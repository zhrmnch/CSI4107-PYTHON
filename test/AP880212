<HEAD>Reports Former Saigon Officials Released from Re-education Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 former officers of the
overthrown South Vietnamese government have been released from a
re-education camp after 13 years of detention, the official Vietnam
News Agency reported Saturday.
   The report from Hanoi, monitored in Bangkok, did not give
specific figures, but said those freed Friday included an
ex-Cabinet minister, a deputy minister, 10 generals, 115
field-grade officers and 25 chaplains.
   It quoted Col. Luu Van Ham, director of the Nam Ha camp south of
Hanoi, as saying all 700 former South Vietnamese officials who had
been held at the camp now have been released.
   They were among 1,014 South Vietnamese who were to be released
from re-education camps under an amnesty announced by the Communist
government to mark Tet, the lunar new year that begins Feb. 17.
   The Vietnam News Agency report said many foreign journalists and
a delegation from the Australia-Vietnam Friendship Association
attended the Nam Ha release ceremony.
   It said Lt. Gen. Nguyen Vinh Nghi, former commander of South
Vietnam's Third Army Corps, and Col. Tran Duc Minh, former director
of the Army Infantry Officers School, expressed ``gratitude to the
government for its humane treatment in spite of the fact that most
of them (detainees) had committed heinous crimes against the
country and people.''
   The prisoners had been held without formal charges or trial
since North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese
government in April 1975, ending the Vietnam War.
   Communist authorities had called the prisoners war criminals and
said they had to learn how to become citizens of the new society.
   Small numbers had been released occasionally without publicity
but the government announced last year that 480 political prisoners
would be freed to mark National Day on Sept. 2.
   On Thursday, Vice Minister of Information Phan Quang said 1,014
would be released under the Tet amnesty.
   He reported a total of 150 prisoners would remain in the camps,
which he said once held 100,000.
   ``Depending on their repentance, they will gradually be released
within a short period of time,'' Quang said.
   He said many of the former inmates would return to their
families in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly the South Vietnamese capital
of Saigon.
   The amnesties apparently are part of efforts by Communist Party
chief Nguyen Van Linh to heal internal divisions and improve
Vietnam's image abroad.

<HEAD>Iowa Caucus Results Shake Up New Hampshire Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ripples from the Iowa precinct caucuses are
spreading to New Hampshire, boosting winners and damaging losers in
the final days before the nation's first primary, polls indicate.
   Vice President George Bush, who was slipping in New Hampshire
even before his third-place Iowa finish, lost more ground in polls
this week. Democratic third-place finisher Michael Dukakis also
lost support, but not as much.
   Iowa, meanwhile, has boosted the candidacies of Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Democratic
and Republican winners, and has aided Pat Robertson, Iowa's
surprise second-place Republican finisher, the polls indicate.
   As recently as two weeks ago, Bush commanded the New Hampshire
GOP field. A CBS News-New York Times poll in the last week of
January had him 22 percentage points over Dole, the same place he'd
held in polls since November and earlier.
   But a crack appeared last week, when an ABC News-Washington Post
poll found Bush's lead sharply diminished, to 7 percentage points.
After Iowa's vote Monday, ABC found the spread down to 4 percentage
points: Bush, 33, Dole, 29.
   In a poll with an error margin of 6 percentage points, that
amounted to a dead heat. Another survey, done for The Boston Globe
this week by pollster Gary Orren, had essentially he same result:
Bush 29, Dole 27. CBS on Thursday had it as Bush 35, Dole 27 _
still a big drop for the vice president.
   ``Dole got a very big kick out of Iowa; more than that, there is
some reluctance in the support for Bush,'' Orren said Thursday.
``He's shown vulnerability, and that's sort of arousing doubts
people have about him.''
   ``The unanswered question is how far Bush will fall,'' Richard
Morin, polling director for The Washington Post. ``The expectation
is that he will continue to drop. That's been the clear direction.''
   If voters were leaving Bush before Iowa, it was not clear where
they were going, Morin said. This week the chief gainers turned out
to be Dole and Robertson, whose support was up to 10 percent in the
ABC and CBS polls, from 6 percent last week and 4 percent two weeks
ago.
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York held steady at 13 percent in the ABC
poll, and fell from 16 percent to 12 percent in the CBS poll.
Analysts said he now may be challenged by Robertson for third place
in New Hampshire.
   ``Kemp was gaining last week. Iowa ended that,'' said Morin.
   Iowa's effect on the Democratic race probably is in the battle
for second place, not first, pollsters said. Massachusetts Gov.
Dukakis, despite finishing third in Iowa, maintained a strong lead
in New Hampshire _ but he no longer had the huge 49 percent support
indicated in an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll in November.
   Three polls indicated a drop in support for Dukakis, to 36
percent in the ABC-Post survey this week from 41 percent last week;
to 35 percent in the Globe's survey, from 38 percent last week; and
to 38 percent in the CBS poll, from 40 percent in late January.
   A fourth new poll, however _ done for WBZ-TV in Boston, WRC-TV
in Washington and the Boston Herald _ said Dukakis' support had
risen from 36 percent at the end of January to 44 percent this week.
   ``It's a big lead for Dukakis no matter whose poll you're
looking at _ and a strong one, too,'' said Jeff Alderman, chief of
polling for ABC News. He said 58 percent of Dukakis' backers told
ABC they supported him strongly.
   The win in Iowa transformed Gephardt, who had single-digit
support in New Hampshire as recently as last month. The CBS poll
had him at 19 percent, up from 7 percent in late January; ABC's
poll put him this week at 22 percent, up from 13 percent last week.
The Globe had him at 18 percent, up from 8, and the WBZ poll had
him at 17, up from 8 last month.
   Poll results were more mixed on Gephardt's chief rival, Sen.
Paul Simon of Illinois, the second-place finisher in Iowa. He moved
to 18 percent from 13 percent in ABC's poll, to 13 from 11 in WBZ's
and fell in the Globe's, to 12 from 17. He held about even in the
CBS poll, at 15 percent this week.
   Movement is taking place at the bottom as well as the top of the
pack. Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, who had 11 percent in the
WBZ and Globe polls last week, fell to single-digit support after
winning just 1 percent in Iowa. Hart and former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt, also a poor finisher in Iowa, went from 7 percent in ABC's
New Hampshire poll last week to 4 percent this week.

<HEAD>Parents Of Slain Man Drop Lawsuit Against Mexican Drug Lord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a student slain when he
apparently stumbled onto a reputed Mexican drug lord's party have
dropped a $2 billion lawsuit against the man, saying a trial would
rekindle painful memories.
   Alberto Radelat, a dental student, and journalist John Walker
were tortured and killed in February 1985 in Guadalajara, Mexico,
and authorities there said they believed the men were executed
because they were mistaken for drug agents.
   On Jan. 29, Dr. Felipe Radelat and his wife, Ana, filed a wrong
death action against reputed drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, whom
authorities have blamed for the deaths.
   The younger Radelat and Walker had apparently entered a
restaurant where Quintero was holding an after-hours party.
   A witness told the Radelats that their son and Walker were
stabbed with icepicks and switchblades before they were dumped in a
crude grave outside Guadalajara, where their bodies were found in
June 1985.
   On Thursday, Radelat said he dropped the suit a week after
filing it because it would revive memories the family had tried to
put behind them.
   ``My wife had settled down, and this brought it all up again,''
he said. ``We don't want any more bad memories. It was a sad
experience. I hope no one ever has to go through it.''
   Quintero was among nine people indicted Jan. 6 by federal
officials in Los Angeles in connection with the deaths of Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot,
who were killed about a week after Radelat and Walker were slain.
   Quintero is in a Mexican jail charged with all four deaths; U.S.
authorities indicted him and the others in Camarena's death in an
effort to bring them to justice if Mexican authorities don't
prosecute them.
   Radelat said he filed the lawsuit because the U.S. government
had not indicted Quintero in the other deaths.
   ``We were disappointed they (U.S. officials) indicted Quintero
just for the drug agent, not the other Americans,'' Radelat said.
``We wanted to do this (suit) not so much for the money but just to
do justice for our son.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Price supports for peanuts grown under 1988
quotas will be $615.27 per ton, an increase of $7.80 from last
year, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said the increase was required
by a formula in the law which takes rising production costs into
consideration.
   The annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated
quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses,
seed and related purposes.
   Production of non-quota peanuts, which can be grown for peanut
oil and meal, and for export, will be supported at $149.75 per ton,
unchanged from last year, Myers said.
   In setting the support for non-quota peanuts, officials are
required to consider certain factors, including the demand for oil
and meal, the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals,
and the foreign demand for peanuts.

   The end was bitter, his helmet dented from the
combat of the campaign, and true to form, retired four-star Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr. reined in his dark horse quest for the
presidency in a pugnacious mood.
   Haig made clear that his new objective was not to seek the keys
to the White House for himself but to deny them to Vice President
George Bush.
   From the very beginning, when he announced, ``I'm throwing my
helmet into the ring,'' the 63-year-old former secretary of state
never rose above the low single digits in public opinion polls.
   He stopped campaigning in the Iowa caucuses in frustration that
his message and his personality had not taken hold.
   ``This is hangover day,'' Haig said, when the Iowa votes were
counted and he ended up with less than 3 percent of the vote in the
GOP field.
   Throughout his campaign, Haig described himself as ``the darkest
of dark horses.''
   His political picture never brightened, perhaps because he
failed to find a way to do what he himself said he had to do to win.
   ``I've learned the secret of life ... It's in marketing,'' Haig
told a Denver audience early in the campaign.
   ``And that's what I'm trying to do today _ marketing.''
   After Iowa, Haig had trouble finding a silver lining.
   ``I'm in it to the bitter end and that bitter end may be the
inability to raise enough money to stay in it,'' he said.
   Haig has been supreme allied commander in Europe, and White
House chief of staff as well as secretary of state and presidential
contender.
   In all of those roles, he demonstrated a vivid _ sometimes
pungent _ grasp of the English language.
   When his hopes for Iowa were still high, Haig told audiences:
``I think it's important that a city slicker like Al Haig, who's
been abroad and lived in our nation's capital perhaps too long,
doesn't come out here and tell agricultural experts how to suck
eggs.''
   Complaining about the Reagan administration's supply-side
economic policies, he said they bore the mark of ``ideological
religiosity.''
   He himself described some of his more obscure references and
word combinations as ``Haigspeak.''
   Haig sensed a measure of public reluctance to put a former
four-star general in the White House and his first television
commercials were designed to counter that.
   One listed the names of the dozen generals who have served as
president, asserting that none of the nation's eight wars began in
their administrations.
   `Ive led troops in battle, seen the horror of war, I know the
imperative of peace,'' the former general said, asserting the need
to elect a president with ``strength, skill and understanding.''
   He said the idea of a nuclear-free world is ``bizarre,''
asserting that Soviet nuclear weapons can only be detered by other
nuclear weapons, not eliminated.
   When the stock market crashed last October, Haig said Washington
had sown the seeds of disaster.
   ``Overnight the famous bull market of the eighties was eaten
alive by the most infamous bear market in our financial history,''
he said, attributing the market's nose dive to ``a pervasive lack
of confidence in our government's ability to deal with budget and
trade deficits.''
   Bush was a preoccupation for much of the Haig campaign.
   Haig tried repeatedly to pin down the vice president on what
advice he gave to Reagan in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``Were you in the cockpit,'' Haig said in typically colorful
language, ``or were you on an economy ride in the back of the
plane?''

   A court ruled Friday that an egg
producer who kept his 2,000 hens in small cages was not guilty of
cruelty to animals, as alleged by animal rights activists.
   ``The verdict is a great relief. It would have been too much to
be found guilty of cruelty to my 2,000 hens,'' Karl Wettre was
quoted as saying by the national NTB news agency after his
acquittal.
   The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
claimed that by keeping hens in small cages, Wettre violated
national legislation to allow animals' natural development and
behavior.
   But the court found that Wettre observed Norwegian regulations
stipulating that a hen should have at least 112 square inches of
cage space in which to live.
   NSPCA chairman Toralf Metveit was quoted as saying: ``I'm
disappointed but not surprised.''
   The society was ordered pay $15,600 in court costs.

   Strategists for Jack Kemp's presidential
campaign say George Bush's poor showing in Iowa, coupled with
Kemp's tough-talking ads against Bob Dole, could put Kemp in the
running for the Republican nomination.
   Before last Monday's Iowa caucuses, Kemp had been on a roll in
New Hampshire, using an effective advertising campaign and the
endorsement of the influential Concord Monitor to help broaden
support.
   But even as his bid to become the conservative alternative to
Dole and Bush took shape, the New York congressman faced the
possibility of being swept out of the race by former television
evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Using his second-place finish in Iowa _ Kemp came in fourth _
Robertson was trying to move Kemp aside and take the mantle of true
conservative. A poll of New Hampshire voters by the Boston Globe
Thursday night indicated Robertson had drawn even with Kemp among
potential Republican voters in next Tuesday's primary.
   Charles Douglas, Kemp's New Hampshire campaign manager, says the
Buffalo congressman wants to finish second or third in a cluster
with Bush and Dole.
   ``We want to be in the 28-30-31 percent range with them,''
Douglas said.
   He conceded that Kemp cannot afford another fourth-place finish,
saying, ``We need to do well here so we can raise money and
continue on to the South. We need to have at least a close third
here.''
   Kemp spent most of the week in New Hampshire making his case at
coffee klatches, before high school students and in speeches to the
party faithful. He is hopeful that his energetic person-to-person
style and strong conservative message will make him the
conservative alternative.
   John Buckley is Kemp's chief campaign strategist.
   ``What you saw tonight,'' Buckley said after Kemp spoke before
800 Republicans in Nashua earlier this week,``was Kemp making an
appeal to the heart and soul of the Reagan vote in New Hampshire.
We consider that to be the largest single vote in the Republican
primary electorate.''
   Buckley said Bush's third-place finish in Iowa presented Kemp
with a New Hampshire opportunity he never thought he would see.
   ``It was a lucky break that the guy who got severely wounded in
Iowa was George Bush, (someone) we never thought we could beat in
the New Hampshire primary.''
   Kemp's strategy had focused on Dole because, as Buckley put it,
Dole is ``extraordinarily vulnerable in New Hampshire because of
his predilection for raising taxes, his four different positions on
oil import fees and his wanting to cut Social Security in a state
that has an elderly, Republican electorate.''
   ``We learned a lesson last month in Iowa,'' Buckley said. ``The
news media was interested in Bush-Dole, Dole-Bush, Bush-Dole,
almost as if they were the only two variables.
   ``The lesson was that by being very specific on issues in a
tough, hard-hitting way, we could pry the door open to get people
to take a look at Kemp.''
   Robertson is now running ads in New Hampshire saying he is the
best alternative to Bush and Dole and noting that he has already
beaten Kemp.
   But Buckley says Robertson can't repeat his showing in Iowa
because of an inherently negative message that won't be effective
in New Hampshire.
   ``For all the voters who may be more comfortable with the gloom
and doom and dour message of Pat Robertson, that we're going to
hell in a handbasket, there are many more who will respond to a
positive conservative message,'' Buckley said.
   ``I'm a conservative,'' Kemp told a living room full of
Republicans in Milford. ``But I'll tell you what, folks, some
things need money spent on them. We've got to shelter the homeless;
we've got to feed and clothe and take care of people who can't take
care of themselves ... and we've got to have a strong defense.''

   A chartered plane crashed into the snowy
flank of a volcano in southern Chile, killing all seven people
aboard, air force rescue officials said Friday.
   The chartered, two-engine Piper Seneca II was reported missing
late Wednesday, after taking off from Temuco, a city 415 miles
south of Santiago.
   Rescue helicopters were unable to find and reach the crash site,
on the Villarica Volcano about 60 miles south of Temuco in the
Andes mountains, until Friday noon.
   ``The crew and passengers died in the accident,'' said a
communique issued by the air force's rescue service.
   Santiago television stations broadcast images of the crash site
which showed the plane's charred remains strewn across an icy slope
6,900 feet above sea level.
   The victims were Francisco Comandari, president of a
Santiago-based bank, Banco del Pacifico; his 13-year-old son and a
12-year-old daughter; the bank's general manager, Eran Fernandez;
his wife and 1{-year-old son; and pilot Juan Bernstein, son of a
well-known Chilean diplomat.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.

<HEAD>90 Soldiers Arrested After Coup Attempt In Tribal Homeland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MMABATHO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 90 soldiers have been
arrested and face possible death sentences stemming from a coup
attempt in Bophuthatswana, leaders of the tribal homeland said
Friday.
   Rebel soldiers staged the takeover bid Wednesday, detaining
homeland President Lucas Mangope and several top Cabinet officials
for 15 hours before South African soldiers and police rushed to the
homeland, rescuing the leaders and restoring them to power.
   At least three soldiers and two civilians died in the uprising.
   Bophuthatswana's Minister of Justice G. Godfrey Mothibe told a
news conference that those arrested have been charged with high
treason and if convicted could be sentenced to death. He said the
accused were to appear in court Monday.
   All those arrested in the coup attempt have been described as
young troops, the most senior being a warrant officer.
   During the coup rebel soldiers installed as head of state Rocky
Malebane-Metsing, leader of the opposition Progressive Peoples
Party.
   Malebane-Metsing escaped capture and his whereabouts remained
unknown, officials said. Several unsubstantiated reports said he
fled to nearby Botswana.
   Warrant Officer M.T.F. Phiri, described by Mangope as one of the
coup leaders, was arrested Friday in Mmabatho, capital of the
nominally independent homeland, officials said.
   Bophuthatswana, which has a population of 1.7 million spread
over seven separate land blocks, is one of 10 tribal homelands in
South Africa. About half of South Africa's 26 million blacks live
in the homelands, none of which are recognized internationally.
   Hennie Riekert, the homeland's defense minister, said South
African troops were to remain in Bophuthatswana but will not become
a ``permanent presence.''
   Bophuthatswana's Foreign Minister Solomon Rathebe defended South
Africa's intervention.
   ``The fact that ... the South African government (was invited)
to assist in this drama is not anything new nor peculiar to
Bophuthatswana,'' Rathebe said. ``But why South Africa, one might
ask? Because she is the only country with whom Bophuthatswana
enjoys diplomatic relations and has formal agreements.''
   Mangope described the mutual defense treaty between the homeland
and South Africa as ``similar to the NATO agreement,'' referring to
the Atlantic military alliance. He did not elaborate.
   Asked about the causes of the coup, Mangope said, ``We granted
people freedom perhaps ... to the extent of planning a thing like
this.''
   The uprising began around 2 a.m. Wednesday when rebel soldiers
took Mangope and his top ministers from their homes to the national
sports stadium.
   On Wednesday evening, South African soldiers and police stormed
the stadium, rescuing Mangope and his Cabinet.
   South African President P.W. Botha and three of his Cabinet
ministers flew to Mmabatho late Wednesday and met with Mangope, the
homeland's only president since it was declared independent in 1977.
   The South African government has said, without producing
evidence, that the outlawed African National Congress may be linked
to the coup.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, dismissed the claims and said
South Africa's actions showed that it maintains tight control over
the homeland governments. The group seeks to topple the Pretoria
government.
   The African National Congress and other anti-government
organizations consider the homelands part of an apartheid system
designed to fragment the black majority and deny them political
rights in South Africa.

<HEAD>Diplomat, Citing ``Corruption,'' Breaks with Noriega</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Panamanian diplomat broke with his
country's military-dominated government Friday, declaring he could
no longer in good conscience serve a regime stained by
``corruption, illigitimacy and dishonesty.''
   Lawrence Chewning Fabrega, minister counselor at Panama's
mission to the Organization of American States here, told a news
conference his decision to resign was triggered by a speech he was
ordered to give at an OAS ceremony on Wednesday.
   Chewning had said in the speech that the Reagan administration
was attempting to overthrow the Panamanian government and was
waging a campaign of ``moral and economic aggresion'' against
Panama.
   ``These remarks were not written by me, nor did they represent
the way I feel or think,'' Chewning said, adding that they were
prepared by Panama's ambassador to the OAS, Roberto Leyton, and the
Panamanian Foreign Ministry.
   Chewning's resignation followed an extraordinary week in which
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega was indicted by two
federal grand juries in Florida on drug-related charges and was
accused by former associates before a congressional panel of
engaging in an array of corrupt activities.
   Speaking through a translator at OAS headquarters, Chewning
said: ``My conscience, my dignity and my deep religious beliefs
prevent me from continuing to be used as an instrument of a
government characterized by corruption, illigitimacy and
dishonesty.''
   Panama's OAS mission had no statement on Chewning's resignation,
and Ambassador Leyton was not available for comment. Gabriel Lewis,
a former Panamanian ambassador who has been lobbying in Washington
against Noriega's rule, said Chewning's resignation proves there
are ``worthy individuals'' in the Panamanian government who refuse
to continue supporting Noriega.
   Chewning said he did not resign on the day of the OAS ceremony
because he felt it was inappropriate, given the nature of the
event. The occasion was the formal incorporation of West Germany
into an international agreement designed to guarantee the
neutrality of the Panama Canal once the waterway comes under
Panamanian control in the year 2000.
   In his speech Wednesday, Chewning had said the United States, in
pursuing a hostile attitude toward the Panamanian government, was
attempting to evade its treaty pledge to relinquish control over
the canal.
   On Friday, he said he believes the United States will faithfully
comply with its commitments.
   Chewning said he was not seeking political asylum in the United
States and was confident he would not be the target of reprisals by
the Panamanian government.
   He will be ineligible to remain in this country because his visa
allowing him to remain here is valid only so long as he maintained
his status as a diplomat. He said he has about a month to decide
what to do in the future.
   Chewning, 46, served in the OAS post for a year and a half. He
previously had worked in Panama's Foreign Ministry, its embassy in
Belgium and its embassy in Washington accredited to the U.S.
government.
   He and his wife are expecting their fourth child.

   Pete du Pont, struggling to keep his
presidential candidacy alive in the final days before the New
Hampshire primary, lashed out Friday at fellow Republicans Bob Dole
and Jack Kemp.
   At a news conference in this snowbound city, du Pont said:
``What Bob Dole says seems to depend on what state he's in.'' He
also called Kemp ``a big spender.''
   With the departure of Alexander Haig from the Republican
presidential race on Friday, du Pont, a former governor of
Delaware, ranks at the bottom of the five-candidate field.
   He conceded that to stay in the race after Tuesday's primary
``you have to do well. You have to start beating somebody.''
   Du Pont had kind words for Haig, a former secretary of state,
calling him ``a credit to this process'' and saying ``he brought a
little spice to the debate.''
   But he had no kind words for anyone else.
   Asked about his prospects, du Pont said, ``All of New
Hampshire's in flux now that the vice president is in a free fall.''
   Vice President George Bush's standing as the clear front-runner
among New Hampshire Republicans has eroded since his embarrassing
third-place finish in the Iowa precinct caucuses on Monday.
   Du Pont called the upcoming days ``the four most volatile of
this campaign.''
   Focusing on Dole, du Pont said, ``I don't think you can go to
Iowa and talk to farmers about how many dollars you've appropriated
and then come to New Hampshire and avoid it.''
   He also said the Kansas senator had told Iowans that he would
not pledge to oppose any tax increases and then came to New
Hampshire and said he would veto a tax increase. New Hampshire
voters have a reputation for solid opposition to tax increases.
   Du Pont also said that Dole had supported an import fee on
foreign oil in Iowa but ``in New Hampshire he says he'll veto it.''
   As for Kemp, a congressman from New York, du Pont said, ``He's a
big spender. In fact he's got a spending record in the Congress
that is even more liberal than Pat Schroeder (a Democratic
congresswoman from Colorado) or Paul Simon (the Illinois senator
who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination).''
   ``So, I don't think on Tuesday the people of New Hampshire are
going to fall for a snow job,'' he said.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad said
Friday he was saddened by the violence in this week's local
elections that left at least 100 people dead, but he added he was
heartened by a heavy voter turnout.
   In a message released by the official Bangladesh news agency,
Ershad said he was sorry at ``the loss of valuable lives and
injuries caused to a number of people in some isolated incidents of
violence.''
   At least 100 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes
among supporters of rival candidates on Wednesday.
   The voting was to elect representatives to more than 4,370
village councils.
   Opposition party leaders Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia have
blamed Ershad for the violence and accused the government of
failure to maintain law and order.
   The women have led a series of strikes and protests since Nov.
10 to try to oust Ershad.
   Hasina, daughter of assassinated president Sheik Mujibur Rahman,
and Mrs. Zia, wife of another slain president, have called for
general strikes Saturday and Sunday to protest the violence and
renew the call for Ershad's resignation.
   Ershad on Friday appealed for ``tolerance and patience'' to make
the process of democracy a success.
   ``The enthusiasm and spontaneous participation of the people in
the polls was the manifestation of peoples' firm confidence in the
constitutional process and democratic norms,'' Ershad's statement
said.
   According to government reports, voter turnout was as high as 80
percent in areas where there was no violence.
   Poling was postponed in at least 2,500 of 21,000 voting centers
because of election-day clashes. A new date for polling had not yet
been set.
   The list of successful candidates is expected to be ready in
about a week, government officials say.
   Ershad, 58, assumed power in a bloodless coup in 1982. He won
election to the presidency in 1986 in balloting the opposition
contends was rigged.
   In an effort to appease the opposition, he dissolved Parliament
and called for new elections Feb. 3. The opposition called for a
boycott, contending the balloting would not be free and fair.

<HEAD>Son Challenges Justice Department To Admit It Wrongly Extradited
Father</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a man who lived nearly 40 years in
the United States and then died in a Yugoslav prison after being
convicted of Nazi war crimes challenged U.S. officials Friday to
admit they wrongly extradited his father to a communist court.
   Rad Artukovic, in a 135-page report submitted to the Justice
Department, said the department used fraudulent evidence to send
his father, Andrija Artukovic, to face a ``sham trial'' in
Yugoslavia two years ago.
   The elder Artukovic died last month at age 88 while awaiting
execution in a Yugoslav prison.
   ``The only way the U. S. government could get him was through
fraud,'' Artukovic told a news conference before leaving for Los
Angeles to join a federal courthouse vigil in honor of his late
father.
   He said his father has become a hero to people from his native
Croatia, now a part of Yugoslavia.
   Andrija Artukovic, who was a cabinet minister in the Nazi puppet
state of Croatia, was called ``Butcher of the Balkans'' by the
Yugoslav government and accused of ordering the deaths of thousands
of people. During his trial, he was described as as overseer of a
grisly network of concentration camps.
   Rad Artukovic, 39, said his father was minister of the interior,
had no military responsibilities and ordered no deaths.
   He said his father was not mentally competent to stand trial.
U.S. officials had declared him senile and legally blind when he
was extradited.
   Tom Stewart, spokesman for the Justice Department's criminal
division, said a copy of Artukovic's report had been received by
the Office of Special Investigations and was being reviewed by
investigators who handle allegations of war crimes.
   ``He's done a marvelous job of defending his father's
reputation, but the matter was dealt with in the courts,'' Stewart
said.
   Artukovic said in the report that both his father's extradition
and the trial in Zagreb relied mainly on false testimony from Bajro
Avdic, a man who claimed to have been a military escort for his
father.
   The report said Avdic was not an escort and was not in the
places he claimed to be when atrocities allegedly occurred. It also
claims he made up the killings attributed to Artukovic.
   ``I ask the Justice Department to go into court and revoke the
order they obtained through fraud,'' Artukovic said, accusing U.S.
officials of collusion with the communist government in Yugoslavia.
   Artukovic said he hopes for a renunciation of the extradition to
invalidate the Yugoslav trial.
   Artukovic said he and two of his four sisters visited their
father during his imprisonment in Yugoslavia but his mother, Ana,
never saw her husband after he was extradited. The family lives in
Seal Beach, Calif. His father for many years had been a bookkeeper
for a Los Angeles construction company.
   The younger Artukovic, a stock trader, said he worked for two
years to research the report on what he said was false evidence
against his father and is sending copies to members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   He said the Justice Department went along with whatever was
given it by the Yugoslavian government but could not collect enough
evidence to deport his father.
   Artukovic said Yugoslavia accused his father of war crimes to
neutralize him as a Croatian political leader. He said most other
members of the Croatian wartime cabinet were executed as war
criminals but Allied officials found no evidence against him and he
was allowed to live freely in Ireland and later the United States.

   Slippery, ice-covered roads and
snarled traffic helped four people escape from a man who abducted
them at gunpoint and took their cars, police said Friday.
   Larry F. Johnson, 43, of Logansport, Ind., was arraigned on four
counts of kidnapping in Warren District Court after his arrest in
the cases early Friday. He was being held without bond in the
Warren County Jail, police said.
   He also was wanted in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Indiana and Kentucky on various charges, including assaulting a
police officer in Georgia, kidnapping, theft and drug-related
charges, said Trooper Jackie Strode.
   Johnson was traveling on foot and was not armed when he was
arrested, Strode said.
   Strode said Erwin Quirand, of Knoxville, Tenn., and a
17-year-old girl from Sumter, S.C., jumped from a northbound car
Thursday on Interstate 65 while traffic was slowed past the site of
a multi-vehicle car-truck pileup in which one person was killed.
They ran to police and said they had been kidnapped.
   Quirand said he had been kidnapped him and his car taken
Wednesday at a Knoxville, Tenn., grocery store. He told WBKO-TV in
Bowling Green that his abductor said he was ``running for his
life.'' The juvenile said she and her car were taken Tuesday.
   The man sped away but crashed the car four miles north of the
accident scene, Strode said.
   The man then stopped a pickup truck driven by Daniel Eidson Jr.,
18, of Bowling Green, and asked Eidson and his passenger, Greg
Bell, 21, of Richardsville, for a ride to get a wrecker.
   But when they pulled into a service station, Eidson said, the
man pulled out a gun and said: ``I'm in a little trouble with the
law. Keep going.''
   The man then took the wheel but slid off an icy road into a
ditch, Eidson said.
   The three walked to a house and the man tried to persuade
someone there to give him a ride to Nashville, but was turned down,
Eidson said.
   He said the three then went to the home of Susan and Gary Comer,
where the man asked to borrow their tractor to pull the truck out
of the ditch.
   Mrs. Comer refused, Eidson said, and the gunman then demanded
her car and ripped a telephone cord out of the wall.
   ``I told them the keys were in the car,'' Mrs. Comer said.
   Her car slid off another road, and Bell and Eidson escaped while
pushing it out of a ditch, Eidson said.
   The gunman later wrecked that car and police lost his trail
until running across him early Friday about six miles south of
Bowling Green, Strode said.
   He had been described by Indiana authorities as suicidal and
wanting vengeance against police officers, Strode said.
   Eidson said he was afraid during the incident.
   ``I didn't really know'' what the man would do, he said. ``But
he had a gun, you know, and he kept pulling it out.''

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Abu Nidal, Two Followers, Convicted in Airport
Massacre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Friday convicted fugitive guerrilla
leader Abu Nidal and two of his Palestinian followers in the 1985
grenade and rifle attack that killed 16 people in a crowd of
holiday travelers at Rome's airport.
   Abu Nidal and another fugitive, Rashid el-Hamieda, were
sentenced to life in prison. The only defendant in custody, Mahmoud
Ibrahim Khaled, was given a 30-year term.
   More than 80 people were injured in the Dec. 27, 1985 assault on
the check-in counters of TWA and the Israeli carrier El Al at
Leonardo da Vinci airport.
   Four Americans were killed, including an 11-year-old girl on a
trip with her family to New York.
   El-Hamieda, described as a top lieutenant in Abu Nidal's Fatah
Revolutionary Council, was accused along with Abu Nidal of
organizing the attack. Neither he nor Abu Nidal took part in it.
   The assault occurred at the same hour as a similar strike at
Vienna's airport, also blamed on Abu Nidal's followers.
   Four people, including two terrorists and an American, died in
the Vienna attack, and 47 people were injured. Two surviving
Palestinian terrorists were convicted of murder by a Vienna jury
and sentenced to life in prison.
   The Rome jury of two judges and six civilians apparently heeded
a plea for leniency for Khaled, the only survivor of the four-man
commando team. He could be released on parole in a little less than
15 years.
   Earlier in the day, his court-appointed lawyer said he could not
possibly ask for acquittal for the 20-year-old Khaled, who admitted
his guilt.
   Instead, the lawyer, Epifanio Ales, reread for the jury Khaled's
own statements about his childhood in a refugee camp in Lebanon,
his parents' death in an Israeli bombing and his taking up of arms
when he was 10 years old.
   Khaled was ``a patriot who wanted a Palestine free of the
Israelis,'' Ales said in his plea for mercy.
   The lawyer asked the jury to remember that Italian courts, for
years, were merciful to men who had killed adulterous wives and
their lovers under a now vanishing ``crime of honor'' standard.
   Ales said defending the confessed terrorist was ``an anguished
task'' and that it was particularly painful to listen to the
testimony of an American journalist about how his daughter,
11-year-old Natasha Simpson, died in the gunfire.
   Victor L. Simpson, news editor for The Associated Press in Rome,
described in court how he threw himself and the girl to the
terminal floor in a futile attempt to shield her from the bullets.
   According to the trial indictment, four Israeli security guards
fired back, killing three of the four members of the attack squad
and wounding Khaled.
   The steel-barred holding cage for Khaled was empty on Friday. He
chose to stay in his prison cell, exercising his right under
Italian law not to attend his trial. He only attended court Dec.
15, the trial's opening session.
   The trial was based largely on hours of pre-trial statements by
Khaled, who told investigators that the terrorists were trained in
Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley and took their orders from
headquarters in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   Investigators believed el-Hamieda provided the terrorists with
their weapons and gave them final instructions during several
meetings in Rome, then checked out of a hotel and fled Italy at
virtually the same hour the raid was launched.
   Prosecutor Francesco Deleo had requested conviction and life
sentences for the three defendants, saying Khaled's statements made
clear the airport strikes were linked to several terrorist attacks
in Europe this decade.
   Italy does not have capital punishment.
   Abu Nidal's group has been blamed for more than 100 attacks
across Europe, Asia and the Middle East since 1972.
   He split from Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization
in 1973.
   An international arrest warrant has been issued for Abu Nidal,
whose real name is Sabri al-Banna.
   Abu Nidal is a nom de guerre which means ``father of the
struggle.''
   He originally based his group in Syria but was expelled and is
believed to operate out of Lebanon, with his followers trained in
Libya.
   Lawyers for both fugitive defendants asked the jury for
acquittal for lack of evidence. They said they would appeal the
verdict.
   Khaled's lawyer said he had not yet decided about an appeal.
   All three defendants were charged with massacre and with illegal
possession of arms.

<TEXT>
   About 15,000 reservists, civilian
militia, police and regular army troops will take part soon in
civil defense and military maneuvers, the Sandinista newspaper
Barricada announced Friday.
   Barricada said the civilians and military personnel will
participate in the exercises in Managua and its surrounding region.
It did not specify on what day they would begin.
   The maneuvers come at a time of high tension in the city of
Masaya, about 20 miles southeast of Managua, where demonstrators
opposing the government's obligatory military draft clashed with
Sandinista supporters and police on Monday and Tuesday.
   Club-wielding Sandinista demonstrators first sought to quash the
protests in the streets. Police later intervened to break up the
demonstrations, and Interior Minister Tomas Borge arrived to
monitor the situation.
   The exercises ``are of a routine nature and are called for under
the annual plans to prepare the people in defense,'' Barricada
said. It added that participating Sandinista police would patrol
``centers of greater criminal incidences.''
   The Regional Committee of the Sandinista National Liberation
Front, the government party, told Barricada the maneuvers would
involve peasant militia, factory and neighborhood reservists and
mass organizations.
   Neighborhood Sandinista Defense Committees and Sandinista Youth
organization members also will take part.
   Sandinista army troops staged maneuvers at the same time last
year, but few civilians participated.
   Borge referred indirectly to the Masaya demonstrations Thursday,
saying he had instructed Sandinista police to act ``with profound
respect for the physical integrity of those who provoke them, but
at the same time with energy and without vacillation in order to
impede vandalism and disorder in the country.''

<TEXT>
   Empty Bullfrog County, created from
scrubland in a bid to assure the state of federal dollars should
the government build a nuclear dump in Nevada, violates the state
constitution, a judge has ruled.
   Judge David Zenoff said Thursday the county stretched its legal
limits ``every which way,'' and left too many constitutional issues
``hanging in the air.''
   Nye County, from which unpopulated Bullfrog County was carved,
had challenged the 1987 Legislature's creation of the state's 18th
county.
   Zenoff, a former state Supreme Court justice brought in to hear
the case, issued the ruling after less than 30 minutes of oral
arguments in district court.
   Zenoff said the governor's authority to appoint three
commissioners for the county ran ``contrary to the democratic
process,'' and contributed to its failure to provide representative
government.
   ``I cannot in good conscience uphold this law,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, we're very pleased,'' said Nye County District
Attorney Phil Dunleavy. ``It confirms what we've been saying all
along. As far as I'm concerned, Bullfrog County is dead and it
should be.''
   Attorney Frank Daykin, representing the Legislature and Bullfrog
County, said it would be up to the Legislative Commission to decide
whether to appeal Zenoff's ruling to the state Supreme Court.
   The commission's next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.
   ``We usually don't accept defeat in the Legislature,'' said
commission Chairman Lawrence Jacobsen.
   Legislators created the county out of a 144-square-mile chunk of
Nye County as a way of giving the state control over federal funds
available for the proposed. Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada is
one of three sites under consideration.
   Had Bullfrog County been selected, the U.S. government would
have had to compensate the state-run county an estimated $8 million
to $25 million a year, officials said.
   ``Personally, I hope the Legislature doesn't appeal it because
it's brought enough embarrassment to Nevada and should be allowed
to lay in peace,'' Dunleavy said. ``The Legislature needs to
rethink its approach to the problem.''
   Nye County stands to lose revenue should the new county remain
on the books.
   Gov. Richard Bryan, who signed the law creating the county into
effect, issued only a brief statement upon learning of Zenoff's
decision.
   ``This apparently resolves the Bullfrog County issue unless the
Legislature chooses to appeal,'' he said.
   Karen Zupon, the governor's press secretary, said Bryan ``has
always said he'll abide by the court's decision. He's not a party
to the suit and he hasn't said anything about whether he thinks it
should be appealed.''
   Nye County challenged the county's creation on 37 different
legal grounds in a 92-page brief. Its major complaint was Bullfrog
County's failure to provide representative government.
   Zenoff agreed, saying it was not ``answerable to the people.''
Among other things, he said the law made no provisions for a
judicial district or legislative representation for the county.

<HEAD>Shultz Sets Middle East Peace Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will go to
the Middle East in two weeks to try to promote two-stage
negotiations between Israel and Jordan on Palestinian self-rule.
   A brief State Department announcement Friday said Shultz would
make the trip at the end of the month ``for the purpose of
advancing the Middle East peace process.''
   Other U.S. officials said he would set out for the Middle East
about 24 hours after returning from Feb. 21-23 talks in Mosocw and
visit Egypt, Jordan, Israel and possibly Saudi Arabia.
   Shultz plans to remain in the area until he joins President
Reagan for a summit meeting with the leaders of the 15 North
Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in Brussels beginning March
2.
   The Soviets have been notified in advance that Shultz intends to
sound out Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze about an
international peace conference that would be a backdrop for
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Their Moscow talks will center mostly on prospects for a treaty
to sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles and
for a withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan after an
occupation of more than eight years.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Shultz have registered
their reluctance to having the Soviets play a prominent role in a
Middle East settlement. But Jordan's King Hussein wants the
participation of all the big powers, including Moscow.
   According to U.S. and other sources who declined to be
identified, Shultz will advance a two-step plan that would open
negotiations in April between Israel and a mixed
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and then resume in December to
work on an overall Middle East settlement.
   All options, including statehood for the Palestinians, would be
open at that point.
   Shultz reaffirmed Monday night in a meeting with American
foreign policy experts that the U.S. approach to a final settlement
is based on Israel trading territory for peace.
   That could cause severe political problems for Shamir because
many of his supporters are against relinquishing land the Arabs
lost to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   At the same time, the United States has not endorsed Palestinian
statehood. President Reagan's formula, outlined in a 1982 speech
and still U.S. policy, proposed linking the West Bank and Gaza to
Jordan.
   Reagan said flatly that the United States ``will not support the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state'' in the
territories and would also ``not support annexation or permanent
control by Israel.''
   Shultz's trip is designed to show a commitment to aiding the 1.5
million Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza and
to ending violence in the Israeli-held territories.
   Sources said Shultz's overriding goal was to promote
negotiations between Israel and the Arabs, possibly in the
framework of a Mideast peace conference.
   They stressed that the framework was incidental to holding
direct talks on the Palestinian issue and that all approaches to
getting the two sides to the table would be considered.
   The peace conference idea has drawn objections from Shamir, but
it has the support of Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and
possibly King Hussein.
   On his last visit to the region in October, Shultz said he
understood why Shamir would be reluctant to hold negotations in a
way that gave the Soviet Union a chance to play an influential role.
   The Soviets generally side with the Arabs in their dispute with
Israel and do not have diplomatic relations with Jerusalem.
   About 96 percent of the residents of the West Bank and Gaza are
Palestinian Arabs. Jewish settlers who were banned from the West
Bank during Jordan's control from 1948 to 1967 have established
villages, religious schools and synagogues there.
   Hussein has accused the Reagan administration of being
hopelessly one-sided toward Israel. But a recent U.S. diplomatic
emissary, Philip C. Habib, was reported to have detected a
``positive'' attitude in talks with the king in Amman.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy returned from the
Middle East on Thursday and reported to Shultz on his meetings with
leaders of Syria, Saudia Arabia, Egypt and Israel, as well as with
British and French officials.

   The Roman Catholic relief agency Caritas Italiana
said Friday it has raised more than $10 million to help the victims
of the African drought.
   The charity said $5.5 million of the $10.3 million total had
been sent to support the people in Ethiopia's Eritrea and Tigre
provinces until fall.
   The organization said in a statement that it raised the money
during its ``Drought in Africa'' campaign, and that it was donated
by private citizens, workers groups, churches and by religious and
public charities.
   Besides the money already sent, the relief agency has allocated
another $1.98 million for directing the second phase of its program
in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Tigre.
   It also said it is preparing to send $3.4 million for relief
efforts in Mali, Mozambique, southern Sudan, Angola and Burundi.

   The government should ease back on acreage
controls for the 1989 wheat crop, the National Association of Wheat
Growers said Friday.
   Frank Johannsen, association president, said greater acreage
should be permitted so the United States can keep filling a growing
export demand. For the last two years, wheat farmers have been
required to idle 27.5 percent of their base acreage in order to
qualify for federal supports.
   The Agriculture Department is to announce the 1989 wheat program
by June 1. Johannsen, a wheat farmer from Bayard, Neb., said the
association wants the acreage reduction be held to no more than 20
percent.
   Johannsen said U.S. wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by 30
percent this season, the largest annual decline in more than 20
years.
   A 1989 acreage reduction of less than 20 percent could be
justified if USDA maintains its current export subsidy programs, he
said.
   ``Since we don't know what will happen after the November
elections, our market outlook is somewhat cloudy, thus making it
more difficult to forecast export sales opportunities,'' Johannsen
said in a statement.

   A member of Israel's Parliament arrived in
Athens on Friday to join Palestinian deportees in a planned voyage
back to Israel, but two organizers said they still had not obtained
a ship.
   The president of Greece's main seamen's union, meanwhile, said
Israeli agents had used threats and pressure to block the
PLO-sponsored trip that would carry 130 Palestians deported by
Israel to the Israeli port of Haifa.
   Union leader Antonis Dalakogiorgis also revealed that the
Israeli Sea Officers Union had warned they would boycott Greek
vessels if Greek seamen continued backing the PLO effort.
   The ``journey of return'' is designed to focus attention on
Israel's use of deportations to punish Palestinians in the
territories it captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Parliament member Mohammed Miari appeared at a news conference
at an Athens hotel alongside Bassam Abu Sharif, the chief spokesman
for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Miari, a member of the left-wing Progressive List for Peace,
said he was told that ``the Israeli government will put on trial
all those who participate in the trip,'' and said there were moves
in Parliament to strip him of his parliamentary immunity.
   Two other parliament members, Tawfiq Zaiad and Charlie Biton,
were among 11 Israelis who arrived Thursday in Cyprus to join the
voyage when it stops there. About 20 Israelis plan to make the trip.
   The trip is modeled after the voyage of the Exodus, which tried
to take Jewish refugees to Palestine in 1947 but was turned back by
British authorities. Miriam Algazi, one of the Israelis who arrived
in Cyprus on Thursday, also took part in the Exodus voyage.
   At the news conference, Miari backed ``the right of the deported
Palestinians people to return to their homeland.''
   He said he hoped the trip would ``open a new window for just
peace in the Middle East.''
   But there was increasing doubt that any ship would be able to
sail soon, although the PLO has gathered hundreds of deportees,
observers and journalists in Athens and Cyprus to take part.
   Two members of the nine-member voyage steering committee in
Athens told The Associated Press that the PLO did not have a firm
contract to charter a vessel because several companies had backed
out of tentative commitments.
   ``We don't have a boat yet,'' said Abdul-Jawad Saleh, the
deported mayor of the West Bank town of Bireh.
   ``There is not a concrete ship as of this moment,'' said another
member of the steering committee who insisted on anonymity.
   The voyage was initially scheduled to start on Tuesday, but the
PLO diplomatic representative in Athens, Fouad Al-Bittar, said
Thursday the voyage had been delayed because ``many'' shipowners
had backed away from contracts.
   However, he then promised that the voyage would begin by early
Saturday morning from Greece's main Piraeus harbor, saying a boat
had been found.
   ``We are still insisting that the boat will sail,'' Abu Sharif
said Friday. He reaffirmed the time schedule given by Bittar, but
added an element of uncertainty.
   ``I'm sure we will find _ and have found, according to Mr.
Bittar _ a brave captain'' for the voyage, he said.
   Piraeus harbor authority officials said at noon Friday the PLO
had not submitted documents legally required 24 hours before a ship
can be brought in or out.
   Dalakogiorgis, president of the Panhellenic Union of Merchant
Seamen, said that ``Israeli agents'' had threatened Greek shipping
companies and individual seamen about the voyage.
   ``Seamen working on ships that the PLO might have chartered
received telephone threats from the Israelis and shipping companies
were also under intense pressure from them,'' Dalakogiorgis said.
   ``I personally received threatening phone calls, threatening my
life, not to proceed with this,'' Dalakogiorgis said.
   Dalakogiorgis distributed copies of a telex from the Israeli Sea
Officers Union saying ``we would have no choice but to boycott
Greek vessels in Israeli ports'' if the voyage goes as planned.
   No one from the Israeli union, headquartered in Haifa, could be
found for comment Friday.
   Shipping sources in Piraeus, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the captain of the first ship chartered to make the voyage had
also been threatened.
   They said that Zannes Kouloumbis of the Maltese-flagged Silver
Paloma was warned of an Israeli attack during the voyage and told
his life was in danger.
   The ship's owners, who operate a regular ferry service to
Israel, dropped out.

<HEAD>US Navy Warships Bumped By Soviet Vessels Off Black Sea Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. Navy warships, under orders to assert
international navigation rights, were deliberately bumped by two
Soviet warships on Friday after moving within 12 miles of Russia's
Black Sea coastline, the Pentagon said.
   No one was injured and damage to the two ships was described as
light.
   But the administration immediately lodged a strong protest with
the Soviet ambassador here, saying the vessels had done nothing
provocative and were operating in accord with international law.
   ``As Secretary of State (George P.) Shultz said just a week ago,
we are prepared to deal with the best and worst of Soviet
behavior,'' said Rudolph Boone, a State Department spokesman.
   ``We intend to continue exercising our rights under
international law. The Soviets are obligated to comply with their
international commitments.''
   Navy officials said during a Pentagon briefing there was no
question that the cruiser USS Yorktown and destroyer USS Caron had
been struck deliberately by a Soviet frigate and a smaller coastal
patrol boat, respectively.
   The Soviet warships broadcast a warning beforehand, saying they
were authorized ``to strike your ship with one of ours,'' said
Capt. Gerry Flynn, a top aide to the chief of naval operations.
   The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the
American vessels, ``which were, as we would say in the Navy,
shouldered out of the way,'' Flynn added.
   The Yorktown and Caron maintained their course and speed despite
the bumping, eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast,
Flynn said.
   ``The latest report I have now is that both ships are operating
routinely in the Black Sea as planned,'' he said.
   Flynn and other Pentagon officials said they could not recall a
similar incident of deliberate bumping during operations in the
Black Sea. The Soviets strongly protested a similar deployment by
the same two ships in March 1986, but did nothing at the time to
physically interfere with their passage.
   The Soviet Union claimed Friday the U.S. Navy ships violated its
border, ignored warnings ``and dangerously maneuvered in Soviet
territorial waters.''
   ``It was a routine passage and we were doing nothing provocative
at all ...,'' Flynn countered. ``We view (this) with considerable
concern.''
   According to Cmdr. Richard Schiff, a Navy lawyer who appeared
with Flynn, the Yorktown and Caron were operating off the Crimean
peninsula in what the Navy calls its ``assertion of rights''
program _ an effort to periodically steam through contested waters
to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas.
   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territorial
limit, the Soviet Union claims a 12-mile limit along its coast,
Schiff explained. The United States will accept such a claim, but
any country claiming 12 miles ``must allow for innocent passage by
the ships of all nations,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union tries to insist that foreign ships stick to
specified sea lanes when making an innocent passage, something it
has no right to do, the lawyer said.
   ``So what our ships were doing there was exercising that right
of innocent passage,'' Schiff said. He noted that Soviet
intelligence-gathering ships routinely operate within five miles of
the U.S. coastline.
   According to the Pentagon, Friday's incident began with the
Yorktown and Caron steaming eastward, parallel to each other and
about three miles apart, past the Crimean peninsula. The Caron was
about seven miles off the shoreline and the Yorktown about 10.
   The two ships had been shadowed by three Soviet vessels and
Soviet reconnaissance aircraft ever since entering the Black Sea
through the Turkish Straits on Wednesday.
   At about 11 a.m. local time Friday _ or 3 a.m. EST _ Flynn said
the Soviets broadcast the following warning to the U.S. ships:
``Soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorial
waters. I am authorized to strike your ship with one of ours.''
   The Caron responded: ``I am engaged in innocent passage,
consistent with international law.''
   When neither the Caron or Yorktown changed course, a
Krivak-class frigate moved up on the Yorktown and a Mirka-class
patrol vessel moved on the Caron, ``grazing'' the left sides of the
each, Flynn said.
   American naval forays into the Black Sea _ each of which must be
approved by the president _ are normally ordered at least once a
year for two reasons, said Pentagon officials who asked not to be
named.
   The Navy ships are expected to monitor Soviet military
operations, frequently employing electronic listening gear, and to
assert the right of U.S. warships to navigate through those waters.
   The Soviet Union considers the Black Sea as its own ``lake'' _
even though it is only one of several nations bordering the sea's
waters _ and maintains a large naval fleet there.
   According to Boone, Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost
called in Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin Friday morning to ``lodge
a strong protest.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who is scheduled to meet
with his Soviet counterpart next month, also intends to protest the
Russian action, Boone said.

   The Kremlin accused the U.S. State Department on
Friday of spreading ``malicious slanders'' about human rights in
the Soviet Union and said the United States has violations of its
own.
   The official news agency Tass carried an interview with Alexei
Glukhov of the Foreign Ministry in which he discussed the State
Department's annual report on human rights around the world.
   The report, released Wednesday in Washington, said the Soviet
government gave its people greater freedom and showed more
tolerance toward dissenters in 1987. But it said an all-powerful
secret police force remained unchecked.
   Tass said the report ``again contains malicious slanders against
the socialist countries, including the U.S.S.R.''
   Glukhov, first deputy head of the Foreign Ministry's Directorate
for Humanitarian and Cultural Issues, accused the State Department
of making the allegations to speed up ratification of the
intermediate-range nuclear weapons treaty, which is making its way
through the Senate.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the treaty in December.
   The Soviet Union, Glukhov noted, conducted a prison amnesty and
introduced new rules on emigration and immigration last year. The
State Department ignored these steps and relied on faulty
information for its report, he charged.
   ``Much of the specific information contained in that report is
clearly drawn from unclean sources,'' he said, citing what he said
was an exaggerated figure of 400 political prisoners in the U.S.S.R.
   ``Obviously, the U.S. State Department again lacks simple
objectivity and simple truthfulness in the evaluations,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union would like to know why the United States has
political prisoners, sentences minors to death and prosecutes
clergymen for anti-war activities, Glukhov said.
   ``The U.S. side is far from the measure of openness and
self-criticism demonstrated by the Soviet Union on that issue,'' he
said, referring to human rights.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze are to discuss human rights at a meeting in
Moscow on Feb. 21-23.

<TEXT>
   Nuclear test-ban negotiations, resuming next
week in Geneva, are making progress toward means of verifying two
unratified test ban treaties, the White House said Friday.
   In a statement, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the talks, which
begin again Monday, ``represent a practical approach _ as the
president has long advocated _ to nuclear testing limitations which
are in our national security interest.''
   Fitzwater said the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in
undertaking the talks that the first step should be to negotiate
effective verification measures for the Threshold Test Ban Treaty
and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty.
   The two pacts, limiting the magnitude of certain nuclear tests,
were negotiated in the 1970s, but ratification has been withheld
because of concerns about how Soviet compliance could be verified.
   ``Once our verification concerns have been satisfied and the
treaties ratified, we will propose that the United States and the
Soviet Union immediately enter into negotiations on ways to
implement a step-by-step program _ in association with a program to
reduce and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons _ of limiting and
ultimately ending nuclear testing,'' the spokesman said.
   ``We are making progress toward our goal of effective
verification,'' he added.
   ``With a better understanding of the practical problems
associated with conducting these experiments, we now have the
information needed to design the experiments,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The two sides have agreed to begin this work immediately upon
resumption of negotiations on Monday. We hope that the sides will
continue to make expeditious progress in these talks.''
   The statement was released as President Reagan arrived in
California for a five-day stay.

   The DC-9 hit the geese Wednesday after reaching an altitude of
200 feet, said Ivan Hunt, manager of the KCI control tower. The
plane suffered damage to its nose cone and windshield, he said.
   ``Our guess is they were geese,'' Hunt said. ``And when it's
just two birds like that, they don't show up on radar.''
   Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident and the geese
were in the clouds, Hunt said.
   Northwest officials would not comment.
   Hunt said no one was hurt, adding that the plane was probably
never in any danger.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas prison escapee who robbed a credit union
and then killed a policeman during a chase was shot 13 times by
officers after his escape was blocked by a television station's
helicopter, authorities say.
   Police also said the man, Phillip Hutchinson, 24, of Arlington,
Va., had listed his goals for February, and at the top of the list
was penciled: ``Get Money.''
   Hutchinson robbed the credit union Tuesday and during the
ensuing police chase he ran over and killed Detective Robert
Wallis, 51.
   After running into a tree, he took John Laurienti hostage and
forced him to drive him in his pickup truck. A KCNC-TV helicopter
piloted by Mike Silva followed Hutchinson and blocked his escape in
a parking lot, and officers shot him to death in the truck cab.
Laurienti escaped injury except for a cut from flying glass.
   The chase and the final confrontation were videotaped by a
cameraman riding with Silva.
   Adams County sheriff's Sgt. Fred Stoll said that because of the
many entrance and exit wounds on Hutchinson's body, investigators
had difficulty telling how many times he had been shot.
   ``But my guess is 13 times,'' he said Thursday.
   According to authorities, Hutchinson was a Marine deserter with
a long criminal record, including escape, robbery, forgery and the
ransom kidnapping of a 13-year-old boy, who escaped unharmed.
   He escaped from Texas' Ferguson prison unit in September 1984
and was recaptured four months later. In July, while serving a life
sentence for aggravated robbery and other charges, Hutchinson
hot-wired a truck and drove it through a prison fence. He had
eluded authorities since then.
   Stoll said police found the list of goals among piles of papers
in Hutchinson's mountain home near Bailey.
   He was known to write detailed strategies and contingency plans
in advance of his crimes, but investigators have not found plans
for Tuesday's credit union office robbery, which netted $3,000.
   Meanwhile, Laurienti, 73, was given a new truck Friday to
replace the one damaged in the gun battle.
   The truck was purchased for him by a dealership and KCNC-TV.
   Laurienti had refused to obey Hutchinson's order to ram the
station's helicopter after Silva landed in front of them.
   Laurienti embraced Silva when they met for the first time
Friday, and they discussed Tuesday's ordeal.
   ``God bless this guy,'' Laurienti said. ``He (Hutchinson) could
have blew my brains out, but I wasn't going to ram this guy.''

   Sen. Bob Dole's presidential campaign is
wasting no time in trying to lure national convention delegates
away from Vice President George Bush, even though only a handful
have been chosen so far.
   Dole's Pennsylvania campaign has gone to work on at least some
of the 18 delegates who were chosen there last week by the
Republican State Committee, and so far one delegate has been
enticed to defect while another is complaining of being harassed.
   ``They're after me,'' Grace Jesberger said Friday in a telephone
interview from from Ridgway, Pa. ``I'm just getting a little miffed
that people are trying to pressure me.''
   The effort has intensified since Bush's third-place finish in
the Iowa caucuses, but Francis Shane, who leads Dole's Pennsylvania
campaign, said nobody's trying to twist arms.
   Since Iowa, ``we're getting calls from people rethinking their
positions,'' he said.
   Dole spokeswoman Katie Boyle said Jesberger had been persuaded
to switch support to the Senate minority leader, but Jesberger
herself said that's not true.
   Jesberger said she has often indicated that she ``has no
problems with Dole.'' But she said she was sticking with Bush, at
least for now, because he is the best qualified candidate.
   However, Dole's campaign did succeed in winning over Ronald
Reese, an insurance adjuster from Philadelphia who was a member of
Bush's state steering committee.
   Reese did not return calls to his office or home Friday, but he
told The Pittsburgh Press that he left the Bush campaign in part
because it was not paying enough attention to black Republicans.
   His defection brought the national delegate count to 46 for Bush
and 35 for Dole. Rep. Jack Kemp has 32 delegates, former television
evangelist Pat Robertson 8 and another 8 remain uncommitted. There
are still 2,148 Republican delegates to be chosen.

<HEAD>Ferraro Says Women's Equality Depends On More Female Officeholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geraldine Ferraro, whose vice presidential
nomination marked a peak for the women's equality movement, said
Friday that women must translate their increasing power at the
ballot box to campaigns for elective office.
   ``If you don't run, you can't win,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ``And
just as important, every time a woman runs, women win.''
   Ms. Ferraro addressed some 1,500 women attending a symposium on
women and the Constitution convened by former first ladies Rosalynn
Carter and Lady Bird Johnson.
   She said there are more female officeholders than ever, but the
numbers are not representative of the population.
   ``Women are, by any measure, grossly underrepresented in
elective office,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ``I would say shockingly
underrepresented; however, nobody is shocked. That's simply how it
is.''
   Coretta Scott King, wife of slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., echoed Ms. Ferraro in urging women, particularly
black women, to seek office.
   ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for nurturing and
compassion which has been finely honed and tempered in our struggle
to raise families in a sexist society,'' Mrs. King said on the
closing day of the two-day symposium.
   ``Let me put it this way _ if the women of America don't lead
the struggle against poverty, racism and militarism, then we must
ask, who will?'' she said.
   According to the National Women's Political Caucus, in 1987
women held 14 percent of the higher statewide elective offices in
the country. At the same time, there are only 23 women serving in
the House _ and only one black woman _ two female governors and two
women in the Senate.
   Ms. Ferraro, a former congresswoman from New York, said many of
those officeholders are not yet in positions of national power or
leadership, which she said would likely delay nomination of a woman
as a presidential candidate.
   However, more women will become interested in politics and the
numbers elected will increase, she said. Ms. Ferraro said her 1984
campaign with Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale
inspired thousands of women to write her and describe how the
candidacy inspired them to go to law school, medical school, or run
for office.
   ``Every time a woman runs for any elective office, it's like
throwing a stone in a lake,'' she said. ``The ripple effect is felt
far beyond the immediate point of impact.''
   Mrs. King compared the challenge facing women in the workplace
and in politics to that faced by blacks during the civil rights
struggle led by her late husband. She said women can learn much
from the tactics used by blacks to gain rights.
   ``The movement showed millions of Americans that you can, indeed
you must, defy authority when that authority is in the wrong,''
Mrs. King said.
   Women have become a distinct and powerful voting group in recent
years, Ms. Ferraro said, pointing to the 1986 mid-term elections
that brought a Democratic majority to the Senate. She said nine
Democrats won by getting less than 50 percent of the male vote, and
more than 50 percent of the female vote.
   ``Women voted more strongly Democratic, and on key issues like
peace, disarmament, social welfare and the environment, differently
from men,'' she said.
   Ms. Ferraro said that after she was nominated for vice president
during the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco,
the thousands of joyfully weeping women she saw told her that
equality, and a female president, are coming.
   ``She will have shown that she possesses the rare combination of
qualities the American people look for in a president, and then it
will be time. And tears will be cried like you wouldn't believe,''
she said.

   Six people have been arrested in what
federal officials say is an international counterfeiting scheme
involving thousands of bogus $100 bills, and investigators are
trying to determine whether the phony money came from Lebanon.
   The arrests began after an Iowa State University student from
Lebanon, Roger Youssef El-Khoury, 25, was taken into custody by
Creston police and federal agents following a tip that suspect
bills had been received by a grocery and department store in
Creston.
   El-Khoury was charged with passing and possessing phony U.S.
money. Federal officials said he had several counterfeit $100 bills
in his possession when he was arrested.
   Also arrested during the month-long investigation was Kenny
Neil, 29, who played football for Iowa State from 1977 to 1980.
Neil, who has been working for the Iowa Department of
Transportation, was a seventh-round draft choice of the New York
Jets professional football team in 1981.
   He was charged with possessing counterfeit money.
   Also charged were Daniel Lee Habhab, 28, a disc jockey at an
Ames nightclub; his roommate, Guy K. Sejaan, 26, a Lebanese citizen
and Iowa State student; and two other students, Dale Bahrenfuss,
24, and Dario Anthony Hutchinson, 29.
   Habhab and Sejaan pleaded guilty Thursday to charges of
possessing counterfeit $100 bills. They have agreed to testify
against the other four, officials said.
   U.S. Secret Service agent William Lenz of Des Moines said
officials do not know where the phony bills were made or how they
were brought into the United States. He said investigators are
trying to determine whether the money came from Lebanon.
   Documents filed in U.S. District Court as part of the guilty
pleas by Habhab and Sejaan include an account of Sejaan's
conversation last year with two Cedar Rapids men in which they
discussed the possible sale of bogus U.S. currency.
   Sejaan said he talked to El-Khoury because he knew El-Khoury
needed money to stay in school. El-Khoury told him to get $5,000 in
counterfeit money from one of the Cedar Rapids men, and on Jan. 11
Sejaan met him in the parking lot of a restaurant, according to the
document.
   The man told Sejaan he was giving him $16,000 worth of
counterfeit money and wanted 45 percent of the proceeds from the
sale. The man also said he expected another shipment of $200,000 in
phony money at the end of January.
   Sejaan said he gave El-Khoury 10 $100 counterfeit bills and was
paid $405. He later gave El-Khoury 20 more phony bills and gave
Habhab, his roommate, 50 of them, according to the documents.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Teig of Cedar Rapids would not
comment on the allegations against the Cedar Rapids men. No charges
have been filed against them.
   El-Khoury's trial is scheduled for March 7 in U.S. District
Court.
   Sejaan and Habhab will be sentenced on April 22. Each could be
imprisoned for 15 years and fined $250,000.
   Officials said the counterfeit bills also have been passed at a
West Des Moines drug store and discount stores in Indianola and
Osceola.

   Democrat Albert Gore Jr., campaigning with
country music star Johnny Cash on Friday, cited increased violence
and suicide among children as he defended his wife's efforts
against raw music lyrics.
   ``What she has said is parents should be more aware that younger
and younger children are targets of increasingly brutal and
explicit material,'' Gore said.
   Cash, a country performer for more than 30 years, appeared with
Gore at a small rally in the railroad yard of the Virginia Museum
of Transportation and planned to travel with the Democratic
presidential candidate to New Hampshire. But snow in New England
forced Gore and Cash to abandon those plans and return to
Washington to await better weather.
   Gore, who has campaigned less in New Hampshire than most of his
rivals while concentrating on the Southern primaries, hoped to make
it to that state before Saturday's Democratic debate.
   Cash, wearing his trademark black-only attire, enthusiastically
endorsed Gore and said his fellow Tennesseean was the only
presidential candidate he has ever publicly backed.
   ``You know, the Soviet Union has a strong, energetic man,'' Cash
told about 150 people who stood in sub-freezing temperatures.
``What we need is a strong, energetic, young, brilliant man, and
that's what we have in Al Gore.''
   Cash's presence prompted numerous questions at a later news
conference about Gore's wife Tipper's work against sexual and
violent lyrics in rock music.
   Gore responded by saying there were epidemics of teen pregnancy
and suicide and an ``epidemic of violence by children against
children.''
   ``In the face of that, I think it's legitimate to ask what is
the effect of children seeing 18,000 murders on television by the
time they graduate from high school. What is the effect of
increasingly explicit material on younger and younger children,''
Gore said.
   ``I'm very proud of what she has done.''
   He said she has never sought to impose censorship but favors
voluntary efforts aimed at letting parents know what is contained
in the music their children listen to.
   Tipper Gore's well-publicized efforts in that cause have brought
criticism from some in the entertainment industry. But Gore's poll
takers and strategists say they find little opposition to his
candidacy in the South or elsewhere based on his wife.
   Cash said he saw no point in trying to censor what his child
might hear in music, but added, ``I really don't think that Tipper
Gore is advocating that kind of censorship anyway.''
   Mrs. Gore did not accompany her husband but two of their
children, Albert Jr., age 5, and Karenna, 14, traveled with him.
   As Gore and Cash spoke, Norfolk Southern freight trains rolled
by noisily just a short distance away, prompting Gore to call on
Cash to sing ``a train song.'' Cash, a country music performer for
more than three decades, complied.
   Virginia's attorney general, Mary Sue Terry, who is expected to
run for governor next year, appeared with Gore, as did the
district's Democratic congressman, Jim Olin, and the city's
Republican Mayor Noel Taylor.
   Gore blasted President Reagan for a lack of leadership on the
deficit and the economy. He said that after the stock market drop
last October Reagan had nothing of substance to say.
   ``The president came out of the White House and said, `What?' _
the helicopter engines were going, you know. He said, `They tell me
I've got to go,''' Gore said. ``Well, he's got a point there.''
   Gore, pinning his presidential hopes on the Southern primaries
on March 8, contended that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is
unlikely to gain great momentum out of an expected win in New
Hampshire, before the campaign turns South.
   ``It's essentially a two-person race in most of the South,'' he
said, referring to himself and Jesse Jackson.

   A small chartered plane crashed into the
snowy flank of a southern volcano, killing all seven occupants, air
force rescue officials said Friday.
   The two-engine Piper Seneca II was reported missing late
Wednesday, after taking off from Temuco, a city 415 miles south of
Santiago.
   Rescue helicopters were unable to locate and reach the crash
site on the Villarica Volcano, about 60 miles south of Temuco in
the Andes mountains, until Friday noon.
   ``The crew and passengers died in the accident,'' said a
communique issued by the air force's rescue service.
   Santiago television stations broadcast footage of the crash site
which showed the plane's charred remains strewn across an icy slope
nearly 7,000 feet above sea level.
   The victims included Francisco Comandari, president of a
Santiago-based bank, Banco del Pacifico, his 13-year-old son and
12-year-old daughter; the bank's general manager, Eran Fernandez,
his wife and 1{-year-old son; and pilot Juan Bernstein.
   The cause of the accident was being investigated, aviation
officials said.

<HEAD>Police: Family Hires Hitman After Arranged Marriage Goes Awry</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple whose daughter spurned an
arranged marriage and eloped with her cousin allegedly tried to
hire a hitman to kill their son-in-law, his sister and mother and
send pieces of the bodies to Jordan, authorities said Friday.
   Dr. Saud Tarawneh, 46, a gynecologist who became a U.S. citizen
in 1980, and his wife, Ghada, 44, were arrested Thursday on a
Broward County warrant in Toledo, Ohio, where they have lived for
several years. Bond for them was set Friday at $1.2 million.
   According to Mike Breece, an investigator with the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement, the couple allegedly tried to
arrange the killings to erase the embarrassment from Rhana
Tarawneh's elopement with her Syrian cousin in 1984.
   ``This would not only help them save face, but elevate the
standing of the family in the tribe to an even higher level than it
was before the daughter ran away,'' Breece said.
   The lovers fled from Jordan and eventually moved to Broward
County.
   Police were contacted by a private investigator the Tarawnehs
allegedly asked either to commit the murders himself or arrange for
a hitman.
   Tarawneh and his wife were each charged with three counts of
conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and three counts of
solicitation to commit first-degree murder.
   The alleged intended targets were their unwanted son-in-law,
Mouataz Abdulsamad, 29; his younger sister, Azza; and his mother,
Najwa, 45.
   When Rhana first fled Jordan with her new husband, the family
wanted to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring,
authorities said.
   But as the embarrassment to the family grew deeper, the parents
allegedly tried to set up the killings of her new husband and his
relatives.
   The plans included instructions for the killer to to hang all
three people, take photographs of the bodies, then cut the mother's
tongue out and sexually mutilate the husband and his sister, Breece
said. Instructions were also included on packaging the body parts
in formaldehyde for shipment to Jordan.
   Breece would not disclose the amount the couple allegedly agreed
to pay for the murders.
   An investigator the parents allegedly tried to hire in early
January told authorities about the plot, and agreed to cooperate
with the state in its criminal investigation, Breece said.
   After getting court permission for wiretaps, agents taped phone
conversations between the investigator and the family, Breece said.
   A state agent and the investigator, who acted as a middle man
for a non-existent hitman, met with the doctor and his wife in
Detroit on Feb. 2, Breece said.
   On Wednesday, the father ``was told the the murders had been
committed and to send his money,'' Breece said. ``Whether or not he
did (send the money), I don't know.''
   Toledo Municipal Court Judge Robert Penn continued the case
until Saturday because the Tarawneh's attorney, Jeffrey Goldstein,
was out of town. The couple faces extradition to Florida, Breece
said.

   Acting Gov. Rose Mofford proclaimed a
state of emergency Friday to free up to $100,000 so the National
Guard can distribute supplies by helicopter to snow- and mud-bound
areas of the Navajo Reservation.
   Col. Vince Barcolo, Chief of Staff of the Arizona National
Guard, said he knew of no life-threatening problems on the
reservation.
   ``We've done this mission a number of years,'' he said. ``When
the snow melts, the mud comes up, and the Navajos have a problem
with getting to isolated areas of the reservation.''
   Barcolo said National Guard helicopters would deliver food and
livestock feed to the huge reservation in Apache and Navajo
counties in northeastern Arizona, and several fuel tank trucks and
a communications van also would be dispatched.
   The mission was expected to last about three days, he said, with
the helicopters based in Window Rock, headquarters of the
reservation.
   Navajo tribal officials were out of town and unavailable for
comment, officials said.

<DATELINE>BECKLEY, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joyrider who took four late-model cars
and trucks this week has earned the grudging respect of Beckley's
finest.
   The joyrider was brazen, bold, efficient and 11 years old.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Patrolman Don Lilly.
``He stole them like a pro.''
   Like many professionals, the young suspect was a specialist. All
four of the stolen vehicles _ two Chevrolets, a GMC and a Buick _
were General Motors products.
   ``He said they were the easiest to steal,'' Lilly said.
   The technique in each theft was the same, he said. The boy broke
the door locks, then broke into the steering column to defeat the
locking mechanism.
   ``Then he'd just start them up and drive off, and all this in a
matter of seconds,'' Lilly said.
   In quick succession Wednesday night, police found two vehicles
taken from a shopping center, one from a mine service company and a
fourth from a home.
   ``We'd find one of the missing cars, and another one would turn
up nearby,'' Lilly said. ``It looks like he just drove them around,
parked them, cranked up another one, and took off.''
   Investigators found the boy through a combination of forensic
evidence and a tip from a witness who saw the suspect near one of
the vehicles.
   ``I was taking fingerprints off of one of the Blazers and
noticed they seemed awfully small,'' Lilly said. ``We started
checking, and every one of the seats was pushed up as far as it
would go.''
   Officials contacted the nearest elementary school, described the
suspect and principal Walter Peelish led them to the boy.
   ``I called his grandmother, and she gave her permission for him
to talk to the police,'' Peelish said.
   Peelish said the youth transferred to the school recently after
moving from another state and had not been a difficult student.
   ``A kid's a kid, and they all get a little rowdy, but we've
really had no problems with him,'' he said.
   Lilly said the boy admitted stealing the cars, and gave police
several tips on his methods.
   The boy was released in his grandmother's custody pending
juvenile court action. He is charged with four counts of auto
theft, and one count of grand larceny for removing a stereo from
one of the vehicles.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said
Friday ``there's a difference between talking about things and
doing things,'' a dig at the long legislative careers of his
Democratic presidential rivals.
   Trudging through a snowstorm that stalled New Hampshire, Dukakis
suggested that his chief Democratic opponents make speeches and
promises while he, as a governor, takes action.
   Dukakis said he is fit to lead ``because I've done it. Because
I've demonstrated I can do it. These just aren't promises; these
just aren't speeches.''
   ``There's a difference between talking about things and doing
things,'' Dukakis said in a snowy campaign stop at Manchester's
fire department.
   Dukakis finished third in Monday's Iowa caucus behind Missouri
Rep. Richard Gephardt and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, both of whom
have long legislative careers.
   Polls leading up to Tuesday's first-in-the-nation New Hampshire
primary show Dukakis in first place, riding his regional advantage,
with Gephardt and Simon trailing.
   The governor's remarks echoed the recent Republican campaign
tack of Vice President George Bush, who has been contrasting his
executive experience with Bob Dole's congressional career.
   Dukakis criticized Gephardt for failing to get his legislative
agenda through Congress. Dukakis said a Gephardt proposal to impose
trade reprisals against countries that bar imports from the United
States is stalled.
   ``His amendment is dead. It's been killed in a Democratic
Senate, which, apparently, he doesn't understand,'' Dukakis said.
   The governor opposes trade barriers, saying they would only
encourage other countries to follow suit.
   ``We aren't going to compete strongly and effectively in this
world by putting walls,'' Dukakis said. ``We're not going to do it
by hunkering down and going back to old ideas and old solutions
that have been tried and failed.''

<HEAD>Researchers Use Monkeys In Vision Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emory University researchers have fitted monkeys
with contact lenses in a study that they hope could yield new ways
to treat babies born with cataracts and other vision disabilities.
   The study at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center
involves a pediatric ophthalmologist, a primate behavioral
psychologist, neuroscientists and several dozen monkeys.
   In the experiments, rhesus monkeys undergo lens-removal surgery
to simulate the operation performed on a newborn with cataracts,
the cloudiness of the eye lens that often plagues older adults.
   Such cataract surgery is not new. In most cases, when a lens is
removed, the patient can be fitted with corrective contact lenses
or glasses.
   But the surgery poses special problems in young children,
because humans are born without fully developed vision systems; the
eyes and the brain must learn to work together. If deprived of
normal visual stimulation _ such as by cataracts _ special cells
needed for vision fail to mature properly.
   Cataract surgery must be performed in children at a very early
age. Even so, doctors have had poor results in trying to stimulate
development. Despite corrective lenses, the best most children have
achieved has been 20-40 vision.
   In the experiment, the researchers remove a healthy lens from
one eye of each monkey. They fit them with contact lenses made at
the center's lab and try various treatment to prompt successful
vision development.
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to relate these results to the human
child,'' Dr. Ronald Boothe, the ophthalmologist and behaviorist who
heads the two-year-old study, said in an interview Friday.
   In both monkeys and man, patients with one good eye and one bad
one will rely on the good eye.
   ``If a child's left to his own devices, he'll ignore it (the
damaged eye),'' said Dr. Howard Eggers, a pediatric ophthalmologist
from New York's Columbia University who is working with the Yerkes
primate researchers. ``We want to force usage of the cataract eye.''
   To force use of the weaker eye, a child can be fitted with a
patch over the good eye. Monkeys don't like to wear eye patches, so
the Yerkes monkeys are fitted with a black contact lens over their
good eye.
   In either case, stimulating proper vision development in the bad
eye is not as simple as just blocking the good one, Eggers said. If
worn too little, a patch will leave the patient relying on the good
eye; too long, and vision in the patched eye will deteriorate.
   Doctors are unsure how long the patches or black lenses should
be worn to give each eye the proper visual stimulation, Eggers
said. ``We don't know the best method, and we obviously cannot
experiment with children.''
   To solve the problem, Yerkes researchers are using different
lens routines on different monkeys. Some wear a black contact lens
all the time, some never do, and others wear it for different
intervals.
   Researchers check the study's remaining 20 monkeys every two
hours to make sure they haven't lost their lenses. ``They have a
great ability to rub contact lenses out,'' Eggers said. Lost lenses
are quickly replaced.
   Researchers test the monkeys' vision, in part, by showing them
patterns on a video screen and rewarding them with banana pellets
when they recognize the proper pattern _ thus proving their vision
is working.
   After the lens trials, the monkeys are killed so researchers can
examine their brains and the development of their optical nerve
systems, Boothe said.

   Police say they believe they have arrested
the man who was shown ``cooking'' the hallucinogenic drug PCP on a
network television news program.
   Michael Wilson Davis, 30, of College Park, was arrested Thursday
as he allegedly arranged with an undercover police officer to buy
chemicals needed to manufacture PCP, or phencyclidine
hydrochloride, said Officer V. Richard Molloy, a police spokesman.
   Police allege Davis is a major East Coast manufacturer of the
drug, which has been associated with violence in users.
   Police believe Davis was the man who appeared on CBS-TV's ``West
57th'' program in a report on the dangers of PCP. The shadowed
figure was shown in the background ``cooking'' PCP.
   Police said they recently obtained a tape of the program, which
CBS said was broadcast in September 1985.
   Malloy said the man on the program showed no remorse when asked
if he felt bad about making the drug.
   According to CBS spokesman Roy Brunett, the ``West 57th''
segment shows an unidentified man telling an interviewer, ``I
figured if they wanted to buy it, they wanted to buy it, and they
knew what the reactions were.''
   Davis and Edward Charles Centerfeit, 31, of Shadyside, were both
charged with conspiracy to manufacture PCP, police said.,
   Davis also was charged with possessing a .25-caliber automatic
handgun, police said.
   Both men were held pending a bail hearing.

   Here is the text of Alexander M. Haig
Jr.'s statement Friday announcing his withdrawal from the
Republican presidential race.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It's evident to me that the contest in Hawaii, Michigan, and
Iowa, and my own assessment of New Hampshire, make it clear that Al
Haig will not be the Republican candidate in 1988.
   My choice, therefore, is to work as effectively as I can for the
principles and the policies that led me into the race in the first
place. I'm therefore announcing today my withdrawal as a candidate
for the Republican presidential nomination and my support for the
candidate best qualified to lead this nation.
   To my family, my friends, and my supporters, let me express my
enduring gratitude for the devotion and your help throughout this
campaign. Only in America could a non-politician have achieved even
as much as I have. Even though I was the darkest of the dark
horses, you supported me because you and I believe, at the very
least, we could shape the issues in this campaign. Believe me,
we've done that.
   To my fellow Republicans, and to my fellow Americans, let me say
this. The '88 elections should not be about business as usual in
America. Our next president should not be a man who offers simply
more of the same. We need a leader who truly reflects the
mainstream values that made this country great, including hard
work, moral convictions, and tolerance for the diversity of
America. We should have the experience and the skill that comes
from a record of having made a difference. And our next president
should understand that good government means competent government
run by the very best people America can provide.
   In my judgment, Senator Robert Dole is the candidate best able
to lead our country into the '90s. He has risen from among the
people through hard work and honest effort. He has never forgotten
that America is, above all, the adventure of the common man. And he
knows from experience how to make our government work. Bob Dole has
indeed made a difference.
   As a candidate in this campaign, only Bob Dole embodies best my
understanding of the crucial challenges we face and what we must do
to meet them. He knows, and I agree, that we must tackle the
horrendous budget deficit now, without resorting to short-term
gimmicks or destructive tax increases that would cripple our
nation's economy. He knows, and I agree, that the answer to our
trade policy must not be self-defeating protectionism.
   He knows, and I agree, that in dealing with the Soviet Union we
must give Moscow no choice but restraint. And, above all, it is
very clear to me that Bob Dole has the strength of character a
president must have to deal with Mikhail Gorbachev.
   I am proud to offer my support for Bob Dole. I urge each of my
supporters and all Republicans to vote for Bob Dole in this crucial
New Hampshire primary and every primary thereafter. The party needs
Bob Dole; so does America.
   Now, finally, a word about that unique American institution, the
media. Every candidate for a high public office undergoes the most
searching scrutiny from the media. They were fair to me. I hope you
feel I was fair to you.

   Near blizzard conditions disrupted
presidential campaigns and almost brought the state to a halt
Friday with up to two feet of snow predicted and winds gusting to
60 mph.
   ``It's terrible out there,'' state police dispatcher Norman St.
Hilaire said Friday. Weir Lundstedt of the National Weather Service
in Concord added, ``It's not a day to go out and challenge the
storm.''
   The weather played havoc with campaign schedules, as candidates
worked feverishly to win support before Tuesday's presidential
primary.
   Staff members scrambled to revise schedules as most candidates
had to scrap events. Several were having trouble flying in or out
of the state, with airports closed. Bob Dole had planned to travel
to New Orleans and Pat Robertson had hoped to go to Washington.
Neither got out of the state.
   Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr., both in Virginia, and Jack
Kemp, in Washington, were trying to get to New Hampshire.
   Only Richard Gephardt had a campaign event made to order for
such a day _ he was to watch a dog sled race at Opechee Park in
Laconia.
   The curtailed campaigning also put a crimp in news coverage.
   Television crews covering Vice President George Bush, who was
holed up in his hotel part of the day, dashed outside to film the
storm to show why candidates were notcampaigning.
   The Weather Service predicted the storm should end after
midnight.

   The flight crews of Brazil's two
largest airlines went on strike for higher wages Friday, tying up
most domestic and some international flights on the eve of Carnival
celebrations.
   Non-Brazilian carriers were not affected by the strike at Varig
and Vasp airlines. Transbrasil, Brazil's other major airline,
operated normally after reaching a separate agreement with its
flight crews.
   The Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro international airports said the
strike stopped all departures and arrivals of Varig and Vasp.
Shuttle service between Rio and Sao Paulo also was suspended.
   An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 passengers, including many
Carnival tourists, will be affected by the planned three-day
strike, the airlines' press offices said.
   The huge Carnival celebration kicks off Saturday and runs until
Ash Wednesday, Feb. 17.
   Edson Antonio Matosinho, one of the directors of Brazil's
12,000-strong flight crew union, said in a telephone interview that
about 7,000 Varig and Vasp employees joined the strike.
   The strike was called to demand a 65 percent wage hike,
Matosinho said.
   Flight crew workers' salaries range from $385 to $3,300 a month,
he said.

   Former President Jimmy Carter's boyhood home,
high school and the railroad depot that served as his 1976 campaign
headquarters are centerpieces of a project to turn his hometown
into a major tourist attraction.
   The National Park Service will assume responsibility for
preserving the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site during a
dedication ceremony at the depot on Saturday morning. Those
scheduled to attend include Carter, former officials of his
administration and members of the Georgia congressional delegation.
   About 80,000 visitors a year stop at the small welcome center in
Plains, an agricultural community of 650 residents in the heart of
Georgia's peanut belt. That is down considerably from the hundreds
of thousands of tourists who visited Plains annually during
Carter's presidency.
   But in four or five years, after the Park Service has built
exhibits, rehabilitated buildings and made other improvements, the
town could attract up to 300,000 visitors a year, said John Tucker,
who will manage the Carter site in addition to his duties as
superintendent of the nearby Andersonville National Historic Site.
   ``There will be a lot people can see and do,'' Tucker said. ``I
think it'll be a lot more attractive to the people going up and
down I-75.''
   The popularity of the 39th president's hometown will help the
surrounding area, he said.
   ``One of the primary benefits ... would be in the area of
tourism,'' Tucker said. ``That'll be a tremendous economic benefit
to Sumter County and southwest Georgia.''
   President Reagan on Dec. 23 signed legislation authorizing the
Park Service to acquire Carter's home on the town's main street,
his boyhood home on the outskirts of town, a vacant brick building
where he attended high school and the depot, which houses a Carter
museum.
   Eventually, the Carters will donate their home and its
furnishings to the Park Service, but they will occupy the house for
their lifetimes. The Carter home, ringed by a metal fence and
protected by Secret Service agents, will be closed to the public
for now.
   Deeds for the railroad depot and high school will be transferred
to the Park Service during Saturday's ceremony.
   In addition to the historic site, the federal legislation also
establishes a 730-acre Jimmy Carter National Preservation District
that includes the town and some surrounding areas.
   The Park Service plans to acquire easements in the preservation
district, through donations or purchases, to preserve Plains'
small-town, rural character, Tucker said.

<HEAD>Bonoir Sees Possible Loophole in White House Ban on Private Contra
Aid</HEAD>

   A congressional critic of President Reagan's
Central America policy said Friday the White House may have left a
loophole in a directive barring government officials from aiding
private fund-raising efforts for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   ``I was disturbed to learn ... that the White House instructions
may not apply to all executive branch employees,'' Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., the chief deputy House whip, wrote in a letter to
Reagan.
   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. and national
security adviser Colin L. Powell on Wednesday issued a memorandum
directing that ``no administration official should provide
assistance or encouragement of any kind'' to such fund-raising
efforts.
   But Bonior said the memo was addressed only to White House and
National Security Council staff members, and not to officials of
the State Department, Pentagon and the CIA.
   ``If the White House intentionally excepted the CIA, Defense and
State departments, they are laying the groundwork for another
Iran-Contra scandal,'' Bonior said in a statement.
   During last summer's congerssional hearings into the Iran-Contra
arms and money affair, activities by White House and State
Department officials to raise money for the Contras, including
those of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, became a focus of concern over
the ``privatization'' of U.S. foreign policy.
   In the memo, Baker and Powell said ``no administration official
should take a position for or against private support for the
democratic resistance'' and that officials should discourage
discussions of the subject at meetings where they are present.
   Contra leaders have said they were actively seeking private
monetary support.
   Meanwhile, Reagan declined an invitation from congressional
leaders to participate in the drafting of a package of strictly
``humanitarian'' aid to the Contras to take the place of the $36
million administration package, which included military aid, killed
by the House on Feb. 4.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other Democratic leaders
had written Reagan on Tuesday to ask for his suggestions, but
Reagan wrote back Thursday that he would not offer ideas, but only
react to any proposal Congress might draft.
   ``The outlines of an acceptable package must provide sufficient
aid to sustain the freedom fighters in order to maintain those
pressures that have moved the peace process forward,'' Reagan wrote.
   The statement seemed a clear indication that the administration
will insist on aid that would keep the rebels active as a fighting
force.
   ``Without immediate action by the Congress, the freedom fighters
will become recklessly exposed, and may soon have to make
irreversible decisions about their own future,'' Reagan said in the
letter. ``Even as I write this letter, we have reliable reports of
new Soviet military shipments to Nicaragua.''
   Current U.S. aid for the rebels, including authority for the CIA
to make air drops to fighters in the field inside Nicaragua, ends
Feb. 29.
   In a speech Thursday night to a conservative political group,
Reagan vowed that ``the curtain hasn't fallen'' on aid to the
rebels.
   ``We're not giving up on those who are fighting for their
freedom, and they aren't giving up either,'' Reagan said.
   Asked Friday what the administration intends to do, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``If we can't reach an agreement
(with the Democrats), we will have our own package.''
   Fitzwater said no decision has been made whether an
administration package would contain military aid, adding, ``First
of all, we want to see what the speaker (Wright) produces.''
   Fitzwater said that by the end of February there will be another
vote in Congress on aid _ either the Democratic plan or an
administration package.

   An airline passenger with a beef over a
bunless hamburger threw his plate and eating utensils at a flight
attendant who was unable to placate him with a First Class roll, an
airline official said Friday.
   Matthew Wallis, 45, of New York City, was booked for
investigation of misdemeanor battery when American Airlines Flight
209 from New York landed at 10:15 p.m. Thursday at Los Angeles
International Airport. He was freed after posting bail of $500.
   Wallis was one of 50 people aboard the DC-10 who had ordered a
special meal, said Steve McGregor, a spokesman for American, based
in Fort Worth, Texas.
   ``He had ordered a hamburger. For some reason, the hamburger did
not have a bun with it. He became somewhat unhappy with that fact.
Our people notified the lead flight attendant who did obtain a roll
from the First Class section, thinking that might placate him. It
did not,'' McGregor said.
   Wallis' wife, who flew with him on the New York to Los Angeles
flight, ordered the same special meal, McGregor said.
   ``Her hamburger, in fact, did have a bun,'' McGregor said.
   When the proffered roll failed to satisfy Wallis, chief flight
attendant Sue Roen, of Los Angeles, advised the captain of the
problem. He ``told her to read him that portion of the law
outlining passenger misconduct,'' McGregor said.
   She did, but that only appeared to make the passenger angrier,
McGregor said.
   ``After using profanities, he picked up his plate with the knife
and fork still on it and threw it at her (Ms. Roen), hitting her
and narrowly missing a passenger with the flying knife,'' said Los
Angeles police Sgt. Joe Arreola.
   Ms. Roen was uninjured and none of the passengers around Wallis
was hurt, Arreola said.
   Wallis was placed under citizen's arrest by Ms. Roen after she
was struck by the plate. The captain contacted Los Angeles
International Airport and asked that police stand by, McGregor said.
   ``Interference with a flight crew is a federal offense and we
always prosecute. That will be the case here, too,'' McGregor said.
   McGregor was unsure how many passengers were aboard the flight
and didn't know what the menu item was for passengers who had made
no special requests.

<TEXT>
   Three Eastern European countries have begun
talks with the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft companies to
supply long-range passenger planes to replace aging Soviet
equipment in their national airlines, Deputy Secretary of State
John C. Whitehead said Friday.
   Whitehead, just back from a two-week trip to four Soviet-bloc
countries, told reporters ``my impression is they are very much
interested in buying U.S. planes. It's a significant thing,
psychologically, I believe _ Eastern European countries flying U.S.
planes.''
   He declined to identify the countries that expressed interest,
but another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were Poland, Hungary and Romania.
   If deals are arranged it would be the first U.S. aircraft sales
to Hungary and Poland.
   In the early 1970s, Romania purchased several Boeing 707
passenger jets under a contract arranged at a time when the United
States was wooing Romania in hopes of increasing that country's
independence from Moscow.
   Whitehead said that from the State Department's viewpoint, ``it
would be feasible and desirable'' for the sales, but he noted two
major stumbling blocks.
   Buying U.S. aircraft would require large expenditures by the
governments and credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for the
purchases would not be available, Whitehead said.
   The aircraft companies, moreover, would be prohibited from
selling equipment on a list of military-applicable goods banned for
export to communist countries. This could limit the type of
airplanes the countries could buy.
   ``There is some navigational equipment that could not be on the
planes,'' Whitehead said. ``They would have to buy stuff that would
not be on the (embargo) list.''
   Whitehead, the No. 2 official in the State Department, has
assumed special responsibility for a U.S. effort to gain influence
in countries that have been dominated by the Soviet Union since
World War II.
   Under the policy, the United States has offered the nations
increased trade and better relations in general, in return for
improved human rights performance and the institution of free
economic policies. On his latest trip, Whitehead visited Poland,
Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   Whitehead said he told Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu that
his country is in danger of losing special trading rights granted
by Congress each year to reward Romania for its relatively free
emigration policies.
   The trading rights _ most-favored-nation status _ have been
worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Romania in previous years,
but renewal for 1988 has been suspended by Congress because the
Ceausescu government's human rights policies are considered
repressive, especially toward religious minorities.
   Whitehead said he told the Romanian leader there was only a
``50-50 chance it would be renewed, but there was still time.''
   Ceausescu, in keeping with previous discussions with U.S.
officials, refused to discuss the human rights issues on grounds
they were strictly an internal matter, Whitehead said.
   ``I came home with not much reason to hope there will be
improvement,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday his
coalition partner and rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, was
going behind his back in an effort to sabotage Shamir's strategy
for Middle East peace.
   His accusation came the day after Peres suggested that
intransigence by Shamir thwarted talks with King Hussein of Jordan,
which the foreign minister said could have averted Palestinian
riots in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At the center of the argument over peace is an initiative by the
United States.
   Israeli officials said Secretary of State George P. Shultz
telephoned Peres and Shamir on Thursday to say he will visit the
Middle East after his scheduled Feb. 21-23 trip to Moscow.
   U.S. envoy Richard Murphy outlined the new American ideas to
Israel's coalition government this week.
   According to Israeli officials, the plan calls for an
international conference, possibly in Geneva, as a means of
beginning Arab-Israeli talks by April.
   Negotiations would focus first on a temporary autonomy plan for
the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. Talks on
the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would begin by
December even if self-government had not begun.
   Peres immediately endorsed the proposals, but Shamir said
clarifications were needed, and expressed reservations about the
rapid timetable and international role. Shamir leads the right-wing
Likud bloc and Peres head the center-left Labor Party.
   On Israel radio Thursday, the prime minister expressed
frustration over what called leaks intended to undercut his
negotiating position.
   ``Every expression of cooperation on my part is thrown in my
face immediately,'' he said. ``I show Mr. Peres a letter and after
a few hours it is in the hands of all the reporters.
   ``Everything he does is in the middle of the night. What I do he
wants to know about so that he can sabotage it.''
   Shamir accused Peres of surrendering to Arab demands for the
return of land captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``How can you conduct negotiations together when your partner
runs every day and every minute to the other side and says, `Don't
listen to what Shamir says, I'll sell it to you cheaper?''' Shamir
declared.
   Moshe Shahal of the Labor Party rejected Shamir's claim that
Peres was ``overeager'' to accept the U.S. proposals.
   ``We are not being overeager. The prime minister is trying to
give an excuse for a period of no movement,'' he said.
   In a speech to party members Thursday night, Peres indirectly
accused Shamir of blocking an international conference agreed to by
Jordan.
   ``If the negotiations with an international opening had begun in
April, when they could have been started, would or would it not
have spared us the events in the territories?'' Peres said.
   Riots began Dec. 8 and more than 50 Arabs have been killed,
nearly all of them by Israelis, accurding to U.N. figures.
   In an interview with Hearst Newspapers correspondent John P.
Wallach, Shamir said: ``It's not a question of intransigence, of a
refusal to talk about it, but I don't want to make the American
government fail.
   ``If we come today with King Hussein and the other Arabs, and
try to negotiate about the final status, the negotiations will
explode immediately. Israel will say, `We want Israeli
sovereignty.' The other side will say, `We want Arab sovereignty'
and it is finished. ... It will be over before it starts.''
   Shamir said a five-year period was needed between Palestinian
autonomy and talks about a final settlement so confidence and trust
could be built. He said that was the concept in the 1978 Camp David
accords, which led to the peace treaty with Egypt in March 1979.
   Israel television said Shamir sent a letter to Shultz on
Wednesday requesting changes in the U.S. proposal, but Shultz
refused.
   It said Shamir asked the Americans to drop the international
conference, extend the autonomy timetable and not to set a date for
talks about the final status of the occupied territories.
   The prime minister also asked the United States to enlist the
support of other countries for building urban neighborhoods to
house the Gaza Strip's Palestinian refugees, repoort said.

<HEAD>Additions To Endangered Species List Hit Near Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service added 59 species
to the list of endangered and threatened species last year, the
second highest total ever, the service said Thursday.
   In the previous most active year, 1979, 68 species were added.
   The list now stands at 993 animals and plants, of which 513 are
found only in foreign countries, the service said in a year-end
report.
   One species was removed from the list after confirmation of its
long-suspected extinction _ the Amistad gambusia, a small fish
found in some springs in Texas.
   Another species died out during the year, but the paperwork to
remove it from the list has not been completed, spokesman David
Klinger said. This was the dusky seaside sparrow, whose last
survivor, an elderly male in captivity, died in Florida.
   Among other reasons to call it a good year, the service noted
its reestablishment of the red wolf in the wild in North Carolina,
the growth of the Chesapeake Bay bald eagle population from 136
pairs to 161, successful captive breeding of the black-footed
ferret and establishment of a second population of California sea
otters off the coast near Los Angeles.
   Too late to make the report was the successful mating of condors
in captivity in California. The service removed the last condor
from the wild last year on Easter Sunday, and hopes to rebuild the
population through breeding in captivity.
   Environmentalists have complained that under the Reagan
administration, the service has been moving far too slowly in
making decisions, and that it will take 16 years or so to work
through the backlog of about 1,000 candidate species.
   They have said that in the last 20 years, 300 species became
extinct while waiting for a decision.
   Listing of a species as threatened or endangered under the 1973
Endangered Species Act means federal agencies must consult the
service about any of their activities which could harm it. Also,
the service must draft and try to carry out a recovery plan, of
which 222 are in effect.

   A research satellite launched last week to
test elements of the proposed ``Star Wars'' anti-missile shield
failed in a secondary tracking excercise when an optical sensor
gave false data to two on-board computers, an Air Force official
said Friday.
   Air Force Col. John Otten, assistant director of the Strategic
Defense Initiative's kinetic energy office, said an optical sensor
on Delta 181, a satellite used to test ``Star Wars'' sensors and
trackers, gave flawed data when it tried to track target objects
that were beyond its range.
   Otten said the sensor data went into the computers, causing them
to respond inappropriately. He said the flaw was detected within an
hour and the computers were told to ignore the data. This corrected
the problem.
   Some of the test data on the system was lost because of the
problem, but Otten said the loss was minor because the tracking
exercise was a secondary objective. ``In the fundamental mission we
suceeded,'' he said.
   Delta 181 was launched Feb. 8 from the Kennedy Space Center and
spent 12 hours conducting a series of tests to gather data needed
to refine the SDI, or ``Star Wars,'' anti-missile system.
   Program manager Andy Green last week called the flight ``a very
successful mission.''
   However, Aviation Week and Space Technology, in a story prepared
for Monday publication, said the satellite was unable to complete
``battle management fire control computations.''
   The magazine blamed the problem on the computers, but Otten said
the flaw actually was caused by the optical sensor attempting to
lock onto an object beyond its range.
   Sensors on the satellite were used to track 14 sub-satellite
targets released in two groups from the Delta.
   Otten said the problem developed when the optical sensor located
an object, looked away, and then tried to relocate the original
object. By then, the target had moved beyond the range of the
sensor.
   The tracking test using the optical sensor was halted when the
fuel budgeted for that exercise became exhausted, Otten said.
   He said an infrared sensor also failed to function properly, but
infrared data was collected by a back-up system.
   Otten said only about three percent of the data collected during
the 12-hour mission of Delta 181 has been examined.

   The Marine Corps and the State Department on
Friday minimized a report that more than 500 instances of possible
wrongdoing by Marine guards at embassies worldwide had not been
investigated properly.
   ``Many of the so-called `infractions' were very minor, such as
curfew violations, insubordination, and misuse of telephone that
could have no conceivable tie to suspected KGB activity,'' the
corps said in a statement. The KGB is the Soviet spy agency.
   Both agencies responded to Rep. Dan Mica's statement that more
than 500 reports of infractions by Marines at embassies had
remained in the State Department's files until recently.
   Mica, D-Fla., said the reports, which dealt with black market
activities or fraternization with Soviets, are supposed to be
turned over to the Naval Investigative Service for further
investigation.
   Mica said his information came from the General Accounting
Office, the congressional watchdog agency, which began looking into
security at the embassies in the wake of allegations of espionage
at the Moscow embassy.
   The KGB often encourages people to engage in illegal behavior as
a first step to gaining cooperation with the Soviets, Mica said.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition he remain
anonymous, said the decision to turn over information about a
possible violation by a Marine guard is sometimes made by the
Marines, sometimes by the department.
   ``There have been instances where one or both passed'' along
information to the NIS, the official said. The removal of a Marine
is also a joint decision, he said.
   Asked about the 578 reports referred to by Mica, the corps said,
``The report is actually a listing of the Marine security guards
whose tours of duty as embassy guards were cut short for a variety
of reasons during the period 1980-1987.''
   Some Marines were removed for disciplinary reasons; others for
medical reasons or for giving a substandard performance, the
statement said.
   Of the security guards sent home between 1985-1987 ``only a
handful could be said to relate to espionage.'' During that period,
only one Marine, Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, has been convicted of
espionage for his activities in Moscow.
   The Marines said they had not known about the list of 578 until
June 1987 ``when it surfaced at the Department of State.''
   Mica was not available to comment because he is in Florida
preparing to announce his candidacy for U.S. Senate. But his
spokesman, John Gersuk, said infractions on the list could have
been things other than black marketeering or fraternization
violations.
   Mica has said the various agencies' procedures for handling
potential security problems are chaotic and may need to be
overhauled.

   The Hotel del Coronado, a lavish
Victorian seaside resort with a star-studded past, will celebrate
its centennial next weekend with an extravangaza befitting its most
gilded days.
   Built in 1888 for $1 million, the hotel is one of the world's
largest wooden structures and the nation's only working commercial
hotel with a national monument designation.
   Famous for its Queen Anne design, the Del, as the hotel is known
locally, has served as host to 10 presidents, royalty from around
the world and countless celebrities.
   Businessman Montgomery Ward, actors Charlie Chaplin and Mary
Pickford, and President Abraham Lincoln's son, Robert Todd, are
among those who signed its registry. Thomas Edison was the
five-story hotel's lighting technician.
   The picturesque resort of red-roofed turrets atop a white
gingerbread exterior on a peninsula south of San Diego also has
been a backdrop for a number of films and television shows.
   ``The Hotel Del is something fantastic,'' said silent screen
star Anita Paige, who stayed at the hotel while filming ``The
Flying Fleet'' in 1927. ``I've been to Europe since and their only
competition is in France.''
   A posh weekend party celebrating the 100th birthday of the
wooden castle's Feb. 19, 1888, opening begins Friday night.
   Some 750 guests, including dozens of celebrities and movie
stars, have paid $5,000 a couple to participate in the full
weekend. Proceeds will be donated to charity.
   At Friday night's festivities for 2,000, a disc jockey
resembling a hip Edison will spin records in one room as musicians
and dancers perform in others.
   Marilyn Monroe look-alikes and original Munchkins from the movie
``The Wizard of Oz'' will wander the paneled hallways. The film
``Some Like it Hot,'' starring Miss Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony
Curtis, was filmed on location at the hotel in 1958, and Oz author
L. Frank Baum, a frequent hotel guest, allegedly based his book's
Emerald City on the Del.
   Saturday will feature a harbor tour with America's Cup victor
Dennis Conner, a celebrity tennis tournament and a ball, followed
by a turn-of-the-century style picnic Sunday with hot air balloons
and a Navy air show.
   Comedians George Burns and Phyllis Diller will be among the
weekend's entertainers.
   But as current owner Larry Lawrence tells it, the hotel itself
nearly didn't make it to the party. When he bought the 399-room
hotel in 1963, it had fallen prey to termites and neglect.
   ``There was no electricity in many places, no water above the
second floor,'' said Lawrence, the hotel's sixth owner. ``It was
infested with termites and rats. This was a property that had
everything but the bulldozer gutting it down.''
   More than $40 million later, the hotel stands with its
stateliness restored. It has new foundations, plumbing, heating,
electricity and an $8 million fire protection system.
   A steel frame was implanted to bolster the Crown Room, a
monumental dining room with a sugar pine ceiling that rises 33
feet. The hotel also was expanded.
   In 1970, the Crown Room was the site of the largest state dinner
outside Washington, D.C., with then-President Richard Nixon,
outgoing President Lyndon Johnson, Mexican President Gustavo Diaz
Ordaz and 800 others.
   Today, about half of the hotel's guests are corporate
executives. With 1,400 employees serving 700 suites, guests pay a
premium for service, Lawrence said. The hotel's average rate is
$200 a day.
   It all began as a dream of railroad tycoon Elisha Babcock and
piano magnate H.L. Story, who envisioned while hunting on the
barren peninsula a resort that would be ``the talk of the Western
world.''
   It was designed by three brothers, former railroad architects
James, Merritt and Watson Reid, and built largely by unskilled
Chinese laborers. It became the largest structure outside of New
York City to be electrically lighted, powered by the first power
plant in California.

   Firefighters recovered the bodies of two people
Friday after a six-alarm blaze roared through an apartment complex,
causing more than $1 million in damage and leaving 200 people
homeless.
   Authorities have not determined the cause of the fire at
Harvey's Racquet Apartments. All residents were accounted for.
   ``Firefighters found one adult and one child inside the building
and were still searching,'' Fire Capt. Donna Cooper said. The
victims were not immediately identified.
   Three others were slightly hurt, including one firefighter with
a knee injury.
   The fire destroyed or damaged 48 apartments, officials said.
About 120 firefighters battled the fast-moving fire at the
apartments near Love Field in 20-degree weather.
   Witnesses said some residents escaped from second and
third-floor apartments by climbing or jumping from
balcony-to-balcony.
   In addition to the those left homeless, another 100 residents
lost electricity because the power was cut for several hours.
   Complex employees and American Red Cross volunteers worked
through the night to find temporary housing for residents. Most
were temporarily housed in vacant apartments in other areas of the
complex.
   Fire officials said it was the largest blaze in Dallas since
flames swept through the Willow Creek Apartment complex five years
ago.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Downed Unmanned Israeli Spy Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said Friday its air defenses shot
down an unmanned Israeli surveillance plane over Iraqi territory
near the border with Saudi Arabia.
   In Israel, the military command said it had no information about
such an incident and an army spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``I believe we will not have any information.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a
military statement as saying the remote-controlled aircraft was
``launched by the Zionists to jam Iraqi air defenses and monitor
data for the hireling (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini regime.''
   Iraq and Iraq are locked in a 7-year-old war and often accuse
each other of receiving Israeli aid.
   Iraq said its air defenses destroyed the craft at 5:44 p.m.
Thursday near Al Ma'aniyah, a small outpost 185 miles southwest of
Baghdad on the Saudi-Iraqi border. It said the plane was launched
from the ``occupied Arab territories,'' a reference to Israel and
Israeli-occupied territories.
   The agency gave no further details. It did not say what weapons
were used to down the plane.
   In Israel, a senior military source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``I think this report is rubbish.'' He expressed
doubt that an Israeli drone could reach Iraqi territory. It would
have to fly about 430 miles to get to Al Ma'aniyah.
   The report was believed to be the first of an Israeli intrusion
into Iraqi air space since Israeli jets destroyed an uncompleted
Iraqi nuclear power station in 1981.
   Israel has pioneered development of radio-controlled
reconnaissance craft, but these have usually been used on
relatively short missions. The Israeli-made Pioneer unmanned
surveillance aircraft has a range of 115 miles. Two other
Israeli-made drones, the Scout and the Mastiff, have a range of 62
miles and 84 miles respectively.
   The craft look like oversized model airplanes. They carry
cameras, sometimes including TV cameras that help their distant
``pilots'' steer the craft to their objectives.
   The United States has been testing unmanned surveillance craft
in the Persian Gulf.

   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson ordered attorneys
Friday to go ahead with a lawsuit against Chrysler Corp., but held
out hope for a settlement that would preserve jobs at the Kenosha
plant the automaker wants to close.
   Thompson said Chrysler does not want a breach of contract suit
to be filed over its plan to lay off 5,500 auto workers at the
plant in Kenosha, which it acquired when it bought American Motors
Corp. last year, and has expressed a willingness to negotiate with
the state.
   ``It would be better for both parties to settle this case
quickly,'' Thompson said at a news conference.
   Thompson said Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca telephoned him
Tuesday and that a meeting was likely soon between state and
company oficials. He declined to say where or when it would be held.
   Chrysler announced Jan. 27 it would halt production of the
Omni-Horizon autos Sept. 30.
   Attorney General Don Hanaway had advised the governor earlier
that the state had a ``clearly enforceable'' agreement with
Chrysler calling for Omni-Horizon autos to be built in Kenosha for
five years.
   At a news conference in New York last week, Iacocca defended his
company's decision to close the aging Kenosha plant.``We did not
lie to anybody,'' he said. ``Why would we?''
   Hanaway said the state has a ``good faith basis'' for filing the
suit. And even though no contract with Chrysler was signed, ``I
don't consider this to be frivolous in any way,'' he said.
   In Chicago, Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald Greenwald said
company officials were sorry the Kenosha plant had to be closed.
   ``I guess you could say Chrysler was overly optimistic'' when it
told workers and government officials in Wisconsin that it believed
it could build the Omni-Horizon small car at Kenosha for up to five
years, Greenwald said.
   ``But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no
grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie,'' he said. ``We never
made any hard commitments.''
   Greenwald said Chrysler always said market conditions would
dictate the future of the plant.
   Greenwald said Chrysler would repay the city and county of
Kenosha more than $1 million the governments spent on improvements
for the plant.
   During Greenwald's news conference, about 50 Wisconsin
autoworkers picketed for hours in icy slush and 10-degree weather
outside his hotel to protest the Kenosha closing.
   Outside, workers carried signs bearing slogans such as: ``1st in
Quality, 1st to Close;'' ``Work Hard, Get Worked Over;'' and ``Lee
is a Liar,'' referring to Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, who
appears in television ads asking customers to trust Chrysler.

<HEAD>Senators Ask Gorbachev To Allow Baltic National Demonstrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-two Senators have written to Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev asking him not to interfere with
demonstrations and religious services scheduled this Sunday and
Tuesday in the Soviet republics of Lithuania and Estonia, it was
announced Friday.
   The senators wrote Gorbachev ``to urge you not only to allow the
Lithuanian and Estonian people to peacefully honor their national
independence days, but also to take all necessary measures to
guarantee that they do not become targets of state-sponsored
harassment before or after these commemorations.''
   The state-controlled Soviet news media has criticized similar
congressional statements in the past for inciting public
demonstrations in the Baltic republics.
   The latest congressional letter, co-sponsored by Sens. Donald
Riegle, D-Mich., David Durenberger, R-Minn., and Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., praised Gorbachev for not interfering with demonstrations
by an estimated 10,000 people in the three Baltic republics last
Aug. 23.
   Those demonstrations marked the anniversary of the 1939
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact under which Stalin agreed to allow Hitler
to invade western Poland and Hitler allowed Stalin to invade
eastern Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   For years, the citizens of Estonia and Lithuania have
celebrated, within the privacy of their homes, their pre-Soviet
independence days in February.
   The public demonstrations in the Baltic republics last August
came in response to Gorbachev's policies of greater openness, and
brought warnings from two conservative members of the ruling
Politburo, Viktor Chebrikov, chairman of the KGB security police,
and Yegor Ligachev, the Communist Party's chief ideologist, that
things were getting out of hand.
   The U.S. senators wrote Gorbachev that they had received reports
from emigre groups ``that 200 Lithuanians have written a letter
informing you of their intention to commemorate their independence
day on Feb. 16 with flower-laying ceremonies.''
   Religious services also have been scheduled Sunday to mark the
pre-Soviet national day in Lithuania, which remains overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic after nearly 50 years of rule by the officially
atheistic Kremlin authorities.
   The senators said ``one report reaching the West indicates that
Soviet authorities may move to block these peaceful ceremonies.''
They cited a report of the beating in Vilnius on Feb. 6 of Nijole
Sadunaite, a leading Lithuanian dissident, ``in an apparent attempt
to intimidate her.''
   The Lithuanian Information Center, an emigre organization with
offices in Washington and New York, blamed the beating on
plainclothes KGB officers.
   The letter cited concern over ``official harassment and abuse''
against demonstrators and cited as an ominous warning a report in
the Communist Party daily Pravda on Jan. 29 that Lithuanian
authorities ``had decided to intensify their efforts against
`bourgeois nationalsim and clerical extremism.''
   The senators signing the letter, besides Riegle, Lautenberg and
Durenberger, were: Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.;
Bill Bradley, D-N.J.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Quentin Burdick,
D-N.D.; Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan
Dixon, D-Ill.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Bob
Graham, D-Fla.; and John Heinz, R-Pa.
   Also, David Karnes, R-Neb.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; Richard Lugar,
R-Ind.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; George Mitchell, D-Maine; Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; William Proxmire,
D-Wis.; David Pryor, D-Ark.; Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Paul Trible,
R-Va.; Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.; Pete Wilson, R-Calif.; and Timothy
Wirth, D-Colo.

<HEAD>NEA: Teachers Snaring Delegate Slots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Education Association said Friday
its teachers turned out in force in the Iowa caucuses and are
poised to grab a large share of New Hampshire's Democratic
convention delegate slots.
   The union said 10,000 members turned out for the Republican and
Democratic precinct caucuses in Iowa last Monday, or 30 percent
more than in 1984.
   In New Hampshire, NEA members turned out in big numbers for
pre-primary caucuses held Jan. 23 to determine who would run on
candidates' delegates slates.
   The union, in its weekly political newsletter, boasted that its
members snared more than 25 percent of the slots on the Democratic
candidates' slates in New Hampshire.
   The liberal union sent several hundred delegates to the last
Democratic convention and several dozen to the Republican
convention. It has refrained so far from endorsing any one
candidate.
   But it has called all the Democrats acceptable and encouraged
state affiliates to maximize the number of teachers running for
delegate under any banner.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp apparently has
failed to file full delegate slates in his home state.
   The state Board of Elections said Friday that only Vice
President George Bush filed nominating petitions for delegates in
all congressional delegates, according to a preliminary count.
   Petitions for delegates slates in New York's April 19 primary
had to be postmarked by midnight Thursday.
   Polls have shown Bush with a solid lead in New York state and
his delegate supporters were expected to be on the ballot in all 34
of New York's congressional districts.
   Pat Robertson's New York campaign director, Henry Hewes, has
said he expected the former television preacher to have delegates
on the ballot in 20-28 congressional districts.
   Kemp's New York campaign director Timothy Carey and New York for
Dole director Philip Pepe said they expected their candidates to
have delegates on the ballots in 20-22 districts.
   At the primary, Republican voters will pick 102 delegates, three
from each of the state's 34 congressional districts, to the
convention. The Republican State Committee will choose 34 at-large
delegates after the primary to round out New York's 136-member
delegation at the GOP convention in New Orleans.

<HEAD>Babbitt Wins Gold Star on Environmental Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential hopeful Bruce
Babbitt's environmental record won him the gold star in a report
card issued Friday by a national environmental watchdog group.
   The League of Conservation Voters praised Babbitt and Republican
presidential hopeful Pete du Pont for their stands on the
environment, while criticizing several other candidates, notably
Rep. Jack Kemp.
   The report gave the former Arizona governor high marks for his
stands on air pollution, acid rain, land management and knowledge
of worldwide problems such as depletion of the ozone layer and rain
forests.
   Also scoring well among the Democrats were Tennesee Sen. Albert
Gore and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, with Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt getting the most lukewarm reception for votes on water and
population issues.
   Among Republicans, du Pont's record in Congress on water
pollution, toxic waste cleanup and population issues won him the
league's highest score.
   League Chairman Brent Blackwelder slammed several Republicans,
particularly Kemp and Vice President George Bush, for their records
and unwillingness to respond to questionnaires about their
environmental views.
   ``Kemp's record has gotten markedly worse in our last two
charts, and the 50 percent grade we gave Bush is probably better
than some of his recent statements might suggest,'' Blackwelder
said.

<TEXT>
   A psychiatrist may be barred from conducting
federally sanctioned drug testing because of alleged inaccuracies
he published regarding an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's
disease.
   Dr. William K. Summers of Arcadia, Calif., received the warning
last month in a letter from the Food and Drug Administration that
involved his account of preliminary studies on
tetrahydroaminocrydine, or THA, for combating the degenerative
mental illness.
   After the New England Journal of Medicine published Summers'
paper in November 1986, a public outcry arose for wider testing of
the drug, which Summers said was very promising.
   The FDA subsequently approved such broader testing, only to
suspend it late last year because of an unanticipated number of
side effects. The test procedures were redrawn and clinical trials
allowed to resume last month.
   Summers submitted his findings on the Alzheimer's drug to the
FDA five days after their publication in the New England journal.
   The FDA letter to Summers noted that the journal article was
submitted as part of his official report to the FDA and said
``there are numerous statements in your NEJM article that appear to
be false.''
   ``We believe that you have repeatedly or deliberately violated
regulations pertaining to the proper conduct of clinical testing of
investigational drugs,'' said the letter from Dr. Frances O.
Kelsey, director of an FDA division that oversees compliance with
agency research procedures. It said he may be barred from
performing sanctioned tests in the future.
   The letter asked Summers to explain 14 specific instances where
the FDA found evidence of misinformation. It said those ``are not a
comprehensive compilation of findings, but represent the more
significant regulatory violations that remain unexplained.''
   One of the 14 charges said Summers failed to report that eight
patients in his study also were taking other drugs that could
affect mental functioning, along with THA.
   Another said he failed to report that 10 of the 12 patients in
one phase of his study lived more than 2,000 miles from his office
and ``that medical monitoring was erratic and conducted mainly
through telephone contacts and letters with either family members
who had a variety of perceptions or local physicians who, you
concede, often did not follow your research protocol.''
   A third charge questioned what the FDA said is Summers'
subsequent acknowledgement that some of the study statistics he
submitted were reconstructed from memory.
   ``It does not seem plausible that you precisely remembered
multiple observations of the entire patient population without a
written record,'' the agency said.
   Summers relayed word through his answering service Friday that
he was not accepting telephone inquires about the subject. He has
several informal and formal procedures available to him to defend
his testing practices to the FDA.
   The FDA letter was disclosed initially in a story in Friday's
New York Times.
   The FDA has not released the letter, but The Associated Press
obtained a copy from another government source. That source, who
asked to remain anonymous, said Summers has replied in writing to
the FDA but declined to release a copy of the response.

   Paul Gillmor, president of the Ohio
Senate, announced his candidacy for Congress on Friday and
suggested that his Republican opponents withdraw to avoid a
divisive 5th District primary.
   Gillmor, 49, who earlier was considered a likely candidate for
governor in 1990, decided to enter the race after veteran
Republican Rep. Delbert Latta announced his retirement late last
month.
   Latta, 67, who has served the sprawling, 12-county district in
northwestern Ohio since 1957, has said that he will support his
son, Robert, a 32-year-old Bowling Green attorney who also has
announced for the nomination.
   Gillmore told about a dozen supporters here that the best way to
avoid a bruising primary fight would be ``for the candidate who has
the least experience, and who is not as well qualified as the other
candidate, to drop out.
   ``I don't expect that to happen,'' he added.
   Fremont businessman Rex Damschroder, son of former state Rep.
Gene Damschroder, also has filed nominating petitions as a
Republican. So far, no Democrat has filed petitions in advance of
the Feb. 18 deadline.

   A convicted IRA bomber serving a life
sentence married his American sweetheart Friday in a simple
ceremony in the prison chapel.
   Paul Hill, 33, has been imprisoned for 14 years for bombings
that killed seven people in England and injured 85. He says he is
innocent and is hoping his conviction will be overturned by a new
police inquiry.
   Hill was allowed to chat briefly with his bride, Marion
Severelli of New Jersey, after the short ceremony conducted by a
Roman Catholic chaplain at Long Lartin Jail, 110 miles northwest of
London.
   He was then returned to his cell. But he was allowed to
celebrate with his bride and about 15 guests at a brief reception
later during which the couple cut a wedding cake.
   A prison spokesman said no alcohol was served and the couple
remained under the watchful eye of prison officers.
   Ms. Severelli, a buyer for a paper mill, first wrote to Hill
three years ago with news that a friend of his had died. After a
year of writing, she flew to Britain to meet him.
   ``When I first saw him, he was just about everything I thought
he would be _gentle and feeling,'' she said. ``He is not at all
cynical even though he is not guilty and has been locked up for
almost 14 years.''
   Ms. Severelli said she is convinced her husband is innocent and
hopes he will be able to join her in the United States if he is
ever released.
   She did not give her age or hometown and the information was not
immediately available from prison officials.
   Bombs exploded in October 1974 in two pubs in the town of
Guildford near London, killing four soldiers and a civilian and
injuring about 50 other people. The following month, a bomb blew up
in a pub in the London district of Woolwich, killing two people and
injuring 35 others. All three pubs were frequented by military
personnel.
   Responsibility for the bombings was claimed by the Irish
Republican Army. The group is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   Hill was one of four people convicted of the pub bombings. The
so-called Guildford Four have always maintained their innocence.
   Last July, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd ordered a police inquiry
into the bombings after receiving statements from a delegation led
by Cardinal Basil Hume, head of the Roman Catholic Church in
England and Wales, that expressed concern about the verdicts.
   Ms. Severelli said she and her husband had discussed the
possibility that he might spend the rest of his life in jail, but
they decided last spring to get married anyway.
   ``I don't know if he will get justice in a British court. But I
believe that good will triumph,'' she was quoted as telling The
Guardian newspaper on Friday.
   Ms. Severelli has been staying at the Evesham Prison Visitor
Center to meet the residential qualification for the wedding. She
is expected to return to the United States next week.

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Friday it had begun a special review of the insecticide dichlorvos,
which is used in fly-killing pest strips and many other
applications.
   The agency said studies on laboratory animals show the chemical
may cause cancer and liver damage.
   Some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800
products every year. About 25 percent is used on farm crops, 35
percent on livestock, 25 percent in commercial and industrial
buildings and on lawns and ornamental crops, and 15 percent in
homes and on pets, EPA said.
   Dichlorvos has been used since 1948 against flies, mosquitoes,
gnats, cockroaches and other insects.
   Last Septmeber, the agency ordered new label warnings and
restrictions on commercial use of most products to state-certified
applicators, but did not restrict home and pet products. Workers
are supposed to keep out of commercial and agricultural areas for
48 hours after treatment.
   EPA's special reviews can lead to fewer or more restrictions, a
ban on the product or its exoneration. The agency tries to complete
the reviews in 12 months to 15 months.

<HEAD>Angola Rejects South African Proposal for Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola has rejected a South African
proposal for a regional peace conference that would include Angolan
rebels, Angola's official ANGOP news agency reported Friday.
   It quoted a government statement as saying Angola was prepared
to hold direct peace talks with South Africa if that country
rejected the United States as a mediator.
   But the Marxist government rejected any negotiations that would
include rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), according to the report monitored in Lisbon.
   It quoted the statement as saying, ``The reference to the
participation of UNITA removes all credibility from the South
African government's proposal.''
   It also claimed the proposal was a maneuver aimed at gaining
time to increase South African military pressure on government
forces in southern Angola.
   President P.W. Botha of South Africa said last month he was
willing to participate in a regional meeting to resolve conflicts
in southern Africa and that UNITA should be represented.
   Botha has not specifically proposed a peace conference or put
forward any concrete suggestions.
   Anti-communist UNITA guerrillas have been battling the
government since the Marxists gained power following Angola's
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The rebels are backed by South Africa and receive aid from the
United States. An estimated 40,000 Cuban military personnel and
Soviet advisers are helping the government forces.
   South African troops have made frequent incursions into southern
Angola from neighboring South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Angola, in its statement that rejected any talks with UNITA,
said it would be ``coherent and logical'' to include in a regional
conference the South-West African People's Organization (SWAPO) and
the African National Congress.
   The African National Congress is the main rebel movement
fighting South Africa's white-led government and SWAPO is a black
guerrilla group fighting for independence for Namibia, which is
administered by South Africa.
   ANGOP quoted the Angolan statement as saying the main causes of
confict in the region are South Africa's ``illegal occupation'' of
Namibia, South African attacks against its black-ruled neighbors
and its alleged creation of armed groups to carry out ``terrorist
activities'' in those countrie, and the denial of political rights
to the black majority in South Africa.
   Later Friday, the Angolan Embassy in Lisbon issued a statement
denying reports published in Portugal that representatives of the
Angolan government and UNITA would hold peace talks this summer in
Lisbon.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Parliament gave unanimous approval
Friday to Prime Minister Martial Celestin's 14-member Cabinet,
which includes a member of the former ruling junta as defense
minister.
   No one identified as a Duvalier supporter is in the Cabinet but
the new defense minister, Brig. Gen William Regala, is not popular.
Critics repeatedly demanded his resignation during the two years of
junta rule after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country
Feb. 7, 1986.
   Celestin kept the portfolio of justice minister. Gerard
Philippe-Auguste, a former presidential candidate, is minister of
agriculture.
   President Leslie Manigat and his prime minister appeared to be
trying through the Cabinet appointments to broaden popular support
for their government. Most of the members are known as liberals or
moderates.
   Manigat was declared the winner of the Jan. 17 election, which
was run by the junta, boycotted by the most popular presidential
candidates and ignored by most Haitians.
   Philippe-Auguste, an agronomist, was one of the four main
candidates Jan. 17. He and the other two who lost to Manigat
claimed the army rigged the vote in Manigat's favor.
   An election in November managed by an independent Electoral
Council was called off within hours because bands of thugs, often
joined by soldiers, killed at least 34 people and wounded 75.
   Among the other Cabinet members are:
   _Gerard Latortue, foreign affairs. Latortue, 54, spent 25 years
in exile during the three decades of Duvalier dictatorship and was
co-director of the U.N. Organization for Industrial Development in
Vienna.
   _Adrien Westerband, public health. He is director of the Haitian
Red Cross.
   _Emmanuel Fils Aime, education and sports. Fils Aime was
education minister for two months in 1985 and is the only new
Cabinet minister to have held a public position under Jean-Claude
or his father, Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier.
   _Alain Turnier, finance. He is an industrialist and writer in
his early 70s who was finance minister under Gen. Paul Magloire,
the president before the elder Duvalier gained power in 1957.
   _Yves Auguste, interior and decentralization. Auguste was
ambassador to the United Nations for the interim government.

   Four leaders of the leftist terrorist group Direct
Action were convicted of belonging to a criminal organization
Friday and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Jean-Marc Rouillan, Nathalie Menigon, Joelle Aubron and Georges
Cipriani, all on hunger strikes for the past 72 days, face trial
later on more serious charges, including murder.
   The two men and two women were brought to court in wheelchairs.
They are being held at Fresnes Prison's hospital in the Paris
suburbs.
   Fifteen other Direct Action members were tried with the leaders,
including one tried in absentia. Eleven were convicted of belonging
to a criminal organization and given penalties ranging from
suspended sentences to 10 years in prison.
   Two women were acquitted. A man and a woman were convicted on
the lesser charge of brigandage and were given 18-month suspended
sentences.
   Defendants had frequently interrupted the two-week trial with
shouts and demonstrations. The trial was concluded Jan. 21 in the
14th Correctional Chamber of the Tribunal of Paris.
   Direct Action surfaced in 1979, claiming responsibility for
bombings and attacks on public buildings which at first caused no
casualties.
   Later, Direct Action claimed responsibility for killing Gen.
Rene Audran, a French arms sales official, in 1985, and Georges
Besse, president of the state-owned Renault automobile company, in
1986.
   After a series of arrests last year, police said they believed
that all leaders of the group were in custody.

   Romania allowed a citizen employed as a U.N.
disarmament official to return to his job and family in Geneva on
Friday after keeping him in his communist homeland for more than
two years.
   Liviu Bota, who headed the U.N. Institute for Disarmament
Research in Geneva, said an ``error'' by Romanian authorities
prevented him from returning after he was summoned home in December
1985 for ``urgent consultations.''
   Speaking to reporters at the airport Friday night, he would not
speculate on why he was let go, but said: ``It was an error made at
some level and it's over now. I'm very happy to be back in Geneva.''
   He said pressure by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and others had helped.
   In New York, Mario Zamorano, a spokesman for Perez de Cuellar,
said: ``The secretary-general, on behalf of all the U.N. staff
members, is very pleased'' about Bota's return.
   Bota will retain a director-level post but his disarmament job
has been taken over by another official, U.N. spokeswoman Therese
Gastaut said.
   He was met by his wife Sandra and Jan Martenson, director of the
U.N. office in Geneva.
   Mrs. Bota has claimed Romanian authorities put her husband under
round-the-clock surveillance, following him with two cars and
tapping or periodically cutting off his telephone.
   Romanian officials played ``deaf and dumb,'' insisting that Bota
had no legal ties with the United Nations or that his U.N. contract
was not valid, she said in a written statement published in Geneva
last month.
   U.N. officials intensified efforts on Bota's behalf after his
wife took an overdose of tranquilizers and other pills in May 1986.
Perez de Cuellar made repeated demands for his release, and the
case also was on the U.S. human rights agenda.
   John C. Whitehead, deputy secretary of state, met with Bota last
week during a visit to Romania. State Department officials would
not say whether Whitehead had a role in the release.
   When he was called home Bota had been a U.N. official for 13
years, on loan from his government, and had headed the disarmament
institute since 1980.
   President Nicolae Ceausescu's government later told the United
Nations that Bota was resigning his disarmanent post, but U.N.
officials refused to accept the resignation unless it was submitted
in person.
   He was not allowed to do so and the Romanian government later
accused him of espionage.
   There have been other cases in which U.N. officials from the
Soviet bloc were detained during visits to their homelands and U.N.
intervention had no effect.
   One of the most publicized cases was that of Alicja Wesolowska,
a U.N. secretary in New York who was detained on a visit to Poland.
She was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1979 on charges of
spying for a NATO nation that was not identified.
   Percy Stultz, an East German employe of the Paris-based U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, was arrested in
March 1980 while visiting his country and convicted of
``anti-state'' activities.
   Both Ms. Wesolowska and Stultz eventually were freed from
prison, but both have been confined to their contries.

<HEAD>Dollar Jumps on Trade Report, Gold Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar soared in value Friday against most
major currencies around the world after the government reported
that the U.S. trade deficit shrank for the second consecutive month
in December.
   Gold prices rose. At Republic National Bank in New York, the
late bid for the precious metal was $445.50 a troy ounce, up $5
from Thursday.
   ``We've got the excitement at last,'' said James O'Neill, an
economist and currency analyst for Marine Midland Bank. ``Within 30
seconds that the trade numbers came out there was an immediate
adjustment (upward).''
   The Commerce Department said Friday that the nation's
merchandise trade shortfall shrank to $12.2 billion in December
from $13.2 billion in the previous month, as exports jumped 4.2
percent.
   The December gap was the smallest since a $11.9 billion deficit
in January 1987 and much lower than market analysts had predicted.
   The dollar had risen about two yen and it was up around two
cents against the British pound and the Swiss franc shortly after
the trade report was released, according to O'Neill.
   Later in the day, though, some profit-taking and a reluctancy to
hold dollar positions through the long Washington's Birthday
holiday weekend helped pushed the American currency off its highs,
traders said.
   ``Even though the numbers are good nobody wants to go home
sitting on dollars because all the old fears haven't dissipated,''
said O'Neill, ``those fears being that the trade deficit is still
too big and that the dollar may have to fall further to get rid of
it.''
   The dollar's protracted decline in value began more than two
years ago as a result of coordinated efforts by the United States
and its main trading partners to improve the U.S. trade picture and
avoid protectionist legislation. In in the past several weeks,
however, the dollar's value has been relatively stable.
   Gary Dorsch, senior money market analyst for LNS Financial Group
Inc., said the dollar also was helped Friday by a rise in interest
rates in the credit markets. He said dealers believe the Federal
Reserve won't move to push rates lower in order to prevent the
dollar from falling.
   Rising interest rates tend to support a currency because they
attract foreign investors eager to buy higher-yielding U.S.
securities.
   The dollar rose above 130 Japanese yen for the first time since
mid-December, trading at 131.15 yen in London from 129.95 earlier
in Tokyo, and up from 129.03 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday. Tokyo
markets were closed for a national holiday.
   Later, in New York, the dollar stood at 130.925 yen, up from
129.265 late Thursday.
   The British pound fell to $1.7401 from $1.7595 late Thursday in
London. Sterling fetched $1.74175, down from $1.76075 in New York
and the highest level since late November.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.7115 West German marks, up from
1.69085; 1.4087 Swiss francs, up from 1.3895; 1.26445 Canadian
dollars, unchanged; 5.7820 French francs, up from 5.7210; and
1,260.75 Italian lire, up from 1,248.20.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Thursday: 1.7123 West
German marks, up from 1.6885; 1.4065 Swiss francs, up from 1.3870;
5.7865 French francs, up from 5.7135; 1.9225 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.8961; 1.2624 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2663; and
1,260.75 Italian lire, up from 1,246.65.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $445.30 a troy ounce, up from $440.00 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in London, gold rose to a late bid price of $443 an
ounce from $441.50. In Zurich, gold gained $2.50 to $443.50 an
ounce.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $443.69 an ounce, down from
$443.93.
   Silver prices also moved higher. At the New York Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery traded at $6.370 a troy ounce, up from
$6.295 late Thursday. In London, gold closed at a late bid price of
$6.34 an ounce, compared with $6.31.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against EPA in Pesticide Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Agency hasn't proven it can
legally authorize the retail sale of small amounts of the pesticide
chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately take the anti-termite
chemical off the market, a federal judge said Friday.
   The agency's latest court filing does not satisfy federal law
which requires the EPA to determine that a pesticide will not
unreasonably harm the environment, said U.S. District Judge Louis
F. Oberdorfer.
   The EPA believes that chlordane causes cancer. To avoid a
protracted battle with 197 distributors, the agency has agreed to
let them sell chlordane already in stock. In return, the companies
are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the
pesticide.
   Oberdorfer, however, said the EPA had produced no evidence to
back its assertion that distribution of remaining stocks won't
cause undue harm.
   The lawyer representing the EPA, Steven Rogers, argued that
insisting on the use of the procedures in the law would in the end
mean less environmental protection in this case because
distributors could fight the revocation of their licenses and
continue selling chlordane products during what could become
protracted hearings.
   The judge asked the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides to submit a draft order declaring use of remaining
stocks of chlordane illegal, but he gave no indication of when he
might rule. The coalition and others have been seeking such an
order since October.
   It is unclear whether the order will make a difference. No one
knows how much chlordane distributors have, though the EPA says it
believes the amount is very small.
   The EPA concluded last year that excessive chlordane residues
can remain in a home even after proper application. Generally,
chlordane is injected under pressure into soil around the
foundation.
   The only manufacturer of chlordane, Velsicol Chemical Corp., and
the EPA agreed last August that Velsicol would no longer sell it
while the company tries to come up with an acceptable application
method.
   The company and the EPA later agreed to end use of Velsicol's
inventories, but the stocks of companies using chlordane in their
own products weren't covered by the agreement.
   After the hearing, Bob Perliss, an EPA lawyer working with
Rogers, said the companies had reported holding a total of about
1,700 pounds. This would be 1.6 percent of the amount in Velsicol's
hands in August, or a two-month supply at the then-prevalent usage
rates.

<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. delegation to a
review of the Helsinki accords accused Moscow and its allies Friday
of hampering progress on a final document by stalling on human
rights issues.
   ``What we see now is that things are beginning either to level
off or in some cases to go backward,'' Warren Zimmermann said at
the third follow-up Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
   ``Textual obligations are festooned with loopholes that deprive
them of all force,'' Zimmermann told a plenary meeting, referring
to Soviet bloc draft proposals. ``For example, freedom of religion
must be consistent with public safety, order, health and morals.
Other freedoms are limited by national legislation.''
   Zimmermann told a news conference that in the three weeks since
the meeting resumed after a Christmas break he noticed ``a very
serious effort'' by the East bloc to put off an agreement.
   ``I hope it's tactical and I hope that it will change,'' he said.
   Delegates from 35 countries, including the United States, Canada
and all European nations except Albania have been meeting in Vienna
since November 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 Helsinki
accords on military security, economic cooperation and humanitarian
issues.
   Zimmermann rejected Soviet bloc assertions that the West is
stressing humanitarian concerns at the expense of European
disarmament issues.
   ``We're not holding any element here hostage to any other
element,'' Zimmermann said.
   He also said the ``obstructionist'' approach of Soviet bloc
governments at the conference has been accompanied by
``disquieting'' signs of failure of those same governments to
observe Helsinki commitments at home.
   Zimmermann noted that a Soviet promise to release all
``religious prisoners'' in an amnesty last November was not kept
and the elimination of psychiatric abuse is still awaited ``despite
promises made as recently as yesterday.''
   He said he noticed similar human rights abuses in other bloc
countries, including Romania and Czechoslovakia.
   The concluding date of the conference has been postponed twice.
Before Christmas, diplomats set the deadline for Easter but some
Western dilopmats now say summer would be more realistic.
   The accords, or the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, include commitments
to honor human rights, individual freedoms, travel and other
exchanges among nations. The 35 signatory nations promised to honor
the covenant's provisions but the accords have no enforcement
mechanism.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A winter storm Friday stretched across the Midwest through New
England, dumping more than a foot of snow and unleashing strong
wind as schools, offices and roads were closed. At least 18 traffic
deaths were blamed on the storm.
   As much as 13 inches of snow were measured at Woodstock, N.Y.,
with up to a foot reported across the Catskills. Brattleboro, Vt.,
had 9 inches and up to a foot fell across Berkshire County in
Massachusetts. Up to a foot of snow fell on parts of Michigan and
Indiana.
   Wind gusting to 45 mph lashed Shaftsbury, Vt., piling up snow
drifts of three to six feet. Several power outages were reported
across Bennington County.
   In Connecticut, snow was heavy at times before changing to sleet
and freezing rain. Snowfall ranged from an inch along the coast to
11 inches across the northwest hills.
   Concord, N.H., had 6 inches of new snow in six hours and 13
total inches on the ground. The snow forced several presidential
candidates to cancel campaign appearances. New Hampshire had wind
gusting to 60 mph.
   Up to 2 feet of snow were expected overnight in Maine.
   Snow and rain made conditions slushy in New York City on Friday.
As much as 8 to 12 inches of snow fell over northwest New Jersey.
   Rainshowers were scattered from the coasts of Virginia and
Delaware into eastern North Carolina. Sleet and snow were reported
at National Airport in Washington, D.C. Snow was reported as far
south as central Mississippi and Alabama.
   The weather was mild across much of the nation west of the
Rockies. Temperatures were in the 40s and 50s across the Pacific
Northwest with 20s and 30s in the higher elevations.
   Temperatures rose into the 60s and 70s in Southern California
and the desert southwest.
   The nation's low Friday was 32 degrees below zero at Hibbing,
Minn., and Duluth, Minn., the city's record low for the date. Other
record lows included El Dorado, Ariz., with 11 degrees, Paducah,
Ky., with 2 degrees and St. Cloud, Minn., with 27 degrees below
zero.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 0
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 82 degress at Santee near San Diego.
   The forecast for Saturday called for widespread snow from the
upper Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes through New England. Snow

   Angry tenants and a banner reading ``Welcome You
Reptile'' greeted a landlord Friday when he reported to one of his
buildings to serve a 15-day sentence of house arrest for failing to
correct housing violations.
   Morris Gross, 77, who lives in a luxury high-rise in the
Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, will be confined to a
fifth-floor apartment in a building where tenants complain of bugs
and rodents, lack of heat and hot water, and leaky ceilings.
   His movements will be monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet
to make sure he serves his sentence.
   A judge convicted Gross of criminal and civil contempt in
December after the city Department of Housing Preservation and
Development brought action against him for failing to comply with a
court order to correct housing violations.
   He was fined $32,000 for the contempt conviction and $137,900 in
civil penalties. Judge Ira Harkavy gave him the option of spending
15 days under house arrest and putting the $137,900 toward the cost
of correcting the 420 violations at the 113-unit building in the
Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
   Asked why Gross chose house arrest, his attorney, Stanley
Kopilow, said Gross ``wanted to show to the judge and the community
that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press.''
   Gross made no comment to the group of angry tenants who shouted
at him when he walked into the lobby Friday morning. The landlord,
whose meals will be catered, will have a private security guard
with him in the apartment during his sentence.
   ``We ask for so many things and they don't do anything,'' said
tenant Errol Ramdeo.
   He said the door to the apartment where he lives with his
parents is off its hinges, bathroom tiles are falling off the wall
and their stove doesn't work.
   Joyce Stewart, president of the tenants' association, took a
group of reporters on a tour to show them some of the violations.
She pointed out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from
which ``water comes down like crazy.''
   Tenant Vivian Murray complained of flaking paint chips, which
she has discovered her 2{-year-old daughter eating.
   Lawrence Carelli, the housing agency attorney who handled the
case, said there were still 400 outstanding violations in the
building, some dating back five years.
   Building superintendent Sydney Pilgrim said Gross had spent $1
million to repair the building.
   ``We know Gross is not an angel. We know he should not have let
the building run down so far, but work is getting done,'' Pilgrim
said.
   Ms. Stewart charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on only
10 to 12 apartments. ``When you subtract that from 113 apartments,
you'll see the real McCoy,'' she said.

<HEAD>MIA Remains Transported Without Informing Widow Due To Oversight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy acknowledged late Friday that ``due
to an oversight,'' the remains of a Vietnam War victim had been
transported from Hawaii to California this week without informing
the man's widow.
   The Navy and Pentagon also said they could not explain why a
request by the widow to withhold public announcement of a military
laboratory's identification of the remains had not been honored.
   The widow, Erna McKinney of San Diego, Calif., said Thursday in
a telephone interview she had asked that the identification be
withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify
the military's forensic work.
   Last Tuesday, the Pentagon announced the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu had succeeded in identifying
six sets of remains repatriated to the United States from Vietnam.
   One of the six, the Pentagon said, had been identified as Navy
Lt. Clemie McKinney, an aviator who was lost over South Vietnam on
April 14, 1972. McKinney, who was 26, listed his home as Cleveland,
Ohio, at the time of his disappearance.
   ``I told them I didn't want them to release the identification
because I wasn't prepared to accept the finding; that I wanted a
second opinion,'' said Mrs. McKinney, who contacted reporters after
news stories about the Pentagon's announcement appeared.
   ``And then they did it anyway. And then they're bringing in the
remains and nobody told me.''
   The remains of McKinney and the other five MIAs were transported
from Hawaii to Travis Air Force Base, Calif., on Thursday.
   Since McKinney was a Navy officer, Navy officials were
responsible for dealing with his next-of-kin.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday that
Navy casualty assistance officers had earlier informed Mrs.
McKinney of the procedures that would be followed for transporting
the remains.
   ``Unfortunately, due to an oversight, the transportation
arrangements were not confirmed to her before the public
announcement,'' Schneider said after consulting with Navy officials.
   The spokesman said he did not know why Mrs. McKinney's request
to withhold public announcement of the identification was not
honored.
   ``All I can say is that we routinely abide by the family's
desires on that point,'' Schneider said. ``If we had been aware of
that request here (at the Pentagon), we would have made sure the
identification was not released publicly.
   ``Regretably, there were misunderstandings or misinterpretations
in this case and we're now working with the family to remedy those.
We will work very closely with the next-of-kin to satisfy their
preferences and desires.''
   Mrs. McKinney said she wanted to have the remains moved to
another forensic scientist in Colorado for detailed examination.
   ``I'm not trying not to accept their identification,'' she said.
``I'm just not ready to accept some of their evidence. And that's
why I didn't want their identification announced yet.''
   Although the work of the Army's laboratory has been verified for
the most part, there have been instances in which independent
scientists concluded the laboratory did not have sufficient
evidence to justify a finding of positive identification.

   President Reagan helped raise more than
$500,000 in political funds Friday at a gathering of Republican
high-rollers, demonstrating he is still a big drawing card for the
GOP.
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan were the featured
attraction at a reception at the Bel-Air mansion of
millionaire-businessman David Murdock.
   The affair behind the walls of Murdock's spacious estate was
closed to reporters. Among the dignitaries seen entering were Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who is up for re-election this year, and
California's Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.
   Before leaving the White House, the president was briefed by
Colin Powell, his national security adviser, about two U.S. Navy
warships being deliberately bumped by two Soviet warships in the
Black Sea.
   Sunny skies and warm temperatures greeted Reagan in Los Angeles,
in contrast to the fog and cold he left behind in Washington.
   More than 50 couples paid $10,000 each to sip champagne and have
their picture taken with Reagan and his wife Nancy during their
45-minute appearance.
   The fund-raiser was Reagan's only scheduled event in California.
On Saturday, he will fly to a Pacific resort of Mazatlan, Mexico,
for afternoon talks with President Miguel de la Madrid, then travel
to his mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., for a
four-night stay.
   Reagan's political director, Frank Donatelli, said that with
less than three weeks' notice, there was no trouble lining up
big-money contributors eager to mix with the president, who was
wounded by the Iran-Contra affair and has only 11 months left in
office.
   ``The president will always be able to be a good fund-raiser,''
Donatelli said.
   The money will go to the California Republican Party. Reagan
will hold another fund-raiser later this year to help the
re-election campaign of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., Donatelli said.
   He said California is ``one of our top targets this year.'' With
its late primary, the state could play a decisive role in the
Republican presidential race. With 47 electoral votes at stake, the
most of any state, it will be a major battlefield for the November
election.
   ``A strong, well-financed Republican Party will be a benefit to
whoever the nominee is,'' Donatelli said.
   Reagan, at a gathering of Republican conservatives Thursday
night, pledged to ``campaign vigorously for whoever our nominee
is.''
   Reporters were excluded from the fund-raiser at the home of
Murdock, who lives on the estate once owned by the late hotel
magnate Conrad Hilton.
   A real estate tycoon, Murdock also is chairman of the Los
Angeles-based Castle & Cooke Inc., which has revenues of more than
$1 billion and is best known for its subsidiary, Dole Food Co., the
pineapple and banana distributor.
   On Saturday, Reagan will meet with de la Madrid in Mazatlan, a
resort area troubled by drug-related violence.
   A senior administration official who briefed reporters in
advance of the Reagan-de la Madrid meeting said both Mexico and the
United States are critical of the other's handling of the drug
problem.
   ``The Mexican perception is that we are the world's largest
market for drugs _ cocaine, marijuana and heroin _ and that we are
not doing enough to reduce the consumption of dangerous drugs in
the United States,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he
not be identified.
   At the same time, he said, the administration believes Mexico is
making increasing, but still inadequate, efforts to fight drug
trafficking. ``The flow of drugs is increasing ... and, in our
view, the amount of the drug-related corruption is growing,'' he
said.

   Ireland's prime minister said after a
chilly meeting with Margaret Thatcher on Friday he was not satified
with the British attitude in a dispute over police conduct in
Northern Ireland.
   British officials said the 30-minute meeting between Prime
Minister Thatcher and Charles Haughey of Ireland was ``calm and
dignified,'' but an Irish statement said Haughey ``could not regard
the present response of the British government in the areas of
principal concern as satisfactory.''
   The statement said Haughey was still waiting for ``an adequate
response'' to Irish protests made at an inter-governmental meeting
Feb. 2.
   Friday's meeting was the first between the two leaders since
Britain acknowledged on Jan. 25 that there was evidence of a
coverup after police in the British province killed six unarmed
Roman Catholics in three separate incidents in 1982.
   Britain said there would be no prosecutions. There are fears the
affair could damage the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which is aimed at
bolstering the Catholic minority's confidence in British justice in
Northern Ireland.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher expressed her belief that the Anglo-Irish
Agreement must continue, as therein lies the future,'' a British
spokesman said after the meeting, referring to the 1985 pact giving
the Irish Republic a consultative role in Northern Ireland affairs.
He spoke on condition of anonymity following government practice.
   The killings of five Irish nationalist guerrillas and a
teen-ager prompted charges that police had a shoot-to-kill policy.
An investigation found no evidence of official shoot-to-kill
tactics, but said officers lied and tried to cover up their
practices.
   At Friday's meeting, Mrs. Thatcher said the decision not to
prosecute was not influenced by her administration, since it was
made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is not a member of
the government.
   It was endorsed and announced, however, by Solicitor-General Sir
Patrick Mayhew, a Cabinet member. He said prosecutions would not
promote ``national security'' or be in the ``public interest.''
   Mrs. Thatcher promised Haughey that Tom King, her minister for
Northern Ireland, would make a statement soon about the
``organizational implications'' of the affair, the British
spokesman said.
   This was interpreted as a suggestion that Britain is considering
changes in the Royal Ulster Constablulary, which draws most of its
personnel from the Protestant majority.
   King has said disciplinary action could be taken against
officers involved in the affair.
   Haughey and Mrs. Thatcher met during an emergency economic
summit of the 12-nation European Economic Community.

<HEAD>Top Terrier Paws Purchases With Checks From Own Bank Account</HEAD>

   Doc Whitehead is a yapping yuppie, a 14-month-old
lakeland terrier whose paw print carries purchasing power.
   His owners, Kenneth and Susan Whitehead, gave him his own bank
account, and the distinctive paw-print signature has paid for a
parking ticket and a custom-made dog tag.
   Doc got his picture in the London Standard newspaper on Friday,
along with a photo of one of his checks.
   The paper said Garrard, the crown jewelers in London, accepted
Doc's 5.75-pound ($10) check in payment for the dog tag.
   ``Normally we would not accept a check from a new client who is
a minor,'' the jeweler was quoted as telling the Whiteheads.
``However ... we are prepared to accept your personal guarantee of
Doc's creditworthiness.''
   Mrs. Whitehead was quoted as saying that Doc got account at the
Westminster Bank branch in Southall, west London, ``so he could buy
his own toys,'' but he had to pay a parking ticket while out
shopping.
   ``Doc was responsible for us parking where we did, so when we
got a ticket, he paid the penalty,'' she was quoted as saying.
``The check was initially sent back with a note saying there was no
signature, but when I pointed out that the paw print was the
signature, there was no problem.''

   Rep. Jack Kemp on Friday accused Pat
Robertson's rival GOP presidential campaign of ``deliberate
distortions,'' and won a standing ovation from conservatives when
he lectured the former television evangelist on the need to obey
the Ten Commandments.
   ``I can't insist that all candidates abide by Ronald Reagan's
11th commandment'' not to speak ill of another Republican, Kemp
said in an address to the Conservative Political Action Committee.
   ``But all of us should abide by the Ninth Commandment: Thou
shalt not bear false witness,'' he said to prolonged cheers.
   Robertson was scheduled to address the group immediately after
Kemp, but bad weather grounded his airplane in New Hampshire and
prevented his appearance.
   But his campaign issued a statement calling the congressman's
charges ``totally unfounded.'' Connie Snapp, an aide, said,
``Contrary to the charges, we have investigated and found that no
Robertson staff member was involved in the distribution of the
material in question.''
   In Merrimack, N.H., Robertson said: ``We didn't put out any of
this stuff he's talking about. ... It's ridiculous what he's
talking about.''
   Meantime, Robertson and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, staying at the
same hotel, met for 30 minutes Friday night. Asked whether they
were striking a deal, Dole said: ``We just had a nice, pleasant
chat and a cup of coffee. He feels good about his chances. I feel
good about mine.''
   When asked if he would want to inherit Robertson's supporters if
Robertson is defeated, Dole responded: ``I said we ought to put out
the melcome mat. These are good people. They're looking for a party
to join in many cases.''
   Kemp's demand that Robertson repudiate a television commercial
being aired by his campaign as well as fliers distributed in early
primary and caucus states reflected the stakes involved in the
early stages of the GOP presidential campaign. Kemp's bid to emerge
as a clear conservative alternative to Vice President George Bush
and Dole has been damaged by Robertson's surprising showing in the
Iowa caucuses and in other states, making next Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary a critical test.
   Thus, while Kemp said at a news conference that the Republicans
would be taking a ``step backward'' if they nominated either the
vice president or the Kansas senator, he saved his sharpest words
for Robertson.
   Kemp avoided leveling an accusation of dirty tricks personally
against Robertson, but said the former minister's campaign was
guilty of ``deliberate distortions.''
   ``I would like him to call off the flier and the ad,'' he said
following his speech. ``I would expect a response from Pat.''
   Kemp's anger was generated by printed material saying he was
soft on pornography and suggesting that a member of his family had
had an abortion. ``It's a lie,'' Mary Brunette, a Kemp aide, said
of the abortion suggestion. ``There is absolutely no truth in it
whatsoever.''
   Distributed to fundamentalist Christian voters in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Minnesota, the material purports to reproduce ratings
of the Republican candidates by the Biblical Scoreboard, which is
published by Biblical News Service.
   Jack Waldron, editor of the news service, said the material was
altered and he described it as ``a malicious, nasty, underhanded
attempt to smear men who are running for president and an obvious
affront and attack on Biblical News Service.''
   The New York congressman also complained about a Robertson
television commercial that cited a study by Washington Econometrics
Forecasting Services saying that Robertson had the best economic
proposal of all the contenders and Kemp had one that would bring on
a depression.
   The commercial cites a Wall Street Journal story on the
forecast, but Kemp said the newspaper's coverage amounted to
ridicule since it placed the report ``in a humor section.''
   In addition, the Journal printed an editorial on Feb. 5
denouncing the use of its story in the television commercial.
   Kemp, in his formal remarks, said he had welcomed Robertson's
followers into the ranks of the Republican Party.
   ``But the contribution ceases to be positive, the cause and
values that we represent are tarnished when such deliberate
distortions are permitted to persist,'' he said.

   Leftist guerrillas exploded dynamite under a
troop truck on a mountain highway Friday, killing 10 soldiers and
wounding 14, officials said.
   President Alan Garcia confirmed the attack by guerrillas
believed to belong to the Mao-inspired Shining Path organization,
which has been fighting for eight years to topple the government
and establish a Marxist state.
   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, later said
two of those killed were officers and several of the wounded were
badly hurt.
   In violence elsewhere Friday, a Marxist university professor
considered ideologically aligned to Shining Path was shot and
killed in Ayacucho, police said.
   Garcia told reporters in Lima the guerrillas set off dynamite
near the highland state capital of Huanuco as the troop truck
passed.
   ``The explosion nearly totally destroyed the vehicle,'' said
Marino Mesa, a correspondent for Radio Programas, Peru's leading
news station, in a live broadcast from Huanuco.
   Mesa said the attack occurred 15 miles outside of Huanuco, which
lies 185 miles east of Lima.
   The soldiers were en route to repair a bridge destroyed during
torrential rains on the eastern slopes of the Andes.
   Five hooded assailants killed Professor Rafael Alarcon, 47,
after locking two of his children, aged 13 and 15, in another
bedroom, police said.
   At the time of the pre-dawn attack, Alarcon's wife and four
other children were in Lima, 230 miles northwest of Ayacucho.
   Alarcon was a philosophy professor at the University of Huamanga
in Ayacucho, where he was known as a Marxist who reflected the
views of the Shining Path, police said.
   The assailants escaped. Police refused to speculate about their
identity and said an investigation was under way.
   The attack follows an upsurge of violence this week by rebels,
who shot and killed four policemen and the wife of one of the
officers, and five state telephone workers.
   The government says more than 10,000 people have died in the
Shining Path insurgency. Human rights groups say hundreds of the
dead were non-combatants caught in the crossfire between rebels and
government forces.

<TEXT>
   A state official is being asked to help serve the
elusive Walker Railey, a former Dallas minister, with a wrongful
death suit that accuses him of trying to choke his wife to death.
   Railey's mother-in-law, Billie Jo Nicolai filed an amended suit
Thursday asking the secretary of state to assist in notifying
Railey of the suit.
   Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey, 39, has been in a coma since she was
choked in the garage of the Railey's home last year. Police say
they have not identified her attacker, but Railey's attorney has
said his client is a suspect.
   Railey, former senior pastor at Dallas' First United Methodist
Church, is accused in the suit of trying to kill his wife by
strangling her with a cord. The suit asks for an unspecified amount
of money, medical care and damages.
   Railey moved to San Francisco late last year.
   ``We're still attempting to serve him (with notice of the suit)
personally, but we haven't been able to find him,'' said A.W.
Arnold II, Mrs. Nicolai's attorney.
   Arnold said he is making use of a Texas law that allows him to
appoint the secretary of state as the agent for serving the suit.
   The secretary of state's office is required by the ``Long Arm''
statute to serve Railey with the suit by certified or registered
mail, said Lorna Wassdorf, head of statutory filing for the office.
   ``We don't determine if the service is valid,'' Ms. Wassdorf
said Friday.

<TEXT>
   Three former police officers who pleaded guilty to
federal corruption, racketeering and cocaine trafficking charges
were each sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines.
   Armando Estrada, 28, Roman Rodriguez, 31, and Arturo De La Vega,
28, were among the original seven Miami police defendants whose
first trial ended in a hung jury last year.
   In all, more than 70 of the department's 1,033 officers have
been arrested, fired or suspended since the investigation of
corruption began three years ago.
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp told the three during the
sentencing hearing that they shamed their entire profession during
the sentencing hearing.
   ``When I was a boy I thought a police officer must be the
highest calling ... but young people today have the perception of a
police officer as one who is corrupt,'' he said.
   Miami Police Chief Clarence Dickson, however, said the officers
arrested do not reflect on the integrity of his department. ``The
majority of the men and women on the streets are honest, upstanding
cops.''
   A fourth defendant, Ricardo Aleman, who was convicted on
narcotics and tax counts last year, was given a delay in sentencing
until Feb. 26.

   They have no campaign posters, no
television ads, little money and virtually no chance of beating
Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in Sunday's presidential elections, but two
opposition candidates refuse to step aside.
   Luis Maria Vega of the Radical Liberal Party and Carlos Ferreira
Ibarra of the Liberal Party are bucking calls to boycott the
election and challenging Stroessner in his quest for an eighth
straight term.
   With the powerful infrastructure of the governing Colorado Party
at his disposal and the full support of the military, the
75-year-old president who took power in a military coup is almost
certain to be re-elected.
   In the last elections in 1983, he won 90.1 percent of the vote.
   Vega, 65, and Ferreira, 54, are hardly being taken seriously and
have been sharply criticized by other opposition leaders, who urged
voters to cast blank ballots as a protest against Stroessner.
   ``They know all too well that not even in their dreams will they
obtain the presidengues,'' Kiely said.

   The U.S. Embassy will provide
$25,000 to help victims of floods and mudslides that killed at
least 196 people and left more than 10,000 homeless in Rio de
Janeiro state, it was announced Friday.
   U.S. Consul-General Louis Schwartz will give a check for that
amount to Gov. Wellington Moreira Franco on Saturday, the
consulate's press office reported.
   It said the money is the total amount in the embassy's emergency
fund. Such funds are provided by the U.S. government to its
embassies around the world.
   In addition to the embassy fund, the United States has offered
to provide Brazil with emergency supplies.
   Most of the money is expected to go to Petropolis, a mountain
resort 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro city. Civil defense
officials said Friday that 12 days of rains caused flooding and
landslides that killed 163 people in Petropolis and left 3,947
people homeless.
   U.S. consular officials visited Petropolis to check on the
families of two U.S. citizens living there and found they were not
seriously affected, the press office said.
   Other countries that have offered Brazil aid supplies include
Britain, France, Italy and Nicaragua.

   Three Calvin College science
professors who taught evolution instead of the biblical version of
creation were sharply criticized in a report released Friday by
trustees of the private college.
   But the report, which followed a yearlong investigation by a
study committee, called for no sanctions against the professors and
concluded that their teachings fell within guidelines set by the
Christian Reformed Church for interpretation of the Bible.
   The report was ``very critical in a studied, careful, pastoral
way'' of the professors' writings and teachings, said the Rev.
Charles De Ridder, chairman of the board.
   It was supportive of the professors' concern for exploring
theories other than creationism, but De Ridder said the panel
``reminds the professors of the limitations that the guidelines
place upon the interpretation of the Bible.''
   The board said those guidelines allow the teachings of such
theories as evolution, but that they ``ought to be evaluated in
terms of the Christian faith,'' said Gordon Van Harn, provost of
the college.
   The study committee was formed in response to dozens of critical
letters about the professors from students, faculty, church members
and others, De Ridder said.
   The professors, Clarence Menninga and Davis Young of the geology
department and Howard Van Till of the physics department, who have
a combined 52 years at Calvin, did not attend the board's news
conference.
   However, Van Till said in a statement that he respected the
board for ``recognizing the need for academic freedom'' and that
the report contains both ``criticism and praise and speaks of both
caution and encouragement.''
   The committee ``urges me to refine my interpretative methods in
such a way that neither the `event character' nor the revelational
meaning of biblical history will be called into question,'' he said.
   The professors describe themselves as loyal, longtime members of
the 300,000-member, Grand Rapids-based Christian Reformed Church,
which owns Calvin.

   Alexander M. Haig Jr. ended his quixotic
quest for the presidency Friday, endorsing Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and
attacking Vice President George Bush as no more than a spectator in
Reagan administration councils.
   Asked his opinion of Bush's involvement in important
decision-making, the former secretary of state said Bush had merely
``been there, period.''
   More than 200 reporters and at least 30 television cameras were
in the room for Haig's announcement, by far the most coverage he
received at any time in his year-long campaign. He withdrew from
the race for the Republican presidential nomination at a news
conference on a day when a snowstorm played havoc with the
schedules of the remaining candidates.
   He opened by saying his assessment of the race had made it clear
that ``Al Haig will not be the 1988 Republican nominee.''
   Haig received less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa
precinct caucuses on Monday and was receiving only about 1 percent
support in polls of Republican voters in New Hampshire.
   He endorsed Dole as the candidate who ``embodies best my
understanding of the crucial challenges we face.''
   Dole appeared briefly at Haig's side to say the endorsement
``means a great deal to me personally'' and that the former NATO
commander had told him he wanted no role in a Dole administration.
   While free with his praise of Dole, Haig seemed to relish even
more his attacks on Bush.
   ``What have you got against George Bush?'' Haig was asked.
   ``Not a single thing in terms of George Bush,'' he replied.
``He's a friend, I've known him for 20 years.''
   But he went on to say that he had worked with both men for two
decades and ``from my point of view, Bob Dole is head and shoulders
above George Bush as a potential president.''
   ``Most important of all,'' he said, Dole exceeds Bush in ``the
demeanor, the internal strength, the ability to deal eyeball to
eyeball with those who do not share our values around the world.''
   Bush later phoned WKNE in Keene to boast that he won the
immediate endorsement of state Rep. Edward Bennett of Bridgewater,
one of Haig's three state co-chairman.
   Then on Manchester television, Bush said Bennett ``thinks that
I'm head and shoulders above Bob Dole.''
   Haig's greatest contribution to the Dole campaign may well have
come earlier, during televised debates when he pressed Bush on his
role in the Iran-Contra affair and asked him if he had been ``in
the cockpit or ... on an economy ride in the back of the plane'' as
vice president.
   When asked Friday about reports of Bush involvement with
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Haig said, ``I do
think there's been less than forthright discussion of this issue by
the vice president.''
   Haig withdrew four days before the New Hampshire primary, and
when asked about the timing he replied in a sentence typical of
what had become known during his public career as Haigspeak:
   ``It takes a bit of arrogance to be so ego-involved in a
campaign such as this that you want to take the few percentage
points that could be critical to another candidate to the political
graveyard.
   ``I'm not that way. I want to make a difference.''
   As a candidate, the 63-year-old retired general who had
announced last year he was ``throwing my helmet into the ring'' was
often openly critical of Reagan administration domestic and foreign
policies.
   Speaking with the authority of having been Reagan's first
secretary of state, Haig has criticized the president's approach in
the Persian Gulf and also has opposed the INF treaty to eliminate
medium-range missiles from Europe.
   On domestic issues, he has said the record federal budget
deficits of the Reagan years stemmed, in part, from the policies
pursued by the administration, making him the only candidate other
than Dole to lay some of the blame somewhere other than on Congress.
   In campaign appearances Haig was fond of saying he had served
under seven presidents and recalling his strong role as chief of
staff in the White House during the final months of Richard M.
Nixon's presidency.
   At a Republican dinner in Nashua Wednesday night he quipped,
``I'm the only one (of the GOP candidates) who's been president
before and I liked it.''

<HEAD>Ethiopia Calls Report Of Resettlement Killings `Unfounded'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government accused foreign
media Friday of a disinformation campaign and said a report that
Ethiopian troops killed at least 20 civilians at a drought relief
camp was ``unfounded.''
   ``Fanatics of one calling or another have in recent months tried
to disrupt the relief distribution efforts and their accomplices
continue to fabricate such unfounded allegations,'' said the Relief
and Rehabilitation Commission, the government agency responsible
for drought relief.
   ``This latest unfounded report is just another instance,'' the
commission said in a statement.
   Foreign relief sources in Ethiopia said Thursday that Ethiopian
troops opened fire on thousands of drought victims when civilians
resisted forced resettlement. Twenty people were killed and many
others wounded, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The sources said the shootings occurred Monday at the northern
town of Korem in Tigray Province, 525 miles north of the capital,
Addis Ababa.
   ``No one in his right mind can imagine that any responsible
person can commit such an atrocity against drought victims,'' the
commission said.
   The commission said it had stated repeatedly that the
resettlement program was voluntary.
   Tigray and its northern neighbor, Eritrea, are the hardest hit
by a drought that threatens more than 5 million Ethiopians with
starvation. Drought in the northern regions has been exacerbated by
a civil war in Eritrea.
   Ethiopia's Marxist government began the resettlement program in
November 1984 with a goal of moving 1.5 million people from the
overpopulated, drought-ravaged north to unused, fertile land in the
south and west.
   At least 600,000 people were resettled before the government
halted the program in February 1986 amid charges from the West that
people were being forced to move, sometimes at gunpoint. Critics
said the government's aim is to depopulate the north, which is home
to two rebel movements.
   Ethiopia resumed resettlement Nov. 25, promising the program
would be voluntary and humane.

<TEXT>
   Network polls released Friday showed Vice
President George Bush and Sen. Bob Dole neck-in-neck for New
Hampshire's Republican primary, with one poll putting Dole ahead
and the other giving Bush the edge.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll taken Thursday night showed
Bush with 32 percent to Dole's 26 percent. That was an increase
over the vice president's 33 percent to 29 percent edge in polling
Tuesday, the network said.
   But CBS News reported that its latest poll, taken Wednesday and
Thursday, gave the Kansas senator 32 percent to Bush's 29 percent.
The network said polling Tuesday and Wednesday had Bush on top, 35
percent to 27 percent.
   In both polls, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis maintained a
strong lead in the Democratic race. ABC reported he was the choice
of 36 percent while Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri had 19
percent and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois 17 percent.
   CBS had Dukakis at 39 percent, with Gephardt at 16 percent and
Simon 14 percent. All other Democratic candidates received less
than 10 percent.
   Among the other Republican candidates, ABC put Rep. Jack Kemp
and Pat Robertson at 12 percent each and former Delaware Gov. Pete
du Pont at 10 percent. CBS had Kemp at 12 percent, Robertson at 10
percent and Dupont at 7 percent.
   The CBS poll was based on interviews with 499 Republicans and
466 Democrats. The margine of error was 4 percentage points on the
GOP side and 5 percentage points on the Democratic said.
   The ABC-Washington Post poll interviewed 575 Democrats and 559
Republicans. The margin of error was 5 percentage points on both
sides.

<HEAD>Demonstrators Protest Nuclear Reactor Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 people demonstrated outside the
headquarters of an electric power company in southwestern Japan
Friday protesting a test at a nuclear power reactor.
   Some of the demonstrators had stayed overnight at the site after
attending a rally Thursday that police said drew 1,500 people.
   The protesters at the headquarters in Takamatsu of the Shikoku
Elecric Power Co. opposed an output test at the company's nuclear
reactor at Ikata that was conducted Friday.
   Takamatsu is 340 miles southwest of Tokyo and Ikata is 115 miles
southwest of Takamatsu.
   Sueaki Maekawa, a member of a local anti-nuclear group, said,
``The protest action was initiated by ordinary people, such as
housewives, who have no affiliation with big organizations. It is
really encouraging.''
   Police spokesman Yasunori Aya said about 300 police officers
were sent to the demonstration Friday to keep order. The protesters
were ``noisy but not violent'' and there were no arrests, he said.
   A Shikoku company official said that in the test, the reactor's
output was reduced by 50 percent over a period of three hours. The
official, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said
the test was made to collect data on rapid reactor output shifts
dealing with the fluctuating demand for power.
   Protesters said the test was similar to one conducted at the
Chernobyl nuclear power complex in the Soviet Union on April 26,
1986 that resulted in a fire and the world's worst nuclear
accident. The Soviets said at least 31 people perished from the
fire or radiation.
   The company official said the tests were different. He said the
Soviets tried to stop the turbine completely and the Japanese test
only involved a 50 percent cutback.
   He said the Soviets also disconnected safety devices at the
Chernobyl plant, while the devices at the Ikata reactor remained in
operation.
   The Kyodo News Service quoted Soichiro Ito, director-general of
Science and Technology Agency, as saying there was was no cause for
concern about the safety of the test.

   Bus drivers and mechanics overwhelmingly
approved a contract proposal Friday night to end an 11-day strike
that had left 90,000 daily riders without public transportation.
   The board that runs the Queen City Metro transit system also
approved the tentative agreement and hoped to restore bus service
by Sunday morning.
   ``Strikes are tough. ... I hope we can mend those fences,'' said
Robert Baker, president of the striking Local 627 of the
Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Negotiators concluded an all-night bargaining session Friday
morning by announcing they had reached a compromise agreement. The
three-year proposal gives the union greater job security and wage
increases of about 5 percent the first year and 4 percent each of
the two final years, Baker said.
   Baker said union leadership urged passage of the settlement,
which was approved at a union meeting by a 465-40 margin.
   The strike against the Queen City Metro transit agency began
Feb. 2 over wages and the company's proposal to use part-time
employees to supplement regular workers during peak transit hours.
The union, which represents about 750 bus drivers, mechanics and
clerks, strongly objected to part-time employees in the belief they
pose a threat to the jobs of full-time employees.
   A top-scale bus driver made $12.17 an hour, under the old
contract. Queen City Metro says drivers were making about $30,000 a
year when routine overtime was figured in.

   A group of 30 prominent intellectuals
appealed to communist authorities to respect the right of free
association, but the state-run PAP news agency called their
petition unnecessary.
   In a commentary on its English-language service released late
Thursday, PAP said the appeal's ``postulates seem to be somewhat
belated, like trying to pry open doors which are already open.''
   It said the signers ``do not take notice of ... very important
changes which have occurred and continue to occur in Poland's
socio-political life,'' including a relaxation of censorship to
allow public debates on ``practically all internal problems.''
   In December, the Polish United Workers (Communist) Party
approved a package of political reforms that includes a pledge to
ease curbs on forming independent associations.
   However, a new law on associations has not been passed yet, and
authorities have blocked efforts to form some independent groups
such as the Economic Society, a lobbying group favoring private
enterprise.
   The intellectuals' petition was submitted to Parliament on Feb.
1 and was made public this week.
   The appeal said it is ``impossible to start overcoming
(Poland's) crisis without real, and not only declarative, respect
for the citizens' right to free association.'' It said every
citizen should have the right to demand changes in the law without
being punished for doing so.
   The signers included 11 full members of the prestigious Polish
Academy of Science; Warsaw University rector Grzegorz Bialkowski;
former Solidarity economic adviser Ryszard Bugaj; and the Economic
Society's chairman, Aleksander Paszynski.

<TEXT>
   A British group said Friday it could not afford to
buy a secondhand Spitfire for a new World War II museum in France.
   More than 20,000 of the famous British fighters were built and
saw service from 1938-1954. The wartime cost of a Spitfire was
5,000 pounds _ then about $24,000.
   ``There aren't many Spitfires left and when the French asked us
to try to get one, we were told the cost would be 300,000 pounds
($522,000) or more. We couldn't face up to that,'' said Lt. Gen.
Sir Ian Harris.
   Haris' British support committee for the Memorial Museum of the
Battle of Normandy at Caen is now trying to raise the equivalent of
$87,000 to buy a secondhand Typhoon fighter-bomber.
   ``It's not a bad substitute,'' Harris said.
   Harris, 77, was the first British regimental commander to enter
Caen on July 9, 1944. He spoke at a news conference to announce his
committee's appeal for a total of $261,000 for the museum.
   The money will pay for British war relics ranging from a
Churchill tank to a miniature radio transmitter used by
intelligence agents landed before the invasion of France on June 6,
1944.
   ``It's somewhat disconcerting that while it was British troops
who first entered Caen, other countries whose forces were never in
the city are giving the museum substantially more importance and
support than we are,'' Harris said.
   He said that in the United States, for example, 300,000 members
of a Normandy Society plan to support the museum project.
   Troops from Germany and 11 allied countries fought in the 78-day
battle around Caen, and nearly 300,000 soldiers were killed.
   Caen, 115 miles west of Paris, suffered 10,000 civilian deaths.
   Caen Mayor Jean-Marie Girault flew to London for the news
conference at the Imperial War Museum.
   He said France is spending nearly $21 million on the museum that
will be opened on the June 6 anniversary.
   The nations involved in the battle have been invited to send
representatives for the opening, the mayor said.
   He said those countries were France, East and West Germany,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Poland and the United States.

   Vice President George Bush campaigned in a
snow-bound condominium complex Friday, telling reporters he didn't
believe his candidacy would be hurt by Alexander Haig's endorsement
of Sen. Bob Dole.
   Haig, who dropped out of the Republican race, called Dole ``head
and shoulders above'' Bush as a potential president.
   Bush phoned Leslie Doppler, WKNE news director in Keene, to
boast that he won the immediate endorsement of state Rep. Edward
Bennett of Bridgewater, one of Haig's three state co-chairman.
   Later on Manchester television, Bush said Bennett ``thinks that
I'm head and shoulders above Bob Dole.''
   ``I think we can pull it out here,'' Bush said as he continued
to compare the race to 1980 when Ronald Reagan lost Iowa and won
New Hampshire and the nomination.
   As Bush, his wife, and Gov. John Sununu, his state chairman,
holed up in the Clarion Somerset Hotel, his campaign staff
scrambled to find voters and photo and visual opportunities nearby.
   About an hour before dark, when at least a foot of snow had
accumulated, Bush declared that he ``had a touch of cabin fever,''
emerged with his Secret Service agents and staff, and led an
entourage of about 35 on an hour-long forced march through the
adjacent Somerset condominium project.
   At first Bush insisted he was headed for a shopping mall, until
his wife, Barbara, told him he knew the stores were closed by the
storm.
   Television crews, so bored during the day that they videotaped
each other in the near white-out outside the hotel, came to life
when two or three people braved the weather to shovel out their
cars.
   Bush and his staff tried to persuade condominium dwellers to let
them help shovel or rescue their cars from the snow but each
declined politely.
   Sununu, who tried to entice people to allow Bush to help shovel
with ``come meet the vice president, come meet the vice
president,'' offered the opinion that ``New Hampshire people are
independent.''
   And Bush concurred: ``Only in New Hampshire.'' The television
crews were reduced to aiming their cameras at Bush petting puppies
in the arms of their masters and mistresses.
   A snowplow driver finally allowed the vice president to get
behind the wheel of his machine, and Bush drove the snowplow about
10 yards down an already-cleared road.

<HEAD>Officials Say 47 People Killed in Aeroflot Accidents Last Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Accidents involving Aeroflot flights killed 47
people last year, officials said Friday.
   They also said the Soviet national airline made $3.3 billion and
transported 119 million passengers in 1987.
   Aeroflot, which claims to be the world's largest airline, is
notorious for its flight delays and poor service. Officials from
the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which operates the airline, said a
program was under way to improve Aeroflot's standards.
   ``We people engaged in civil aviation are not satisfied with the
safety and regularity (of flights) that now exist,'' said Boris E.
Panyukov, first deputy minister of civil aviation.
   However, airline officials said at a news conference that
Aeroflot's safety record compares favorably with that of major
Western carriers.
   Last year, 47 Aeroflot passengers and crew members were killed
in accidents, said Vladimir Y. Potemkin, deputy chief of flight
services.
   In the past, Soviet officials were reluctant to give details of
aviation accidents and casualties. But Aeroflot has said that
starting this year, fatality figures would be made public, a
measure clearly linked to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for
``glasnost,'' or greater openness on some issues.
   On Jan. 18, an Aeroflot jet missed the runway in the Caspian
port city of Krasnovodsk, flipped over and broke in two. Eleven
people were killed and 12 others injured.
   The official Tass news agency and the government newspaper
Izvestia reported the crash the same day, marking the first time a
fatal Soviet air accident was reported in the official media on the
day it occurred.
   Officials told reporters that Aeroflot plans to replace its
planes with newer models.
   Panyukov said Aeroflot will also lay off some of its 500,000
employees. He did not say how many.
   Aeroflot, responsible for all civil aviation in the Soviet
Union, has more than 15,000 airplanes and helicopters, he said.
   Aeroflot officials said the carrier made about 2 billion rubles
last year, the equivalent of about $3.3 billion.

   Five rare old navigation charts on vellum, the
oldest dating from about 1460, will be sold in London in April.
   Auctioneers Christie's said the charts were found recently ``in
Europe,'' after being hidden since the time of Napoleon's campaigns.
   The seller's name was not disclosed.
   Two documents are by a well-known family of chart makers, the
Teixeiras of Portugal, and date from 1587 and 1620.
   The oldest chart was made in Genoa about 1460 and depicts the
Mediterranean and mid-Atlantic.
   Another was by a Dutchman and based on a Portuguese model about
1600.
   The fifth is of the North Sea and the Baltic in 1588 by
Englishman Thomas Laton.
   The finely inked and colored charts, with flags, coats of arms
and even saints, show ports in Europe and Africa and later in the
Americas. They are expected to bring from $12,000 to $87,000 each
at the April 13 sale.
   ``For a long time before the French Revolution the charts were
owned by a Flemish family, the counts of Maldeghem, who were
burgomasters of Bruges (now in Belgium),'' said Sarah Soames of
Christie's books and manuscripts department.
   She said Laton worked in Danzig, now Gdansk, Poland, and was
probably connected with the Eastland Co. which traded English
woolen cloth for Polish grain.
   Independent art historian Huon Mallalieu said after examining
the charts: ``They are very rare things and would have been secret
in their time because they were the valuable working tools of
sailors. They show the prevailing winds and routes around the
world.''

   A former nurse's aide who is serving life
prison terms for 34 slayings was indicted Friday for the murders or
attempted murders of six more patients at Cincinnati's Drake
Memorial Hospital.
   Donald Harvey is expected to plead guilty to the indictments
next week when he is brought to Cincinnati from his Lucasville
state prison cell, assistant Hamilton County prosecutor Joseph
Deters said.
   Under a continuing plea-bargain agreement with prosecutors, the
new guilty pleas will not lengthen Harvey's current sentence of
three consecutive life terms in an Ohio prison, Deters said.
   Harvey, 35, of Middletown, Ohio, will be eligible for parole in
60 years, prosecutors have said.
   The Hamilton County grand jury indictment returned charges that
Harvey fatally poisoned two of the patients, killed another by
suffocation and poisoned the three patients who survived. Families
of the victims have been notified, Deters said.
   The indictment charges Harvey with three counts of aggravated
murder and three of attempted aggravated murder, alleging that the
crimes occurred between April and November 1986. The victims were
identified as patients at Drake, a Hamilton County-owned hospital
that provides long-term care and rehabilitative services. Harvey
was employed at Drake as a nurse's aide from February 1986 until
his April 1987 arrest.
   Authorities identified the three patients who were killed as
Nathaniel Watson, by suffocation, and poisoning victims Doris
Nalley and Henry Cody. The three who survived poisonings were
identified as Lawrence Bernsden, Willie Johnson and Anna Hood.
Officials declined to provide the patients' hometowns or ages.
   Harvey pleaded guilty last August to Ohio charges that he killed
25 people, including 21 Drake patients.
   Harvey knows of more murders, his lawyer, William Whalen Jr. of
Cincinnati, said Friday.
   ``We know there are more, but either they aren't establish-able
or Donald needs additional assistance with them,'' Whalen said.
   But Deters said he anticipates no further indictments against
Harvey. ``Hopefully, this is the end of his story,'' he said.
   Harvey is serving a concurrent Kentucky life sentence for the
deaths of nine patients at Marymount Hospital in London, Ky., when
he worked there from 1970 to 1971.

   Cuban officials boarded a U.S.-registered sailboat
Friday only hours after they released the vessel, which had been
fired upon and seized the day before, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman
said.
   The three people aboard the Tranquility radioed a Coast Guard
cutter out of New Orleans Friday evening that they were on their
way to Key West, according to Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson in
Miami.
   The 48-foot sailboat, fired upon and seized Thursday night, was
released Friday morning. It had sailed north-northwest some 25
miles when it was again stopped and boarded by Cuban officials,
Simpson said.
   They were again released and the three people, proceeded on
their way, he said.
   A passing merchant ship reported to the Coast Guard late
Thursday that shots were fired across the 48-foot Tranquility's bow
off Cayo Guajaba, on Cuba's northern coast, Simpson said.
   The Tranquility told the merchant ship by radio that it was then
taken in tow by the Cuban patrol boats. Reports from the State
Department showed the sailboat was released early Friday, Simpson
said.
   Crew members were two men and a woman whose names have not been
released, the spokesman said.
   ``The Cuban foreign ministry has stated that the Tranquility had
drifted into Cuban waters due to a lack of wind and was assisted
into the port of Nuevitas, and subsequently released,'' a State
Department statement said.
   The appearance of the Cuban patrol apparently frightened the
sailboaters into flight. The Cubans may have fired warning shots
because they didn't understand why their order to halt was
disobeyed, Simpson said.
   ``They couldn't communicate,'' he said. ``The merchant vessel
told our operations center that the people on Tranquility were
speaking only English and the Cubans were speaking only Spanish.
   ``We've never had a problem with the Cubans harassing pleasure
craft,'' Simpson said. ``At this point we don't even know why the
Cubans would want to shoot at this boat.''
   Meanwhile, Havana radio reported Friday that another
U.S.-registered boat, carrying 7,700 pounds of marijuana, had been
seized Feb. 6 in Cuban waters and its four crewmen taken into
custody.
   The Cuban Coast Guard captured the Mary near the Las Tunas
province area in northeastern Cuba, reported a Radio Rebelde
broadcast monitored here.
   The arrested crew members were identified as Puerto Rican-born
Ivan Lancharte Ramiro, and Cuban natives Lazaro Perez Garcia,
Inocente Hernandez Lores and Roberto Iglesias de Rojas.
   Radio Rebelde said Perez and Hernandez left the island illegally
in 1979 and that Iglesias left in 1980. All four were arrested and
detained and the marijuana was burned, the radio said. The report
did not specify whether the Cuban natives were U.S. citizens.
   Coast Guard officials said they had no knowledge of the incident.

   A military spokesman said Friday
the armed forces will investigate allegations that high-ranking
officers are involved in drug trafficking.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides told reporters, ``This situation
worries the High Command, and all of us.''
   ``We are going to investigate.''
   The New York Times published an article Friday saying senior
Honduran military officers and a drug dealer linked to Colombia's
Medellin Cartel are setting up a major narcotics smuggling
operation in this Central American country.
   The Times story quoted unidentified U.S. and Honduran officials.
   Asked about the allegations, Suarez said: ``We don't rule them
out because there are no means to refute them, nor is there proof
of guilt.''
   ``The armed forces call on the The New York Times to provide the
names of those Honduran officers involved in the alleged drug
trafficking, as well as the corresponding proof implicating
officers of our army,'' he said.
   ``With the proof in hand, we will move drastically against those
responsible ... and we will punish them with all the weight of the
law,'' said Suarez, the spokesman for the armed forces.
   The Times article identified Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros as a
principal figure in the alleged operation. Matta, a Honduran,
escaped from a Colombian jail in 1985 and is considered a key
dealer for Colombian cocaine barons. He lives in Tegucigalpa.
   Matta is wanted in the United States in connection with the 1985
murder in Mexico of Enrique Camarena Salazar, a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent. Honduran law does not allow
extradition of Honduran citizens.
   U.S. officials say the Medellin Cartel, named for the Colombian
city in which it is based, is responsible for more than 80 percent
of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Honduran Congressman Roberto Ramon Castillo said Friday the High
Command should report to Congress on possible drug trafficking
involving the army. The High Command consists of the only general
on active service and about 55 colonels and lieutenant colonels.
   Castillo called on President Jose Azcona Hoyo to investigate
Matta's activities. Azcona heads a civilian government but the
military wields great power.
   The congressman, from the opposition National Party, suggested
that representatives of the High Command be called before Congress
to testify.
   He said he would form part of a congressional commission that
will travel to the United States next week to discuss the
accusations with U.S. congressmen, senators and Reagan
administration officials.
   Radio and television stations and afternoon newspapers reported
the allegations in the Times article.

   Leaders of the European Economic
Community reached agreement early Saturday on agricultural
spending, ending nearly a year of deadlock, a spokesman for the
executive commission said.
   ``We have an agreement on a farm package. We are having a good
summit,'' European Commission spokesman Nico Wegter told reporters
at the end of the two-day meeting.
   The agreement came after significant concessions by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who had sought stringent
budgetary controls to end soaring farm spending.
   ``It has been a very tough European Council,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said early Saturday. ``But what is important is that for the first
time we have effective and legally binding controls on
expenditure.''
   The accord set production limits on the most expensive crops:
Grains and oilseeds and proteins, with penalty price cuts for
surpluses.
   It was the third summit attempt in eight months to solve the
financial crisis. The 12-nation EEC, or European Common Market, has
operated without a budget since December.
   Proposals endorsed by West Germany, current president of the
EEC, envisaged looser curbs on the community's farm spending than
Britain initially was willing to tolerate.
   The community agreement boosted by 80 percent over the next five
years regional aid to the four poorest members _ Spain, Portugal,
Greece and Ireland. The increase will bring regional aid to $16.25
billion by 1992, compared with a 50 percent rise favored by the
wealthier states inluding Britain, France and West Germany.
   West German spokesman Friedhelm Ost said his country's
chancellor, Helmut Kohl, did his best to change Mrs. Thatcher's
mind in private talks Friday evening.
   ``The chancellor made it clear ... we now have arrived at the
outer limits of what we can do,'' Ost told reporters.
   On the key issue of overall limits on farm spending, which
consumes two-thirds of the EEC's annual budget, the last-minute
compromise document called for a $34.4 billion maximum this year,
slightly higher than in 1987.
   That was consistent with British demands, compared with a $36.9
billion limit favored by West Germany and France.
   The compromise document also called for a 160-million metric ton
annual limit on cereal production _ the level wanted by West
Germany and France, compared with 155 million tons sought by
Britain.
   Every ton above the 155 million costs the EEC about $175 million
annually in export subsidies.
   As a sweetener to Britain and the Netherlands, the proposals
called for a 9 percent price cut spread over three years from 1989.
   On the other most expensive crops, oil seeds, the final proposal
called for price cuts and production quotas midway between British
and other demands.

   An airport restaurant employee who gave Mayor
Eugene Sawyer a $4.95 beef sandwich without charging him was fired
Friday for ``misappropriation of company funds.''
   ``Police officers at the airport get free coffee, sandwiches and
doughnuts,'' Michael Bueschel, 23, said after getting his pink
slip. ``I figured if Chicago police officers could get a free
sandwich, why couldn`t the mayor.''
   Bueschel said he was fired by management of Midway Airport
Restaurant Inc. when he reported to work Friday afternoon.
   He said the reason for his dismissal was listed as
``misappropriation of company funds.''
   Sawyer, upon hearing about Bueschel's firing, was not pleased,
said the mayor's press secretary, Monroe Anderson.
   ``He thought that they had carried policy to its extreme limit
and that if the young man didn't find a job, he'd find him a job or
give him a job himself because he didn't think the punishment fit
the crime,'' Anderson said.
   Bueschel said restaurant managers Guy Accetura and Michael
Oswald told him he was dismissed from the $5-an-hour job at the
Cafe Volare as a result of not charging Sawyer for a sandwich
Thursday.
   Oswald told The Associated Press he would have no comment. He
said Accetura wasn't at work late Friday. There was no home
telephone listing for Accetura in Chicago directory assistance.
   WLS-TV reported that restaurant managers thought they had to
fire Bueschel because other company employees had been dismissed
for giving food away and they feared that making an exception would
lead to a discrimination lawsuit.
   ``It's company policy not to give anything for free to friends
and such, but as far as the mayor is concerned, I thought this was
the way to take care of the guy,'' Bueschel said.
   Sawyer was at the airport on his way to a speaking engagement in
Alabama when he got his free meal from Bueschel, a six-month
employee of the cafe.
   A security officer for the mayor had ordered the sandwich, which
he then received with a note from Bueschel on the take-out box:
``Mr. Mayor, keep up the good work. Compliments of Cafe Volare.''
   Bueschel said the mayor then returned the favor with a handshake
and said, ``Thanks for the sandwich.''
   Bueschel is a sophomore at Richard J. Daley College, a school
named for the longtime mayor who died in office.
   Sawyer was appointed mayor by the City Council last year after
the death of Mayor Harold Washington.

<TEXT>
   President Oscar Arias, main author
of a Central American peace plan, urged Moscow Thursday to halt
arms shipments to insurgents in the region. He said Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's new image would be tested now.
   Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting the peace
accord signed last August by himself and the presidents of El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras.
   He said in a message broadcast nationwide on radio and
television: ``We must struggle, with the help of the whole world,
so that the shipment of arms to insurgents in the region stops.''
   Then he directed the call specifically at the Soviet Union. He
said the image being fostered by Soviet leader Gorbachev _ less
dogmatic and relatively tolerant _ would be put to the test in
Central America.
   ``He (Gorbachev) should cease all armed support, direct or
indirect by means of Cuba and Nicaragua, to insurgent forces.''
   Leftist guerrillas in El Salvador have been waging an 8-year-old
guerrilla war against the U.S.-backed government there. The
guerrillas reportedly receive some of their weapons from East bloc
supporters who channel the arms through Cuba and Nicaragua.
   The guerrillas deny the reports of outside military aid. They
say their arms are purchased on the international black market or
captured from government forces.
   ``Today there is a chance for peace like never before in Central
America,'' said Arias, ``an opportunity for democracy in Latin
America like never before. There is a last chance to defeat poverty
and to prevent misery, protected by dictatorships, from
perpetuating itself.''
   He expressed the hope that Nicaragua will move resolutely toward
making its society more democratic, and that peace talks between
combatants in both Nicaragua and El Salvador will resume and bear
fruit.
   ``It is they who must choose between war and peace,'' he said.
   Cease-fire negotiations between U.S.-backed Contra rebels and
representatives of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government are to
resume next week in Guatemala.
   Peace talks between the two sides in El Salvador have stalled.
The government says they will not be resumed until after
legislative and municipal elections March 20.
   The Arias accord demands cease-fires in Nicaragua, El Salvador
and Guatemala; greater freedom and democracy throughout Central
America; an end to outside aid to insurgent forces in the region,
and a halt to the use of any country's territory as a base for
attacks on another nation.

   A team of doctors Friday reattached a
man's left hand to his arm 2{ months after it was joined to blood
vessels in his abdomen for temporary preservation following an
accident.
   Twelve doctors and support staff spent 22{ hours in surgery on
Mike Thomas, a 31-year-old ironworker from Cleveland, Ala. He was
listed in serious condition.
   The accident in which Thomas lost his hand was a pulling and
tearing injury rather than a clean cut, making it difficult for
doctors to determine the extent of possible nerve damage. They also
were concerned about the potential for infection in the wound.
   Therefore, they decided to attach the hand to his abdomen to
preserve it for a future reattachment to his arm.
   ``The blood flow has been re-established but it might be weeks
or months before we can determine how much function he'll have,''
said Virginia Perrin of University Hospital's public relations
office.
   Thomas might be able to leave the hospital within two weeks,
although further surgery might be needed, she said.
   ```So far, so good' seems to be the attitude right now,'' Mrs.
Perrin said.
   Thomas lost the hand, wrist and a small part of his forearm when
he grabbed a cable to break a 70-foot fall from a girder while he
was working at a church Nov. 24.
   The cable wrapped around his forearm and pulled his hand off
about six inches above his wrist.
   The day after Thomas fell, plastic and reconstructive surgeons
attached the arteries, veins and skin of the hand to those of his
abdomen.
   Such a temporary attachment has been used twice, once
successfully, in Yugoslavia.
   ``To our knowledge, this is the first time a severed limb as
been kept this way'' in the United States, said Hank Black,
spokesman for the hospital.
   The surgeons' goal was to give Thomas a hand with enough
sensation to protect it from injury and to allow him the use of it
as a helping hand, one that is better in appearance than a false
one, Black said.

   Democratic presidential hopeful Richard
Gephardt said Friday that rival Paul Simon should withdraw negative
advertisements from television and radio or ``take off the bow tie
because he's just another politician as long as they're on.''
   Simon, battling with Gephardt for second place in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary Tuesday, on Thursday began airing ads
that highlight what he called ``inconsistencies'' in Gephardt's
record as a congressman from Missouri.
   After alluding to their intensifying dispute during a state
Democratic Party dinner at which both spoke, Gephardt said at an
impromptu news conference, ``Enough is enough on these negative
ads.''
   Gephardt said the spot ``impugns my character and my integrity
by saying, can you trust this man?
   ``I've never impugned Paul Simon's character. I've disagreed
with a lot of his crazy ideas .... but I have never once questioned
Paul Simon's motives or his integrity or whether he could be
trusted,'' Gephardt said.
   ``I asked Sen. Simon to take those ads off television. And if he
doesn't, he ought to take off the bow tie because he's just another
politician as long as they're on.''
   At an earlier appearance, Simon said he would be running
different ads starting this weekend, but not because Gephardt asked
him to.
   After the Democrats' dinner, Simon said he did not believe the
dispute with Gephardt was harmful.
   ``As long as it doesn't get too acrimonious, I think a healthy
comparison is good,'' Simon said.
   From Washington, Gephardt's campaign counsel said telegrams had
been sent to television stations in Boston, Manchester and
Portsmouth, Me., asking them to sell Gephardt time for response ads
to Simon.
   Bob Bauer said the stations have generally agreed to sell
Gephardt such time for the ad, which will begin running Saturday.
Bauer said he had not seen the ad.
   Simon's campaign has described the ads not as negative but as
simply comparing the candidates' records. But Gephardt said the
spots question his motives by suggesting his record shows he's not
trustworthy, and he added:
   ``I don't agree with Ronald Reagan's balanced budget amendment
that (Simon is) for. I don't agree with Ronald Reagan's line-item
veto that he's for. I don't agree with Ronald Reagan's sub-minimum
wage, which he's for. I don't agree with the Senate version of the
Gramm-Rudman bill, which Paul Simon voted for and supported, which
would have been the fulfillment of `Reaganomics.' ''
   ``I don't agree with his changing his position on an oil import
fee, changing his position on whether we should talk to the
(Palestine Liberation Organization), changing his position on the
balanced budget amendment.''
   Gephardt added, ``I've never questioned his motives. I think
he's trying to do what he thinks is right. That's what I try to
do.''
   ``So if we're going to get into this business of going back
through 8,000, 9,000 votes, it's fine. We can go through them all.
I'll stand with every vote I made.''
   Simon said he would not withdraw the ads aimed at Gephardt. ``We
may be changing ads, but we're not going to do it in response to
his request.''
   He said he had ``never claimed that there is complete
consistency in my record or anyone's record. But there is a
difference between absolute consistency, which no one has, and a
pattern of inconsistency. The positions that Dick Gephardt is
taking today in the campaign are appreciably inconsistent with his
positions in the past.''
   Simon sed he did vote against one balanced budget proposal
because it had ``unsound limitations.'' He said he voted against an
oil-import fee that lacked rebates for poor people and he flatly
denied that he changed his position on the PLO.
   As he did in his initial response Thursday to Simon's ads,
Gephardt acknowledged that he has changed some of his positions
over the years.
   ``Nobody's perfect. Things change, you make a vote, it didn't
turn out the way you thought,'' he said. ``But to say someone is
not to be trusted, or someone's motives are bad because you voted a
certain way on the B-1 bomber, is just ridiculous.''
   Gephardt and Simon have acknowledged they essentially are
fighting to place second in New Hampshire. At least for Simon, a
third-place finish could pose severe trouble for his campaign.
   Gephardt came to Concord after watching a sled-dog race in
Laconia in the middle of a fierce storm that dumped more than a
foot of snow on New Hampshire on Friday. He had to change into dry
clothes before the law-school speech, and he appeared before the
standing-room-only crowd in blue jeans and a plaid shirt.
   And, before his speech, Gephardt said: ``I don't take this
election for granted. You know when you're No. 2 and you're trying
to be No. 1, it's like Avis _ you've got to try harder. So I'm
trying harder.''
   Gephardt reiterated familiar themes in his speech, stressing the
need for an economic overhaul and painting himself as
anti-establishment while calling his opponents ``apostles of the
status quo.''

   Communist rebels killed three
police officers and a street vendor and wounded dozens of others in
a series of attacks late Friday in this central Philippine city,
police said.
   Police said the four people were killed when a dozen gunmen
aboard a jeep opened fire at police officers directing downtown
traffic in the city, about 350 miles south of Manila.
   The assailants hurled a grenade at pursuing officers, injuring
dozens of pedestrians, police said. Authorities said they believed
the attackers were communist rebels. None were captured.
   The rebel Jovito Plaza Brigade recently announced plans to
increase attacks in Cebu, the country's second largest city.
   Mayor Tommy Osmena described the attacks as ``shocking'' and
vowed to increase security in the city.
   Police said 25 people were taken into custody for questioning
and seven were given tests to determine if they recently fired
weapons. Results of the tests were unavailable and police said no
one had been charged.
   The 25 were rounded up at a movie theater which a young girl
told police she saw the gunmen enter. The theater was surrounded,
the film stopped and the patrons were led out one by one for
questioning.
   Soon after the shooting, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Cebu,
Cardinal Ricadrdo Vidal, made a rare broadcast statement in which
he denounced the attack as an ``act of savagery.''
   ``I appeal to those people of evil motives, please put a stop to
your savagery,'' the cardinal said. ``We are all chidlren of God.''
   Communist guerrillas have fought the Philippine government since
1969.

<HEAD>Army Ad Pulled from Magazine Because of Article on Gays, Editor
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army withdrew a full-page advertisement from
the February edition of Student Lawyer magazine because the issue
featured an article on homosexual law students, the magazine's
editor said Friday.
   The decision to pull the ad came shortly before a federal
appeals court on Wednesday overturned as unconstitutional the
Army's ban on homosexuals, editor Sarah Hoban said.
   ``It is very ironic; the timing couldn't be better,'' she said.
   The cover article in February's edition of the magazine, a
publication of the American Bar Association, is titled ``The Legal
Closet.'' The piece by Chicago free-lance writer Lynn Miller is an
examination of gay law students and contends that anti-gay fears
and prejudices are common in law schools and within many law
practices.
   In a note to readers, Ms. Hoban said the writer had encountered
many people who were afraid to discuss homosexuality. In the note,
she said an advertisement had been withdrawn from the issue, but
did not identify the advertiser as being the Army.
   Ms. Hoban told the Chicago Tribune on Friday that the advertiser
was the Army and the ad had been withdrawn by the Army's New
York-based advertising firm, Young & Rubicam.
   Ms. Hoban said she suspected that the Army might be bothered by
the article, so she had her advertising director contact Young &
Rubicam and tell the firm that the article would appear in the
February issue.
   Young & Rubicam then withdrew the ad.
   ``They didn't threaten us,'' she said. ``They just said they
wanted to pull it. It's their right, though I'm sorry they did it
just a week before we went into production for this issue.''
   Young & Rubicam could not be reached for comment by telephone
late Friday. Calls after business hours to the agency's Chicago and
New York offices went unanswered.
   Lt. Col. John Cullen, chief of public affairs for the Army
Recruiting Command at Fort Sheridan, Ill., said Young & Rubicam
consulted the Army before deciding to pull the ad.
   ``It's not their money, after all,'' said Cullen, who said the
agency had been told by Student Lawyer that the article contained
material uncomplimentary toward the military.
   ``The magazine initiated it, and we took the option,'' Cullen
said of the decision to pull the ad.
   Cullen said the Army intended to continue advertising in future
issues of Student Lawyer.

<HEAD>Robots Helped Put Italy's Fiat in Forefront of Auto World</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By PIERO VALSECCHI</BYLINE>

   Highly efficient and obedient, robots have
replaced workers who used to shout strike slogans and have helped
Fiat vault from financial gloom in the 1970s to a leadership role
in the world's auto industry.
   The task of turning a deficit-burdened company, faced with high
absenteeism and low productivity, into a vanguard, highly
profitable enterprise took nearly 10 years and required massive
annual investments of about $830 million.
   At one point, the Italian automaker turned to Col. Moammar
Gadhafi's Libya for money, but in a sign of financial health it
bought back Libya's minority share a decade later and avoided a
threat to defense contracts from the United States.
   The era of robotics took a heavy toll on the work force.
Employment at Fiat auto was cut by nearly half, to 72,000 workers
by the end of 1987, from 138,000 nine years earlier, according to
figures given by Italian trade unions to The Associated Press.
   By increasing automation, Fiat improved productivity and reduced
costs, ushering in a period of high profit that allowed the Agnelli
family, which controls the company, to expand its financial empire
into telecommunications, insurance, banking and retailing.
   Vittorio Ghidella, who became the managing director of Fiat's
auto division in 1978, and Cesare Romiti, who took over as managing
director of the Fiat group a year later, are unanimously considered
the architects of the group's impressive recovery.
   Given a free hand by Chairman Giovanni Agnelli, whose family has
been the controlling Fiat shareholder since his grandfather founded
the Turin-based company in 1899, Ghidella and Romiti set Fiat's
course through the end of this century after subduing the tough
opposition of the metalworkers union.
   Through temporary layoffs of 24,000 workers and the dismissal of
61 involved in acts of violence and sabotage inside the factories
during disruptive walkouts in 1979-80, Fiat regained ``control of
the plants and on production,'' Carlo Besuzzo, head of Fiat's work
planning, said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   A march by 40,000 foremen and white collar workers, supporting
Fiat's policy, helped end 35 days of strikes in 1980 and foiled a
possible occupation of the plants threatened by the most radical
groups of strikers, who were openly supported by the Communist
Party.
   During the most difficult years of labor tensions, worsened by a
drop in demand in the wake of the world oil crisis, Fiat was
burdened with unsold stocks of about 500,000 cars while absenteeism
ranged from 15 percent to 20 percent.
   Ironically, it was in large part the mounting opposition of
trade unions to the traditional and stressful assembly line work
that drove Fiat toward heavy investments in computers and robots.
   ``It was a dramatic but unavoidable choice,'' said Besuzzo.
``Fiat was the first (European) auto company to brave the risks of
heavy investment in automation. The result was a less expensive and
better product and, after some years, an impressive economic
improvement.''
   At present the Fiat group relies on 1,550 auto robots, or about
half the total robots in use in Italy, and Besuzzo says there is
more room for even more advanced automation in the Fiat plants.
   ``For sure we have a technological leadership over Japanese and
U.S. makers in flexible robotized lines, which can assemble parts
of different models. Robots in the spray painting division could
soon cover 60 percent of the production, up from 40 percent, while
the percentage of robotized work in assembling parts would rise to
25 from 3 percent,'' he said.
   Many of the robotic systems have been supplied by Fiat's factory
automation unit Comau, which has also sold systems to major
European and American auto makers, including Ford and General
Motors.
   The Tipo, the latest midsized model which is expected to boost
Fiat's ambitions of becoming Europe's No.1 automaker at the expense
of West Germany's Volkswagen, is being assembled in the factory at
Cassino, which is Europe's most automated.
   The model, unveiled Jan. 26, has a competitive price in
comparision with European models of the same class. It required the
most expensive investment for a Fiat model _ nearly $1.6 billion.
   However, investment in automation has produced highly successful
returns so far.
   Since the beginning of the decade, the Fiat group has nearly
doubled net income from one year to the next.

   The auto division achieved a turnaround in 1983 after more than
10 years in the red. It had piled up estimated debts and losses of
about $416 million by 1979. The auto sector accounts for 50 percent
of Fiat's revenue now. Industrial vehicles, tractors and
earth-moving machines bring the total to about 72 percent.
   The group boosted its net earnings to $522 million in 1984, to
$1.1 billion in 1985 and $1.8 billion in 1986.
   Fiat, which last year took over state-controlled Alfa Romeo to
increase its dominance in the Italian market, has a 61 percent
share of the domestic market of automobiles _ a higher percentage
than any other major European car manufacturer _ and a 14.3 percent
share in Europe.
   It holds a minor share of the U.S. market, as the bulk of its
production is made up of small-sized cars. However it has high
hopes for the Alfa Romeo models. The luxury 164 Alfa, Italy's most
expensive mass-produced sedan, will be marketed aggressively in the
United States while another Fiat subsidiary, the prestigious
Ferrari, has a healthy market for its sports cars overseas.
   In the face of growing automation and a modest increase of auto
demand in Europe, Besuzzo said Fiat's auto employment is not
expected to rise or decline through the '90s.
   Franco Lotito, secretary of the metalworkers division Unione
Italiana Lavoratori (UIL), one of the largest Italian trade unions,
agreed with Besuzzo's predictions.
   Lotito emphasized that the sharp cut in employment resulting
from robots at Fiat did not cause a dramatic social impact, thanks
to layoffs subsidized by a state fund, early retirements and
re-employment of some workers in state jobs.
   ``At the beginning we had nourished the illusion that automation
could co-exist with a high rate of employment,'' he added in an
interview. ``That proved wrong, yet we did not oppose technology in
the factories because we were aware it was the only possibility to
keep the auto industry competitive. Unions which opposed
automation, like in Britain, only caused the collapse of the
companies and massive dismissals.''
   The growing health of the group, and of the Agnelli dynasty, has
recently been worrying some Italian politicians.
   The Socialist Party, whose relations with Fiat became tense
following a bitter controversy over the candidate to head Telit _ a
joint telecommunications venture between Fiat and the state holding
copmpany IRI _ accused the Turin group and the Agnellis of
dominating Italian industry.
   Some politicians called for an anti-trust law on grounds that
industrial and financing holdings directly or indirectly controlled
by the Agnelli family have a market capitalization equal to 22.8
percent of the entire Italian stock market.
   Fiat's influence on the Italian news media also came under
questioning. Fiat owns the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa, has
effective control of the Rizzoli publishing house and Milan's
influential Corriere della Sera newspaper and has expressed some
interest of moving into commercial television.
   Giovanni Agnelli recently cooled down the controversy, noting
that Fiat revenue accounts for less than 4 percent of the gross
domestic product.
   ``The three major state-controlled holding companies together
account for 10 percent and this is not causing any worry,'' Agnelli
said.
   Agnelli is such a well-known public figure that he is often
referred to merely as ``L'avvocato,'' the title for a laywer in
Italy (he holds a law degree). He is always widely quoted, whether
it be on business or politics or Italy's most successful soccer
team, Juventus, which he owns.

<HEAD>Relief Agencies Take Risks Getting Food to Mozambique's Hungry</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SENA, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Getting food to hungry people caught in
Mozambique's guerrilla war has become more and more risky and
expensive for international relief agencies.
   Anti-government guerrillas, who have sabotaged rail lines and
roads, now have threatened to shoot down relief planes.
   The International Red Cross stopped flying to areas outside
provincial capitals last Christmas after receiving a threat from
the guerrillas.
   CARE International, which runs a famine relief food transport
program in cooperation with Mozambique's government, is now
operating airlifts to remote areas the Red Cross once served.
   ``But we don't know how long we can keep it up,'' said David
Neff, an American who is CARE's director in Mozambique.
   He said it costs eight times more to move food by air than by
truck, but 16 districts in four provinces can be supplied only by
plane. Six towns cannot be reached at all, he added, because of
sabotage to the rail and road routes or the heavy concentration of
the Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas fighting the
Marxist-led government.
   On a recent CARE flight that carried reporters to Sena, the main
highway could be seen below pitted with trenches and blocked by
tree branches. Tracks on the railroad line were torn up.
   The guerrillas have rocket-propelled grenade launchers, many of
captured from the army, ``but they can bring down a plane with a
pistol if they hit you right,'' said Mike Mispelaar, CARE's
international operations manager.
   The guerrillas have blown up the longest railroad bridge in
Africa, near Sena. They often carry away railroad tracks, set
explosives on the lines and have made road travel so dangerous that
85 percent of Western food aid doesn't move unless it can join an
army convoy.
   ``We can't count the cost of vehicles sitting idle, waiting for
convoys,'' said Neff.
   Most of the difficulty in getting grain from a seaport to a
hungry refugee in the drought-stricken bush is due to guerrilla
attacks on the transportation system.
   Until last year, the guerrillas kept one of the nation's primary
rail, road and oil pipeline routes, the Beira Corridor, inoperable
most of the time.
   But in 1987 Mozambique arranged for troops from neighboring
Zimbabwe to guard the corridor between Harare and Beira and help
defend the Indian Ocean port. The corridor is Zimbabwe's cheapest
route to the sea.
   Other neighbors also help: Soldiers from Malawi are stationed
along the Nampula-Nacala route in the northern part of Mozambique
where sabotage still occurs regularly; troops from Tanzania have
been assigned to guard recaptured towns, freeing Mozambican troops
to retake other vital targets.
   ``If you protect 10 percent of Mozambique you protect 90 percent
of the economy of the country,'' said Trade Minister Manuel Jorge
Aranda-Silva in an interview. ``You need only have the transport
system linked with that 10 percent. This is survival. It is not
growth.''
   Most of the Beira railroad track has been relaid with concrete
ties instead of timber ones, Canadian rails, and heavier ballast.
It is much harder to sabotage and an explosion is less likely to
derail a train.
   The Nampula-Nacala line, most useful for Malawian exports in the
north, still needs to be relaid, as does a line from Zimbabwe down
the Limpopo River to Maputo. It goes through arid regions where
security is difficult, and where the track is so flimsy a saboteur
can simply walk away with the rails.
   Moving donated food from overseas to nearly half of the
Mozambican population under such conditions requires constantly
shifting strategies, explained Mispelaar, who is from India.
   ``Immediately after you hear about a local highway blocking, you
move spare food up on available charters, get everything off the
roads in that area, move other shipments up by sea, reschedule
certain donations so they go to a different port,'' he said.
   ``When the bandits (rebels) came to know about a shipment and
attacked 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Chokwe, we couldn't move
the other trucks we had kept back on standby. Bags start piling up,
looting starts. You can tip the balance with the smallest mistake.''
   CARE, nevertheless, distributes more than 300 tons of food a day
to market places and refugee centers throughout the country.
   Planes unload bags of corn and rice on air strips. Women wearing
only wrapped skirts in the blazing sun trudge in single file for
hours, carrying the bags on their heads. They often are guarded by
soldiers.
   Some food is loaded onto tractors and taken over roads where
land mines are hidden. Other bags are carried by canoes to isolated
farming settlements.
   Food is a priority, so there are shortages of clothes, tools and
seeds.
   ``There are more people coming out of the bush to the
resettlement camps,'' said Mispelaar. ``They come with nothing but
if you can give them a few seeds, basic tools, some bamboo poles
and a little food, they start building, they start planting, they
are not totally dependent on handouts.''

<DATELINE>LEADVILLE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Past glories and future dreams of this
economically depressed mining town two miles up in the Rocky
Mountains are pinned to a bill now inching its way through Congress.
   The measure aims to bless the National Mining Hall of Fame and
Museum, now housed in the old Lake County junior high school here
in Leadville, with a federal charter.
   Such a charter brings no bucks but would qualify the museum for
inclusion on lists of national historical sites and maps and other
official documents _ and museum boosters believe that will lure
thousands of mining buffs.
   Tourist dollars are badly needed in Lake County where
unemployment stands at 22 percent, the highest in Colorado. The
state's average unemployment rate was 6.4 percent in October, the
last month tallied.
   Leadville is the highest town in North America and an historic
mother lode of legends and lore from the bygone silver and gold
rush days.
   ``We think having the hall of fame and mining museum will
provide a cornerstone for revitalizing Leadville,'' said state Rep.
Ken Chlouber. ``We may be one of the richest six cubic miles on
Earth because of our minerals, but we have to diversify.''
   Fifty-four mining museums are scattered around the country,
according to the industry. They range from one-room displays to the
new $1.1 million New Mexico Museum of Mining at Grants, which
spotlights uranium; the World Museum of Mining in Butte, Mont.,
which showcases copper; the American Mining Hall of Fame in Tucson,
Ariz., and an exhibition coal mine at Beckley, W.Va.
   But none claims a national designation, say backers who want The
National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum to become an educational
center for the entire industry.
   The museum, set up as a non-profit corporation, was chartered by
Colorado in 1977 and has members in 31 states. Industry giants such
as AMAX, Phelps Dodge Corp. and ASARCO support the idea, and many
mining executives serve on the board of trustees.
   Bills designating the Leadville site as the nation's official
mining museum were introduced in Congress a year ago.
   On Feb. 4, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved
one version and sent it to the full Senate with 40 co-sponsors.
   An identical resolution is stalled in the House with only half
the 218 co-sponsors required to move it through the legislative
process.
   Museum advocates are chomping at the bit, counting on the
federal charter to help them raise $1.5 million to construct
initial exhibits.
   For more than a century Leadville has been synonymous with
mining. In the 1800s, thousands of adventurers dug gold and silver,
found in the town's namesake veins of lead, from surrounding
mountains.
   Legendary characters such as gambler and gunfighter Doc
Holliday, suffragette Susan B. Anthony, the ``unsinkable'' Molly
Brown and English writer Oscar Wilde were attracted to the boom
town 100 miles west of Denver, then a nondescript little frontier
settlement.
   In this century, Leadville's sought-after metal was molybdenum,
used to strengthen steel. AMAX's Climax mine north of town, which
provided steady paychecks through two world wars and the Great
Depression, employed 3,200 people in 1981.
   But Leadville's mining collapsed in 1982 because of declining
steel-making and a world molybdenum glut. Climax now keeps just 48
men on a skeleton maintenance force.
   Town leaders, accustomed to Leadville's boom-bust history, at
first didn't believe large-scale commercial mining was finished.
But as Lake County's unemployment soared and For Sale signs
sprouted like weeds, committees were formed to plot economic
strategy.
   Leadville is 60 miles east of Aspen, 40 miles south of Vail, and
surrounded by some of the nation's most spectacular scenery,
including two of Colorado's highest peaks, Mount Elbert and Mount
Massive.
   One campaign that fizzled over time was ``Operation Bootstrap,''
aimed at coaxing more tourists to the town of 3,300 people, half
the county's population.
   The National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum was nothing but an
idea looking for a home when a search committee received
Leadville's application in 1986.
   ``We heard there was a national competition for the mining
museum, and this community went after it,'' said Chlouber. ``That
effort marked the first time everybody in this town really came
together and forgot about their little turf battles.
   ``Being out of work will do that to you,'' said Chlouber, a
former shift boss at the Climax mine but now unemployed except for
his legislative job, which pays just $11,500 a year. ``When we're
all unemployed we support each other.''
   To lure the museum, the school board offered the old junior high
and its 71,000 square feet of space for 50 cents rent a year. The
county donated parking and free utilities for two years. The town
offered office space, snow removal and improved traffic routing.
Colorado Mountain College volunteered to make promotional films,
supply audio-visual help for exhibits and lend its local campus for
mining seminars.
   ``We need this museum,'' said Carol Luoma, who owns the Golden
Burro Restaurant with her husband, Jack. Both lost their jobs when
the Climax mine closed. They gambled their life savings to buy the
cafe on Leadville's main street.
   ``We've got to all pull together to bring new businesses and
attractions here. This is a great place to live, full of wonderful
people, and I hate to see many of them leaving because there aren't
any jobs,'' said Mrs. Luoma. ``The museum can be our showpiece and
help make Leadville famous again.''
   Robert Reeder, the museum's executive director, said the
Victorian-style junior high building would eventually be converted
to house a library, geology hall, lecture auditorium and rooms
detailing the history of American mining. The Hall of Fame plans to
periodically pick a person who's made a major contribution to
mining.
   ``We want to show visitors there's virtually nothing you can
look at that mining doesn't have some impact on,'' said Reeder.
``Did you know 17 minerals go into making newsprint? That 14
minerals are needed to manufacture basic cosmetics?
   ``College enrollment in mining engineering is down in this
country from 4,000 students in 1977 to 616 this academic year,''
said Reeder. ``We want this museum and hall of fame to stimulate
people's awareness of how important this industry is, both its
past, its present, and its future.''

<HEAD>`Baby' Actors Enjoy Virtuous Roles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAUDIA COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern didn't mind
playing two squares in the comedy hymn to marital fidelity, ``She's
Having a Baby.'' In fact, they liked the movie's emphasis on
old-style morals.
   ``Old-fashioned is new-fashioned, let's face it,'' Bacon said.
   Director-writer John Hughes ``is basically an old-values type of
guy in all his movies,'' McGovern said. And his story of a young
couple, Jake and Kristy Briggs, is ``a tribute to suburbia'' and to
the virtue of commitment.
   Though the actors are young _ Bacon is 29, McGovern is 26 _ both
are examples of another old-fashioned virtue: hard work. They
recently talked about just how hard it was to bring out ``Baby.''
   One scene _ the Briggs' wedding _ was shot over 26 consecutive
hours. It was filmed in the Winnetka Congregational Church in
Illinois, which was available for only a limited time.
   Two versions of the scene were filmed: a straight-forward
account of the wedding, and Jake's hallucination about what his
wedding vows really mean.
   ``Wilt thou listen to endless conversations about children's
clothes and decorator checkbooks?'' the minister asks in the
fantasy version.
   The marathon session demanded a lot of Bacon. ``I actually fell
asleep on my feet,'' he said.
   Bacon, who previously appeared in ``Diner'' and ``Footloose,''
is on the screen in almost every frame of the film. In one scene,
Jake sits outside the church with his best man, who tries to tempt
him not to get married.
   The struggle, Bacon says, was to win the audience's sympathy,
despite the fact that his character is on the brink of jilting the
beautiful Kristy.
   ``I really wanted him to seem like a little boy in a monkey
suit, and that was difficult,'' Bacon said.
   McGovern's travails were more subtle. Her character, Kristy,
appears bland. But she's not, said the actress.
   Kristy is ``very strong, although she doesn't necessarily appear
on the surface to be strong,'' said McGovern, who first drew
attention in the industry with her portrayal of Timothy Hutton's
girlfriend in 1980 in the Academy Award-winning ``Ordinary
People.'' The next year, she had a supporting actress Oscar
nomination for her role in ``Ragtime.''
   ``She's a person you wouldn't ever think twice about,'' McGovern
said. But before the end of the movie, ``The door opens on her soul
and you see how much there is she has to offer.''
   Both actors lauded Hughes' direction. ``As strong and
independent as I come off on the set, I need a director who will
say, `OK, that's good, you got it,''' Bacon said. Hughes did that
for him.
   McGovern agreed. ``I always felt supported and I always knew
that he would guide me.''
   By the end of the filming, Hughes trusted Bacon to improvise.
One touching and funny result has Jake trying natural childbirth
methods _ massaging his abdomen and panting _ while Kristy gives
birth in another room.
   ``By that point I'd been playing this character so many times
and in so many different situations that I really felt that I knew
him and John knew him. ... And he just kind of said, `We'll turn
the camera on and you just hang out in the room and do what you
would do.''
   The tension Bacon has felt in front of the camera in other
movies didn't apply in this one, he said. ``John sort of blows all
that tension right out of the water,'' by letting the camera roll
during retakes instead of shouting, ``Action!'' or ``Cut!'' a lot.
   The atmosphere during filming was relaxed enough for Bacon to
bring along his dog, Jane, whom he calls ``a Labrador deceiver'' _
a mutt that's part Lab.
   Bacon and McGovern are both accomplished on the New York stage,
and are used to feeding on the energy of an audience. But in a way,
McGovern said, the director filled that function.
   ``When he was looking at me he would see Kristy, he wouldn't see
Elizabeth,'' she said.

<HEAD>French Philosophers Debate Heidegger's Nazi Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The normally staid community of French philosophers
is in an uproar over the Nazi past of Martin Heidegger, the late
West German whose philosophy had a wide following in France.
   Specialists have long known that Heidegger, whose classic
``Being and Time'' in 1927 influenced a whole generation of
existentialist philosophers, was once a member of the Nazi Party.
   It has not been clear just how deep his fascist sympathies ran,
or how his disciples contributed _ knowingly or unknowingly _ to
protecting his reputation.
   Heidegger, one of the ranking philosophers of the 20th century,
has been a particularly dominant figure in France, where his
writings helped shape the thought of Jean-Paul Sartre and other
thinkers.
   Twelve years after his death, his standing is now threatened by
the mushrooming controversy, which focuses on the question: Were
Heidegger's Nazi ties a matter of opportunism, self-preservation
and a weak character _ or a poisonous reflection of his lifelong
belief in the superiority of the German people, language and
culture?
   The book ``Heidegger and Nazism'' by Victor Farias, a Chilean
philosopher and former student of Heidegger at the University of
Freiburg in Germany, goes far beyond anything previously published
about the German thinker.
   Farias found documents indicating that Heidegger was a
card-carrying, dues-paying member of the Nazi Party until 1945, the
year World War II ended. He argues that Heidegger acted not out of
circumstance or opportunism, but out of a commitment to the
principles of National Socialism: elitism, discrimination and
anti-Semitism.
   He further maintains that Heidegger resigned as rector of the
University of Freiburg in 1934 not because official university
policy was pro-Nazi, but because it was too moderate. Farias says
others later became the official party ideologues at the university
only because Heidegger was considered too radical.
   While reaction to Farias' book has been loud and varied, French
philosophers are perhaps most troubled by the idea that Heidegger's
Nazi beliefs are the underpinnings of his thought.
   Francois Fedier, a devoted Heideggerian, called Ferias' book a
``shameless falsification'' and accused the author of ``tampering
with documents.''
   Heidegger ``was not a hero, but neither was he the partisan
activist and anti-Semitic denouncer of Jews who emerges from the
imaginary portrait painted by Victor Farias,'' Fedier wrote in the
latest issue of Debat, a philosophy journal.
   Fedier did not deny Heidegger's attraction to Nazism, but called
it merely a ``serious error in judgment. Heidegger did not see how
dangerous Hitler was. He let himself be fooled.''
   In two recently published books, the French deconstructionist
Jacques Derrida traced the links between Heideggerian thought and
Nazism. Critics praised the strength of Derrida's analysis, but
said he did not go far enough.
   ``One would have liked to see Derrida ... express his own moral
indignation,'' wrote Robert Maggiori in the newspaper Liberation.
``Why be so polite? Why does Heidegger's work, like a sword,
command its victim's respect?''
   Farias is less polite. He devotes a chapter to Heidegger's first
essay, written in 1910, which extols the virtues of Abraham a
Sancta Clara, a 17th century Viennese monk known for his virulent
anti-Semitism and xenophobia.
   ``Important people like Abraham a Sancta Clara should remain
alive in our hearts, working silently in the soul of the people,''
Heidegger wrote then. Heidegger discussed Sancta Clara again in
1964 and was no less laudatory.
   Heidegger's later work denounced dehumanization in modern
society. Yet, as Farias and others, including Maurice Blanchot and
Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, point out, he never denounced the
Holocaust or uttered a single word of sorrow or regret over the
death of millions of Jews.
   ``Heidegger's irreparable mistake was his silence on The
Extermination,'' Blanchot wrote in a letter published in Le Nouvel
Observateur, a French weekly.
   The controversy has also spread to Germany, where Farias is a
professor at the Free University of Berlin. His book appeared first
in Paris only after being rejected twice by West German publishers.
   The liberal weekly Die Zeit of Hamburg, in a recent article on
the furor, describes Heidegger as a ``scared opportunist,'' and
``not the hero type,'' but says he was not an anti-Semite and
questions whether he ``thought as a Nazi, acted as a Nazi,
philosophically justified the Nazi business.''
   The affair has had a much higher profile in Paris, perhaps
because Heidegger has not been as influential a figure in postwar
German thought as he has been in France.
   In 1934, Heidegger was photographed wearing a Nazi badge and was
quoted as saying, ``The Fuehrer himself and alone is the present
and future German reality.''
   For Lacoue-Labarthe, Heidegger's commitment to National
Socialism is ``absolutely coherent with his thinking.''
   In his recent book, ``The Fiction of Politics,'' Lacoue-Labarthe
quotes Heidegger as comparing agriculture, ``a motorized food
industry,'' to the ``fabrication of cadavers in the gas chambers
and extermination camps, the blockade of countries reduced to
famine and the building of hydrogen bombs.''
   Michel Deguy, a leftist philosopher also writing in Debat,
argued that Farias' disclosures have been common knowledge for
years. He called the book ``weak conceptually and analytically''
and said it gained attention only through the mass media.

   In days of economic tension, such as now, bad
news tends to land like a bomb, while good news is seen as a mere
respite not to be taken too seriously.
   This explains to some degree why the recent good news hasn't
caused any great commotion. The dollar, so unstable just weeks ago,
has settled down. Manufacturers are expanding. Exports are up. The
trade deficit has shrunk.
   But will it continue? That's the question.
   Today, therefore, was marked on calendars a long time ago as a
day to watch, it being the day on which the January U.S.
merchandise trade figures come out.
   It could be the day on which good news makes as much noise as
the bad. Another indication that America's trade deficit is
improving could convince some cynics that the economy really has
turned around.
   Suggestions of that turn have been dropped bit by bit over the
past few weeks and months, but they have been falling soft as
snowflakes rather than hard as bombs.
   U.S. manufacturing, for example, is out of the doldrums in which
it had been stranded for years. Production is rising; output per
manhour is up; quality seems to have improved; wage rates have been
stable.
   U.S. exports have been improving. The falling dollar was perhaps
the one most important factor in the turnaround, since it
automatically made American goods less expensive abroad while
putting pressure on imports.
   But the story is more involved than that. For several years
American producers have been refining their production techniques,
refitting plants, paring their payrolls and otherwise making
themselves fit for competition.
   In addition, the attitude of confrontation between labor and
management that for decades made battlegrounds of factories has, to
a very great degree, evolved into one of cooperation in pursuit of
shared goals.
   In addition, so gradually it has gone almost unnoticed, there is
also a greater awareness of exporting by even small companies that,
in the 1950s and 1960s, were content to restrict sales to the U.S.
domestic market.
   All this has been occurring without a great deal of bombast by
anyone. Day by day, the falling dollar got most of the attention,
but the falling dollar wouldn't have been of much help to exporters
if they weren't ready to export.
   The dollar got much of the attention because it posed dangers as
well as advantages. But now the dollar has stabilized at a lower
rate; the dangers inherent in its fluctuations are greatly reduced,
but the advantage remains.
   Since the beginning of the year, the exchange value of the
dollar has gained 6.6 percent relative to the Japanese yen, 8.4
percent against the West German mark and 6.9 percent against a
basket of 10 major foreign currencies.
   Until the dollar stopped falling, fears existed that foreigners
would sour on U.S. investments, call their money home and undermine
U.S. stocks, bonds and real estate. That threat now has been
greatly reduced.
   If at the same time the United States can continue to raise
exports and lower imports, the good news probably will get the
attention it merits, while crisis headlines become the dust of
history.

   The overall percentage is still tiny, just 4.7.
But that represents a big increase, of 33 percent, in the number of
black children attending private schools over a decade and a half.
Black enrollment in Catholic schools was even more remarkable,
growing from 4.8 percent in 1971 to 8.5 percent in 1985, according
to the National Association of Independent Schools. Two stories
report on such schools in Georgia and in Arkansas.

   Happy noises hum down the halls of the
Progressive Christian Academy and filter into the paneled office.
Principal Betty Tolbert stops her paperwork to listen attentively.
   A substantial, gray-haired woman, she seems frozen in her swivel
chair as she strains to catch the sounds coming from the
classrooms, a buzz of song, recitation and prayer.
   Relaxing after a moment, she nods approvingly. A smile melts the
concentration that had creased her forehead.
   ``Yes,'' she says. ``It's a good sound, the sound of children
learning.''
   A bell rings and the halls are filled with children. The girls
are immaculately dressed in green plaid jumpers and white blouses.
The boys wear green pants, white shirts and black ties.
   The children have something in common besides the uniforms: All
482 have dark skins.
   ``Welcome to the Progressive Christian Academy, the only
large-scale, all-black, private Christian school I know of,'' said
Mrs. Tolbert, the 53-year-old founder and driving force behind the
school. ``Our motto is `All things are possible within the Lord.' ''
   The non-profit academy is housed in a one-story brick building
atop a hill near downtown Macon. Until 1983, the building was a
public elementary school. Progressive Christian is leasing it with
an option to buy.
   ``You're looking at a miracle here,'' Mrs. Tolbert said proudly
as she walked down the hall, past photographs of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., Diana Ross and Bill Cosby. ``This place was a
total wreck when we moved in 18 months ago. Now we're a family.
We're also a vital education center that is serving the needs of
black children.''
   Mrs. Tolbert said she came to perceive those needs in the 18
years she was a public schoolteacher and principal.
   ``It was clear to me that the public school system wasn't
providing the moral guidance, the loving discipline and the
positive self-image reinforcement that many children need in order
to flourish,'' she said.
   In the summer of 1985, Betty Tolbert took the plunge with
$50,000 in savings and loans. She opened a trial summer school at
the Progressive Baptist Church, where her husband is pastor.
   ``We had 75 children and taught remedial reading and math with
an emphasis on Christian principles and the development of positive
self-esteem,'' she said. ``It was incredible. I began to see a
change in those children on a daily basis and so did their parents.
They kept telling me their kids were so excited about the school
that they didn't even have to get them up in the mornings.
   ``That fall I quit my job (as principal of an integrated public
magnet school) and opened this school, which goes from K4
(pre-kindergarten) through the eighth grade. We started with 175
students. By the summer of '86, we had 400 students enrolled and
had to move out of the church. Now, with 482 students and 38
employees, we've got cramped quarters once again.''
   The Progressive Christian Academy is one of four mostly black
private schools, including a tiny class run by Seventh-day
Adventists, in Bibb County. Some 5,000 of the county's 30,000
school-age children attend private schools, most of them white.
   ``Most of our children came to us from the public schools, where
many were doing poorly,'' she said. ``They were developing poor
self-images and their parents were afraid their children were going
to be lost.''
   Kendall Reid, a sixth-grader, feels he was one such student.
   ``I was a little mouse. I was so scared I just couldn't speak
up,'' he recalled of his three years in public school. ``I had a
white teacher in the first grade who told my parents I was
retarded. She and the kids used to make fun of me. Now I'm on the
honor roll, and I know I'm not retarded.''
   Other students said they had to work harder at Progressive
Christian and had fewer social and athletic activities yet still
preferred their private school to public classrooms.
   ``The kids here aren't as mad as they were in public school,''
said Latonya Raines, an eighth-grader. ``And the teachers really
seem to care about you here.''
   Bibb County Commissioner William Randall, who worked to
integrate the county's schools two decades ago, said he found the
present situation ironic.
   ``I've got two grandchildren in Mrs. Tolbert's school, including
a grandson who wasn't doing well in public school,'' Randall said.
``My grandson is doing much better now that he's in the private
school.''
   Mrs. Tolbert said her school, in addition to providing a
Christian atmosphere, gives the children positive role models.
   ``They get to see black people in charge,'' she said. ``We also
strive to instill in them the belief that everybody is somebody
special. We stress the worth of the individual.''
   She said her school also accommodates the students' special
needs and schedules.
   ``For one thing, she said, ``we're open from 6 a.m. until 6
p.m., which especially helps single parents. We provide a warm,
loving atmosphere, but we also stress academics and have volunteer
tutors for high-risk failures. Then, too, we supervise the homework
of those students who stay after school.''
   She said the parents pay $30 a week for one child and $50 for
two or more. They must provide books, uniforms and lunches for
their children.
   Several mothers, interviewed as a group, agreed they were
thrilled with the school even though tuition money is hard to spare.
   ``My little boy is happy now. There hasn't been a day he hasn't
gotten up and gotten himself ready for school. Morning can be an
especially tense time for a single parent, and I simply can't tell
you how much this means to me,'' said Natalie Coggins, a Social
Security claims examiner with two children at the school.
   Mrs. Tolbert said parents of eighth-graders want her to offer
high school classes so children won't have to return to public
school.
   ``I'm also getting requests from parents outside the area to
start a boarding school,'' she added. ``I'd like to do that, but
first we need to raise enough money to pay off our bills and
complete our library, which we need to do to be fully accredited.''
The school now has provisional accreditation and plans a library
fund-raising drive.
   ``I feel certain these things will all come in time. Meanwhile,
I must be doing something right. It's all I can do, when I go out
in the hall, not to get knocked down by all the hugs I get.''

   Wary of the turbulent public school
system and seeking the best possible academic environment for their
5-year-old son, Lawrence and Kim Dade enrolled the boy in private
school.
   The Dades were one of many families who last year chose private
schools over the Little Rock School District, which was beginning a
vast desegregation plan involving crosstown busing and the
reassignment of students and teachers to achieve racial balance.
   White flight has been a problem in the district for some time.
But the Dades are black.
   The Dades' son, Lawrence III, attends McGraw Learning Institute,
the only black private school in Little Rock.
   ``We wanted a positive, strong school, and basically a black
school that was strong in academics,'' Dade said. ``Before, we had
taken our son to other schools and they didn't seem to have the
care and, really, the motivation that it took. Because my son was
brought up in a more mixed environment, more whites than blacks, we
thought it was time to have the reverse, as well as have a good
academic background.''
   The McGraw school has built a reputation for academic excellence
since beginning as a preschool day-care facility in 1982.
   Patricia McGraw founded the school in a converted grocery store
near downtown soon after earning a doctorate in socio-linguistics
at Washington University in St. Louis.
   ``I thought it was a necessity,'' said Ms. McGraw, an English
professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. ``For about
20 years I've taught on the college level and it has been my
experience that many black students do not use the language well,
even after 12 years of schooling. They do not feel good about
themselves and generally ... most of them need something that has
been lacking in the school systems.''
   In the beginning, most of the pupils were the children of Ms.
McGraw's students at college.
   About 60 students, mostly children of business and professional
people, now attend the institute. More than half are preschoolers,
the rest in kindergarten through third grade.
   The institute is certified by the state to teach through sixth
grade and has a long waiting list.
   Students are taught basic reading, writing, mathematics,
geography, science, music and dance, and learn French as well as
English. Special emphasis also is placed on language development
and computer training.
   As important to most of the students' parents, Ms. McGraw said,
are the lessons their children are taught in cultural awareness and
social skills and the experience they get in being where blacks are
the majority.
   ``A very crucial and important part of our curricula is to be
sure that these young people have good feelings about themselves
and their people,'' Ms. McGraw said. ``Most often, we are told very
little about how we happened to be where we are. At this school ..
. we teach young people parts of African and Afro-American history
that can make them feel good about themselves. That, I know, they
don't get anywhere else.
   ``These little folk come from a people that has been greatly
neglected in this society, so they need some special kind of
emphasis to make them know that they are really something awfully
great,'' she said. ``I think that's what we give them.''
   The school is not for everyone, Ms. McGraw conceded. Many
families cannot afford the tuition and fees, which total about
$2,650 annually for the 12-month program.
   The school has several pupils of mixed race, and one white child
attends the after-school program. But its mostly black enrollment
and its emphasis on black culture have discouraged some black
parents, Ms. McGraw said.
   ``Many black parents ... have been conditioned to believe that
things cannot be good if they (their children) are not mixed with
white,'' she said.
   The small enrollment enables the school's five full-time and two
part-time teachers to give extra attention to individual students,
the one feature cited most by parents who enroll their children at
McGraw.
   Alma Stewart described her 5-year-old son, Curtis, as ``a slower
learner'' who has to be motivated.
   ``He needs to be pushed. Some teachers' classrooms (at public
schools) are overcrowded, and they don't take the time that they
need to take to push our kids,'' Mrs. Stewart said. ``That's my
reason for sending him here.''
   Shelly Wilkins-Robinson said her daughter was further advanced
academically than some other 4-year-olds but was not getting the
educational base she needed at another school.
   ``At McGraw, she's already reading and knows phonetics, numbers,
alphabets. The way the teachers here have worked with her, she
knows now that she can read almost anything.''
   Several students who got their early academic training at McGraw
have advanced rapidly in the public school system.
   One, 7-year-old Khiela Holmes, ranked in the top 1 percent in
the nation in mathemathics on a national standardized test she took
a year ago. On average, first-graders in the Little Rock district
ranked at the 57th percentile among first-graders nationwide who
took the Metropolitan Achievement Test in the 1986-87 school year,
accordiing to Sue Tadlock, a district evaluation and testing
specialist.
   Khiela completed kindergarten at 5{, had gone through the
first-grade math program within two months of her first year at
public school and was doing third-grade math work by the time she
reached second grade. She also excelled in reading, English and
science.
   ``Khiela started at McGraw at 2{ and stayed there through 5{. We
feel that a lot of her ability now is attributable to what McGraw
did,'' said her father, Tracy Holmes. ``All those years, she had
one-on-one attention, she excelled in all her studies and she
enjoyed what she was doing.
   ``That's the key,'' he said. ``They made her feel confident in
what she was doing. She felt good about herself.''
   A study by the Urban League of Arkansas concluded that black
students in the state have not achieved in school at a competitive
rate, and it questioned whether they receive adequate early
academic preparation in public schools.
   ``Without appropriate preparation during early school years, the
future academic achievement of black students is left to chance,''
it said.
   Charles M. Hodge, author of the study, said the McGraw school is
a good alternative, particularly for younger students, to public
schools, which he said are largely insensitive to the needs of
blacks.
   That the school is predominantly black and emphasizes black
culture is not inconsistent with desegregation efforts, said Hodge,
dean of the University of Central Arkansas College of Education.
   ``In fact, they're probably doing more in addressing the issues
of a multiracial society,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When former Congressman Jack Tanner arrives at a
scenic New Hampshire farm for a photo opportunity, the farmer
chides him _ ``Are you my 10:30? You're late!''
   All along the crowded New Hampshire campaign trail, Tanner,
played by Michael Murphy, is constantly bumping into the other
candidates _ Pat Robertson, Gary Hart, Bob Dole. They play
themselves.
   All make cameo appearances in the premiere episode of HBO's new
series ``Tanner '88: The Dark Horse,'' making its debut tonight,
just in time for the New Hampshire primary. The next episode will
be aired in March.
   The limited-run series is a collaboration between director
Robert Altman and cartoonist Garry Trudeau. They have created a
fictional presidential candidate, surrounded him with a loyal staff
and will follow his progress through the 1988 presidential campaign.
   At one point in the first episode, set in New Hampshire,
Tanner's campaign manager, T.J. Cavanaugh (Pamela Reed), complains
to the artsy filmmaker who produced the candidate's video
biography, ``Deke, if you use the term `neo-realism' one more time
...''
   Neo-realism is, in fact, the term that springs to mind when
describing the series, reminiscent of both ``Medium Cool,'' Haskell
Wexler's 1969 quasi-documentary on the 1968 Democratic Convention,
and ``The Candidate,'' Michael Ritchie's 1972 film starring Robert
Redford as a reluctant Mr. Clean drafted to run for the U.S. Senate.
   But ``Tanner'' is mostly a reflection of Altman, himself an
early innovator in ``neo-realism.'' His ``Nashville'' and ``The
Wedding'' broke new ground in filmmaking with improvised dialogue
and their unflinching examinations of American morality.
   Trudeau, of course, put politics on the funny pages with
``Doonesbury,'' and ``Tanner'' gives him a vast new forum for
political satire and commentary.
   Between the two of them, Altman and Trudeau have created a
searingly insightful dramatization that could shed more light on
the 1988 election process than any number of network commentators
and newspaper columnists.
   In episode one, Tanner and his staff arrive in New Hampshire to
find a state full of jaded, media-wise voters who cringe at the
thought of another candidacy, even though Tanner is good-looking,
likable, competent and well-intentioned.
   The premise of his candidacy is that since Joe Biden dropped out
of the race, Tanner has stepped in as the ``generational''
candidate, the only one among the lot, he says, who can say without
thinking which Beatle was his favorite.
   Tanner gave up his Michigan congressional seat in the 1970s,
because his daughter had cancer. He's now divorced. His daughter,
Alex, played by Cynthia Nixon, has long since recovered and is
helping with the campaign.
   Tanner did poorly in Iowa and arrived in New Hampshire with
barely enough momentum to rent a seedy motel room and buy a few
pizzas for volunteers. The only news media interest in him consists
of a lone Boston reporter doing a series of psychological profiles
of the candidates.
   When Tanner's campaign film is shown to a test group of voters,
they hoot at its undraped sentimentality. There's hope, though.
They react favorably to the candidate himself. It's when the film
seeks to manipulate them that they get turned off.
   ``It could be the process itself,'' says the media consultant.
``It's tedious. It's long. What they may be resisting is another
candidacy.''
   While the media consultant tries to figure out how to sell the
candidate, T.J. is contending with phone calls from Joe Kennedy who
apparently is trying to get her to help his own campaign. ``Don't
hang that on me,'' she says at one point in the one-sided
conversation. ``That was a victory party. I was drunk and that was
just a figure of speech.''
   After a depressing day of campaigning, Tanner returns exhausted
to the motel _ where a mystery woman is waiting for him _ and stops
by the campaign office.
   There the campaign filmmaker surreptitiously captures, in
red-hot cinema verite, Tanner's unrehearsed but eloquent tirade on
patriotism.
   The campaign's new slogan: ``Tanner _ For Real.'' On to Super
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Writer Dan Jenkins Tells Cinderella Story About Texas Bar Maid</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sportswriter Dan Jenkins popularized the
phrase ``dead- solid perfect'' to describe a well-struck golf shot,
and he wanted just that quality in the movie of his novel about a
Cinderella barmaid named Juanita.
   ``I like this one,'' Jenkins says of ``Baja Oklahoma,'' which
Home Box Office will premiere this Saturday. When Jenkins' pro
football novel ``Semi-Tough'' was made into a Burt Reynolds movie
in 1977, most of the book had disappeared.
   ``The adaptation of `Baja Oklahoma' is 500 times more faithful
than what happened to `Semi-Tough.' It was great having a producer
and director busting their chops to make it more faithful,''
Jenkins says.
   ``Baja Oklahoma,'' which is another way of saying Texas, tells
how Juanita Hutchins, who works in Herb's Bar & Grill, finds true
love with a guy named Slick and happiness as a country singer. Her
ticket to fame is her tune, ``Baja Oklahoma.'' Goodbye Pearl Beer
and chicken-fried steaks, hello Nashville.
   Lesley Ann Warren stars as Juanita, Peter Coyote as Slick,
Swoosie Kurtz as Juanita's friend Doris, Billy Vera as
singer-songwriter Lonnie and Anthony Zerbe as disc jockey Ol' Jeemy
Williams. Bobby Roth directed from a screenplay by Roth and Jenkins.
   In addition, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris and Bob Wills appear
as themselves. Alice Krige plays Patsy Cline. The movie was filmed
mostly on location in Texas, with more than 2,000 extras used in
the scenes filmed at Billy Bob's Texas, a huge honky tonk in Fort
Worth.
   Juanita's song of ``Baja Oklahoma'' was in the book, as was her
hero, Willie Nelson.
   ``Willie's an old friend,'' said Jenkins. ``I've known him for
20 years. I called him up and asked him if he'd write the music for
it. We went up to Lake Tahoe, where he was working, and he wrote
the music for two verses in 10 minutes. Willie says, `It ain't
``Stardust,'' but it ain't bad.'''
   Jenkins has lived in New York City for more than 25 years, but
looks and sounds like he just came in from his hometown of Fort
Worth, Texas. He still has a Texas drawl, he's tall and still has
most of his youthful slimness, but his hair is white and thinning
on top. With his cigarette, he could be a slightly over-the-hill
Marlboro Man. His wife, June, operates Mexican restaurants in Fort
Worth, New York and Florida named Juanita's after the heroine of
``Baja Oklahoma.''
   Jenkins spent 23 years as a senior writer at Sports Illustrated,
then left in 1984 to write a weekly syndicated column and columns
for Sports Digest and Playboy magazines. He's also written four
novels, ``Semi-Tough,'' ``Dead Solid Perfect,'' ``Baja Oklahoma,''
``Life Its Ownself'' and ``Limo,'' co-authored with Bud Shrake. A
fifth, tentatively titled ``Don't Write Me Nothing That Rhymes,'' a
period comedy about the newspaper business, is near completion.
   ``I write comedy romances,'' he said, adding with a grin: ``I
write novels to support my journalism habit. Journalism's my first
love. It keeps you alert. I love novels, but writing news is my
real love.''
   One of his three children, Sally Jenkins, is a sportswriter for
the Washington Post.
   ``Baja Oklahoma'' has been through several typewriters on its
way to becoming a movie. Frank Pierson wrote the first two
screenplays. Joan Tewkesbury wrote another version.
   ``Then I got a call from producer Marykay Powell asking me to
write the screenplay,'' Jenkins said. ``It was going to be a
theatrical picture with George Roy Hill directing and Shirley
MacLaine playing Juanita. It would have been a different movie,
more of a big comedy. Now it's more of a love story, but we keep
some of the comedy.
   ``Given all the compromises you have to make adapting a novel to
the screen, it was a good experience. It made me like Hollywood
again.''
   Jenkins believes he can finish his latest book in about another
month. ``It's set in the 1930s and '40s, so I've had to do a lot of
research,'' he said. ``I wanted everything to be accurate. If
somebody's talking about something in the news, I want it to be
right. It's got a lot of old radio stuff, too, and that's all
accurate. I'm a radio freak.''

<HEAD>Economic Outlook May Be Deteriorating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small-business survey released today indicates
inflation could become a worsening problem during 1988.
   The National Federation of Independent Business, which studies
responses from more than 2,000 member firms each quarter, said ``a
trend toward more frequent and larger price increases has become
quite evident.''
   While signs of economic deterioration weren't sharply defined in
the latest study, the inflation component jumped sharply, said
Professor William C. Dunkelberg, who interprets the findings.
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of business, said
27 percent of all companies in the survey said they plan to raise
prices, a 6 percentage point jump from the previous survey and the
highest level in several years.
   The sharp rise in price expectations among respondents is
considered significant for the economy as a whole, since the
small-business community produces about 50 percent of the nation's
gross private product.
   In spite of the negative implications of the inflation component
_ and despite expressions of doubt about the economy's future _ the
survey showed businesses plan to spend on equipment, inventory and
additional jobs.
   Such spending plans, said Dunkelberg, appear inconsistent with a
rise in negative opinions about future business conditions.
   Each year since 1985, he said, the percentage of companies
expecting a worsening of conditions rises, while the number
anticipating better markets shrinks. Simultaneously, those
declaring it to be a good time to expand fell to just 13 percent of
all companies, a four-year January low.
   ``Apparently, many believe the law of gravity applies to
economic statistics as well as to apples,'' he said, explaining
that the longer the recovery continues, the greater is the
percentage believing it will end.
   Negative and positive variations in the January report left the
small-business optimism index almost unchanged at 101.8 seasonally
adjusted, compared with 102.3 in the previous quarter.
   The index, which sets 1978 as its base, is made up of responses
to 10 questions, including expected business conditions, current
job openings, plans for capital outlays, expected credit
conditions, and changes in net earnings.
   The latest reading of the optimism index, which was begun in
late 1974, compares with an all-time high of 108.7 in January 1984,
and an all-time low of 81.1 in the second quarter of 1980. Except
for brief dips in the final quarters of 1985 and 1986, the index
has exceeded 100 in every survey since early 1983.
   Some highlights of the components include:
   _Employment _ Strongest hiring plans since 1978. Nineteen
percent of companies plan to increase employment in the next three
months, while 5 percent plan net reductions.
   Job openings reached a new high for the expansion, with 23
percent reporting unfilled positions. In New England, the
percentage was 42 percent.
   New hiring plans were strongest in manufacturing, with 28
percent planning increases and only 8 percent planning workforce
reductions.
   _Interest Rates _ Average interest rates paid by small companies
held at 11.1 percent in the fourth quarter of the year. Fifty
percent of all short-term loans were tied to the prime rate.
   _Prices _ There are indications, Dunkelberg said, that inflation
could be worse than generally anticipated. ``Based on plans to
raise prices, non-food inflation should begin to pick up, heading
toward the 5 percent level.''
   Commenting on the decline in business expectations, Dunkelberg
said ``if this view produces a caution in spending on the part of
more and more decisionmakers, the economy cannot help but slip.''
   The big exception to this, he added, is if foreigners ``become
exceptionally aggressive buyers of U.S. goods.''

<HEAD>America's Most Distinguished Living Playwright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One evening last fall, America's most
distinguished living playwright stood on a bare stage at the Los
Angeles Theater Center and read to an audience whose reverence
overflowed in explosions of laughter, sighs and standing ovations.
   This sold-out promotion for his autobiography, ``Timebends: A
Life'' (Grove Press, $24.95), demonstrated Arthur Miller's enduring
popularity with American theatergoers who remember ``Death of a
Salesman'' and ``The Crucible'' _ an audience he fears is becomming
extinct.
   ``Maybe it's a minority art at this point,'' he says of his
great love, the theater. ``That doesn't mean it's less valuable.
The masses aren't always right.''
   Earlier in the day, Miller had reflected on the travails of the
American theater and his own unhealed wounds from years of critical
attack. He voiced with some reticence his perception that the media
collaborated in the destruction of his second wife, Marilyn Monroe.
And, although he is at work on another play, he expressed
hesitation at re-entering the often brutal arena of the New York
theater.
   ``The prospect of battling the theater again is not something I
look forward to,'' he said.
   ``When I began, the theater was the most exciting of media. It
was full of adventure, social protest and the new discoveries of
(theater teacher and director Constantin) Stanislavsky. Some of the
best actors were involved in theater rather than the movies.''
   What changed that, he surmises, was an escalating standard of
living which pushed ticket prices out of the reach of the average
person, and a new breed of critics who didn't understand.
   ``The Crucible,'' was shrugged off by reviewers when it opened
in 1953, he said. ``That makes me wonder what else is being
shrugged off.''
   A sturdy, energetic 72, Miller has found a new fascination in
book writing. His next project may be a novel. His 599-page
autobiography offers a rich pastiche of memories from his
depression era childhood, from his painful marriage to the most
famous movie star in the world and his equally painful
confrontation with the House Un-American Activities Committee.
   Some reviewers have questioned the rambling form of
``Timebends'' which follows no particular chronological order. But
Miller, with characteristic confidence, sees it as a breakthrough.
   ``I believe the form of this book is new and it fascinates me.
... The book is written the way we rememeber, not the way movies
used to show it by flipping calender pages backwards, and not as a
hurdler going over hurdles one after the other,'' he says.
   ``We remember in connected images. The mind has no sense of time
as far as the emotional life is concerned. Time is liquid in this
book, like a wave that rolls over on itself. I'm bending time.''
   Dredging up memories of his four-year marriage to Miss Monroe
appears to have been difficult.
   ``Any of the personal relationships are difficult and painful
(to write about),'' he says. ``But anything that doesn't make the
author feel pain is probably not worth writing in the first place.
If you're revealing the world, you're revealing yourself.''
   There is a revelation of a consuming love which drew him into
the unseemly marriage to the actress.
   ``She was a whirling light to me then,'' he writes, ``all
paradox and enticing mystery, street tough one moment, then lifted
by a lyrical and poetic sensitivity that few retain past early
adolescence.
   ``I was in a swift current, there was no stopping or handhold,
she was finally all that was true.''
   There is some self-criticism by Miller for failing to save the
actress from her own demons. But more often, he blames her demise
on others: the Hollywood hierarchy of directors, acting coaches and
gossip columnists who fed the Monroe myth but denigrated her
efforts to become a serious actress.
   His hardest jibes are at the press which dogged her during their
marriage and, in his opinion, conspired to portray her in the most
unflattering light possible.
   ``I don't blame the press,'' he says. ``The press can
collaborate in harming somebody, but they don't do it
singlehandedly. She was frustrated by the press. She wanted to be
taken more seriously and every time she tried to pick herself up
off the floor they would then kick her in the face. An actor is at
the mercy of the press.''
   He is asked whether Miss Monroe, a sex symbol in a pre-feminist
era, might have fared better today.
   ``Yes, I think so,'' he says. ``She was a victim of the
hypocrisy of the '50s. It was hard not to be. But the hypocrisy
continues. The tears keep being shed by people who did their best
to destroy her.''
   Of his own life, so eloquently recounted in ``Timebends,''
Miller says he has few regrets.
   ``I'm very fatalistic about it. It's not that there's a mystical
fate, but one's character determines one's fate. I simply created
this life of mine the same as your handwriting is yours and can't
be different. ... We do make our lives and we're free to choose in
one way or another.''

<DATELINE>PUSHKAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This town of cobblestone streets and
sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in India, but
millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their
sins in its holy lake.
   Pushkar is a place revered by Hindus and even by some foreigners
who seek out its tranquility.
   Its beginnings lie with Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe
in Hindu mythology. Hindu texts have it that when Brahma was
seeking a place for a holy ceremony, he chose Pushkar.
   He dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the
desert to form a lake, according to the texts that date from the
8th century B.C.
   In these modern times, as the sun rises, Hindu pilgrims chant
mantras and take a dip in Pushkar Lake, believing all their sins
will be washed away by the holy waters.
   Europeans and Americans often are seen by the lake, sharing the
religious experience. They feed grain to pigeons and sweets to
long-tailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the town's
400 temples where ascetics, Hindu monks and other holy men gather.
   Pushkar, a town of 9,000 people, is an oasis of tranquility, far
removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of Bombay, New
Delhi and Calcutta.
   The blazing sun soaks into everything.
   It was the sacred month of Kartik, signifying the onset of
winter, when Lord Brahma is said to have dropped his lotus blossom.
   Brahma, foremost in the Hindu trinity of supreme gods, had been
looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony.
   But his wife, Savitri, could not attend the ritual. Angered, she
decreed that henceforth Brahma would be worshiped at only one place.
   Pushkar became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of
creation, while millions of shrines were erected across India to
Lord Shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like Kali and
Durga who are often depicted as fire-spitting images carrying heads
of evil men they had slain in battle.
   But this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for
the Hindus, almost equal in importance to Benaras, the ``eternal
city.'' Hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in
Benaras.
   Pilgrims come by the thousands to Pushkar, 250 miles southwest
of New Delhi, to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of
Brahma's majestic rite every year on Kartik Poornima, the full moon
night in the month of November.
   Shielded by Nag Pahar, or Serpent Mountain, Pushkar has India's
_ and perhaps the world's _ only temple to Brahma.
   The town centers on the lake, where there are several steps for
bathing. Signs warn foreigners ``not to wear shorts and other
revealing clothes, not to smoke, drink near the lake or take
photographs, not to kiss, embrace or indulge in other irreverent
acts.''
   The steps, called ghats, are controlled by vigilant and
aggressive brahmin priests, who preside over religious ceremonies,
armed with horoscopes. They watch every pilgrim approaching the
lake and pounce on potential clients.
   Each visit is recorded in their bulky, cloth-covered books. A
priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited
Pushkar by referring to the dog-eared notebooks.
   Displeasing a priest can be unpleasant. He will pronounce curses
on one's entire family, naming all _ the grandfather, father and
sons.
   From the lake, the steps lead up to the main street, a favorite
shopping center with the tourists. The shops are stacked with
exotic handicrafts, peasant skirts and other clothes native to this
part of India. Velvet shirts and pajamas, musts for low-budget
travelers, hang in vibrant displays.

<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Annie Sims, the preacher's wife, delivered the
prophecy at a noon prayer meeting late in December:
   ``The Lord said he was going to send a tornado, and many shall
die,'' she recalls, saying God spoke through her during the prayer
service. ``He was going to send his fury and vengeance on the
people.''
   So 17 faithful members of the Repairer of the Breach Church of
God in Christ gathered at their small westside church _ a converted
two-story frame house _ on Jan. 3 to await the wrath of God.
   The congregation has been waiting, faithfully, peacefully, ever
since.
   Any day now, any moment, members believe, God will send a
tornado spinning down from the heavens to smite the wicked and
spare the righteous. And spare their church.
   Their number includes a school teacher, a recent college
graduate, a college freshman, and a restaurant worker with a
management degree.
   They have sacrificed jobs and education, as well as the respect
of family and friends who question their sanity.
   The congregation has been challenged by the power of the state,
too.
   Five members have been removed under court order _ though two of
them have returned since undergoing forced psychiatric
examinations. Two children were taken from their mother and
returned to school, and a 51-year-old man was ordered to undergo
kidney dialysis treatment.
   But unlike a Mormon polygamist clan in Utah whose recent
resistance of police ended in a shootout that killed one officer,
these religious fundamentalists have quietly accepted the
intrusions.
   ``We're not against the court,'' says M.L. Sims, the church
elder and preacher, the husband of Annie. ``If God allows it to
happen, then that's it.''
   Sims, 36, says he's also lost the support of national church
headquarters in Memphis, Tenn., which ordered him to take down a
sign proclaiming affiliation. ``Until the Lord says to move it,
it's going to be up,'' he says.
   A woman who answered a call at the Memphis headquarters said no
one was available to discuss the matter.
   Despite the challenges from outsiders, Sims and the church
members welcome visitors and talk freely. All profess an
unshakeable belief in the tornado. None say they want to leave.
   The 39-year-old Mrs. Sims first prophesied the tornado would
strike Jan. 3, then Jan. 24. Both dates passed uneventfully. The
Simses now say God delayed the tornado to gain time to spread the
warning. No new date has been set.
   ``It'll be pretty soon,'' says Sims. ``It's nationally known
now.''
   No one's faith is shaken by the delay, or by meteorological
precedent.
   ``Tornadoes can occur anytime, but most of the tornadoes in this
area occur from March through June, and then again late in the
fall,'' said National Weather Service forecaster Larry Mowery, who
says he can't recall a midwinter tornado ever striking the area.
   Religion professor Patrick Olivelle, chairman of the department
at Indiana University, says apocalyptic visions are common
religious themes.
   ``Of course there are always reasons why the end never comes,''
he said. ``I always tell my students that religion is not logic,
and you cannot put logical questions to that.''
   One of those waiting in the church, David Freeman, a 24-year-old
graduate of Grinnell College with a major in Spanish, said,
``There's no doubt in my mind, or in anyone's mind that it's going
to come.''
   Freeman stopped showing up for his bank teller's job after Jan.
3, then called the bank to explain. ``They didn't really understand
it,'' he said. ``But after the tornado comes they'll understand,
and they'll congratulate us for standing up for the Lord.''
   The family of Ruschell Harris, a Gary school teacher, and her
16-year-old daughter, Jeanetta, won the court order compelling the
two to undergo psychiatric evaluation.
   ``Really, at the time, they felt I was so deeply under the
influence of pastor that we couldn't do our own thinking,'' she
said. ``If I believe something, and it's different from what you
believe, does that make me insane and you not?''
   Mrs. Harris said she and her daughter returned voluntarily to
the church after a psychiatrist found them competent.
   ``I'm 47 years old. I've been teaching for 20 years. I've taken
my daughter out of school,'' said Mrs. Harris indignantly. ``Do you
think I would be here if I didn't believe it?''
   Jeanetta says it doesn't matter she's missing out on school.
``It doesn't bother me because after the tornado, the school may
not be there.''
   A court gave custody of Patricia Sanders' two sons, Allen
Simmons, 13, and Charles Russell, 12, to a brother, who will return
them to school. Child welfare authorities took the children from
the church.
   ``I don't fight that. They're just doing their job,'' says Mrs.
Sanders. ``They don't understand, because this is spiritual.''
   The days are occupied with informal services, talking and just
waiting.
   ``Praise God, because this world is coming to an end, and we
want to be right,'' chanted Elder Sims during one service. ``People
say we're strange, they say we're crazy, that we're crackpots,'' he
intones, mopping sweat from his face with a towel thrown around his
beefy shoulders. ``But we're just doing what God says to do.''
   ``Better be so ready, you may not know the day,'' sings the
congregation, now a choir whose voice reverberates off bright
blue-painted plaster walls.
   There is no television or radio in the church, and no
newspapers. Adult members take turns preparing meals in the fully
equipped kitchen, and the teen-agers clean up. The Simses live
upstairs. At night, the others fold up the metal chairs and spread
out bedding.
   The cramped quarters are part of the sacrifice. ``We've all
sacrificed here,'' says 18-year-old Falease Lemon, who dropped out
of Indiana Univerity's Gary campus. ``God is going to pay us in
return.''
   Jacqueline Sims, the preacher's 18-year-old daughter, says the
waiting will be ended soon.
   ``We'll be out there after the tornado,'' she says. ``Then the
world will be a better place to live, with everybody doing God's
will.''

   The briefing packet prepared by the Air Force said things would
be less civilized at the Galapagos, where the group visited the
Darwin Center, which does nature research, including work on the
islands' endangered giant turtles.
   ``Wear what you are ashamed to give to Goodwill,'' the briefing
packet advised, and bring two pair of tennis shoes and sandals.
Maitlin said there was good reason for the extra footwear: the
group had to wade ashore.
   ``It's no vacation resort,'' he said.
   Besides Roe, the party included Reps. Manuel Lujan, R-N.M.;
George Brown, D-Calif.; Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn.; Bob Walker, R-Pa.;
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.; and Ron Packard, R-Calif.
   Still more gastrointestinal problems were reported from the
six-day trip led by House Small Business Committee Chairman John
LaFalce, D-N.Y., to discuss trade and debt issues in Brazil,
Argentina and Chile.
   ``Bilateral trade has an impact on the small business community
here,'' said Gary Luczak, a LaFalce spokesman who declined to
identify who answered sick call. ``Mr. LaFalce has a bill to open
bilateral trade to small business.'' He also said LaFalce is an
active member of the Banking Committee.
   Luczak declined to make available the group's daily itinerary,
but he said it included an overnight flight from Brazil to Chile
and long days of meetings and briefings.
   ``Mr. LaFalce has trouble getting people to go along (on his
trips) sometimes because he works them so hard,'' Luczak said.
   This, apparently, wasn't one of those times. Accompanying him on
the trip, which ran up $61,858 in military aircraft costs, were 12
House members, six spouses, five aides and six military escorts.
   According to Luczak, the other members were Charles Hayes,
D-La.; David Dreier, R-Calif.; Marge Roukema, R-N.J.; Dennis
Hertel, D-Mich.; Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis.; Jamie Fuster, D-Puerto
Rico; Thomas Manton, D-N.Y.; Tom McMillen, D-Md.; Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn.; Kweisi Mfume, D-Md.; Jim Bates, D-Calif.; Bruce Vento,
D-Minn.; and Patrick Swindall, R-Ga.
   Travel to Down Under countries was not a House exclusive. Four
senators racked up $209,085 in military aircraft expenses winging
to Australia and New Zealand after a stop in the Philippines, with
trade and security issues on the agenda in each country.
   The traveling party included Sens. James Exon, D-Neb.; John
Melcher, D-Mont.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; and Howell Heflin,
D-Ala.; their wives; four aides; and two Senate officials, Abbott
Saffold, secretary for the majority, and John Doney, assistant
secretary for the minority.
   Among European travelers was a large delegation headed by Rep.
Tom Lantos, D-Calif., that went to West Germany to meet with
members of European parliaments and then to the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia.
   The delegation had some spiritual resources: the House chaplain,
the Rev. Dr. James David Ford, whose wife accompanied him. Why the
chaplain? ``I would assume it's because the group discussed human
rights in Russia and Czechoslovakia,'' Lantos spokesman Bob King
said. `` Having the chaplain along was a useful thing.''
   Other members on the trip were Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.; J.J. Pickle,
D-Texas; Donald Pease, D-Ohio; Thomas Coleman, R-Mo.; William
Clinger, R-Pa.; John Miller, R-Wash.; and Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio.
   Along for the first parts of the trip were Gilman and Vander
Jagt, who left the Lantos group and caught up with the narcotics
committee's trip to Southeast Asia.
   Travelers to Africa included Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and
Terry Sanford, D-N.C., their wives and Walter Stewart, secretary of
the Senate. Their stops to inspect military installations and talk
to U.S. officials included Italy, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe
and Spain.
   While most members of Congress traveled with colleagues, spouses
or aides, Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., did a virtual solo: a four-day
trip to Honduras to watch a local Army reserve unit build roads.
   Accompanied only by an Army liaison officer, he made the journey
in an Army aircraft only 10 days after the House formally
reprimanded him for a series of ethics violations.
   Why Honduras? ``He had never been there,'' replied his
spokesman, John Casey.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second wave of Oscar hype and hoopla
begins this week when nominations for the 60th Academy Awards are
announced with as many publicists attending as press.
   ``Broadcast News,'' ``The Last Emperor,'' ``Moonstruck'' and
``Hope and Glory'' seem certain to place high in the Wednesday
nominations, judging from critics' awards and Hollywood consensus.
   The early-morning announcement will be held at the Beverly Hills
headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
While reporters phone in stories to their news organizations,
publicists will telephone their clients and bosses with the good or
bad news and return to their offices to plot the second phase of
the Oscar campaign.
   ``Campaigning'' is a dirty word in the industry, but most people
in the movie business do it.
   ``We don't like it, but we can't stop it,'' sighs Academy
president Robert Wise.
   The Academy expressed its feelings in a message to members in
the reminder list of eligible releases: ``You will be importuned by
advertisement, promotional gifts and other lobbying tactics, in an
attempt to influence your vote. Each year these crude and excessive
solicitations embarrass the Academy, embarrass you and demean the
significance of the Academy Award.''
   Yet this year's campaign appears as intense as ever with
estimates of the total cost run as high as $5 million.
   ``I don't know how much attention is paid (to the campaigns) by
the voters,'' Wise said. ``Not much, I suspect. I know they have no
influence on my vote; I rely solely on my own judgment.
   ``I think the campaigns are justified only to call attention to
a good film that has been released early in the year. That's the
only way I'm influenced. I read about `The Tin Men,' which was
released earlier in l987, and I said to myself, `Yeah, that was a
good picture.'''
   ``You can't influence Academy members,'' said Booker McClay, who
has directed campaigns for Universal Pictures for the past dozen
years. ``These are professionals who have spent years in the
business and seen thousands of films. You can't hustle them.
   ``The main goal is to get the voters to see your picture. You do
everything possible so they can see it at their convenience.''
   McClay's big push this year is for Universal's prestige film,
``Cry Freedom,'' which has performed disappointingly at the box
office in its limited release. Since November, the film has had 21
special screenings at the studio theater, including those for the
actors, writers and directors guilds. Academy members can also show
membership cards for admission at theaters showing ``Cry Freedom.''
   Tri-Star Pictures took extreme measures to insure exposure for
``Gaby,'' a film about a handicapped woman. It has been praised by
the critics but has failed to attract an audience.
   ``We really, really love the film,'' said Peter Silberman, West
Coast publicity vice president for Tri-Star. ``We felt we needed to
do something special to make it more available for Academy members.
So we sent out 2,500 cassettes of `Gaby.''' This is believed to be
a first-time event for a film that is still in theatrical release.
   The most visible form of campaigning is advertising in the
Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety. Every winter the trade papers
bulge with ads proclaiming films and filmmakers ``for your
consideration.'' One publicist estimates the cost per page at
$5,000, including creative, color printing and space charges.
   ``Let's face it, the trades are our bibles,'' comments marketing
consultant Lloyd Leipzig. ``The question is: How many ads to run?
If you run too few, you don't get consideration. Too many and
you're accused of overkill. The voter says, `They're trying to buy
me.'''
   McClay said Universal ran only 14 ads for ``Out of Africa''
pre-nominations, and the film ended up with the best picture award
of 1985. On the other hand, Orion Pictures bought 65 ad pages for
``Amadeus,'' the best picture winner for 1984.
   Publicity plays in important role in Academy campaigns. Cher,
for example, has recently been on four magazine covers and has
appeared on most of the important TV talks shows. All of this
brings attention to ``Moonstruck,'' for which she seems certain to
be nominated as best actress.
   ``Cher has been very cooperative,'' said John Flinn, a publicity
veteran who is conducting the ``Moonstruck'' campaign for MGM. ``We
also brought Olympia Dukakis to Hollywood for a round of
interviews. (Director) Norman Jewison has done good work for us.
Even Nicolas Cage, who usually doesn't do publicity, has agreed to
some college interviews.''
   But what does a publicist do when stars won't agree to
interviews? Lloyd Leipzig faces that problem in his campaign for
``Ironweed.'' Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson would do no publicity.
   ``It's a tough, harsh, uncompromising, relentless movie,'' said
Leipzig of ``Ironweed,'' which concerns hobo life in 1930s Buffalo.
``Not the kind of movie America is into this year.''
   It's a movie that requires a lot of screenings and not only in
Los Angeles and New York, he said. ``I've also arranged screenings
for the 100-odd Academy members in London, 20 in Paris and 15 in
Rome.''
   Studios also promote their films with expensive brochures which
are mailed to Academy voters. Members of the music branch are
inundated with cassettes and albums of songs and scores.
   After the nominations the campaign continues, but usually with a
more dignified tone.
   ``You've made it this far _ you don't want to blow it with too
much hype,'' cautioned one publicist. ``It never works.''

<HEAD>Europeans Consider Distributing Clean Needles to Slow AIDS</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With drug abuse blamed for 20 percent of AIDS
cases in Western Europe, several countries are exploring ways to
get clean needles to addicts to slow the spread of the disease.
   The goal is to help addicts stop sharing needles and cut their
risk of passing AIDS to each other and to the general population.
The World Health Organization is encouraging national campaigns to
reduce needle-sharing as part of its global strategy to combat AIDS.
   The Netherlands, Britain and Switzerland have introduced
extensive needle- exchange programs.
   Elsewhere, health authorities are using other approaches to make
syringes and needles more widely available to keep addicts from
sharing equipment.
   In Copenhagen, Denmark, for example, addicts _ or anyone else _
can now pick up free syringes and needles at drugstores. After
closing hours, they can buy a syringe and two needles for the
equivalent of 80 cents from sidewalk dispensing machines.
   Although male homosexuals have been most at risk from AIDS, drug
abusers now account for 20 percent of cases reported to the World
Health Organization in Geneva from Western Europe and 25 percent
from the United States.
   Dr. Manuel Carballo, chief of social and behavioral research for
the organization's Global Program on AIDS, said in an interview
that there is also evidence that drug-taking by injection is
increasing.
   If AIDS is introduced into the general population of Western
countries on a large scale, Carballo said, it will probably be
because of drug abuse _ through sexual contact with infected
addicts, including prostitutes, and from pregnant women to their
babies.
   In January, AIDS experts from 23 countries met at the World
Health Organization's headquarters to review ways of dealing with
the rise in AIDS among intravenous drug abusers.
   Among proposals they considered were giving addicts bleach to
clean needles, providing washing facilities in drug clinics,
information campaigns and needle-exchange programs.
   Carballo said the main objection to exchange programs was that
they could be seen to condone the use of drugs.
   Under such programs, addicts receive free syringes and needles
in exchange for their used ones. At the same time, health
authorities offer advice on AIDS and drug treatment.
   Even though the World Health Organization has not publicly
endorsed needle exchange, Carballo said he favors the idea when
combined with efforts to reduce drug-taking.
   ``If we accept that needle-sharing is one of the primary routes
of HIV infection, then it stands to reason that the long-term
effect of these programs may well be the cutting down the potential
spread of HIV,'' the health official said.
   HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
   Intravenous drug users sometimes share needles not only because
of short supplies, but also as a social gesture in the way
marijuana users pass ``joints.''
   Carballo said evidence from the Netherlands and Britain
indicates that exchange programs can reduce needle-sharing,
although there is no evidence yet of a reduction in AIDS infection.
   The Dutch program began in 1984 and is by far the most extensive
in the world. It is centered in Amsterdam, the capital, which is a
haven for drug abusers, with an estimated 7,000 addicts.
   Municipal spokesman Gijs van Stijgeren said the city distributes
600,000 needles a year. No questions are asked and no names taken.
   The spokesman said a small proportion of the nation's 400 AIDS
patients are drug abusers, adding that the Amsterdam program
``doubtlessly has been of great influence'' in slowing the rate of
infection. Another contributing factor, however, could be that many
heroin addicts in the city prefer smoking the drug to injecting it.
   The British program began last April as a one-year experiment,
with the establishment of 15 needle-exchange clinics in England and
Scotland. Results have been uneven.
   The program has recruited about 2,000 addicts nationwide, and
some larger clinics, such as the three in London, are seeing as
many as 50 people a day, officials say.
   But a program set up in Dundee, Scotland, collapsed after six
weeks in what was described as an atmosphere of acrimony between
health workers and their clients. One addict, in a fit of anger,
reportedly sprayed blood from a syringe on a worker.
   In Glasgow, Scotland, local residents picketed the clinic for
six months, maintaining that it would attract junkies and pushers
into their neighborhood. The protests have since died out, and
officials say the program is going smoothly.
   Much attention has been focused on Edinburgh, the Scottish
capital, which has a notorious problem with hard drugs.
   Unlike England, where drug abuse accounts for 1 percent of all
reported AIDS cases, 60 percent of AIDS carriers in Scotland are
intravenous drug users, and the majority of them live in Edinburgh.
   Carol Tinto, administrator of the Lothian Health Board's AIDS
Prevention Team, which is in charge of Edinburgh's program, said it
has been a qualified success.
   Tinto said the clinic has had 115 clients, including 50 or so
regulars, but it has not been able to recruit large numbers because
it was set up to be open one afternoon a week and distribute only
three needles at a time to each addict.
   The Monitoring Research Group at the University of London's
Goldsmiths' College has produced a confidential report on the
British program, and the government will not disclose its findings
until the report is studied.
   Dr. Gerry Stimson, a sociologist who led the research, would not
discuss the group's overall assessment but said some of the larger
clinics have been very successful in attracting new clients.
   Major cities in Switzerland launched anonymous needle-exchange
programs one year ago. In Zurich, a European hard-drug center with
an estimated 4,000 addicts, syringes and needles are available free
and without prescription from doctors and drugstores. Public
reaction to the program has been mild.

   Oil prices continue to drift aimlessly on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   In moderate trading Thursday, contracts for March delivery of
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at $17.11
per 42-gallon barrel, down 2 cents from Wednesday.
   Refined products moved higher, however.
   Wholesale heating oil contracts rose 0.07 cent to 47.35 cents

per gallon, up 0.17 cent.
   ``It was a real dull day,'' said Bob Baker, an analysts at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   He said product prices rose because they had fallen considerably
more than crude on Wednesday, ``and things were just drifting back
to a more normal relationship.''
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst Linda Simard said crude
opened strong at the start, picking up on moderate overnight gains
in London, but the surge faded quickly when the momentum faltered.
   Trading continued in a narrow range for the rest of the day, she
said.

   Runza fast-food restaurants have something
McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's don't _ cabbage and a cult
following.
   The chain offers hamburgers, french fries and other traditional
fast foods, but it's the Runza sandwich that's the staple at Runza
Drive-Inns of America.
   The Runza _ a mixture of ground beef, cabbage and onion in an
oblong loaf of dough _ is available only in Nebraska and three
neighboring states. But its following is devoted.
   Ex-Nebraskans living in New York are known to order several
dozen Runzas _ with cheese and Italian variations _ when they hold
their ``Taste of Nebraska'' parties in the Big Apple.
   New customers often react with disbelief when they learn that
cabbage is a main ingredient in the Runza, says chain chief Don
Everett.
   ``Ninety percent of the people who don't like cabbage normally
like the product,'' Everett said. ``I say to people, `If you don't
like it, I'll give you your money back or I'll buy you a
hamburger.'''
   Everett apparently shells out few refunds, because his
Lincoln-based chain sold about $15 million worth of Runzas last
year at its 42 restaurants in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Colorado.
   Its franchises have reported overall sales increases every year
since Runza Drive-Inns of America was incorporated in 1966, Everett
said. But the Runza's roots stretch back to 18th-century Russia.
   Germans who were invited to settle in the Volga region by
Czarina Catherine the Great in 1763 developed the Runza or bierock,
said Ruth Amen of the American Historical Society of Germans from
Russia.
   A century later, many of the Germans migrated from Russia to the
Americas because of a change in Russian leadership.
   ``Our people, when they came from Russia, brought the Runza with
them,'' she said. ``I can't say, and I don't think anyone can say,
whether they picked them up from the Russian people.''
   Everett picked up the Runza from his mother, Sarah ``Sally''
Everett, who learned how to bake Runzas from her mother on a farm
near Sutton.
   Mrs. Everett's brother, Alex Brening, and her brother-in-law,
Milan Everett, found themselves looking for work shortly after
World War II. With an investment of about $500, the three opened
the first Runza restaurant in 1950.
   Mrs. Everett and Brening still own the original Runza, but they
sold the trade name rights to Don Everett in 1966.
   A subsidiary, Runza National, has franchised 42 of the
restaurants, Everett said. Thirty-six of the restaurants are in
Nebraska. Three are in Kansas, two in Iowa and one in Colorado.
   Everett, a major stockholder in about half the restaurants, has
enough franchise applications on file to expand the chain rapidly.
But he said Runza Drive-Inns will only grow as quickly as qualified
owners and managers are found.
   ``We have more than 1,400 applications, but we don't give them
serious consideration because they don't have qualified managers to
send here for training,'' he said.
   If a franchise application receives initial approval, the
applicant or a designated store manager must come to Runza's
Lincoln headquarters for 50 hours of training.
   The franchise is not awarded until the training period, which
includes working in Runza restaurants, is successfully completed,
Everett said.
   Kathi Krause started working at Everett's first Runza Drive-Inn
in 1972 at age 16 as a $1 per hour carhop. Today, she's a major
stockholder in nine Runza restaurants.
   In states other than Nebraska, Mrs. Krause admits, Runzas can be
a hard sell.
   ``It's kind of been a word-of-mouth recipe that people in
Nebraska have really grown accustomed to,'' she said. ``Outside
Nebraska, we've had to work a little harder to let people know what
they are.''

<HEAD>Pilots Fight Shuttle Transfer, Farming Out Routes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Eastern Airlines' pilots union fought in court
to stop the transfer of the carrier's Northeast Shuttle, the leader
of the nation's unionized pilots said the takeover of Eastern
routes by a small, low-cost cargo company could lead to
industrywide action.
   Henry Duffy, national chairman of the Air Line Pilots
Association, said Eastern's plan to let tiny Orion Air operate
Eastern planes out of Atlanta could draw ``full labor reaction.''
   ``Pilots all over the United States will see this as a threat to
the professions,'' Duffy told The Miami Herald in a story published
today. ``If one company could get away with this, other companies
with like minds could duplicate it.''
   U.S. Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., will hold hearings Tuesday in
Washington over Orion's proposed provision of pilots and crews to
operate 26 planes out of Atlanta, starting April 1. The pilots
would receive one-third the pay now earned by Eastern's crews,
according to details made public of the contract with Orion.
   Eastern unions see the Orion deal as both a way for the
money-losing carrier to lower costs and to keep operating during a
strike.
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker in
Washington on Thursday signed an order to expedite the pilots'
legal effort to stop the shuttle transfer and management's
counter-effort to move the transfer along.
   He set an April 12 hearing. The order also included requirement
of a 10-day notice to the pilots and court before any transfer of
the shuttle, meaning the shuttle transfer couldn't come before
April 22.
   Texas Air criticized a pilots' press release that said Eastern
was ``barred from the shuttle transfer until court ruling.''
   ``ALPA (the Air Line Pilots Association) has issued a
misleading, preposterous release ... They are up to their old
tricks,'' Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks said from Houston.
   Hicks said the court order was a joint agreement among Eastern,
its parent company and the pilots and that it would allow
management to keep its original schedule of mid-April for making
the Eastern shuttle a separate entity. He said the agreement mainly
set up a schedule for depositions and filings in the discovery, or
evidence-gathering, phase of the case.
   Eastern had asked the court to dismiss the pilots' challenge so
it could go ahead with the shuttle transfer.
   Texas Air outraged Eastern's labor leaders last week by
announcing the profitable Boston-New York-Washington shuttle would
become a Texas Air division called Air-Shuttle.
   The pilots union last year filed suit seeking to block any
transfer of Eastern's assets.
   Texas Air last year made Eastern's reservations system a
separate entity and transferred or sold some aircraft, gates and
routes to Continental Airlines (also owned by Texas Air) and other
carriers.
   ``Unilateral dismemberment by Texas Air Corp. management of
Eastern Airlines will not be tolerated,'' said Capt. Jack Bavis,
chairman of the Eastern pilots union. ``The shuttle is not gone,
and we will fight to keep it within Eastern using every available
resource.
   ``We're confident that Judge Parker will agree with Eastern
pilots that a unilateral Eastern Air Shuttle transfer is unlawful
and nothing more than a union-busting tool,'' Bavis said in a
prepared statement.
   ALPA contends the sale of the shuttle service violates the
federal Railway Labor Act by changing the working conditions of
Eastern pilots without collective bargaining and undermining ALPA's
collective bargaining status.
   New York attorney James Linsey, representing the pilots, said he
would seek Eastern and Texas Air internal memos, and also will ask
during depositions of Eastern and Texas Air officers, about plans
for any more asset transfers, such as ``Latin American routes;
significant transfers of aircraft to other airlines.''
   ``Then we proceed to court for an injunction to prohibit the
systematic dissection and dismantling of Eastern Airlines,'' Linsey
said.
   Texas Air said it would pay Eastern, reeling from a decade of
losses, $125 million cash and $100 million more in securities for
the shuttle. Eastern union officials say the shuttle has brought in
more than $125 million cash in the last three years.

<HEAD>Mexico Sets Feb. 26 for Auction on Foreign Debt Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Mexico's creditor banks have
given the government permission to go ahead with a new proposal to
swap some of its enormous foreign debt for special bonds, the
Treasury Department said.
   At the same time, it announced that the first auction of the
bonds had been tentatively set for Feb. 26, a week later than
initially planned.
   In New York, J.P. Morgan & Co., the exchange agent of the deal,
said in a statement Thursday that the deadline was extended by a
week ``in response to requests from numerous banks to prepare their
bids.''
   Under the program, the government plans to exchange some of the
debt it owes foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds that
will be issued by the government.
   The Mexican bonds will be backed by $10 billion worth of special
securities to be issued early this year by the U.S. government.
Mexico is expected to pay about $2 billion for the 20-year, U.S.
zero coupon bonds, which pay no interest but are issued at a sharp
discount of their face value.
   In a statement released late Wednesday, the Mexican Treasury
Department said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks
permission to offer the bonds because provisions in the loan
contracts bar it from giving preferences in the repayment of the
debts.
   It received majority approval on Feb. 5, it said.
   Even so, it said, ``the fact that the banks have expressed
agreement so that the bonds can be issued does not imply a
commitment on their part to take part in the auction.''
   Jose Angel Gurria, the nation's chief debt negotiator, said 300
banks had given their authorization for Mexico to go ahead with the
auction.
   The program would apply to $51 billion of the country's total
foreign debt of about $105 billion, the second highest in the
developing world after Brazil.
   Some major U.S. banks reportedly plan to shun the auction
because they are unhappy that Mexico will continue obtaining loans
at 100 percent of their value while paying back, through the bond
program, its old loans at about half their value.
   They also are reluctant to accept losses of 50 percent or so on
the loans entered into years ago.
   Gurria, in an interview with the government newspaper El
Nacional, shrugged off the banks' concerns.
   ``It doesn't worry us ...,'' he said. ``The banks should make
their decision and quote it. No one pressures them, nor suggests a
price to them.''
   ``We are not negotiating,'' he said, ``they are taking their
position and they will declare it in a sealed envelope.''
   When government officials open the bids, he said, ``those that
please us most we take, and those that don't, no. The auction
mechanism eliminates negotiations.''
   He said the government ``has no preconceived idea about prices
or levels. ... We have a totally open mind because we are entering
new ground. Nothing will happen if the offers in the auction are
not accepted.''
   Government officials have said previously that if they don't
consider the bids good enough, they may well not accept any.
   Under the program, banks would exchange their old debt for the
new bonds, letting Mexico recover 52 cents or so for each dollar in
the secondary market. That means that Mexico could retire part of
its debt for half its face value.
   By reducing its debt, the government will also cut the amount of
interest it pays each year on the loans. Mexico was scheduled to
pay an estimated $8 billion to $9 billion in interest charges in
1987.

   A federal judge has turned down Federated Department Stores
Inc.'s request to dismiss Campeau Corp.'s challenge of a Delaware
anti-takeover law, while the federal government has indicated it
might intervene in the case.
   In another development Thursday, Toronto-based Campeau disclosed
more financing details for a proposed $5.4 billion merger with
Cincinnati-based Federated. The merger was offered as an
alternative to its outstanding $4.2 billion hostile tender offer.
   ``We believe that the Federated board cannot, consistent with
its fiduciary responsibilities to stockholders, continue to refuse
to meet with us,'' Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau said in a letter
to Federated Chairman Howard Goldfede.
   Federated had no comment on Campeau's renewed offer, Federated
spokesman Jim Sluzewski said.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a brief
Thursday supporting Campeau's right to challenge the Delaware
statute. The SEC also indicated it might express an opinion on the
merits of the suit itself.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand in New York had asked the
SEC for comment on Federated's motion to dismiss Campeau's suit.
Federated, which is incorporated in Delaware, contended Campeau had
no standing to make the constitutional challenge because it did not
have assured financing for its hostile takeover bid.
   But the SEC indicated ``the substantial efforts and
expenditures'' undertaken by a party making a tender offer
satisfied the requirement that a party have a ``personal stake'' in
an issue in order to have standing to sue.
   The brief also stated Campeau could suffer ``substantial
injury'' if forced to wait for assurance of financing before
pressing its lawsuit, and such assurance would do little or nothing
to clarify the constitutional issues in the case.
   Campeau challeged the takeover law as an unconstitutional
interference with interstate commerce and an infringement on
federal regulatory authority.
   The law is regarded as significant because of the thousands of
major companies that have incorporated in Delaware. Black & Decker
Corp., which has a $2.03 billion hostile offer outstanding for
American Standard Inc., also has challenged the law.
   Eric Summergrad, the SEC assistant general counsel, said in
Washington the agency's staff also was considering a similar
``friend of the court'' brief addressing the actual issues raised
by the suit. He said a decision on whether to file such a brief
should be made in the next two weeks.
   Campeau also has filed suit to challenge Federated's ``poison
pill'' takeover defense, but that issue was not addressed by the
SEC brief issued Thursday.
   Federated shares jumped $2.37{ to $59.87{ a share Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Campeau further disclosed that it had financing commitments for
$200 million of a planned $500 million bank loan being arranged by
Bank of Montreal and Banque Paribas and a commitment for a $100
million short-term ``bridge'' loan from First Boston Corp. First
Boston also indicated it was highly confident it could raise up to
$1 billion in subordinated debt to finance the merger.
   Campeau said in his letter to Goldfeder that Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles has committed $500 million to the deal
and ``has advised us that it is highly confident that commitments
can be obtained for the balance of the required financing.''
   Campeau on Wednesday disclosed it had agreements for $660
million in financing for its $5.4 billion offer. Federated has said
it would discuss that offer, which was applicable only in a
definitive merger agreement, if Campeau showed it had enough
financing to complete the buyout.
   Ohio shopping center developer Edward J. DeBartolo, who helped
finance Campeau's $3.4 billion buyout of Allied Stores Corp. in
1986, agreed to lend $400 million. The Reichmann family of Toronto,
which controls Olympia & York Developments Ltd., a major Campeau
shareholder, agreed to buy $260 million in new Campeau shares.
   Federated operates approximately 650 stores nationwide and had
sales exceeding $11 billion in 1987.
   Federated's holdings include the New York chains Bloomingdale's
and Abraham and Straus, Filene's of Boston, Burdines of Miami,
Rich's in Atlanta, Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles
and I. Magnin in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Stop & Shop Rejects Latest Dart Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dart Group Corp. says it will press its
billion-dollar buyout bid for Stop & Shop Cos. despite a unanimous
rejection of the offer by the Stop & Shop board of directors.
   ``Our offer is still outstanding,'' Dart President Robert Haft
said Thursday following the rejection of the offer. ``Our offer is
to the 90 percent of the shareholders who are not on the board.''
   In rejecting the offer, the Stop & Shop board said the $1.03
billion buyout, a bid of $37 a share, was inadequate and not in the
best interests of the company or its stockholders.
   Among the board's considerations was information that Dart has
yet to secure commitments to provide financing for its offer, Stop
& Shop said in a statement. Stop & Shop also said it was exploring
alternatives to the unsolicited offer, including a possible sale of
the firm.
   A company statement said Stop & Shop had received ``indications
of interest from third parties for a transaction with the company.''
   But Haft said Dart was prepared to compete for Stop & Shop.
   ``If there is a higher bona fide alternative to our offer, we
intend to bid against it,'' Haft said in a telephone interview.
   Stop & Shop said its other alternatives included exploring a
leveraged buyout, recapitalization or other restructuring. In a
leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to purchase a company
and then pay off the debt with the company's cash flow or the sale
of its assets. Stop & Shop, which operates 141 supermarkets and 171
Bradlees department stores around the country, has said publicly it
prefers to remain independent.
   The statement referred to Dart's history of making millions of
dollars in profits through failed takeover bids. Many analysts
doubt that Dart is sincere in wanting to acquire and operate a
retail company.
   Haft denied his company had made its offer solely to profit from
its Stop & Shop holdings. The Dart Group has acquired 738,220
shares of Stop & Shop, 2.7 percent of the outstanding shares.
   Haft said Dart had begun the process under which it could call a
special meeting of Stop & Shop shareholders for the purpose of
replacing the company's board with directors more sympathetic to
the offer.
   Stop & Shop stock fell 50 cents Thursday to $36.87{ a share in
New York Stock Exchange trading. Announcemennt of the rejection
came after the close of trading.
   Haft and his father Herbert, the chairman of Dart, had offered
$31 a share for the retailer, and earlier this week raised the bid
to $37.
   In Hartford, Conn., officials at Local 919 of the United Food &
Commercial Workers' Union said Thursday they have retained a team
of lawyers, investment bankers and other advisers to explore the
workers' options in the face of the Dart bid.
   The union also requested a meeting with Stop & Shop directors.
   ``We are exploring all and every appropriate alternative to
protect the interests and jobs of the employees we represent,''
said local president Arnold F. Espinosa.
   Among the options being considered are seeking a ``white
knight,'' a suitor sympathetic to the employees' interests, and an
employee stock ownership plan in a possible leveraged buyout,
Espinosa said.
   The Hartford local, which represents 10,000 Stop & Shop workers,
is leading the effort on behalf of other locals. Stop & Shop has a
total of 35,000 workers.

   A Franco-Belgian deal to keep a
restructured Societe Generale de Belgique SA in Belgian hands fell
through Friday and revitalized a bid by Italian investor Carlo De
Benedetti to take effective control of the nation's biggest holding
company.
   Belgian industrialist Andre Leysen failed to get the necessary
backing from a group of mostly Belgian shareholders to approve a
deal with the French holding Cie Financiere de Suez to take control
of Societe Generale.
   Leysen said in a statement ``he considered his mandate as
spokesman for the group as over.'' He added he would not take new
initiatives in the fight for control of the company that has a
stake in a third of the Belgian economy.
   De Benedetti is trying to get effective control of Societe
Generale and use it as a platform for a pan-European financial
holding company.
   The Italian investor claims to be the largest single shareholder
and can control, through allies, 38 percent of stock in the
company. He has a public offer for 15 percent more.
   The 166-year-old Societe Generale has interests in about 1,400
companies world-wide with assets totaling nearly $3 billion.
   The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around Leysen said
it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while Suez claimed 15
percent.
   But together with various small allies Leysen said the bloc
would have been assured of absolute majority at shareholders
meetings.
   The accord was also favored by the current management of Societe
Generale, which has come under sharp attack by De Benedetti.
   Even before Friday's rejection of the Leysen-Suez deal, De
Benedetti had offered to cooperate with Belgian shareholders in
restructuring Societe Generale, with a Belgian as chief officer and
himself running the day-to-day management.
   De Benedetti did not extend the offer for cooperation to Suez
however.
   A shareholder can block management decisions when he has 25
percent of Societe Generale stock.
   Friday's developments followed a week of frantic negotiations
between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat De
Benedetti's bid to take control of the company.
   Suez meanwhile said in Paris it would continue to negotiate with
Belgian shareholders despite Leysen's withdrawal.
   Suez said in a statement the group ``is continuing discussions
with all the Belgian shareholders that have expressed their desire
to build a balanced partnership with us.''

<HEAD>Group Discloses Gillette Stake; Seeks Meeting With Potential
Acquirers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co., which has fought off cosmetic giant
Revlon Co. repeatedly, is now being chased by a group led by
Coniston Partners.
   Coniston subsidiary RB Partners has accumulated 6.76 million
Gillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's roughly
115.9 million shares outstanding, the group disclosed Thursday.
   Coniston, a partnership that was instrumental in the breakup of
Allegis Corp., indicated it would like to meet with Gillette, said
Paul E. Tierney Jr., Coniston general partner.
   Failing that, Tierney said Coniston may meet with potential
buyers of Gillette stock in an attempt to seek representation for
the upcoming board of directors annual meeting in April.
   ``We don't want to break up Gillette,'' Tierney said. ``The
smartest thing would be to see the company purchased by another
entity.''
   Coleman Mockler, Gillette's chairman and chief executive, said
in a prepared statement, ``RB Partners appears to be trying to
pressure the Gillette directors into putting the company up for
sale and to stir up renewed speculation in Gillette stock.''
   ``The directors have consistently stated the view that Gillette
has a bright future as an independent company,'' the statement said.
   The Coniston group said it acquired the shares because it
believed they were undervalued. Coniston also indicated it would
attempt to meet with Gillette management to determine the steps the
company would take to boost its stock price.
   But according to the Gillette release, the company was satisfied
that a recent restructuring was sufficiently boosting shareholder
values and it would not be pressured into giving up its
independence.
   Shearson Lehman analyst Andres Shore said if Coniston pursued a
proxy fight against Gillette management, it might find support in
the many institutions that hold company stock.
   Thursday's disclosure came after several days of renewed
takeover speculation surrounding Gillette that sent the consumer
products company's stock shooting higher.
   Gillette rose $3.62{ to $41 a share in active New York Stock
Exchange trading Thursday.
   The group stated it might meet with potential acquirers to
determine their interest in buying Gillette, and to compare the
price they might offer against the benefits of a management plan.
   Boston-based Gillette long has been the object of takeover
speculation. Over the past two years the company has spurned
several takeover offers from Revlon Group Inc., the latest a $5.41
billion proposal.
   The companies signed a standstill agreement in November 1986,
after Revlon acquired a 14 percent take in Gillette and made its
initial unsuccessful offer for a $4.12 billion buyout. The pact
prohibits Revlon from launching a tender offer without the consent
of Gillette's board of directors _ which adamantly has opposed
takeover overtures.
   After rebuffing Revlon in 1986, Gillette undertook a
restructuring that included layoffs of about 2,400 workers and the
sale of a number of its smaller businesses.
   Last November, the company announced a reorganization that split
it into two main units, one for its North American and European
razor, razor blade, personal products and stationary products
businesses and the other for international and diversified units.
   Coniston's moves indicated it believed Gillette was worth more
than the stock market had valued it, and the group might realize a
bigger profit from the proceeds of a buyout, breakup or other
restructuring than it would from a long-term rise in the company's
stock price.
   Keith Gollust, a general partner in the group, declined to
identify the parties deemed potential buyers for Gillette, although
rumored acquirers in the past have included the British
conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC and Unilever NV, the Anglo-Dutch
consumer products company.

   Now that Wall Street has been in a bear market
for nearly six months, some venturesome investors are searching out
``cheap'' stocks to buy.
   Of course, just about all the merchandise a stockbroker has to
offer has been marked down significantly since last summer. But
some stocks may, upon appraisal, look cheaper than others.
   How to identify them? One handy way is to plug several
statistical measures into a computer program and instruct the
machine to search the market for stocks that meet those criteria.
   Norman Weinger and Michael Metz, analysts at the investment firm
of Oppenheimer & Co. who are well known on Wall Street for screens
of this type, have just completed one.
   They found ``deep discount stocks'' predominating in electric
utilities, banking, insurance, savings and loans, and some
household-name blue chips as well.
   ``No investment decision is warranted on the basis of these
figures alone,'' they caution. If a stock is out of favor, there
are likely to be excellent reasons why.
   ``The data should be used as a starting point in a quest for
unusually attractive values,'' Weinger and Metz say.
   The analysts set three standards for a stock to qualify as
deeply discounted:
   _ Its price-earnings ratio had to be at least one-third below
the average for the market as a whole, as measured by Standard &
Poor's index of 400 industrials;
   _ It must carry a dividend yield at least one-third more than
the S&P 400;
   _ The ratio of its stock price to book value, or theoretical
worth if the company were to be liquidated, had to be at least
one-third below the aggregate ratio for the S&P 400.
   The two biggest names that showed up on Weinger and Metz's
screen were General Motors and Sears Roebuck _ prime examples of
``companies that clearly would be affected by any slowdown in
consumer spending,'' the analysts noted.
   Also conspicuous by its presence is Merrill Lynch, reflecting
the depressed state of the securities industry.
   Numerous banking concerns also made the least-loved list, thanks
(if that is the right word) to worries about loans in Third World
countries and in real estate and energy deals that investors are
worried about.
   Representatives from the insurance industry include such
prominent participants as Aetna, Cigna, Continental and Travelers.
From the savings and loan group: H.F. Ahmanson, Calfed and Great
Western Financial.
   And then there are no less than 57 utilities, from Atlantic
Energy to Pacificorp.
   This is, Weinger and Metz say, ``an industry undergoing
significant change. Perhaps the most important change is that
capital requirements (e.g., for new plants and other facilities)
are tending to flatten or decline.
   ``As a result, some utilities are becoming net cash generators
rather than the insatiable consumers of capital they were in the
1970s.
   ``It is estimated that the industry in aggregate will be able to
cover its capital requirements entirely from internal cash
generation by 1989. This development has favorable implications for
the industry's investment status.
   ``Improving debt-to-equity ratios could provide the basis for an
upward valuation of the group, enabling utility companies to pay
out a larger proportion of reported earnings in dividends.
   ``The group may command considerably greater investment interest
as a result of the recent market decline and greater concern about
prospects for continued economic growth.''

   The dollar surged in Europe today on news of a
sharp improvement in U.S. trade performance in December.
   Gold bullion prices also advanced.
   After picking up gains in early trading, the dollar shot up
immediately after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
trade deficit narrowed from $13.2 billion in November to $12.2
billion in December. It was the smallest gap since January 1987.
   The dollar rose above 130 Japanese yen for the first time since
mid-December, trading at 131.15 yen _ up from 129.95 yen earlier in
Tokyo and from 129.03 yen on Wednesday. Tokyo markets were closed
Thursday for a national holiday.
   Here are some other afternoon dollar rates in Europe compared
with late Thursday, with rates before the U.S. trade announcement
in parentheses: 1.7135 (1.6949) West German marks, up from 1.6885;
1.4060 (1.3915) Swiss francs, up from 1.3870; 5.7915 (5.7305)
French francs, up from 5.7135; 1.9230 (1.9038) Dutch guilders, up
from 1.8961; 1,263.00 (1,250.50) Italian lire, up from 1,246.65;
and 1.2632 (1.2630) Canadian dollars, down from 1.2663.
   The British pound sank to $1.7365, down from $1.7565 earlier in
the day and 1.7595 dollars late Thursday.
   Gold bullion rose to a bid price of $445.25 a troy ounce in
London, up from the morning fixing of $440.30 and late Thursday's
$441.50.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal jumped to a bid of $442, up
from $440 earlier today and $441 late Thursday.
   Earlier, the metal had closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $443.69,
down from $443.93.

   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $12.2
billion in December, the smallest gap since January, as exports hit
a record, the Commerce Department said today.
   For the year, the trade deficit widened to $171.2 billion, the
largest ever. But financial markets were expected to pay more
attention to the December numbers, which came two months after the
Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   December's merchandise trade deficit of $12.2 billion was an
improvement from the $13.2 billion gap posted in November.
   December's deficit, the smallest since January's $11.9 billion
shortfall, was paced by a record $24.8 billion in exports, a 4.2
percent improvement over November. November's gain had also
resulted from surging exports.
   Imports, meanwhile, were at $37 billion in December, the same
level as in the previous month.
   Still, for the year, the differnce between what the United
States imported and what it exported soared 9.6 percent from the
previous record deficit of $156.2 billion in 1986.
   For all of 1987, imports totaled $424.1 billion and exports
totaled $252.9 billion _ up from imports of $383 billion and
exports of $226.8 billion in 1986.
   The Reagan administration was quick to hail the new numbers.
Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter said the drop in the
deficit ``is good news, particularly since this is the second
straight monthly decline. ...We hope this is a sign that there are
better days ahead on the trade front.''
   Jay Goldinger, economist for Cantor, Fitzgerald, a Los Angeles
bond brokerage, said the trade figures demonstrate ``we are in the
middle of a major change in course'' on the balance-of-trade.
   ``But it's a big ship. And you don't turn it on a dime. But at
least we know we're headed home,'' Goldinger said.
   Exports have been climbing in recent months under pressure from
a weaker dollar _ which makes U.S. goods more competitive abroad
while driving up the price of imports.
   Government and private economists have suggested that an export
boom could be the major factor in finally bringing down the trade
deficit, which has been increasing steadily since the late 1970s.
   The United States continued to run its largest deficit with
Japan _ $59.8 billion in 1987, up from $58.6 billion in 1986.
   The deficit with Western Europe, however, narrowed to $30.2
billion from $32.7 billion. The deficit with Taiwan increased to
$19.0 billion from $15.7 billion. And with Canada, it was down to
$11.7 billion from $13.2 billion.
   The deficit with South Korea in 1987 was $9.9 billion, up from
$7.1 billion in 1986. With Hong Kong, it was up to $6.5 billion
from $6.4 billion. And with Mexico, the U.S. trade shortfall rose
to $5.9 billion from $5.2 billion in 1986.
   For December alone, the trade defcit with Japan was $4.8
billion, about the same as November; with Western Europe, $2.7
billion, up from $2.4 billion; with Canada, $632.8 million, down
from $1.3 billion; with Taiwan, $1.1 billion, down from $1.2
billion; with South Korea, $762.8 million, up from $760.2 million.
   Imports for all of 1987 were up 10.7 percent while exports rose
11.5 percent. That compares to an 8.7 percent rise in imports in
1986 and only a 3.7 percent rise in exports.
   For the full year, imports of manufactured goods rose to $325.2
billion, from $293.8 billion. Oil imports surged to $44.8 billion
from $37.6 billion.
   Meanwhile, exports of U.S. manufactured goods were up to $171.5
billion, from $148.7 billion in 1986.
   In agricultural goods, one of the few categories where the
United States maintained a trade surplus, exports were up to $28.6
billion from $26.1 billion in 1987.
   New car imports from Japan were $2.0 billion in December, the
same level as in November. For the year, car imports from Japan
totaled $22.2 billion, up slightly from $22.0 billion in 1986.
   New auto imports from Canada were $1.0 billion in December, down
from $1.2 billion in November _ and $10.2 billion for the year,
down from $11.8 billion in 1986.
   From other countries, auto imports were $1.6 billion, up from
$1.5 billion in November _ and $16.8 billion for all of 1987, up
from $12.7 billion.
   The monthly trade figures _ which governmment analysts caution
can be misleading because they are not adjusted for either seasonal
factors or inflation _ have become one of the most closely watched
set of government statistics by financial markets.
   In fact, the task force appointed by President Reagan to study
the market collapse identified a weaker-than-expected trade report
released in early October as one factor triggering the 508-point
stock price plunge.
   A weaker dollar can help ease the U.S. trade deficit by making
imports more expensive and U.S. goods more competitive abroad. But
reports of a smaller trade deficit tend to raise the value of the
dollar _ which in turn can cause the deficit to widen.
   The Reagan administration in past months has joined with its
major economic allies in seeking a stable dollar against other key
currencies. Too rapid a fall in the value of the dollar can produce
inflation.
   The dollar has fallen 50 percent since mid-1985 against the
Japanese yen and key European currencies.

   The stock market gained ground today in what
analysts described as a muted response to news of a smaller U.S.
trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 23.87 to 1,985.41
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 769 up, 239
down and 427 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.58 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.20 billion in December
from $13.22 billion the month before.
   The figure came in at the low end of analysts' estimates, and
lent support to the growing belief that the international trade
situation was improving. American exports set a record for the
second straight month.
   But analysts said traders in the stock and bond markets didn't
see the news as purely positive.
   Given the strength it showed in U.S. manufacturing, they said,
the chances seemed less that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further. Interest rates rose and prices declined
in the credit markets.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 1] at 112|; General Electric, up { at 43|; Ford Motor,
up | at 43{, and American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 29|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.41 to 145.40. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.87 at 276.27.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped .50 to
1,961.54.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 810 up, 707 down and 446 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 200.76 million shares, against 187.98 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Toyota May Export Small Planes to Far East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Sales USA is working on a plan that
could result in the export of small airplanes to the Far East, a
company official says.
   Brian Barents, a Toyota vice president hired recently from
Cessna Aircraft Co. of Wichita, Kan., said the potential deal would
help reduce the U.S. trade imbalance with the Far East.
   The government announced today that its deficit with Japan for
last year rose to $59.8 billion, from $58.6 billion in 1986.
   Analysts said they doubted the plan would have much of an impact
on the trade deficit because of the small airplane market in Japan.
   ``We're having discussions but nothing is finalized,'' Barents
said from company headquarters in Torrance, Calif.
   Toyota officials said the deal would involve the export of
planes made by Cessna, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corp.
Barents, in a story published in today's Detroit Free Press,
declined to say how many airplanes would be involved or when export
would begin.
   He said the plan called for Toyota to export Cessna's largest
airplanes, including corporate jets.
   Cessna spokesman Dean Humphrey declined to comment.

   Wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.4 percent in
January as higher food costs more than offset declines in energy
prices, the government said today.
   The rise in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index negated
a 0.4 percent decline in December and was the steepest monthly
increase since an identical 0.4 percent jump in September.
   January's rise, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount to
an annual inflation rate of 4.6 percent, compared with the 2.2
percent increase for all of 1987. Economists, however, still expect
that wholesale prices will moderate through the balance of 1988.
   Food prices increased 1.7 percent in January, rebounding from a
1.4 percent decline in December.
   Analysts said an insect infestation in California and Arizona
pushed up vegetable prices, while cold weather influenced a rise in
chicken and pork prices.
   The increase included a 16.2 percent surge vegetable prices.
Lettuce shot up 51.6 percent in Janaury. That comes atop a 10.5
percent increase in December and a 95.4 percent jump in November.
Celery rocketed 44.1 percent and onions 32.5 percent.
   Prices for pork were up 13.2 percent; egg costs jumped 12.5
percent; chicken prices went up 5.6 percent.
   Costs also rose for rice, macaroni products and fish. Declines
were posted for turkeys, off 12.4 percent, and fresh fruits, down
3.0 percent.
   Natural gas prices edged up 0.8 percent after a 3.0 percent
increase in December. But steep declines were recorded for other
forms of energy, which overall fell 4.5 percent, compared with a
decline of 1.6 percent a month earlier.
   Gasoline prices fell 8.4 percent after dropping 4.2 percent in
December. Home heating oil costs dropped 6.2 percent, compared with
a 5.2 percent fall a month before.
   Donald Ratajczak, who runs his own inflation surveys as director
of economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta,
said falling energy prices reflect ``a little bit of a glut'' on
the oil market.
   The industry, historically, takes a long time to adjust its
production to price changes and there is still some overproduction
stemming from oil price increases in the early 1980s, he said.
   Minus the usually volatile food and energy categories, the index
for all other finished goods rose a brisk 0.5 percent, compared
with a 0.2 percent increase in December.
   Ratajczak said this figure was pushed higher by publishers of
newspapers and magazines and producers of items sold through
catalogs, who tend to raise their prices once at the beginning of
each year.
   The Labor Department gave these other specifics on January
wholesale price activity:
   _New automobile prices were up 0.2 percent, following a 1.9
percent drop in December.
   _Alcoholic beverage costs were up 0.1 percent after a 0.3
percent increase a month earlier.
   _Household appliance prices were down 0.2 percent, compared with
an 0.2 percent increase in December.
   _Home electronic equipment costs fell 0.2 percent after dropping
0.5 percent earlier.
   Gains were also posted for adults' and children's clothing and
shoes.
   The figures are adjusted to remove predictable seasonal price
fluctuations.
   The wholesale price calculation excludes services and imports,
areas of the economy where price increases have been more rapid in
part because of the falling dollar, which makes foreign products
more expensive.
   The Consumer Price Index, which tracks prices at the retail
level and includes services and imports, is due out Feb. 26 for
January. Inflation at the consumer level was 4.4 percent in 1987.
   The January increase left the overall Producer Price Index,
which is not seasonally adjusted, at 106.2 percent of its 1982
base-period average.
   That means that a selection of goods costing $10 in 1982 cost
$10.62 last month, up from $10.57 in December and $10.40 in January
1987.
   The government used the 1982 base for the first time in the
January report. It had used a 1967 base since 1971. A selection of
goods that cost $10 in 1967, cost $29.80 last month, up from $29.68
in December and $29.18 in January 1987.
   The Labor Department, with the January report, also revised its
seasonal adjustments for the past five years, changing previously
reported percent changes in many categories.
   Michael Evans, president of his own economic consulting firm in
Washington, said a modest rebound in wholesale inflation may spook
the bond market and send long-term interest rates up.
   But Lawrence Chimerine, president of the Wefa Group, a
Philadelphia-area forecasting service, said the markets will be
looking more closely at December trade deficit figures, also
released this morning.
   ``Generally speaking, inflation is still pretty mild,''
Chimerine said.
   Ratajczak predicts moderate wholesale inflation of 2.6 percent
for 1988 and a more robust 3.9 percent in 1989.
   ``The major thrust of the (1988) increase is ... higher farm
prices, especially for the grains, and a slight increase in
(energy) prices,'' he said. ``... Our current estimates suggest
that reacceleration of significant inflationary pressures may
develop in 1989 as oil prices rise.''

<HEAD>Union Construction Workers Returning to Amoco Refinery, Company
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement has been reached between union
construction crews and Amoco Corp., ending a four-month labor
dispute at the Whiting, Ind., refinery.
   A union official said Thursday the Chicago-based oil company had
agreed to use only union contractors. In return, the unions agreed
to call off picketing and a campaign calling for a union consumer
boycott of Amoco's gas stations.
   G. Russell Bassett, president of the Northwest Indiana Building
and Construction Trades Council, said the Chicago-based oil company
agreed to use only union contractors for any refinery construction
work in the future.
   The dispute began in October, when Amoco hired non-union
contractors for $10 million worth of construction and renovation
work at the 99-year-old refinery. The work was completed recently
despite the presence of union picket lines.
   More than 55 people were arrested and several were injured
during the first days of the picketing, which drew as many as 1,000
union members.
   In a move to put economic pressure on Amoco, the unions withdrew
at least $100 million in funds from Chicago banks that had Amoco
executives on their boards of directors. Bassett said redepositing
of that money was not part of the settlement worked out with the
company.
   Resolution of the dispute came several days after members of the
Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union endorsed a two-year contract
covering the Whiting refinery and other Amoco installations around
the country.
   ``All parties are gratified with the settlement and are looking
forward to a resumption of work,'' Amoco said in a statement
Thursday.

<HEAD>December Trade Deficit at $12.2 Billion; Inventories, Wholesale
Prices Jump</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with December figure on
inventories; uppicks 7th graf pvs: On Thursday...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's deficit in foreign trade stood at a
lower-than-expected $12.2 billion in December, while business
inventories jumped, the government said today. It also said
wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.4 percent in January.
   The trade figure was the lowest in 11 months, reflecting a surge
in exports, Commerce Department officials said.
   For the year, the trade deficit widened to a record $171.2
billion, the largest ever. But financial markets were expected to
pay more attention to the December numbers, which came two months
after the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said higher food costs more than
offset declines in energy prices last month, easily wiping out a
0.4 percent decline in December's Producer Price Index.
   It was the steepest monthly increase since an identical 0.4
percent jump in September, and would amount to an annual inflation
rate of 4.6 percent _ if it persisted all year. The annual rate of
increase for all of 1987 was 2.2 percent.
   Analysts still expect that wholesale prices will moderate
through the balance of 1988, however.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said business
inventories shot up 0.8 percent in December, the third consecutive
large monthly advance.
   The December increase pushed unsold stockpiles on shelves and
backlots up by $5.45 billion to a seasonally adjusted $701.87
billion. The increase followed even larger gains of 0.9 percent in
November and 1.1 percent in October.
   While the economy, as measured by the gross national product,
expanded at a brisk 4.2 percent annual rate in the final three
months of the year, nearly three-fourths of that growth came from
an unusually large buildup in inventories which was occurring at
the same time that consumer spending was falling.
   Because of this combination, many analysts believe growth in the
first three months of 1988 will be extremely sluggish, with some
analysts even forecasting one quarter of negative GNP growth.
   On Thursday, the Commerce Department said retail sales activity
posted its third monthly increase in January, as a rebound in auto
sales boosted the key economic sector.
   Some economists said January's 0.5 percent rise in retail sales
reflected a continued recovery in consumer confidence that was
jarred during the October stock market crash.
   In addition to the January rise, the government revised upward
the sales gains reported for the two previous months. Sales were up
a strong 1.2 percent in December and 0.3 percent in November,
compared with previous estimates of 0.7 percent and 0.1 percent,
respectively.
   Because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, analysts have been watching it closely for signs
of a slowdown in the wake of the crash.
   But although January's gains were supported by a 1.6 percent
rise in auto sales, some analysts said the figures were strong
enough to indicate consumers were not dragging the economy into a
recession.
   Sales had declined by a sharp 0.9 percent in October and 1.7
percent in September.
   Retail establishments sold $128.1 billion worth of goods in
January, up $600 million from December, the government said. It was
the highest monthly total since August, when sales hit $128.9
billion.
   A separate government report indicated severely cold weather
boosted Americans' home heating bills by nearly a half-billion
dollars in January.
   The survey by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration indicated home heating cost Americans $9.98 billion
in January, $470 million more than if weather for the month had
been average.
   That means the typical home owner or renter spent $138.80 on
oil, gas or electricity to keep warm last month, $6.54 more than
the bill would have been in a normal January.
   Costs vary considerably across the country, but bills were above
normal in every area except the Pacific Coast, according to the
monthly report.
   In other economic news on Thursday, a selective midwinter review
of the farm labor situation by the Agriculture Department showed
there were about 11 percent more hired workers on the job than a
year ago.
   A quarterly report showed about 340,000 workers hired by farmers
were on the job during a survey in the week Jan. 10-16, compared
with 307,000 a year earlier.

   The stock market advanced broadly today in what
analysts described as a muted response to news of a smaller U.S.
trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 16.74 to 1,978.28

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures weakened in advance of this afternoon's weekly
Agriculture Department auction of surplus wheat stocks, analysts
said. The agency had said it expected to sell 25 million bushels of
wheat today.
   Corn futures were slightly lower on indications of increased
farmer selling of the grain.
   Soybeans were lower on a lack of follow-through buying from
Thursday's strong close.
   Early trading volume was light ahead of the three-day
Presidents' Day weekend.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.27 a bushel; corn was } cent
to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.01} a bushel; oats were { cent

   Leaders of the 12-nation European
Economic Community looked for a way out of the trading bloc's
financial crisis during an emergency summit today.
   The two-day summit, which began Thursday, stalled for several
hours through the morning as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
the summmit chairman, met separately with several leaders. The
meeting resumed midafternoon.
   The summit adjourned within minutes of the morning opening after
France and Germany threw out proposals for relatively stringent
curbs on the trade bloc's runaway farm spending after seeing
detailed costings drawn up overnight by officials.
   France, seeking less painful measures for its farmers as the
spring presidential election looms, declared it could yield no
more, while British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Dutch
Premier Ruud Lubbers held out for austerity.
   Through most of the morning, the leaders sat around in groups
with their foreign ministers in the main conference room at the EEC
headquarters chatting informally.
   Kohl, striving to head off a third successive EEC summit failure
in eight months, met separately with French Premier Jacques Chirac,
Lubbers, Mrs. Thatcher and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   ``On the steep and difficult climb toward the summit there is a
dense fog and some people have lost their way,'' West German
government spokesman Friedhelm Ost told reporters.
   He said Kohl wanted ``a success, but not a success at any
price.''
   Earlier, French agriculture minister Francois Guillaume, said in
a French radio interview that ``France has no more to give on the
agriculture issue.''
   ``When you reach a certain moment, you have to know how to say
no,'' said Guillaume.
   Dutch spokesman Nic-Jan Jonker told reporters, ``It is wrong to
assume that the Netherlands will give in.''
   In Paris, angry farmers today plowed furrows in the Champ de
Mars, a park near the Eiffel Tower, to protest some EEC members'
proposals for cuts in farm spending.
   About 50 people participated in the demonstration. They dug
several furrows, then left peacefully when police arrived shortly
after noon.
   European leaders argued late into the night Thursday in an
effort to reach agreement on a number of issues. Kohl urged them to
forget their national interests, saying, ``National go-it-alone
policies are doomed to fail now.''
   The Common Market members are grappling with these interrelated
issues:
   _Curbing agriculture spending that totaled $33.8 billion last
year, or two-thirds of the total EEC budget.
   _Raising funds for regional development in the EEC's poorest
areas of Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland.
   _Devising a new EEC funding formula based on the relative wealth
of each member state, which now contribute 1.4 percent of their
sales taxes.
   Two previous summits failed to produce agreement on any of these
issues. Lacking a 1988 budget, the Community is now operating at
last year's funding levels.
   Britain and the Netherlands want the EEC's farm spending to be
raised by $625,000 in 1988. France and West Germany, both with
politically powerful farming lobbies, have sought an increase of
$3.1 billion.
   France also wants production of cereals, a commodity already in
gross oversupply, to be held at 160 million tons annually, as
opposed to 155 million tons as demanded by the Dutch and the
British.
   ``If we accede to the French, we face severe trade problems
(with the United States and other producers). It is not a budgetary
issue,'' Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek told reporters
after the summit's first day.
   But France joined the rich northern countries to defeat
proposals for nearly doubling the $8.8 billion allowance for
regional development. Britain and other northern nations seek an
increase of just 50 percent.

   Stock prices rose today in what analysts
described as a muted response to news of a smaller U.S. trade
deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 15.91 to
1,977.45 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 856 up, 418
down and 522 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.20 billion in December
from $13.22 billion the month before.
   The figure came in at the low end of analysts' estimates, and
lent support to the growing belief that the international trade
situation was improving. American exports set a record for the
second straight month.
   But analysts said traders in the stock and bond markets didn't
see the news as purely positive.
   Given the strength it showed in U.S. manufacturing, they said,
the chances seemed less that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further. Interest rates rose and prices declined
in the credit markets.
   Another apparent drag on the markets was the Labor Department's
report that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.4
percent in January, after falling about the same amount in December.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 1 at 112\; General Electric, up [ at 43\; Ford Motor,
up { at 43], and Exxon, up ~ at 41[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.94 to 144.93. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.96 at 276.36.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 113.17 million shares at
noontime, against 107.27 million at the same point Thursday.

<HEAD>Belgian and Dutch Bank Sign Agreement for Banking Alliance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgium's largest bank Friday announced
it entered a ``banking alliance'' with one of the biggest Dutch
banks to form a major European financial group.
   The Dutch Amro Bank and the Belgian Generale de Banque S.A will
try to set up ``an integrated multinational banking group within
three years,'' said Generale de Banque's chairman, Eric de Villegas
de Clercamp.
   Officials said the two banks launched the venture by acquiring
partial ownership of each other and by putting funds into a joint
holding company, TUBA Holding International BV.
   Each of the two partners has a 50 percent capital stake in TUBA,
which will be managed on a joint basis.
   De Villegas de Clercamp denied that the agreement had been made
with Amro to head off a possible bid by Italian investor Carlo de
Benedetti, who is trying to take effective control of Societe
Generale de Belgique S.A, Belgium's biggest holding company.
   Societe Generale has a 13.4 percent stake in Generale de Banque.
   De Villegas de Clercamp acknowledged, however, that the battle
for control of Societe Generale gave rise to the feeling that the
bank's clients' trust and confidence may have been shaken.
   He said Societe Generale, which has three seats on the bank's
board, had given general approval for the project _ but when it
came to a vote, the three representatives had abstained ``for
personal reasons.'' He did not elaborate.
   Deposits of Generale de Banque amounted to $52.047 billion while
Amro Bank's deposits $58.343 billion, based on 1986 statistics.
   The Generale de Banque chairman said the two banks were forming
the alliance to prepare ``for the intense competition which must be
faced,'' after 1992.
   The European Economic Community has targeted that year for a
complete end to barriers in the exchange of goods, capital and
trade among the 12 member nations.

   Major U.S. banks aren't expected to participate in
Mexico's innovative debt-reduction plan, an American banker said
Friday.
   A senior official at Swiss Bank Corp., however, said his bank
will tender some of its loans.
   The bankers made their comments at a London conference on Latin
America organized by the International Herald Tribune and the
Inter-American Development Bank.
   Under the program, the Mexican government plans to exchange some
of the debt it owes foreign commercial banks for new, 20-year bonds
that will be issued by the government and backed by U.S. Treasury
bonds.
   Mexican officials have indicated they expect to retire $20
billion of debt through the $10 billion bond issue. The country has
$105.6 billion in total outstanding debt.
   In a statement released late Wednesday, the Mexican Treasury
Department said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks
permission to offer the bonds and that it received majority
approval on Feb. 5.
   But Richard Marin, a senior vice president at Bankers Trust Co.,
told the conference, ``I do not believe any major U.S. banks will
tender'' their loans under the Mexican plan.
   U.S. banks have provisions equal to about 25 percent of their
Third World loan exposure and this won't cover the 50 percent
discount at which Mexico expects the banks to swap their loans,
Marin said.
   Marin indicated that the Mexican plan to swap loans for new
bonds is designed for smaller U.S. regional banks that wish to dump
their Mexican exposure.
   Franz Lutolf, general manager at Swiss Bank Corp. said his bank
will submit a bid, and called the plan a ``step in the right
direction.''
   Lutolf wouldn't say at what discount his bank would tender its
loans but indicated it would be above 50 percent of face value.
``Fifty percent won't fly,'' he said.
   An official at Swiss Bank Corp. in Basel, who refused to be
identified, said the bank plans to tender about one-third of its
Mexican loans but wouldn't say how large its exposure is.
   The official said Swiss banks must have provisions equal to at
least 35 percent of their Third World exposure and that his bank is
comfortably above that level.
   Auction of the bonds had been tentatively set for Feb. 26, a
week later than initially planned.

<HEAD>Canada's December Trade Surplus Shrinks To 208 Million Canadian
Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's merchandise trade surplus shrank to 208
million Canadian dollars in December, or about $164 million, the
lowest monthly surplus since September 1981, Statistics Canada said
Friday.
   The December surplus, down from a revised 402 million Canadian
dollars in November, left the full year's surplus at the lowest
level in seven years.
   The 1987 surplus totaled 10.3 billion Canadian dollars, or about
$8.1 billion, down marginally from 10.4 billion Canadian dollars in
1986, the agency said.
   The surplus with the United States, Canada's most important
trading partner, declined to 17 billion Canadian dollars from 18.4
billion Canadian dollars in 1986. Those numbers are reconciled with
the United States.
   Paul Kovacs, senior economist at the Burns Fry investment house
in Toronto, said he had expected 1987 would have ended with a much
stronger trade surplus _ the result of Canada exporting more goods
than it imported.
   ``We clearly had a deteriorating trend at the end of the year,
which is disturbing,'' said Kovacs.
   Exports grew by 4.1 per cent in 1987 from the previous year,
rising to 125.8 billion Canadian dollars largely on strong foreign
sales of forest products.
   However, imports increased at the slightly quicker pace of 4.7
per cent during the year to reach 115.4 billion Canadian dollars by
year end.
   Meanwhile, the trade deficit with Japan, the No. 2 trading
partner, fell to 691 million Canadian dollars from more than 1.6
billion Canadian dollars the year before.
   Statistics Canada said the rise in exports was mainly the result
of an increase of 3.2 billion Canadian dollars in forest-product
sales that came despite export taxes Canada was forced to impose on
softwood lumber because of American action.
   However, foreign sales of automotive products from Canada fell
by 2.2 billion Canadian dollars to 32 billion Canadian dollars.
   Merchandise trade is only about half of Canada's total trade
picture, with the rest coming in service sectors such as tourism,
shipping and consulting.

   Gov. Tommy Thompson asked Wisconsin's
attorney general today to prepare a lawsuit against Chrysler Corp.
because of its plans to close its automaking plant in Kenosha,
Wis., but left open the possibility of a settlement.
   Thompson said it was possible an agreement could be reached with
Chrysler before the issue actually goes to court.
   Asked about the odds of the matter actually ending up in court,
Thompson replied, ``I don't want to engage in a percentage'' at
this time.
   The governor stressed that, in such matters, it is always
desirable to negotiate before going to court.
   ``That would certainly spare the trauma. It would be better off
for both parties to settle'' without going to court, he said.
   ``The attorney general has advised me ... that we do have a good
and winnable case,'' said Thompson, who was joined at a news
conference by Attorney General Don Hanaway.
   Thompson said it could be some time before the suit is filed
over Chrysler's decision to lay off 5,500 workers in Kenosha.
   He said he talked Tuesday with Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and
would meet later with other Chrysler officials. He declined to say
where or when the meeting would occur.
   ``The lawsuit is a type of thing that can be won in several
ways,'' Thompson said.
   The governor said he has asked Hanaway to check with local
government officials in Kenosha and with United Auto Workers union
Local 72 at the Chrysler plant there to see if they want to join in
the lawsuit.
   Thompson repeated his contention that Chrysler's decision to
abandon automaking in Kenosha was political and not economic.
   He said Omni-Horizon cars were being produced at Kenosha
efficiently and were of the highest quality.
   ``There is no reason,'' he said, ``for Chrysler not to live up''
to what the state contends was an agreement by the automaker to
produce the cars at the plant for five years.
   ``All of us at Chrysler are very sorry that the plant had to be
closed. We also feel very deeply for the pain and suffering'' of
the workers and community, Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald
Greenwald said at a news conference in Chicago after Thompson's
announcement.
   ``I guess you could say Chrysler was overly optimistic'' when it
told workers and government officials in Wisconsin that it believed
it could build the Omni-Horizon small car at Kenosha for up to five
years, Greenwald said.
   ``But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no
grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie,'' he said.
   Greenwald said Chrysler will repay the city and county of
Kenosha more than $1 million the governments spent on improvements
for the plant.
   ``My position is the retention of 5,500 jobs for five years,''
Thompson said. ``Those jobs don't necessarily have to be automobile
jobs. They could be other manufacturing jobs.''
   Hanaway said it had not been decided precisely what Wisconsin
would seek in the suit, but he said the state probably would ask
the court for an injunction to delay the layoffs.
   Thompson, asked if defense contracts for the plant might be
something the state would go after, replied: ``I think that is a
possibility.''
   In fiscal year 1987, Chrysler Corp. and three subsidiaries _
Electrospace Systems Inc., Gulfstream Aerospace and American Motors
Corp. _ were awarded 375 Pentagon contracts worth more than $268
million.
   In the first two months of fiscal 1988, the contractors won $11
million in contracts.

   Stock prices rose only moderately on Friday
despite news of an improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 4.2
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,734.0 at the close.
   Volume was a low 323.4 million shares, down from 352.7 million
shares a day earlier.
   The market was calm for most of the morning session as investors
awaited the release of the U.S. trade data. But it responded only
moderately to the better-than-expected report.
   The 100-stock index rose briefly to its session peak of 5.1
points higher after the figures were released.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit
narrowed to $12.2 billion in December from a November deficit of
$13.22 billion.
   Analysts were bemused by the lack of response to the trade
report.
   ``It was a day with nothing but good news for equities, but the
market didn't do anything,'' said Ian Harwood, an analyst at
Warburg Securities.
   ``The market's mood seems to be to look for bad news all the
time,'' he said.
   Harwood attributed the modest response to continued lack of
institutional buying of British shares.

   The dollar jumped higher against most major
foreign currencies in moderate European trading Friday, following
news that the U.S. trade deficit shrank to $12.2 billion in
December from $13.2 billion the previous month.
   Gold prices also moved up.
   The dollar surged quickly after the trade figures were reported,
but profit-taking pushed it back somewhat.
   The dollar finished with a gain of almost two cents against the
British pound and more than two pfennigs against the West German
mark. It also gained more than two yen against the Japanese yen,
but that increase was spread over two days because Thursday was a
national holiday in Japan.
   ``It was a good (trade) number,'' said one London dealer, ``but
overall it's still too early to say the dollar has turned a
corner.''
   Dealers were heartened by the news that exports rose 4.2 percent
to a record $24.8 billion, while imports were unchanged at $37
billion.
   The report also showed the deficit with Japan narrowed to $4.79
billion from $4.85 billion.
   However, dealers said they are reserving judgment on the
dollar's upside potential until Monday, when Japanese trade data
for January will be released.
   A significant reduction in the U.S. trade deficit with Japan
would support the dollar's bullish undertone, dealers said.
   The dollar rose above 130 Japanese yen for the first time since
mid-December, trading at 131.15 yen in London, up from 129.95
earlier in Tokyo, and up from 129.03 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.7123 West German marks, up from 1.6885;
1.4065 Swiss francs, up from 1.3870; 5.7865 French francs, up from
5.7135; 1.9225 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8961; 1,260.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,246.65; and 1.2624 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2663.
   The British pound fell to $1.7401 from $1.7595 late Thursday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $443 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $441.50.
   In Zurich, gold was higher, closing at a bid $443.50 compared
with $441 late Thursday.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $443.69, down
from $443.93.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.34 a troy ounce, compared
with $6.31 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Mattel Posts $100.7 Million 4th Qtr Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toymaker Mattel Inc. on Friday posted
losses of $100.7 million for the fourth quarter and $113.2 million
for the year, with virtually all the red ink accounted for by
restructuring costs.
   The maker of Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels and other toys also
disclosed it has trimmed its headquarters staff by 22 percent over
the last year, to 1,720 workers from 2,200.
   Mattel's troubles reflect a malaise in the toy industry that
persisted through much of last year.
   The company's $100.7 million deficit for the three months ended
Dec. 26 compared with a loss of $26.9 million the previous year.
Revenue was off by 14 percent to $233.8 million from $271.9 million.
   The most recent period included $61.8 million in restructuring
expenses and debt restructuring costs.
   For the full year, the company's deficit of $113.2 million,
compared to a loss of $8.3 million in 1986, came on a 3.7 percent
decline in revenue to $1.02 billion from $1.06 billion.
   The 1987 results included $96 million in restructuring expenses.
   Last month, in the wake of a bitter strike at its production
facility in Manila, Mattel announced it would close that plant and
pull out of the Philippines.
   Mattel, which does all of its manufacturing overseas, shifted
the Philippines work to elsewhere in the Orient. That action was
not a factor in the company's restructuring, which dealt only with
changes at the company's headquarters.

   The stock market gained ground today in a muted
response to news of a smaller U.S. trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 15.42 to
1,976.96 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by 8 to 5 in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 886 up, 558 down and 487
unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.20 billion in December
from $13.22 billion the month before.
   The figure came in at the low end of analysts' estimates, and
lent support to the growing belief that the international trade
situation was improving. American exports set a record for the
second straight month.
   But analysts said traders in the stock and bond markets didn't
see the news as purely positive.
   Given the strength it showed in U.S. manufacturing, they said,
the chances seemed less that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further. Interest rates rose and prices declined
in the credit markets.
   Another apparent drag on the markets was the Labor Department's
report that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.4
percent in January, after falling about the same amount in December.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up | at 111~; General Motors, up 1\ at 66~; Eastman
Kodak, up | at 42{, and Exxon, up \ at 40{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.57 to 144.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 2.07 at 276.47.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 155.47 million shares with an
hour to go.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices leaped higher Friday in
the last hour of trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. Grain
futures closed mixed.
   The soybean rally was sparked by one large speculative firm,
which began snapping up soybean futures and options contracts late
in the session, analysts said.
   The runup triggered computer-controlled buy stops, ``and up she
went,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The August contract gained 10\ cents a bushel.
   Mickey Luth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. said the initial
surge may have been linked to rising European demand for soybean
meal.
   Corn prices retreated slightly on rumors the Agriculture
Department plans to begin auctioning off surplus corn stocks in
April. The program would supposedly be similar to the USDA's
successful weekly wheat auctions, begun in November, which have
increased the supply of wheat on the open market.
   Wheat futures advanced in line with soybeans.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.32{ a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 2 cents lower with March at $2.00} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $1.90{ a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents to 10\ cents higher with March at $6.28 a bushel.

   It's the ultimate Valentine's Day challenge for
lingerie retailers: Can you top this bottom?
   From rhinestone-studded undies to briefs fitted with music boxes
to a club that delivers perfumed, gift-wrapped panties, the
lingerie industry is shedding its cotton-drawer image and
exploiting the holiday of the heart.
   Some insiders say that for this special sub-category of women's
clothing retailers, Valentine's Day is second only to Christmas
when it comes to racking up holiday sales. Their most compelling
sales pitch is that no matter how scanty, lingerie lasts longer
than roses and isn't fattening like chocolates.
   Lila Williams thinks her Panty-of-the-Month Club covers the
territory when it comes to imaginative love tokens. This
Brooklyn-based entrepreneur promises to put one pair of scented,
gift-wrapped designer briefs in the mailbox for $16.50 each month.
   Men are the main purchasers of her hidden couture _ she
estimates 95 percent of the subscriptions to her panty club have
been bought by men.
   With more than 1,000 customers, Williams makes sure the package
and panty are ``color-coded to the season.'' Last year's April
Easter pair had a ``furry, detachable bunny tail;'' the July
``firework special'' was, of course red, white and blue; and New
Year's pair was silver silk.
   Williams said she hand-dyed 600 pieces of lingerie to a minty
green for last St. Patrick's Day, her third-biggest sales period.
This year, however, she found emerald satin panties trimmed with
champagne lace. And don't forget the optional ``Erin Go Bra'' bra.
   But Frederick's of Hollywood's $10 pair of musical panties is a
tough contender.
   Cleverly hidden amid what little red-and-white lace makes up
this undergarment, which a company spokeswoman described as ``very
small,'' is a tiny computer box that can chirp out a rendition of
``Let Me Call You Sweetheart'' at the pull of a string.
   Though long considered outside the realm of high-class lingerie,
Frederick's has managed to spawn 150 stores nationwide and post
annual sales in the $58 million range, spokeswoman Ellen Appel said.
   For those who want to be a bit more extravagant, Bloomingdale's
in New York is selling rhinestone-studded red silk panties for $100
a pair. The matching camisole carries a $250 price tag.
   ``The idea of sleaziness is leaving the American scene,'' said
Carol Palmer, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``Just
look at how the square footage for lingerie in department stores is
increasing.''
   Indeed, the last few years have seen a ``coming out of lingerie
as a real fashion item,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail marketing
consultant and publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report.
   Over a year ago, for example, Bloomingdale's flagship Manhattan
store moved its lingerie department from the more pedestrian ground
floor to upstairs, next to designer clothing, a spokeswoman said.
   ``The industry is growing rather fast,'' Barnard said, pointing
to The Limited Inc. as one major retailer that has focused on
lingerie with its 237-store Victoria's Secret chain.
   ``It's likely we'll see more and more stores affiliated'' with
lingerie spinoffs, Barnard predicted.
   The actual size of the industry is difficult to gauge, partly
because many of the players are private companies and because the
industry does not have a trade association.
   But Ray McInerney, publisher of Intimate Fashion News, said his
publication reported 1986 intimate apparel sales totaled $5.6
billion.
   While trailing sleepwear, which posted 1986 sales of $1.42
billion, and bras, which totaled $1.34 billion, sales of panties
reached $1.1 billion and ranked ahead of robes, slips and girdles.
   Williams finds panties the most essential item. She notes they
come in ``the most colors and styles, they're the least expensive
and most needed'' piece of intimate apparel.
   ``This year has spurred a major growth in pants,'' said Lisa
Goldstein, fashion editor for intimate apparel at Women's Wear
Daily. She says there's a ``silhouette to fit any figure,'' from
bikinis to petits pants.
   Even the G-string and its minisculely more generous sister, the
``thong'' panty, continue to rack up sales. ``I thought they would
be a flash in the pan, but Christian Dior and Lily of France are
doing a very big business in them,'' she said.

<HEAD>Economic Reports Raise Inflation Fears, But Some Fear Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four months after the stock market collapse, the
government on Friday reported a lower trade deficit, rising prices
and mounting piles of unsold goods, baffling the markets over
whether to expect inflation or recession.
   The confusion was first reflected in the inflation-sensitive
bond market, where prices first soared and then sank in a half hour
of wild gyrations. Stocks and the dollar rose.
   Interest rates finished the day higher in a setback for
individual and corporate borrowers that some economists believe
could tip the precariously balanced economy into recession.
   The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit
shrank to $12.2 billion in December, the lowest figure since
January 1987, even though the gap for all of 1987 totaled a record
$171.2 billion.
   Exporting manufacturers are continuing to do a booming business,
but demand for imports remains healthy as well, the trade report
showed.
   The impression of a strong, potentially inflationary economy was
heightened by the Labor Department's report that wholesale prices
rose 0.4 percent in January.
   The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond _ an
indicator for interest rates throughout the economy _ rose to 8.44
percent from 8.35 percent late Thursday as the bond's price sagged.
   Wall Street took the reports more favorably than the bond market
as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.72 points to
1,983.26 one hour before the close of New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   The dollar strengthened about 1.2 percent percent against key
currencies, rising to about 131 Japanese yen and 1.71 West German
marks.
   Contrasting with the signs of economic strength was one sign of
weakness: The Commerce Department said business inventories shot up
0.8 percent in December, the third consecutive large monthly
advance.
   The reports suggested that since the Oct. 19 stock plunge, the
economy remains balanced on the knife edge between inflation,
brought on by the improvement in trade, and recession, brought on
by tight credit and sluggish consumer spending.
   Friday's jump in interest rates was interpreted by some
economists as evidence that investors are confident about economic
growth and concerned about the risks of inflation.
   In addition to the reports on trade and wholesale prices, the
economy showed sparks of life in Thursday's report that retail
sales rose 0.5 percent in January.
   ``We believe that there is enough strength in the manufcturing
sector to prevent a recession. And if we get any strength in the
consumer side, that's just gravy,'' said Douglas Schindewolf,
associate economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   But other economists said the economy shows fundamental signs of
weakness, such as the report that inventories of unsold goods are
piling up on shelves.
   Investors are not especially worried about a resurgence of
inflation, argued Robert Brusca, chief fixed-income economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   Disagreeing with the prevailing interpretation, Brusca argued
that investors sold bonds Friday because they had been expecting a
cut in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve and didn't get it.
   Brusca said the Federal Reserve made a mistake by not cutting
the discount rate, which would have made life easier for borrowers
and resuscitated an ailing economy.
   ``When the patient has been pulled out of a pool, that's a good
time to administer artificial resuscitation, rather than wait till
he stops breathing,'' Brusca said.
   The increase in producer prices reported Friday was not large
and followed three months of decline, Brusca said, arguing against
the likelihood of zooming inflation.
   ``I'm concerned about what the Fed has done here; I don't think
it's good,'' Brusca said.
   Merrill Lynch & Co. economists believe Friday's reports confirm
their view that the economy will continue to slog forward through
1988 and that a recession is not likely until 1989, said senior
economist Bruce Steinberg.
   Steinberg said he does not believe a discount rate cut is either
imminent or needed.

<HEAD>Posner Avoids Prison; Agrees To Community Service, Help Homeless</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner avoided a
prison term for federal income tax evasion, but agreed Friday to
pay $3 million to help South Florida's homeless, pay more than $4
million in back taxes and penalties and give 5,000 hours in
community service over five years.
   The 69-year-old Miami Beach businessman, whose holdings include
controlling interests in Royal Crown Cola and Arby's, had little to
say after the sentencing hearing, but told reporters:
   ``I've been involved in charity works all my life, and I've
given millions and millions to charity.''
   U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman cautioned Posner in court:
   ``Not one dollar of the funds of this project are
tax-deductible!''
   Posner faced up to 40 years in prison after pleading no contest
Sept. 29 to evading more than $1.2 million in federal taxes by
inflating the value of land he donated to a Bible college as a tax
exemption.
   A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt, only a statement
that the defendant will offer no defense. For sentencing purposes,
it is equal to a guilty plea or conviction.
   Aside from paying the $4 million in back taxes, penalties,
interest and fines, Posner was ordered to pay the cost of his own
prosecution.
   Spellman said the homeless project will include Dade, Broward
and Palm Beach counties and he appointed a committee of civic
leaders to determine how the money will be spent.
   The judge warned that failure to abide by the terms of the
agreement could result in jail time for Posner.
   The judge directed that, as part of his community service,
Posner spend five hours a day for one day each of the next eight
weeks at Camillus House, a downtown Miami mission for the homeless.
   During the hearing, Posner's attorney, Edward Bennett Williams
of Washington D.C., pleaded for an alternative to jail time.
   Williams said Posner had always considered the tax case a civil
matter. But the Internal Revenue Service did not see it that way,
and started a criminal investigation eight years ago.
   ``Because it is a unique case, it provides the court with an
opportunity under which Mr. Posner could give of himself and his
resources for the benefit of South Florida,'' Williams said.
   ``There are matters crying out for remedy,'' Williams told the
court. ``It would serve no useful purpose to incarcerate this
defendant. I appeal to your mercy and I appeal to your justice.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Cartusciello argued that a jail
term was necessary as a deterrent to others.
   ``Mr. Posner lied to the Internal Revenue Service and he
corrupted others,'' he said. ``In his statement to the probation
officers he makes the same claims and tells the same lies.''
   ``He doesn't show he's remorseful, that he's sorry. The honest
taxpayers end up paying a disproportionate burden,'' the prosecutor
said.
   Posner entered the plea a month before he was to be retried. His
1986 conviction was set aside because of jury irregularities.
   He pleaded in September to 10 charges: conspiracy to evade
income taxes, four counts of tax evasion and five counts of making
false statements in a tax return.
   Posner was indicted in 1982, accused of filing false returns
between 1975 and 1979 and evading $1.2 million in taxes by
inflating the value of property he donated to Miami Christian
College.
   Miami real estate broker William H. Scharrer Sr. was charged
with aiding and abetting in the tax violations. He was convicted in
1984 and sentenced to 18 months.
   Posner's holdings also include controlling interests in Sharon
Steel and the Graniteville textile company. He was named America's
highest-paid executive by Business Week magazine in 1985.
   The industrialist, who rarely grants public interview,
reportedly earned $8.6 million in 1986 and his fortune was
estimated at $240 million by Forbes magazine in 1984.
   He has sold off holdings in recent years to pay company debts.
   His Evans Products Co. and Sharon Steel filed for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law.

<HEAD>Posts Loss as Probe of Home Video Unit Widens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lorimar Telepictures Corp. posted a
$19.2 million third-quarter loss Friday after setting aside $22
million in reserves for possible future losses by its home-video
division.
   A year ago, Lorimar ousted the three top executives of the home
video operation, including its founder and president Stuart Karl,
amid allegations of conflict of interest. An internal probe has
been under way since then.
   Lorimar's loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 narrowed from
a loss of $21.7 million a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter
rose by nearly 30 percent to $255.1 million from $196.8 million.
   The $22 million reserve is to cover potentially uncollectable
accounts receivable and a writedown on the value of inventory
because of overstocking some titles.
   For the nine months, Lorimar posted a loss of $82.6 million,
which included a $45 million writedown on the value of the final
five movies made by the ousted management of the film division. In
the first nine months of 1986, the company lost $4.1 million.
   Revenue for the nine months were up 17.3 percent to $616.8
million from $525.7 million.
   Last November, Lorimar sued Karl charging that he breached his
fiduciary duty in running the operation. Karl has denied any
wrongdoing.
   Separately, Lorimar disclosed that it has had to reduce the sale
price of of its New York-based advertising agencies _ Bozell,
Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt Inc. and Poppe Tyson Inc. _ by slightly
over $10 million to $133 million.
   But the company said it is proceeding with sale to members of
the agencies' management, with the deal expected to close within a
week.
   Lorimar will show a pre-tax gain of about $16 million on the
deal.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Gets Financing For American Standard Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black & Decker Corp. announced Friday that a
group of commercial banks has arranged $2.2 billion in financing
for the company's $2.1 billion hostile takeover attempt for
American Standard Inc.
   The syndidate is composed of 19 domestic and foreign banks,
including Chase Manhattan Bank, which earlier pledged $750 million
of its own funds toward the deal, the company said.
   American Standard has vowed to fight Black & Decker's
$65-per-share bid, saying it will consider a restructuring,
leveraged buyout or a friendly merger with another company. The New
York-based manufacturer of plumbing, heating and air conditioning
equipment has urged its shareholders to reject the offer and has
adopted a ``poison pill'' plan allowing shareholders to buy back
their stock at half market value if the takeover succeeds.
   Black & Decker, which currently owns just 100 shares of the
company, launched an effort Wednesday to oust American Standard's
board of directors. Shareholders will be asked to vote their shares
to remove 10 members of the company's board, Black & Decker said.
One of the objectives, the suitor said, was to remove the poison
pill plan.
   The Towson, Md.-based tool and appliance maker also announced
the expiration of a waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The law required a 30-day
cooling off period to check for possible antitrust violations.
   ``The screening process is over and that means there are no
antitrust implications,'' said Black & Decker spokeswoman Barbara
Lucas.
   Mrs. Lucas said the agreements with the banks are for permanent
financing of the takeover. Some of the $2.2 billion loan is for
expenses related to the deal, she said.
   Black & Decker launched its bid for American Standard on Jan. 28.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Takeover Protection Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Richard Celeste signed into law
Friday emergency legislation that enables the state to assess the
economic impact of takeover bids by foreign corporations.
   The law, which takes effect immediately and expires July 1, was
prompted by Campeau Corp.'s billion bid to acquire or merge with
Federated Department Stores, Inc., Celeste said.
   Campeau is headquartered in Toronto; Federated is based in
Cincinnati.
   ``With the help of this bill, we will use every resource
available to investigate the impact of this offer and take whatever
action is necessary to prevent the loss of jobs in the Cincinnati
area,'' Celeste said.
   Separately, Campeau Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert
Campeau cautioned that any attempt by Federated to enter into
agreements with other firms would be met with a ``vigorous legal
challenge.''
   In a letter to Henry Kravis of the leveraged-buyout firm of
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co., Campeau noted that it has been
``widely reported'' that KKR has expressed interest in Federated.
   Campeau said the firm ``cannot enter into such arrangements
without our having a full and fair opportunity to compete with any
offer you make, including providing us with any information
provided to you or any other third parties.''
   Under Ohio's new law, foreign businesses trying to acquire an
Ohio business are required to disclose financing plans and any
intent to sell the target company's assets to pay for the
acquisition.
   Companies must make the disclosure to the Department of
Development, which is then authorized to conduct an economic impact
review and also can involve other departments, including commerce
and taxation.
   ``This legislation protects target corporations with a
considerable presence in Ohio by requiring bidders to explain their
financing plans,'' the governor said.
   Celeste said serious questions have arisen about the amount of
debt involved in the transaction.
   John Chester, a Columbus attorney representing Federated, said
Thursday that enactment of the bill should send a signal to
Toronto-based Campeau that Federated has obtained some of the
protection it wanted.
   A companion bill requested by Federated effectively has been put
on hold. The measure would have expanded Ohio's existing
anti-takeover law to include certain non-Ohio corporations licensed
to do business in the state.
   But lawmakers said there were substantial constitutional
questions and other concerns about the bill.
   Campeau's $5.4 billion, $61-per-share offer to merge with
Federated was made as an alternative to its outstanding $4.2
billion hostile tender offer.
   Federated employs about 16,000 people in Ohio, and has a payroll
of $237 million annually.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Leap 10 Cents A Bushel In Late Surge</HEAD>

   Soybean futures prices leaped as much as 10\ cents a bushel
Friday as speculators sparked a final-hour surge on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   On other markets, grain futures were mixed; precious metals
firmed; energy futures retreated and stock-index futures advanced.
   The soybean rally was kicked off by one large speculative firm,
which began snapping up soybean futures and options contracts late
in the session, analysts said.
   ``During the first two and half hours of the trading session, it
was basically a liquidation market with prices easier following a
runup during the week,'' said Mickey Luth, an analyst in Chicago
with the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Then it started rallying and rallying and ran up to new highs
on the day,'' he said.
   The runup triggered computer-controlled buy stops, ``and up she
went,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   The August contract gained 10\ cents a bushel.
   Luth said the buying may have been linked to rising European
demand for soybean meal.
   Corn prices retreated slightly on rumors the Agriculture
Department plans to begin auctioning off surplus corn stocks in
April, Lespinasse said. The program would supposedly be similar to
the USDA's successful weekly wheat auctions, begun in November,
which increase the supply of grain on the open market.
   Wheat futures advanced in line with soybeans. After the close,
the USDA announced substantial new export business, including new
sales of wheat to China, Algeria and Finland.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 3{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at $3.32\ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 1} cents
lower with March at $2.01 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent
higher with March at $1.90{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 10\
cents higher with March at $6.27{ a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures posted their best gains in more than a
week on New York's Commodity Exchange in apparent defiance of
government trade figures released Friday.
   The Commerce Department reported the U.S. trade deficit had
narrowed to $12.2 billion in December compared with $13.2 billion
in November. The lower-than-expected number helped strengthen the
dollar, which often leads to lower gold prices.
   Instead, gold futures gained more than $5 a troy ounce, perhaps
in reaction to the Labor Department's announcement that wholesale
prices rose a brisk 0.4 percent in January, said Craig Sloane, an
analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Sloane said Thursday's government report of a 0.5 percent rise
in retail sales in January also may have helped the metals markets,
which had been drifting lower on ideas the economy was slipping
into a recession.
   The increase in retail sales ``could suggest the economy is not
going into recession and I think that is something the metal
markets in general would view favorably,'' Sloane said. ``The last
thing they want to hear right now is anything having to do with
recession.''
   Gold settled $5.30 to $7.50 higher with the April at $448.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 8.3 cents higher with March at
$6.39 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures slumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
mostly technical trading, analysts said.
   Merrill Lynch analyst John Hill said the charts continued to
look weak, and he predicted further declines on Tuesday, when
trading resumes after the holiday weekend.
   Hill also said many traders were selling crude-oil contracts for
March delivery and buying contracts for later delivery, an
indication they expect oil prices to fall in the near term.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 34 cents
lower with March at $16.77 a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to
.79 cent lower with March at 46.60 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .37 cent to .76 cent lower, with March at 46.28 cents
a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on expectations of a surge in slaughters.
   Many traders expect livestock marketings to increase next week
as milder weather moves into the Plains and Midwest, said Roger
Norem, an analyst for Agri-Visor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 71.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with March at 83.30 cents a pound; hogs were .43
cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at 47.25 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to .78 cent lower with February
at 55.80 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.55 points higher at 258.80. The underlying spot
index finished 1.67 points higher at 257.63.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows, But Wholesale Prices, Inventories Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture
Friday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRADE DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $12.2 billion in December,
down from $13.2 billion in November and $17.6 billion in October.
But the overall $171.2 billion shortfall for 1987 was the highest
ever.
   Exports in December climbed 4.2 percent to a record $24.8
billion, while imports held steady at $37 billion, the same as the
month before.
   Analysts credited the devalued dollar, which makes American
goods cheaper abroad, for the recent export surge.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHOLESALE PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The steepest increase in food prices in nearly 18 months, partly
offset by falling energy costs, pushed wholesale prices in January
up 0.4 percent, equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of 4.6
percent.
   The rise followed three months of declines and was the largest
since a 0.4 percent increase in September.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose by $5.45 billion, or 0.8 percent, in
December, following even larger increases of 0.9 percent in
November and 1.1 percent in October.
   The large rise in inventories was led by a 1.5 percent increase
in stockpiles held by retailers. Inventories held by wholesalers
rose 0.6 percent, while manufacturing stockpiles were up 0.4
percent.
   Many economists say the swelling backlog of unsold products
could retard growth in the coming months.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Business sales rose 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $466.57
billion in December following two months of sluggish activity.
Business sales fell a revised 0.4 percent in November, more than
initially reported.
   The sales increase was paced by a 2.2 percent rise in sales by
manufacturers. Sales by retailers were up 1.2 percent, while sales
at the wholesale level were essentially unchanged.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The stock market showed a moderate gain in a muted response to
news of a smaller U.S. trade deficit. The Dow Jones average rose
21.72 to 1,983.26, extending its gain for the week to 72.78 points.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLLAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened about 1.2 percent against key
currencies, rising to about 131 Japanese yen and 1.71 West German
marks.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OIL PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices moved lower, pulled down by technical factors and
slumping prices in Europe, analysts said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for March
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
closed at $16.75 per 42-gallon barrel, down 36 cents from Thursday.
   Among refined products, wholesale heating oil contracts fell
0.75 cent to 46.60 cents per gallon, while wholesale unleaded
gasoline sold for 46.28 cents per gallon, down 0.37 cent.

<DATELINE>LEONIA, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaguar Cars Inc. announced Friday a recall
of 16,000 1988 Jaguar XJ6 and Vanden Plas models in the United
States because of possible problems in the front suspension system.
   Jaguar said stress corrosion may cause certain lower-spring pan
fixings in the front suspension system to fail. Such failures could
cause the vehicle's front sspension to settle onto the bump stop on
one side of the car, Jaguar said.
   The company said the car would not lose steering or braking, and
that no accidents or injuries have been reported from the problem.
   Owners will be told by mail when to make appointments with
Jaguar dealers to have new fixings installed at no cost, the
company said.

   The stock market gained ground in moderate
trading Friday, mustering only a subdued response to news of a
smaller U.S. trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.72 to 1,983.26,
extending its gain for the week to 72.78 points.
   Advancing stocks outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 among New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 937 up, 556 down and 473
unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 177.19 million shares, down from 200.76
million in the previous session.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.20 billion in December
from $13.22 billion the month before.
   The figure came in at the low end of analysts' estimates, and
lent support to the growing belief that the international trade
situation was improving. American exports set a record for the
second straight month.
   But analysts said traders in the stock and bond markets didn't
see the news as purely positive.
   Given the strength it showed in U.S. manufacturing, they said,
the chances seemed less that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further. Interest rates rose and prices declined
in the credit markets.
   Another apparent drag on the markets was the Labor Department's
report that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.4
percent in January, after falling about the same amount in December.
   As they had on last month's trade report, stocks registered just
about all their gains in the first half hour of trading, and then
spent the rest of the session drifting in a narrow range.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up } at 112; Ford Motor, up { at 43]; Eastman Kodak, up ~
at 42}, and Exxon, up \ at 40{.
   General Motors, benefiting from upbeat appraisals of its
earnings report early in the week, rose 1{ to 67[.
   United Inns paced the day's percentage gainers, jumping 7] to
26{. The company said it retained an investment banking firm to
advise it on potential takeover offers that ``have or might be
made.''
   MCA climbed 5\ to 45. The company said it was notified by Donald
Trump, the real estate developer and financier, that he had
acquired a block of MCA stock and might increase his stake to as
much as 24.9 percent.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $15.74 billion, or
0.62 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.87 to 144.86.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 201.46 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 2.22 to 296.07,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.68 at 257.63.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 2.23 to 353.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 277.00, up 2.60.

<HEAD>Leysen Fails in Soc. Generale Bid; Big Boost for De Benedetti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgian financier Andre Leysen Friday
failed to push through a Franco-Belgian deal to control Societe
Generale de Belgique SA, giving rival Italian investor Carlo De
Benedetti's bid a major boost.
   Leysen could not get enough backing from a group of mostly
Belgian investors to ratify an accord with the French holding Cie.
Financiere de Suez to restructure Belgium's biggest holding concern
and keep it anchored in Belgium.
   Leysen said he considered his mandate as spokesman for the group
as over.
   Because of the failure, the battle for control for Societe
Generale, one of the pillars of the Belgian economy, remains open.
   Suez, however, said ``it is continuing discussions with all the
Belgian shareholders'' wanting to cooperate in gaining control of
the company that has a stake in a third of the Belgian economy.
   It said Leysen's decision to relinquish his leading role
``absolutely does not call into question the goal sought by the
Belgian and French partners'' to restructure the 166-year-old
company.
   Societe Generale has interests in about 1,400 companies
worldwide with assets totaling nearly $3 billion.
   De Benedetti did not comment on Friday's developments. He wants
effective control of Societe Generale in order to use it as a
platform for a pan-European financial holding.
   He also has offered to continue negotiations with the Belgian
shareholders but has excluded Suez from such negotiations.
   The Italian investor claims to be the biggest shareholder and
says he can control, through allies, 38 percent of stock in the
company. He is launching a public offer Monday for 15 percent more.
   In the public offer, De Benedetti is willing to offer 4,000
francs ($114.30) per share, 150 francs ($4.30) less than Friday's
closing price on the Brussels stock exchange.
   The price had plunged 14 percent Friday from 4,850 francs
($138.60) and brokers blamed it on Leysen's failure, which caused
many market participants to conclude De Benedetti had won the
battle for control.
   The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around Leysen said
it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while Suez claimed 15
percent. Together with allies Leysen said they had a majority of
shares.
   But important groups within the coalition did not support the
accord. Cobepa, linked to Leysen and Paribas, a French rival of
Suez, has an estimated 4 percent of the shares of Societe Generale
and said the plan lacked a clear industrial program.
   The Belgian group uniting beer brewers Artois and Piedboeuf also
failed to agree to the terms.
   The accord was favored by the current management of Societe
Generale, which has come under sharp attack by De Benedetti.
   Friday's developments followed a week of frantic negotiations
between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat De
Benedetti's bid to create a pan-European holding centered around
the Belgian company.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall On Inflation Worries, Fading Hopes for Lower
Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices sagged Friday as hopes faded for
continued declines in interest rates and concerns grew about
inflation.
   The activity occurred against a backdrop of new government
reports that included a smaller-than-expected December trade
deficit and a rise in wholesale prices in January.
   By late afternoon, the Treasury's 30-year bond was off ~ point,
or $8.75 for every $1,000 in face value. It rose more than $10
shortly after the trade report was released before quickly
reversing course.
   Its yield climbed to 8.43 percent from 8.35 percent late
Thursday.
   The government reported the U.S. trade imbalance fell to $12.2
billion in December from $13.2 billion in November.
   The report sent bond prices higher because the deficit was lower
than many analysts had expected and indicated the gap could shrink
without new declines in the dollar. A falling dollar discourages
foreign investors such as the Japanese from buying U.S. securities.
   But the rise was shortlived as bond prices abruptly changed
direction.
   Analysts said the reversal occurred because the market's
attention shifted from the trade report to a second government
report that wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in January after a
0.4 percent decline in December.
   Paul Boltz, chief financial economist for T. Rowe Price
Associates, a Baltimore-based investment company, said the
wholesale price numbers triggered some concerns about inflation,
which would erode the value of bonds.
   At midday, the Federal Reserve took steps for the second day in
a row to arrange securities sales that had the effect of draining
reserves from the banking system.
   Some analysts said that signaled the central bank had no
intention of further relaxing its credit policy, and that it raised
questions about whether it had eased its policy earlier this week
as some economists believed it had.
   The federal funds rate, the closely-watched interest charge on
short-term loans between banks, edged up to 6 11-16 percent from 6{
percent late Thursday.
   The rate is often seen as an indication of which way the Fed
wants short-term rates to go, and when it fell below 6 percent
earlier this week, some economists concluded that the Fed had
relaxed its credit policy.
   ``The market had gotten overexuberant on the possibility of
further Fed easing ... but after the Fed drained reserves, the
funds rate kicked up. The prospect of Fed easing is up in the
air,'' said Elliott Platt, research director for the investment
firm Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc.
   Late Friday afternoon, the Fed disclosed its policymakers
decided in December to end aggressive efforts to push interest
rates lower, believing that the immediate threat from the October
stock market collapse had passed.
   Fed policymakers met again Tuesday and Wednesday but did not
disclose any results of their actions.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds on Friday, prices of
short-term governments fell \ point, intermediate maturities
dropped | point and 20-year issues fell 1[ points, according to
figures provided by the financial information service Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.52 to 113.32. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, lost 5.47
to 1,185.17.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 1.31 to 282.65.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 12 basis points to
5.75 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 10 basis points to 6.01 percent and one-year
bills gained 8 basis points to 6.25 percent.

   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $12.2
billion in December as exports hit new records, but the overall
$171.2 billion shortfall for 1987 still measured the highest ever,
the government said Friday.
   December's merchandise trade deficit was down from $13.2 billion
in November and from $17.6 billion in October, and was the smallest
figure since a $11.9 billion trade gap in January 1987, the
Commerce Department said.
   The improvement was driven by a 4.2 percent rise in exports,
which reached record levels for the second month in a row.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
21.72 to 1,983.26, a subdued response to the trade report. Bond
prices fell as concern grew about inflation, but the dollar soared
against most major currencies.
   Both private and government analysts pointed toward the December
report as strong evidence of the long-awaited reversal in the
nation's trade peformance.
   ``The tide has turned,'' declared Allen Sinai, chief economist
for the Boston Company Economic Advisers Inc.
   Exports in December were $24.8 billion, a new record, up from
$23.8 billion in November, the previous record. Imports, meanwhile,
held steady at $37.0 billion, the same as the month before.
   ``We're beginning to see our economy driven by exports and that
means economic vitality and increased jobs for Americans,''
Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said in a statement.
   But he said the overall deficit for the year _ up 9.6 percent
from $156.2 billion in 1986 _ was ``unacceptable. We have a long
way to go until we can be comfortable.''
   For all of 1987, Americans imported $424.1 billion in goods from
other countries while exporting $252.9 billion, compared with 1986
imports of $383.0 billion and exports of $226.8 billion.
   Analysts credited the slide in the dollar _ now worth half of
its 1985 value against the Japanese yen and key European currencies
_ as being the major factor in the recent export surge.
   A devalued dollar makes American goods cheaper abroad.
   And, while it will also eventually drive up the price of
imports, this effect has not yet been fully realized as many
foreign manfacturers take smaller profit margins to hang onto their
share of lucrative U.S. markets, analysts said.
   Still other economists suggested that the December figures be
looked at cautiously, claiming that the monthly trade figures _
although closely watched by financial markets _ tend to be erratic.
   For one thing, the figures are not adjusted to remove the impct
of seasonal factors, such as increases in imports before Christmas
and when new-model auto shipments come in early each summer.
   On a seasonal basis, the trade gap traditionally improves in
December and January, economists said.
   To meet this concern, the Commerce Department announced on
Friday that, beginning with the release of April trade figures, it
would ``seasonally adjust'' the monthly data.
   In other economic data on Friday:
   _The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose 0.4
percent in January, equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of
4.6 percent, with higher costs for a variety of items, including
food, offsetting lower energy prices.
   _The Commerce Department said business inventories shot up 0.8
percent in December, the third consecutive large monthly advance,
pushing unsold stockpiles on shelves and backlots up by $5.45
billion to a seasonally adjusted $701.87 billion.
   Of the December trade figures, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said, ``This is a sign that there are better days ahead on
the trade front.''
   And Jay Goldinger, senior economist for Cantor, Fitzgerald, a
bond brokerage, predicted that imports would soon begin to fall as
sharply as exports have risen, ``as we work off the high level of
import inventories.''
   ``We're in the middle of a major change of course. But it's a
big ship and you don't turn around a big ship on a dime,''
Goldinger said. ``At least we know we're headed home again.''
   The United States continued to run its largest deficit with
Japan last year _ $59.8 billion, up from $58.6 billion in 1986.
However, imports from Japan in December held at their November
level of $4.8 billion.
   Eclipsing Western Europe for the first time as the
second-largest trade deficit were the so-called four ``tigers'' of
Asia, the newly industrialized nations of Taiwan, South Korea, Hong
Kong and Singapore. Together, the trade deficit with those nations
in 1987 rose to $37.7 billion, up from $30.8 billion in 1986.
   The deficit with Western Europe, meanwhile, narrowed to $30.2
billion from $32.7 billion in the previous year.
   Trade accounts with Canada _ this nation's largest single
trading partner _ also improved during 1987, to a deficit of $11.7
billion from $13.2 billion in 1986.
   For the full year, imports of manufactured goods rose 10.7
percent to $325.2 billion while exports of U.S. manufactured goods
rose 15.3 percent to $171.5 billion.
   Oil imports were up 19.1 percent, to $44.8 billion, as oil
prices rebounded from their 1986 collapse.
   And in the only major category in which the United States has
consistently maintained a surplus, farm product exports were up 9.6
percent, to $28.6 billion.
   Automobile imports from Japan totaled $22.2 billion for the
year, a 0.9 percent increase. But those from Canada were down 13.5
percent to $10.2 billion.
   From all other countries, auto imports were up a sharp 32.2
percent, to $16.8 billion, reflecting popularity of model lines
like the South Korean Hyundai automobile.

<HEAD>Gillette Announces Settlement in Revlon Suit</HEAD>

   Gillette Co. announced Friday the settlement of 16
lawsuits brought against the company and its directors in 1986 by
Revlon Group Inc. after it abandoned efforts to gain control of
Gillette.
   The settlement, subject to U.S. District Court review, requires
Gillette's non-employee directors to fully evaluate all takeover
proposals and stock repurchase agreements for the next three years.
The directors must also obtain advice from financial experts on
takeover bids and make certain public statements about the offers.
   In addition, Gillette must pay up to $550,000 to cover legal
fees as part of the settlement.
   Fourteen class action suits were filed by Revlon on behalf of
Gillette shareholders shortly after the company signed a November
1986 agreement prohibiting any attempts to takeover Gillette for 10
years. Two other suits were filed in 1987 as amendments to the
original suits.
   Revlon made two offers for Gillette, the latest a $5.4 billion
stock buyout bid in 1986.
   Gillette bought back from Revlon about 24 million shares at
$29.25 a share following the agreement, said Gillette spokesman
David Fausch.
   Revlon had acquired 14 percent of stock from Gillette, which is
presently facing a takeover attempt by New York-based Coniston
Partners.

<HEAD>Trump May Seek Up to 24.9 Pct of MCA</HEAD>

   New York investor Donald Trump may
seek up to 24.9 percent of MCA Inc., the parent of Universal
Studios, the entertainment conglomerate said Friday.
   It has been speculated for more than a year that MCA would be a
takeover target, but until now no suitor has emerged.
   Some analysts have long contended the company's stock was
undervalued. But it was believed a hostile takeover would be
difficult because MCA is ruled with an iron hand by Lew Wasserman,
the last of the old-line movie moguls.
   Wasserman, 74, has been with MCA and its forerunner, Music Corp.
of America, since 1936.
   In a brief announcement, MCA said it had been notified by Trump
that he owns 375,000 of the company's shares and may seek to
acquire 24.9 percent.
   MCA has 77.1 million shares outstanding.
   MCA's announcement came after the stock market closed, but the
company's stock already had jumped by $5.25 per share to $45 on
rumors that a takeover bid was in the offing.
   Like most other companies, MCA's shares took a beating in the
stock market crash and never fully recovered. In the past year,
their highest price was $64.50.
   Trump spokeswoman Norma Foerderer in New York said she had no
comment.
   MCA takeover speculation peaked in mid-1987 when Wasserman was
hospitalized for a prolonged period after what was to have been
routine surgery to remove a polyp from his colon.
   However, Wasserman did return to the helm of the entertainment
giant after five weeks, reportedly with his corporate power
undiminished.
   To dissaude suitors, MCA last July adopted a ``poison-pill''
permitting stockholders to buy new shares at half price if a
hostile bidder acquired more than 20 percent of MCA or made an
unsolicited tender offer for more than 30 percent.
   Wasserman's control comes more from the respect he commands than
from the stock he controls.
   Wasserman owns 6.9 percent of MCA's stock and controls another
8.9 percent through a series of trusts, including those of the
family of MCA founder Jules Stein.
   From its beginning as a Hollywood talent-booking agency, MCA has
grown into a powerhouse in producing movies, television
programming, records and toys.
   It operates a successful backlot tour of Universal Studios here,
is building one in Florida and has agreed to build one in Japan. In
all three locations, it would be competing with theme parks by its
arch-rival Walt Disney Co.
   MCA also is involved in book publishing, retail and mail-order
businesses.
   In 1987, MCA earned $137.9 million, or $1.97 per share, a
decrease of 9 percent from a year earlier when it netted $150.9
million, or $1.97 per share.
   The decline would have been even more dramatic except that the
1986 results already were depressed by a $50 million writeoff to
cover bills it was unlikely to collect from independent television
stations that had used MCA programs.
   Trump, who made his fortune in New York real estate, is building
a casino empire with two hotel-gaming houses already in Atlantic
City, N.J., and a permit pending for a third one.
   Trump also is seeking to gain total control of Atlantic
City-based Resorts International Inc. He already owns 90 percent of
the company's voting power.
   In addition, Trump in the past has acquired stakes in takeover
targets and later sold them for a handsome profit.
