   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Opposition leader Louis Dejoie was
summoned to court next week for a hearing apparently related to his
arrest on charges of inciting the public to revolt, a Dejoie aide
said Friday.
   Aide Philippe Stevenson said Dejoie's lawyer had mistakenly
informed him that the hearing was Friday.
   Stevenson said that Dejoie went to the Palace of Justice Friday
morning, but was informed by court officials that his hearing was
not until Thursday.
   ``I think it will be just to close his case since he was
officially in provisional liberty,'' Stevenson said.
   Neither Dejoie's lawyer, Georges Leger, nor Dejoie could be
reached at their homes for comment.
   Dejoie was arrested Jan. 20 when he returned from a monthlong
trip to the United States, Canada and the West Indies. During the
trip he called for an economic boycott of Haiti to protest the
aborted Nov. 29 election and government-run elections Jan. 17.
   Dejoie was charged with inciting the public to riot and held for
two days before his release.
   The Nov. 27 elections, which were run by an independent
Electoral Council, were canceled after thugs killed 34 people and
wounded 76. Witnesses said the army did not stop the violence and
in some cases participated in it.
   President Leslie Manigat won a Jan. 17 election that was
boycotted by the major candidates from the Nov. 27 balloting.
Turnout was low and there was no secret ballot.

   Six Cuban prisoners became unruly during a
cell transfer Friday, and three officers and an inmate suffered
minor injuries in the fracas, authorities said.
   The six began ``ranting and raving and throwing things,'' said
Sheriff Aubrey Cole. He said the inmates were not trying to escape.
   The prisoners, who are being housed by the county for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, were being taken to
separate cells when they jumped some jailers and officers, Cole
said.
   ``When they opened the cell and moved them out into the hallway
they began to fight the officers,'' Cole said.
   Dispatcher David Weaver, Deputy Jack Myers, and jailer Eddie
Johnson suffered minor injuries, Cole said. An inmate also was
bruised. No medical treatment was needed, Cole said.
   All six prisoners will be charged with assault on peace officers
and will be returned to the custody of the INS, Cole said.
   Cole said the sheriff's department called the Jasper Police
Department for help.
   A subsequent search of the prisoners' cell uncovered two
homemade weapons that had been fashioned from metal electrical
switch plates taken from the walls, sharpened and wrapped at one
end with cloth, Cole said.
   Five Cuban nationals escaped from the jail in October. All five
were later apprehended.

   Stage director Yuri Lyubimov, who has been called
the Soviet Union's greatest theatrical figure, says he misses his
homeland but welcomes the changes going on there since he was
exiled four years ago.
   ``I miss my theater, my friends and my relatives, but if I want
snow I can always go to Canada or Chicago or call on Solzhenitsyn
in Vermont,'' he said in an interview at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden.
   ``I also miss the unique Soviet audiences who hunger for
something spiritual,'' said Lyubimov, among the world's outstanding
directors.
   Lyubimov, a youthful 70, this year became a citizen of Israel.
He lives in Jerusalem with his Hungarian wife, Katalin, and son,
Peter. Another son, Nikita, is in Moscow.
   Lyubimov talked to The Associated Press on Wednesday night at
the stage door after an applauded revival of his production of
``Jenufa'' by Czech composer Leos Janacek.
   ``Jenufa'' was first produced in 1904 and is a dark tale of
peasant life, murder and penance.
   Lyuibmov ran Moscow's defiant Taganka Theater and was on a
London visit to direct a play in March 1984 when he became came
under criticism from then-leader Konstantin Chernenko.
   ``I was told I wouldn't be allowed to return home _ Chernenko
was half alive at the time and dead 12 months later,'' the director
recalled, speaking through an interpreter.
   Lyubimov said he's hopeful that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies of greater openness on selected subjects will
last.
   ``A lot of things once forbidden are now being seen in the
Soviet Union _ films, plays and books,'' he said. ``It would be a
terrible tragedy if all this will be reversed, like it was once
before when (Nikita) Khrushchev was deposed.
   ``But people coming from Russia tell me they really believe the
change is irreversible and I hope all people of good will in the
West will help,'' he said.
   The director said his name, in oblivion after his exile, has
been restored by public demand to the Taganka Theater's programs
for revivals of his celebrated productions.
   Lyubimov said the Soviet and Israeli political climates are
``very different and I'm trying to reconcile them.''
   The Royal Opera disclosed it has Lyubimov working on a new
production of Richard Wagner's demanding four-opera ``Ring'' cycle
for opening in September.
   Wagner, a German composer of genius, is anathema to many Jews
who regard him as an anti-Semite. Wagner's music has been shouted
down at concerts in Israel.
   ``Wagner is also little performed in the Soviet Union,''
Lyubimov said. ``I once wanted to to use the march from (Wagner's)
`Twilight of the Gods' in a festival music program, but it was
forbidden.''
   The ``Ring'' is performed in a variety of costumes these days,
from Viking style to modern evening dress. Lyubimov, when asked if
his version will be traditional or modern, replied: ``I'm keeping
that a secret, but I will try to use different kinds of symbolism
and psychological concepts to bring Wagner closer to the people.''
   He said he was glad to be working on it with Bernard Haitink,
the Royal Opera's recently appointed music director from Holland.
   ``Wagner's world is difficult to penetrate as he sought unity of
all the forms, music and drama, and wrote a lot about it. The hard
part about producing Wagner is that what you see on the stage must
not destroy what you hear,'' the director said.

<DATELINE>KIRYAT ARBA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a Beretta pistol in
her lap, Tzip Haetzni pulled her car out of this hilltop community
and joined a convoy of Jewish settlers on patrol under the stars.
   Her husband, Eliakim, an attorney, sat beside her, also armed.
   After nine weeks of unrest in the occupied territories and two
serious attacks on Jewish settlers, residents of Kiryat Arba, 20
miles south of Jerusalem, have begun nightly patrols.
   ``We shall not be chased from this place,'' Haetzni, 62, vowed
as his wife steered the car past an Arab refugee camp. ``We shall
meet the danger. We will fight darkness by lighting up the night.''
   But these tactics, while carried out by only a minority of the
West Bank's 65,000 Jewish settlers, have triggered panic and
sometimes fueled new violence.
   In the Arab village of Beit Ummar this week, a report of
approaching settlers sounded from a mosque loudspeaker. It was a
false report, but hundreds of Palestinians fearing a vigilante
attack rushed to the village outskirts, armed with sticks and
stones.
   Israeli soldiers who knew nothing of the false report tried to
force the Arabs back. Three villagers were killed in the clash, the
army said.
   In other Arab towns and refugee camps, Palestinians patrol their
neighborhoods through the night, looking for vigilantes.
   ``The Arab inciters have begun shouting, `The settlers are
coming! The settlers are coming!' to get everyone stirred up,''
said Mrs. Haetzni, 60.
   ``But the rumors are false,'' she said. ``We want to make our
presence felt on the road. We want the Arabs to know we are here.
But most of us are happy to let the army do the fighting.''
   Nevertheless, Kiryat Arba residents say some of their men
entered the nearby village o Hebron one night and smashed windows
of Arab-owned cars. Some settlers have also distributed leaflets in
Arab villages threatening retaliation against inciters of violence.
   Still, the relationship between most Israeli soldiers and
settlers is better than ever.
   With more than 100 troops stationed round-the-clock along the
road from Kiryat Arba to Jerusalem and a spotlight sweeping
continuously over a nearby refugee camp, many settlers feel the
army is finally doing its job.
   ``Before, it was like a toy army here, so we had to protect
ourselves,'' Haetzni said. ``We never would have reached this stage
if the army had been stronger earlier. But at least they are acting
now.''
   In an effort to help cement their new relationship, the
settlers' three-car convoy took coffee, cake and sunflower seeds to
troops guarding the road overnight.
   The convoy stopped outside the nearby village of Beit Ummar, a
closed military area, where two dozen soldiers stood outside a
Palestinian home while Arab children peered from the window above.
   One soldier wore a checkered Arab headdress wrapped around his
face for warmth.
   Pvt. Rafi, who would give only his first name in keeping with
military regulations, said the army has warmed to the presence of
the settlers in the area.
   ``We don't mind if they patrol the roads,'' he said. ``We and
they are the same people, even if we don't always see eye-to-eye
politically.''
   Not all Israelis agree. Some say the settlers are a source of
provocation, not protection. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has
called them ``a heavy burden.''
   ``The appearance of armed settler patrols alongside Israeli army
forces creates the impression that the state of Israel is
encouraging Jews in a war against the Arabs,'' the daily Haaretz
wrote this week.
   ``The Israeli army does not operate according to Jewish tribal
feelings, and the farther it distances itself (from the settlers)
... the better.''
   But Haetzni argues: ``Those Israelis who don't understand our
presence here also don't understand the Arab mentality.''
   Haetzni came to Israel from Germany at the age of 13. He built a
lucrative law practice in Tel Aviv and then gave it up to move to
Kiryat Arab 16 years ago.
   He recalls being beaten up as a boy in Germany because he was
Jewish and says, ``it helped make me a better, more realistic
Zionist today.''
   ``What Israelis don't realize is the Arabs do not want a state
on this side of the green line,'' he said, referring to the
pre-1967 border of Israel. ``They want a state that extends all the
way to the blue line,'' the Mediterranean Sea.

<HEAD>Lutheran Church A Rallying Point For Pressure For Change In East
Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A drab Lutheran church in East Berlin has become
the headquarters of a grassroots movement aimed at forcing reform
upon the country's aging and authoritarian Communist leadership.
   But unlike dissident movements of the past, the Lutheran
movement has found itself looking more East than West for
inspiration on how to change Eastern Europe's most industrialized
country.
   ``We want to change the system from within. We need to get some
glasnost here,'' a leading church member Hans Mayer said in
reference to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness
and reform.
   ``You can only get democracy when you fight for it,'' said
Mayer, who used an alias to protect himself from official reprisals.
   While the Zion Church is the headquarters and focal point for
the reform movement, other Lutheran churches in East Berlin also
have become rallying places for young adults seeking change.
   Dissidents were thrust into international attention after an
official rally led by East German leader Erich Honecker on Jan. 17
to honor German Communist Party founders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl
Liebknecht.
   Members of the Zion Church tried to join the rally in a protest
action against the nation's leadership.
   At least 100 dissidents were arrested, and more than 60 of them
have since been expelled to West Germany. The rest have also been
released from East German jails.
   The Zion Church, which is located only about two blocks from the
Berlin Wall, turned into a magnet of dissent last year when its
outspoken followers, mostly between the ages of 20 to 35, began
calling for more human rights and democracy in East Germany.
   There are no official estimates on the number of active
dissidents gathering in East Berlin's 90 Lutheran churches, but
informed sources put the number at several thousand.
   Another of the churches is the Church of Faith located near East
Germany's secret police headquarters.
   Although the movement has been gaining strength since at least
1983, it was galvanized by two events in the Soviet Union _
Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985 and the Chernobyl nuclear fire in
1986.
   Gorbachev's policies which call for some decentralization of
economic and political life have been hailed by East German
dissidents as the first good thing to come from the Soviet Union in
decades.
   While an international disaster, the April, 1986 Chernobyl fire
has also had its political uses _ alllowing those concerned with
ecological issues to rally around an issue.
   ``Chernobyl was the biggest boost for the movement,'' said Karl
Wegner, another church member who also used an alias to avoid
police harassment.
   ``People interested in ecological questions started to go to
meetings in church basements, because they soon found out the
church reacted to their demand for a room,'' he said.
   Incidents in East Germany have further aided the movement.
   On Oct. 17, a group of about 20 ``skinheads'' _ disenchanted
rightist youths _ raided a rock concert in the Zion Church and beat
up concert-goers with bicycle chains and clubs.
   Some sources say East German authorities fomented the attack,
while East Germany claims provocateurs from West Berlin were
involved.
   ``After the battle of Zion things really got hot here,'' said
Mayer, speeking in the sleet near the 115-year-old church.
   But things could get hotter.
   Party leader Honecker indicated Friday that East Germany won't
copy reforms being implemented in the Soviet Union.
   ``Of course we follow developments in the Soviet Union and the
other socialist countries very closely,'' Honecker said in a speech
to party officials carried on the state-run news agency ADN. ``But
that does not necessarily mean we intend to copy them.''
   Such a lack of tolerance could mean more crackdowns.
   Mayer says millions of East Germans watching West German
televiion have followed the progress of the dissident movement.
That's led to an inundation of queries from people who simply want
to leave and are looking for advice.
   But Mayer said his group does not want to become too involved
with those people. His concern is with those who have to stay.
   At the Zion church, the movement's resources are meager: a
10-foot-by-14-foot room in a parish building and a basement
``ecology library.''
   About 1,000 books line the shelves of the small windowless
library. Next to Joseph Stalin's ``Thoughts on Leninism'' is a copy
of the officially banned West Berlin newspaper ``Tageszeitung.''
   East Germany police raided the library in November, confiscating
duplicating machines and publications critical of government
policies.
   That raid resulted in 21 arrests, and dissident groups staged
peaceful demonstrations several days running at Zion and other East
Berlin churches until their comrades were released from prison.
   Upon leaving the building, Wegner pointed down the street at two
dour-looking police officers.
   ``Never mind them,'' he says. ``They're always here.''

<HEAD>Manslaughter Charge Is New Weapon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The charge of manslaughter is the
latest weapon in the fight against heroin in this city of fishermen
and artists where heroin overdose is the leading cause of death
among young adults.
   There have been 10 overdose deaths in less than 18 months in
Gloucester, population 25,000.
   Last week, Louis Catalina, 36, a fisherman, became the first
person in the history of Massachusetts to be indicted on charges of
involuntary manslaughter in connection with a drug overdose.
   He is accused of supplying a fatal dose of heroin to Grace
Randazza, 31, the mother of three.
   Police later arrested Frank Auditore, 41, a stevedore, and
charged him with manslaughter in the death of his sister-in-law,
Anne Swanson, 33, a former medical secretary and mother of one.
   District Attorney Kevin Burke said both women died after
injecting heroin of exceptional purity. To convict on a charge of
manslaughter, a jury must find the defendant provided the drugs
that caused the death and did so wantonly and recklessly, he said.
   Manslaughter charges carry penalties of up to 20 years in prison.
   ``Gloucester is an extraordinary place, having perhaps the
highest per capita number of heroin addicts in the state,'' said
Burke.
   ``It makes Gloucester an appropriate place to deliver the
message that when there's an overdose, the supplier just can't walk
away.''
   Auditore said he has been trying to kick his own drug habit in a
methadone program. He pleaded innocent and was released on bail but
said he has been evicted from his apartment and shunned by some
acquaintances since being charged with manslaughter.
   ``I'm very sorry it happened to her, but it was just a matter of
time. She was strung out,'' he said of the death of Ms. Swanson.
   ``They're trying to scare people so they won't deal,'' he told
The Boston Globe. ``They want people to think, `Hey, someone might
die. I better not sell this heroin or I might be up for
manslaughter.'
   ``But it won't work. Heroin's got people hooked so bad here,
it's never gonna let go. It's like AIDS, which doesn't scare anyone
either.''
   There is no known cure for AIDS, which can be spread by sharing
contaminated hypodermic needles.
   Authorities say they aren't sure why heroin has made such
inroads in Gloucester.
   Auditore's brother, Vincent, 37, runs a drop-in center for
recovering addicts and said he was one of a small group of young
men who made the first local heroin connection in 1968.
   ``There aren't many still alive who know how it started, with a
couple of guys from Boston who came down here in a big Lincoln
Continental,'' he said.
   ``There were about 20 of us. After that, it just mushroomed.
Now, you stand anywhere long enough in this city, someone's going
to ask if you're looking to buy.''
   Police Chief Earland Worthley said overdose deaths began in
1968. Police detectives made 87 heroin arrests last year, 300
percent more than in 1986, and they seized 1,020 bags of heroin,
400 percent more than in 1986.
   Estimates of the number of addicts in the city range as high as
250, and the annual heroin trade reportedly is at least twice the
$2.6 million budget of the Police Department.

   A police officer investigating a report of
a stolen sled was shot to death Friday in a confrontation with the
suspect, who was critically wounded in an exchange of gunfire,
police said.
   Lt. Larry Bauer declined to release the name of the officer
because her relatives hadn't been notified. The name of the
suspect, a 46-year-old Lansing man, also was withheld pending
notification of his family.
   ``The officer was responding to a call in which a juvenile
reportedly was assaulted and his sled taken by an adult,'' Bauer
said. He said the officer found a suspect and a confrontation
ensued.
   ``After a standoff, the two exchanged gunfire and the officer
was fatally wounded,'' Bauer said. He said the suspect shot the
officer in the head with a .22 caliber rifle.
   The suspect, wounded twice in the abdomen, managed to crawl into
a nearby garage and barricaded himself for about 40 minutes before
surrendering, he said.
   The suspect was taken to Ingham Medical Center in serious
condition and was to undergo surgery.
   Bauer said it wasn't known whether the officer or the suspect
fired first.

   The crew of a Continental Airlines jet
aborted takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport Friday
after foreign objects entered the jet's engines and bent some of
its turbine blades.
   No one was injured as Continental flight 581, bound for Denver
with 139 passengers, started rolling down the runway and then
slowed to a stop at about 7 a.m.
   Bruce Hicks, a spokesman for the airline, said passengers were
transferred to other flights.
   Airline officials at first suspected that ice may have been
hurled by the wheels into the twin rear-mounted engines. But Hicks
said that inspections indicated that the problem may have been
caused by something on the airfield.
   Visual and hand inspection of the McDonnell Douglas aircraft
found no ice on the wings or engines before the plane left the gate.
   Hicks said further testing of the engine blades is planned to
determine the cause of the incident.

   A radio station's gag came to a smashing halt
when a truck driver crashed into the car of an on-air announcer who
was describing a man undressing.
   WBZZ-FM disc jockeys Jim Quinn and ``Banana Don'' Jefferson
called a phone booth in front of a restaurant and convinced a man
to take off his pants and start waving them over his head.
   The truck driver, who was not identified, was watching the stunt
when he sideswiped the car of WBZZ-FM announcer Tank Sherman, who
was narrating the activity.
   A policeman threatened to arrest the pantsless man for public
lewdness, but was persuaded only to issue a warning, the station
said. The driver was not charged and no injuries were reported.
   WBZZ-FM Manager Tex Meyer said the ``Stupid Human Phone Trick''
on Thursday on the station's highly rated ``Quinn and Banana'' show
wasn't in bad taste, ``but it was getting close.''
   ``We're not going to do anything that would get anyone in real
trouble,'' Jefferson said.

<HEAD>U.S. Warships Back To Normal Operations In Black Sea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. warships are back to ``routine
operations'' in the Black Sea after being deliberately bumped by
Soviet vessels in a confrontation off the Crimean coast, the
Pentagon says.
   Navy officials said the ships were struck while exercising their
right to pass through international waters. The Soviets said the
U.S. ships violated its border.
   And the State Department, which protested the bumping, said the
incident showed once again that U.S.-Soviet relations are a
continuing blend of the good and the bad in what spokesman Rudolph
Boone called a ``competitive relationship.''
   He said that Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost summoned
Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin to receive a strong U.S. protest and
that Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would raise the issue in a
meeting with Soviet officials in Bern, Switzerland, next month.
   The flare-up occurred Friday when, according to the Navy, the
cruiser USS Yorktown was deliberately struck by a frigate and the
destroyer USS Caron was deliberately struck by a smaller coastal
patrol boat.
   The two American vessels were exercising their right of
``innocent passage'' within the 12-mile territorial waters claimed
by the Soviets, the Navy said. The Navy says its ``assertion of
rights'' program calls for steaming periodically through contested
waters to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas.
   The Soviet Union countered with a charge that the U.S. Navy
ships violated its border, ignored warnings ``and dangerously
maneuvered in Soviet territorial waters.''
   Navy Capt. Gerry Flynn gave this account at a Pentagon briefing:
   The Soviets had been shadowing the U.S. vessels since they
entered the Black Sea earlier in the week and headed northward to
the Crimean coast.
   At about 11 a.m. local time Friday _ or 3 a.m. EST _ the Soviets
broadcast the following warning to the U.S. ships: ``Soviet ships
have orders to prevent violation of territorial waters. I am
authorized to strike your ship with one of ours.'' The Caron
responded: ``I am engaged in innocent passage, consistent with
international law.''
   The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the
American vessels, ``which were, as we would say in the Navy,
shouldered out of the way.''
   When neither the Caron nor Yorktown changed course, a
Krivak-class frigate moved up on the Yorktown and a Mirka-class
patrol vessel moved on the Caron, ``grazing'' the left sides of the
each.
   The Yorktown and Caron maintained their course and speed despite
the bumping, eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast.
   Flynn concluded by saying, ``the latest report I have now is
that both ships are operating routinely in the Black Sea as
planned.''
   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territorial
limit, the Soviet Union claims a 12-mile limit along its coast,
said Cmdr. Richard Schiff, a Navy lawyer. The United States will
accept such a claim, but any country claiming 12 miles ``must allow
for innocent passage by the ships of all nations,'' he said.
   A high-ranking State Department official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said that although the department protested Soviet
behavior, he did not expect the incident to disturb a U.S.-Soviet
effort to narrow differences on arms control, human rights,
regional disputes and bilateral issues.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is scheduled to go to Moscow
in two weeks to further those efforts and talk about a U.S.-Soviet
summit meeting tentatively scheduled in the Soviet capital in the
spring.
   Retired Rear Adm. Robert J. Hanks, a former director of
strategic plans and policy for the Navy, said testing rights of
passage was an important necessity for the United States, but is
accompanied by risks such as those encountered Friday.
   He said the two countries set up a commission to discuss such
incidents, under what the Navy calls the ``wrinkled fender''
agreement.
   Efforts to assess the blame for the latest incident, he
predicted ``will be a big rhetorical contest'' with the Soviets.
   Another former admiral, Eugene Carroll, who commanded ships in
the Black Sea, said such incidents are inevitable, given the
conflicting U.S. and Soviet goals. He said of Friday's action:
``It's really scary.''

<HEAD>Report Cites Withdrawal Of Farm Investment Due To Tax Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment in U.S. agriculture will probably
decline at least through the early 1990s because of the massive Tax
Reform Act of 1986, according to a new study by the Agriculture
Department.
   Most of the investment decline can be laid to the law's repeal
of the investment tax credit, which allowed up to 10 percent tax
credit for qualifying capital improvements, the report said Friday.
   Most farm machinery, equipment, many farm structures and certain
livestock operations qualified for the full 10 percent credit.
   The report, ``Economic Consequences of Tax Reform on
Agricultural Investment,'' was prepared by Roger Conway, Ron Durst,
James Hrubovcak and Michael LeBlanc of the department's Economic
Research Service.
   According to their study, there was a decline in net farm
investment of $2.9 billion in 1987, with repeal of the investment
tax credit accounting for 98 percent of the reduction.
   The annual reductions are expected to increase gradually through
1991, when the net ``disinvestment'' in agriculture attributable to
the 1986 law would be almost $3.5 billion.
   Elimination of the investment tax credit increases the rental
rate on farm machinery, including tractors and other ``long-lived
equipment'' such as cultivators, grain harvesters, planters, plows
and shredders, the report said.
   ``The rental rate of capital is not the most important
determinant of investment, but it _ and therefore, by implication,
tax policy _ does have a measurable effect on agricultural
investment,'' the report said.
   According to other USDA material about the 1986 tax law, farmers
had been claiming more than $1 billion in investment tax credit
annually. One of those background papers noted:
   ``However, a large share of this ($1 billion a year) is claimed
by individuals with taxable income in excess of $85,000 and
marginal tax rates of 45 percent or above. Farms with gross
receipts between $50,000 and $500,000 (per year) are able to claim
less than half of the investment tax credit avabilable to them due
to no current tax liability.''
   In its latest report, the agency said history ``suggests that
changes in the tax code are not permanent'' and that, for example,
the investment tax credit has been revised four times since 1964.
   ``Although no reasonable measure of change in the (1986 law) can
alter the current disinvestment of capital in agriculture, 1988
will probably bring forth strident efforts to reinstate the
investment tax credit,'' the report said.

   The National Association of Wheat Growers
wants the Agriculture Department to ease back on acreage controls
for the 1989 wheat crop.
   Frank Johannsen, association president, said Friday that greater
acreage should be permitted so the United States can keep filling a
growing export demand. For the last two years, wheat farmers have
been required to idle 27.5 percent of their base acreage in order
to qualify for federal supports.
   The USDA is to announce the 1989 wheat program by June 1.
Johannsen, a wheat farmer from Bayard, Neb., said the association
asks the acreage reduction be held to no more than 20 percent.
   Johannsen said U.S. wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by 30
percent this season, the largest annual decline in more than 20
years.
   A 1989 acreage reduction of less than 20 percent could be
justified if USDA maintains its current export subsidy programs, he
said.
   ``Since we don't know what will happen after the November
elections, our market outlook is somewhat cloudy, thus making it
more difficult to forecast export sales opportunities,'' Johannsen
said in a statement released here by the association.

   Price supports for peanuts grown under 1988
quotas will be $615.27 per ton, an increase of $7.80 from last
year, the Agriculture Department has decided.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said Friday the increase was
required by a formula in the law which takes rising production
costs into consideration.
   The annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated
quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses,
seed and related purposes.
   Production of non-quota peanuts, which can be grown for peanut
oil and meal, and for export, will be supported at $149.75 per ton,
unchanged from last year, Myers said.
   In setting the support for non-quota peanuts, officials are
reqired to consider certain factors, including the demand for oil
and meal, the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals,
and the foreign demand for peanuts.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Three Charges Against Hijack Suspect, Six Counts
Remain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled that suspected terrorist
Fawaz Younis may be tried on charges he led the June 1985 hijacking
of a Royal Jordanian airliner but not on charges of assaulting
passengers and blowing up the jet.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker on Friday dismissed
three charges against Younis, but refused to dismiss six conspiracy
and hijacking counts of the indictment.
   Each of the three charges Parker dismissed carried potential
20-year sentences and fines of up to $100,000. The hijacking
charges still pending against Younis carry life sentences.
   Parker ruled that the Aircraft Piracy Act of 1984 provided no
jurisdiction for U.S. authorities to prosecute Younis for the
bombing of the ALIA jetliner . The plane was blown up at Beirut
International Airport after the passengers aboard the aircraft had
been released.
   The judge ruled, however, that the Justice Department did have
jurisdiction to prosecute Younis on the six other charges of
conspiracy and hijacking under the Hostage Taking Act, also passed
by Congress in 1984 as part of a legislative package to combat
terrorism. The hijacking happened June 11.
   That law gives U.S. authorities jurisdiction because three
Americans were aboard the flight when it was stormed in Beirut by a
group of armed men carrying assault rifles and submachine guns,
Parker said.
   ``There is no dispute that the only nexus to the United States
was the presence of several American nationals on board the
flight,'' Parker said. ``The airplane was registered in Jordan,
flew the Jordanian flag and never landed on American soil or flew
over American airspace.''
   The judge said the government didn't have jurisdiction to
prosecute Younis on charges of placing a destructive device aboard
the plane, destroying the plane and assaulting the passengers
because ``the ALIA flight had no connection whatsoever with United
States territory
   The judge refused to dismiss the six conspiracy and hijacking
counts of the indictment and upheld the use of Navy vessels that
transported Younis following his arrest aboard an FBI-chartered
yacht last Sept. 13 in the Mediterranean.
   Younis, who later told the FBI that Lebanaon's Justice Minister
Nabih Berri approved the hijacking, was lured aboard the yacht by
the prospect of making a drug deal, authorities said.

<HEAD>Court Rules Bodies Of Homeless Can Be Released For Public Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legal victory in a custody fight over the
bodies of two street people who froze to death will enable an
advocacy group for the homeless to hold a public funeral and
24-hour protest vigil near city hall.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
on Friday upheld a lower court, which reversed a city official who
called the funeral plan an attempt by homeless advocate Mitch
Snyder to create a public spectacle.
   The three-judge appeals panel upheld U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who earlier in the day ordered the District of
Columbia to release the bodies to the Community for Creative
Non-Violence, which operates a shelter for the homeless. There was
no immediate information on when the funeral would take place.
   ``Our purpose in holding the funeral is not to point the finger
at the D.C. government,'' Snyder said. ``We are all responsible''
for the plight of the homeless.
   During the emergency hearing, attorney Mark Venuti said the
organization for eight years has been claiming the bodies of all
homeless people who die of exposure.
   D.C. attorney Lutz Prager said the group wanted to use the
bodies ``for a public spectacle'' to embarrass the city government
for not doing enough for homeless people.
   ``The District of Columbia has an interest in not having a
public display of dead bodies,'' Prager said.
   At the earlier proceeding in U.S. District Court, Jackson told
city attorneys he had ``a great deal of difficulty understanding
how this differs from innumerable presidential funeral corteges
that have proceeded up Pennsylvania Avenue since the beginning of
the country.''
   Noting that the remains would be in closed caskets, Jackson said
he saw no legitimate governmental interest in preventing the
homeless advocates from holding a dignified funeral in a public
plaza across Pennsylvania Avenue from the District of Columbia
Building.
   City officials said they had been unable to find next of kin for
Henry Dixon, who died Jan. 2 in a parking attendant's booth, and an
undentified woman, who was found dead five days later in a
construction site.
   So far, 10 homeless people have died on the streets of the
nation's capital this winter.

<HEAD>Route To New Hampshire Chilly For Kemp's Colleagues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey Rep. Christopher Smith stamped
his foot on the airport tarmac, trying to get back the circulation
in his big toe. Such is the glamor of the campaign trail.
   Smith, along with more than a dozen other congressmen, became a
potential frostbite victim en route to campaigning for Rep. Jack
Kemp, a colleague and fellow conservative Republican who's running
for president.
   Arriving from Washington aboard two cramped chartered planes,
Smith and his fellow travelers were unexpectedly warmed by the
30-degree air around this state capitol.
   Thirty felt good compared with the interiors of the planes,
neither of which had working heaters. For the two-hour flight, the
congressmen kept their coats on and buried themselves under the
day's New York Times.
   They came here for a media ``hit,'' a show of solidarity for
Kemp on the statehouse steps. The idea was to give the campaign a
high-profile booster shot less than a week before the state's
critical, first-in-the-nation primary election.
   The idea, also, was to be pictured with Kemp in front of the
forest of television cameras that has sprouted up in the small town
square.
   The busy congressmen, who logged a total of four hours up and
back in the frigid skies, spent about 20 minutes campaigning. They
waved flags and shouted ``Jack is back'' as Kemp predicted victory
to what, at least last week, was likely the largest press corps in
any 30,000-person town in the world.
   Smith, who has worked nearly a year on Kemp's behalf, saw his
brief afternoon in New Hampshire as time well spent.
   Like other Kemp backers, Smith says he's encouraged by the
momentum his candidate has shown here. Once an ``also ran,'' the
Buffalo, N.Y., congressman claims to be creeping into a position
just behind GOP front-runners Vice President George Bush and Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Kemp claimed a boost in the Iowa precinct cacuses on Feb. 8,
when Republicans handed Bush an unexpected and unsettling third
place. Dole ran first, followed by former TV evangelist Pat
Robertson. Kemp was fourth.
   ``It's a new day. It's a new race,'' he triumphantly told his
audience, composed of friends and reporters _ and hardly anyone
else.
   It's easier around here these days for would-be presidents to
get the attention of a $150,000-a-year television reporter than to
attract real, live local residents.
   But then, unlike on most Main Streets, presidential campaign
offices here are more common than convenience stores. As Kemp gave
his speech outside the statehouse, Dole was shaking hands inside.
Bush was expected later.
   Watching Kemp's congressmen _ a full 3 percent of the U.S. House
of Representatives _ disembark from buses, a truck driver sighed,
``Here they come again.''
   Such political nonchalance reminded Smith of his trip to Iowa
for Kemp the weekend before. Smith said he thought Iowans would at
least be startled when a congressman from New Jersey knocked at
their door.
   But he quickly found it's hard to impress anybody who's had
pancakes with the vice president.

   Government warehouses that once bulged with
surplus cheese and other commodities are running out, forcing the
Agriculture Department to cut off much of its aid to food banks and
soup kitchens.
   Rice and honey inventories will be gone next month, and cheese
and non-fat dry milk will be depleted in May, said Assistant
Secretary John W. Bode, who oversees the department's food and
consumer services.
   ``Flour, cornmeal and butter distributions will continue as in
recent months,'' he said Friday. ``Cheese, non-fat dry milk, rice
and honey distributions will be suspended when we have given it all
away. When we get more, we will distribute it.''
   It comes as no surprise. For months, operators of local food
banks and soup kitchens have reported reduced USDA donations. And
last November the department predicted that its donations under the
Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program would likely be a
trickle by spring.
   According to department estimates, up to 18 million people had
been getting some free food each month through the program.
   The food was accumulated by the department's Commodity Credit
Corp. under various farm price support programs. In the case of
dairy, for example, the CCC buys surplus butter, cheese and non-fat
dry milk to prop up the price of milk paid to farmers.
   But many federal supports have been reduced, helping make some
commodities more competitive on the market instead of winding up in
government warehouses. Overseas sales and donations also have
helped drain off some of the surpluses. Diversion of many CCC-owned
foods into school lunch programs also has reduced the stockpiles.
   ``Although variations in surplus stocks cause the size of the
temporary emergency program to go up and down, our regular food
assistance programs ... continue,'' Bode said. ``Low-income
Americans remain eligible for food stamps, free lunches and
breakfasts, elderly food assistance, supplemental food programs for
women, infants and children (WIC), child care meals and summer
child feeding.''
   More than one of every seven Americans receives food assistance
at some point in the year at a taxpayer cost of more than $56
million a day, he said.
   Since 1981, approximately five billion pounds of surplus food
worth more than $5 billion have been distributed through TEFAP,
Bode said.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Colorado Party called
for a huge turnout to re-elect President Alfredo Stroessner to an
eighth straight term. Opponents labeled the elections a farce and
urged voters to boycott it.
   Despite criticism from the opposition and the Roman Catholic
Church, Stroessner was expected to win Sunday's presidential
elections easily.
   The president, who has announced no formal platform, won 90.1
percent of the vote in the last elections, in 1983.
   Criticism of the 75-year-old army general also came from the
U.S. State Department, which said Wednesday in its 1987 human
rights report that ``Paraguay has not had a democratic government
since its independence in 1811.''
   The report said Stroessner dominates ``the military, the
political forces, the government's bureaucracy and the ruling
Colorado Party. The opposition's ability to conduct an effective
campaign is severely restricted.''
   Stroessner, son of a Bavarian immigrant father and Paraguayan
mother, has governed since 1954, longer than any other head of
state in the Western Hemisphere.
   He faces nominal opposition from candidates of two small
recognized parties. There are 1.44 million registered voters, out
of a population of 3.7 million.
   The other candidates are Rep. Carlos Ferreira Ibarra, 54, of the
Liberal Party, and Sen. Luis Maria Vega, 65, of the Radical Liberal
Party. Both men, accused by other opposition groups of being
government accomplices, admit publicly they cannot win.
   ``Current conditions do not guarantee free elections,'' Ferreira
said.
   Three opposition groups charged that at least 12 of their
members were arrested Thursday for taking part in political acts.
Police released most of them Friday without explanation.
   Police late Friday left the Asuncion home of Domingo Laino,
president of the unrecognized Authentic Radical Liberal Party and
Paraguay's leading opposition spokesman. For two days they had
prevented people from entering or leaving the home. Laino's
telephone line remained cut.
   The elections also include races for the 72 seats in the House
of Deputies and 36 seats in the Senate. The party winning the
largest percentage of votes gets two-thirds of the seats in
Congress. The rest are divided according to the percentage won by
other parties.
   The Colorado Party is expected to win the majority of
congressional seats. Stroessner closed his campaign Thursday night
with a 40-minute nationally televised address to 151,000 supporters
_ by party count _ in Asuncion.
   Wearing the party's traditional crimson kerchief around his
neck, Stroessner recounted his government's achievements in health,
education and public welfare and promised to pay off Paraguay's
$2.3 billion foreign debt, one of Latin America's smallest.
   Interrupted a dozen times by chants and cheers in Spanish and
Guarani, the Indian language spoken by most Paraguayans, Stroessner
vowed his government will not share power with ``minorities who
call themselves defenders of human rights and embrace the evil and
bloody servants of international communism.''
   Voter polls conducted late last month by the independent
Asuncion newspaper Ultima Hora indicate many voters do not even
know the names of Stroessner's opponents, who together spent less
than $100,000 on their campaign.
   A third officially recognized party, the Febrerista
Revolutionary Party, has refused to take part in elections since
1973, saying the voting is rigged.
   The main opposition is from the National Accord, a loose
grouping of the Febreristas and three parties not officially
recognized: the Authentic Radical Liberals, the Colorado Popular
Movement and the Christian Democrats.
   The National Accord asked voters to boycott Sunday's ballot.
Election rules require all citizens aged 18 to 60 to vote. The
government said fines and other penalties for failure to vote will
be enforced.
   Other critics include members of the Colorado Party's
``traditional'' wing, ousted from party leadership by a militant
pro-Stroessner faction at the August party convention. The wing
recommend voters cast blank ballots as a show of disapproval.
   The archbishop of Asuncion, Ismael Rolon, recently told the
country's overwhelmingly Catholic population it was their duty to
``vote for the candidate of your choice and if none meets your
expectations then you are free to cast a blank vote.''
   Blank votes are permitted by law, but in past elections have
been included among the uncounted, with nullified or spoiled votes.
   The Colorado Party called Friday for voters to prove their
allegiance to Stroessner with a massive turnout Sunday.
   The elections will be observed by official and unofficial
representatives invited by both the government and the opposition,
including observers from the United States and the European
Parliament.

<HEAD>Rappaport Says Memo Refers To Israeli Payments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Planned payoffs to the government of Israel
and the Israeli Labor Party were mentioned in a 1985 memo to
Attorney General Edwin Meese III describing a proposed $1 billion
Iraqi pipeline project, according to a Swiss businessman who was a
partner in the plan.
   The businessman, Bruce Rappaport, said Friday in an interview
with ABC News that the memo may have even referred to annual
payments that were to be given to guarantee the safety of the
pipeline from Israeli attack.
   His statement was the first direct confirmation from any of
those involved in the pipeline project about the contents of the
memo.
   Rappaport was a partner in the project with Bechtel Group Inc.,
of San Francisco. Rappaport was brought in the project because of
his 45-year relationship with then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres. Rappaport in turn brought in E. Robert Wallach, a longtime
Meese friend.
   The memo from Wallach to Meese states ``that there will be some
money that will have to be paid to the government of Israel and ...
either also a certain portion to the Labor Party and I think he
even referred to some amounts annually,'' Rappaport told ABC.
   Rappaport said he did not intend to pay bribes. He called the
payments standard business procedure and said they would come from
profits from the pipeline or discounts on the oil.
   Earlier Friday, government sources said independent counsel
James McKay won't publicly release the memo because it might harm
his investigation of Meese.
   But if the memo is declassifed, the attorney general and his
lawyers would also have the option of deciding whether to make the
document public. They have said they would first consult McKay on
the matter.
   McKay's opposition to releasing the memo comes on the heels of a
review by an interagency group formed at the behest of the White
House.
   Patrick Korten, a Justice Department spokesman, said he
understood the group had concluded there was no national security
reason for keeping the document classified. An earlier
recommendation by the State Department had prompted McKay to
classify the memo.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, however, the panel
was still reviewing hundreds of documents sought by McKay.
   McKay's office hasn't yet been told officially of the
interagency group's conclusions in favor of declassification, said
the sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Meese said last week he was unable to discuss the contents of
the document because it was classified.
   But Meese said that ``I do not believe that it fairly implies
that a violation of law was committed or contemplated in connection
with the pipeline.''
   Meese also says he doesn't recall reading the portion of the
memo mentioning payments and his involvement in the project was
``entirely lawful, proper and responsible.''
   Wallach, Meese's close friend and former lawyer, approached the
attorney general about the pipeline in May 1985 and Meese later
helped arrange a meeting between Wallach and then-National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane on the pipeline, which was never built.
   Peres, now foreign minister, has denied that anything of value
was offered or accepted by him or his Labor Party in connection
with the pipeline.
   The proposed 540-mile pipeline was to run near Israeli territory
from Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the Jordanian port of Aqaba.
   Fitzwater, talking to reporters accompanying President Reagan to
California on Air Force One, denied a report in Friday's Washington
Post that Reagan would order the declassification. ``The president
does not make this decision,'' he said.

   Alfie flew the coop nearly a week ago
and macaroni and cheese, chicken clucks and feline whines have
failed to coax him back.
   The male Mexican yellow-headed parrot remained among the missing
Friday following his escape during a family picnic in the park in
this Southern California city.
   ``He was sitting on top of the station wagon and he said, `Bye,
bye,' and flew up to one of the pine trees, about 35 feet up,''
owner Susan Gabler said.
   Every morning since Alfie's escape Sunday, Mrs. Gabler has been
strolling through Waller Park meowing like a cat, clucking like a
chicken and crying like a baby in an effort to lure him home.
   When she wasn't making the sounds Alfie has learned to mimic
over the years, she was holding out a pot of macaroni and cheese _
the bird's favorite meal _ in hopes the aroma would waft into the
treetops and entice him to return home to his 200-pound wrought
iron cage.
   As they often did, the Gablers let Alfie out of his cage during
Sunday's picnic to allow him a taste of freedom. Alfie took off.
   After going home and calling authorities about her escaped pet,
Mrs. Gabler returned to the park, where she could hear Alfie but
couldn't see him.
   So far, Mrs. Gabler hasn't spotted Alfie's bright yellow head,
red shoulders or green body, but she heard him Sunday and Wednesday.
   She said she is worried, especially since owls and hawks live in
the park and are much larger than her two-pound pet.
   Mrs. Gabler is convinced Alfie has survived in the unseasonably
warm weather, feeding on scraps people have dropped for the ducks
in the park. ``But he's never had to forage for food before,'' she
added.
   She said she and her three children would continue the daily
hunt for Alfie.

   Homeless people are younger, more likely to be
women and less likely to be working than the homeless of a
generation ago, a study shows.
   ``We're getting the harvest of the last decade's very high
unemployment rate among minorities,'' said Peter Rossi, a professor
of sociology at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
   Rossi, who has studied the history of homelessness and collected
statistics on the current homeless population, was to describe his
findings today at the annual meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
   He said at a news conference Friday that the average age of the
homeless in the 1950s was 59. ``There were virtually no women, and
very few of them slept out on the streets,'' he said.
   Many stayed in skid-row flophouses. ``If they slept downtown,
the police would pick them up,'' he said.
   Police policies changed in the 1960s, however, and arrests for
vagrancy and public drunkenness dropped, Rossi said.
   About 25 percent of the homeless are now women, the result of a
short supply of eligible working males able to support a household.
   ``The age has dropped enormously,'' Rossi said. ``It's now
around 36.'' Very few are over age 65.
   ``One of the most encouraging things I found was the
disappearance of people over 65, by virtue of the rise in the value
of social security,'' he said.
   Few of the homeless are now employed, although that varies in
different areas, Rossi said. In contrast, many homeless men were
able to find day labor in the 1950s.
   ``You might say the fork-lift truck has depleted the market for
day work unloading trucks,'' he said.
   Jon Erickson of the State and Local Expenditure Policy
Commission of New Jersey said that job training programs have
helped some homeless people get back to work and have their own
homes again.
   An effort to find jobs for 580 homeless in New Jersey was partly
successful, he said. About one-fourth of them got jobs. Most were
employed as security guards, clerical workers or in construction,
Erickson said. Eighty-four percent earned less than $7 per hour.
   Rossi has found that the proportion of homeless who come from
minority groups has risen. In New York City, for example, 85
percent of the homeless are black or Hispanic.
   Estimates of the total number of homeless in the United States
vary from 250,000 to several million, Rossi said. He guesses _ and
emphasized that he is only guessing _ that the low estimates are
nearer to the truth.
   Some of the homeless, Rossi said, are adults with relatives who
might support them, but those relatives are often so close to being
impoverished themselves that they cannot support adult dependents,
no matter how generous they might want to be.

   A teen-ager believed to be a gang member
fatally shot another youth and injured two others at a crowded high
school carnival Friday night during an argument over a girl, police
said.
   The shots rang out just before 11 p.m., when more than 500
people packed rides and amusements at Hialeah High School's annual
charity carnival just northwest of Miami.
   ``A group of gang members from outside the city approached
another group of kids and began arguing, we believe over a girl,''
said Hialeah police spokesman Lowell Coffin. ``The shooting went
off very quickly and by the time police could react, the gunman had
taken off in a car.''
   One teen-ager was dead at the scene and two more were airlifted
to Jackson Memorial Hospital, one with gunshots to the knee and
another with arm wounds, said Coffin. He said the names of the
victims and suspect were not yet available.
   ``All of them were in the age range from 16 to 18 years old,''
he said.
   Coffin said the suspect or suspects are probably from a gang in
neighboring Miami.

   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. underwent surgery
Friday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to correct an aneurysm of
an artery supplying blood to his brain, his spokesman said.
   Spokesman Pete Smith quoted from a statement issued by Walter
Reed that Biden, 45, was expect to recover satisfactorily and have
``no significant after effects'' from the surgical procedure known
as a ``clipping.''
   Biden, D-Del., was admitted to the hospital early Friday after
being transferred from St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, Del.,
where the senator lives.
   ``I am told the hospital has him listed as `seriously ill' but
that he `tolerated the procedure well,''' Smith said early
Saturday. An aneurysm is a sac formed by local enlargement of the
weakened wall of an artery.
   The surgery ``did not involve the removal of any brain tissue
and there is every indication that the senator will recover
satisfactorily and have no significant after effects,'' Smith said.
``He is awake, alert, oriented and moving all extremities well. The
length of his hospital stay will depend on his continued progress.''
   Smith said the surgery was performed in the afternoon but there
was no immediate information when it began or how long it took.
   ``I am told that he is in intensive care, which Walter Reed said
is normal for surgical patients, and his family is with him at the
hospital,'' Smith said. Biden and his wife, Jill, have three
children.
   Biden, a three-term senator, had been complaining for a couple
of weeks about what has been diagnosed as a pinched nerve in his
neck, Smith said Thursday.
   Biden wore a neck brace two weeks ago during hearings on the
proposed Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with the Soviet
Union. He was ill and unable to vote last week on the confirmation
of Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. Biden, as chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Commitee, had led the committee hearings on
Kennedy's nomination to the top court.
   This week, Biden felt well enough to appear for several speaking
engagements at colleges on the East Coast.

   Gertrude Ferris always knew she had
a gem of a mate, but she never dreamed he would be named ``Husband
of the Year'' on Oprah Winfrey's television show.
   ``We are just floating,'' said Sidney Ferris, 77. ``It was just
a tremendous experience. We weren't nervous, a little bit stunned
maybe. The significance of it all hasn't settled in on us yet.''
   The Ferrises, who will celebrate their 53rd wedding anniversary
in April, won the first prize, a trip for two to Hawaii.
   Two weeks ago, Winfrey asked wives across America to write and
tell her why they thought their spouse deserved the title of ``best
husband.''
   More than 10,000 letters poured in. From those nominees, 25
finalists were selected, including Ferris.
   All 25 men and their wives appeared on Friday's show in Chicago
wearing beauty pageant sashes with their names on them. For the
show's opening, they marched across the stage and sang ``Hello,
Oprah'' to the tune of ``Hello, Dolly.''
   Each wife read a portion of her letter aloud, and each husband
had about 30 seconds to answer the question, ``What do you love
about your wife and married life?''
   Mrs. Ferris, however, is legally blind, and needed help from her
husband.
   ``He read her letter and it was just heartwarming. He just stole
everyone's heart,'' said Colleen Raleigh, one of the show's
publicists.
   The part of the letter Ferris read:
   ``My angel is 77 years of age, and he does all the heavy
housework, the laundry and shopping because of my disability. Since
I am partially blind, he inspects my clothes and checks my makeup
every day. My neighbors say when they see Sidney, they also see a
halo over his head.''
   For his part, Ferris called his wife ``my angel.'' And then a
beaming Mrs. Ferris hugged and kissed him.
   ``I wish every young woman could meet a young man who cares
about life and love as he does,'' she said.

<HEAD>New `Siegfried' Bows At Met</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new production of ``Siegfried,'' a new tenor
to sing it and a superlative performance by the entire cast filled
the evening at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday.
   Wolfgang Neumann, scheduled to make his Met debut as Siegfried
on Feb. 20, made it instead on the first night of the new
``Siegfried'' production because Peter Hofmann had a bronchial
infection and withdrew.
   Neumann, from Kaernten, Austria, a member of the Mannheim Opera
in Germany, has a golden voice. It isn't the kind with a golden
pinging edge but a full, rich voice which remained fresh-sounding
through this long part.
   Neumann didn't hold back in the first two acts, as some tenors
do, for his duets with Brunnhilde in Act 3. Neumann sounded
innocent, as Siegfried should, and he looked like an attractive,
large country boy.
   Hildegard Behrens sang glowingly as Brunnhilde, her top notes
sounding effortless and tender, never blaring.
   Otto Schenk directed the meeting of Siegfried and Brunnhilde
well. They must do a lot of singing before they embrace. Schenk has
Siegfried exhibit much wonderment, circling the rock on which he
found Brunnhilde.
   We liked the direction of Mime less. Horst Hiestermann sang the
part well but several times skipped about, too frivolously for such
a villain.
   Also, the dragon in a suddenly darkened Act 2 was unpleasantly
startling in a production which has Siegfried in Act 1 forge a
broken sword with meticulous realism. It was a frightening monster,
waving various ugly heads out from several holes in a rock wall.
   Anne Gjevang had a sweet though hooded tone as Erda. She
appeared in an otherworldly blue light, to sing with the Wanderer.
   Donald McIntyre sounded wise and sympathetic as the Wanderer;
his voice did not tire.
   James Levine conducted, taking the overture very slowly and
making the most of every nuance, note and pause. Most of the
evening was taken at a faster pace though there were other places
where Levine slowed the tempo.
   Gunther Schneider-Siemsen designed the sets, which included
wonderful deep forests.

   An Iraqi jet bomber fired a long-range
cruise missile within eight miles of the destroyer Chandler Friday
night as the vessel escorted a convoy of four tankers, according to
a media pool report.
   The Chandler was not the apparent target or the attack and there
were no reported injuries.
   Iraqi planes occasionally have hit by mistake fishing trawlers
and last May 17, struck the frigate USS Starke, killing 37 American
sailors.
   Iraq said Saturday its warplanes raided a ``very large maritime
target'' off Iran's Gulf coast on Friday night. In Iraqi military
terminology, a ``very large maritime target'' usually means a
supertanker sailing off Iran's coast.
   The Pentagon media pool report, released in Washington, said an
Iraqi jet bomber on Friday night fired a long-range cruise missile
within eight miles of the destroyer USS Chandler as it was
escorting a convoy of four reflagged Kuwaiti tankers to Kuwait's
oil terminals.
   Although the Chandler and its convoy were not the apparent
targets of the missile attack, the destroyer fired two flares from
its 5-inch guns to warn the Iraqi Badger bomber that it was
approaching too close to the U.S. warship, said the pool report,
filed by Norman Kempster of the Los Angeles Times newspaper.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, quoting a military spokesman,
reported Saturday that Iraqi warplanes struck at a ``very large
maritime target'' off the Iranian coast, ``scoring an accurate and
effective hit'' and returned safely to base.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the attack took place at
9:08 p.m. Friday (1:08 a.m. EST Friday). It gave no other details.
   Cmdr. Steve Smith, captain of the Chandler, said he was
concerned because Iraqi pilots often fire at radar blips without
making sure what their targets really are.
   ``Having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time, I
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was
heading toward us,'' Smith said over the ship's public address
system after the incident ended.
   Later, Smith told a small group of reporters who boarded the
ship as part of the Pentagon's Persian Gulf press pool, that the
Iraqi pilot fired two Soviet-made C-601 missiles, a 50-mile range
air-launched version of the Styx, which China copied in producing
its far better-known Silkworms.
   Smith said both missiles passed astern of the Chandler, the last
ship in the convoy, but that one of the rockets suddenly changed
course and passed along the starboard side of the ship before
veering away to the right.
   Seconds later it detonated, producing a bright flash on the
horizon. There was no immediate indication whether the missile had
hit a target or had crashed harmlessly into the sea.
   Smith said it was the closest approach of a missile to his ship,
which has been on station in the Persian Gulf since Nov. 25. The
Chandler, one of four guided missile destroyers originally produced
for Iran during the reign of the shah but never delivered, is the
flagship of the Navy's tanker escort squadron, which includes six
frigates.
   Ensign Brian Josse of Kilua, Hawaii, the officer of the deck
when the incident began, said later, ``We've seen Iraqi planes come
close but never this close.''
   Quartermaster 2nd Class Dave Markee of Salem, Ore., who was
manning a 50-caliber machine gun on the starboard side of the ship,
said, ``We believe we saw the missile separate (from the jet.) We
also saw anti-aircraft fire off our stern.''
   Smith placed his crew on ``general quarters,'' the Navy's
highest state of alert, after the Badger, which had earlier passed
the convoy on a flight south along the gulf from Iraq, turned back
north and headed straight for the Chandler.
   Smith said he was prepared to try to shoot down the incoming
missile if it had appeared to be on a course that would strike any
ship in the convoy. He readied the Standard-1, anti-aircraft
missile, shoulder-fired Stinger missiles and the automatic-firing
Phalanx Gattling gun.
   Smith said he informed the Badger by radio that it was
approaching a U.S. convoy and ordered it to turn back. He said the
Iraqi pilot, who did not speak English very well, did not seem to
understand.
   Smith said he then warned the Iraqi that he planned to fire two
``illumination rounds'' from the ship's powerful 5-inch gun.
   As soon as the flares went off, he said, the Iraqi jet turned
sharply away from the ship and fired both of the C-601 missiles.

   Hundreds of lonesome lovers are getting a free
chance to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of sweethearts
anywhere in America this Valentine's Day weekend, courtesy of a
phone company and a hotel.
   ``All that romance stuff is gone. I'm trying to get it back,''
Derek Grier of Los Angeles said Friday as he tried to call his wife
of five years.
   Although he is in Chicago for six weeks for an IBM training
program, Grier said he wants to make this Valentine's Day a turning
point in his marriage.
   ``I'm sending flowers for the first time. I have to bring the
fire, the sparks, the romance back into it,'' he said.
   Grier was one of dozens taking advantage of three free ``love
lines'' set up by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Hyatt
Regency. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. today and Sunday the lovelorn may
talk to their favorite valentine for three minutes at the Hyatt and
AT&T will cover the costs, said Nancy Ruth, a hotel spokeswoman.
   About 600 people made free calls when the promotion was tried
for two days last year, Ms. Ruth said. The hotel expects about 800
calls will be made this year, she said.
   But as one homesick valentine discovered, the offer doesn't
extend beyond the United States.
   ``I want to call Rome. My valentine is there _ my wife,'' said
Mario Biasetti, 62, who was in Chicago on business.
   Biasetti told the women operating the love lines the story of
St. Valentine, the third century Italian martyr for whom the
holiday is named. But despite the storyteller's charm, they
wouldn't let him call Italy.
   A Chicago woman persistently tried to reach her sister and close
friend in San Diego to tell them her ``good valentine's news.''
   Linda Calderon opened her apartment door this morning to a
deliveryman bearing a dozen long-stem red roses from a new romantic
interest.
   ``I was speechless,'' she said.
   Others using the three phones set up in the hotel lobby called
to express a different kind of love.
   ``The only person I can think of to call is my mom,'' said Lee
Dixon, 25, of Los Angeles, who is also in the IBM training program.
   Carol Pegg, who moved from Oregon to Chicago last year, used the
free lines to call some old friends from her hometown.
   ``I would never have called another way,'' said Ms. Pegg, who
came across the love lines on her lunch break.
   Maria Gonzalez, 26, had a lively conversation in Spanish with
her grandmother in Miami.
   ``I just called to tell her I loved her and wish her a happy
Valentine's Day,'' she said.

   The presidential campaigns began turning
bitter on the final weekend before the New Hampshire primary, with
Jack Kemp denouncing a Pat Robertson commercial as a lie and
Richard Gephardt saying a Paul Simon ad questions his integrity.
   The public schedules of the campaigns were snarled by a massive
snow storm Friday, but the reality that the first 1988 primary will
end some candidates' hopes heated up the rhetoric.
   For one Republican _ Alexander Haig _ the campaign ended Friday,
as he withdrew in the face of certain defeat.
   For one longshot Democrat _ Bruce Babbitt _ Friday was the time
to ask voters to prolong a campaign offering vastly different ideas
from those of his rivals.
   ``Let me be direct, even blunt _ New Hampshire has the power of
life or death over my campaign,'' Babbitt told a state party
dinner. ``I don't expect to win the New Hampshire primary, but what
I do need to do, what you need to do, is to send a message to the
rest of America that here, in the snowy hills of New England, a
message of courage and challenge and hope was kept alive.''
   In the final 72 hours before the primary vote begins, the
airwaves in New Hamsphire are filled with campaign commercials, and
those ads started sharp exchanges.
   Kemp, his chance for at least a moral victory here threatened by
Robertson's surge, demanded that the former television evangelist
withdraw television commercials and printed fliers that contained
``deliberate distortions.''
   ``I can't insist that all candidates abide by Ronald Reagan's
11th commandment'' not to speak ill of another Republican, Kemp
said in an address to the Conservative Political Action Committee
in Washington.
   ``But all of us should abide by the Ninth Commandment: Thou
shalt not bear false witness,'' he said to prolonged cheers.
   Robertson, snowbound in Merrimack, N.H., said: ``This is the
kind of desperate thing that losers begin to do. ... We didn't put
out any of this stuff he's talking about.''
   Four of the Democratic candidates _ Simon, Gephardt, Babbitt and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis _ showed up for a New Hampshire
state party fund-raising dinner. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
and Jesse Jackson had planned to be back in the state, but could
not make it due to the snow. Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart did not
plan to attend the dinner.
   But the fraternal nature of the evening did not stop the
bickering.
   Turning to Simon and Gephardt, Dukakis asked: ``You guys getting
along? Anything I can do to help?''
   The audience of activists laughed as many understood the
bickering between the No. 2 and No. 3 contenders has done nothing
to hurt Dukakis.
   After the dinner, the trading of barbs between Simon and
Gephardt blew up.
   ``Enough is enough on these negative ads,'' Gephardt told
reporters. ``Paul Simon is running an ad that ought to come off the
television. It impugns my character and my integrity by saying, can
you trust this man?
   ``So to put it very straight _ enough is enough. I asked Sen.
Simon to take those ads off television. And if he doesn't, he ought
to take off the bow tie because he's just another politician as
long as they're on,'' the Missouri congressman said.
   Only moments before, Simon had told reporters that drawing out
the distinctions between the candidates is legitimate.
   ``As long as it doesn't get too acrimonious, I think that a
healthy comparison is good,'' Simon said.
   Gephardt promised to renew the exchange at the final debate
before the primary, a confrontation sponsored by the League of
Women Voters this afternoon at St. Anselm College.
   The daily polling of the sentiments of the New Hampshire voters
continued without pause, with Vice President George Bush locked in
a neck-and-neck race with Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   One survey, the ABC News-Washington Post poll taken Thursday
night, showed Bush with 32 percent to Dole's 26 percent. Another,
the CBS News poll taken Wednesday and Thursday, gave the Kansas
senator 32 percent to Bush's 29 percent.
   The CBS poll was based on interviews with 499 likely GOP primary
voters and had a sampling error margin of 4 percentage points. The
ABC-Washington Post poll interviewed 559 likely Republican voters
and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
   In both polls, Dukakis maintained a strong lead in the
Democratic race.

   The son of Mayor W. Wilson Goode, injured in
a three-car collision, was in satisfactory condition at a hospital
today, authorities said.
   W. Wilson Goode Jr., 22, was under observation at Osteopathic
Hospital for chest impact injuries suffered in the accident late
Thursday, said George Hatzfeld, director of communications.
   Goode was a passenger in a car that was making a left turn when
it was struck by another auto and spun around and collided with a
third car, police spokesman Edward Tenuto said.
   Goode was hospitalized after the crash, officials said. The
others were treated at Osteopathic for various neck and back
injuries and released.
   The accident occurred a week after the mayor was injured when
his car was rammed by a car carrying his bodyguards. The mayor has
been wearing a neck brace since the collision.

   Film star Burt Lancaster will top the
bill of a marathon 7{-hour film of one of Italy's most famous
epics, ``The Betrothed,'' which will also feature Oscar winner
Murray Abraham, the film's producers announced.
   Lancaster is already well-known to Italian audiences for his
lead role in Luchino Visconti's 1963 film ``The Leopard.''
   ``The Betrothed'' is based on the novel by Alessandro Manzoni,
considered a classic of Italian Romantic literature.
   The producers, Italy's state-owned RAI television network, hope
Lancaster's presence will help sell the film to the American
market. It is being made entirely in English, and will be dubbed
back into Italian for showing in Italy.
   Abraham won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1984 for his
portrayal of the composer Antonio Salieri in the film ``Amadeus.''
   Filming, which began last month, is expected to last 32 weeks,

   Singer Michael Jackson popped out onto a
ramp for less than 10 seconds at the Pensacola Civic Center, waved
to about 300 cheering fans and then darted back inside.
   It was the public's only chance to glimpse the reclusive
entertainer since he arrived Monday to rehearse through Feb. 18 for
a 13-city tour scheduled to start Feb. 23 in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``It didn't even last two seconds. I'm so disappointed,'' said
Stephanie Puddle, one of three 18-year-old fans from Toronto who
said they spent every dime they had to travel here in hopes of
seeing Jackson.
   A husband-and-wife disc jockey team, Doug and Denise Daniels,
had gone on a hunger strike for two weeks and collected thousands
of names on a petition to persuade Jackson, who has been rehearsing
in front of 10,000 empty seats, to hold a public performance here
before leaving.
   It has been to no avail so far, although the Daniels did get a
call praising their effort from Jackson's publicity agents.

   Veteran rock singer Sly Stone
forfeited a $7,500 bond and faced arrest when he didn't show up for
a preliminary hearing on charges he possessed ``rock'' cocaine and
narcotics paraphernalia.
   Deputy District Attorney Lisa Hart said Stone's attorney told
her the 43-year-old musician, whose real name is Sylvester Stewart,
was in New York.
   Municipal Court Judge Laurence Rubin issued the bench warrant
Thursday and set new bail at $15,000.
   Stone, who with his band, Sly and the Family Stone, has such
1960s hits as ``Dance to the Music'' and ``I Want to Take You
Higher,'' pleaded innocent Dec. 16 to the most recent charges.
   He also faces trial in Santa Monica in a separate drug-related
arrest in 1986.

   Organizers of a project to turn Jimmy
Carter's hometown into a major tourist attraction say they hope to
draw up to 300,000 visitors a year, more than used to stop here
during his presidency.
   Carter, former officials of his administration and members of
the Georgia congressional delegation are scheduled to attend a
dedication ceremony today at the railroad depot that served as his
1976 campaign headquarters.
   The National Park Service will oversee the Jimmy Carter National
Historic Site, which will include the depot and the former
president's boyhood home and high school.
   About 80,000 visitors a year still stop at the small welcome
center in Plains, an agricultural community of 650 residents in the
heart of Georgia's peanut belt.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic Defends Winning Bid In Phone Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell Atlantic has formally told the General
Services Administration that it won two government
telecommunications projects honestly and without ``any information
regarding any other offeror's bid.''
   In a brief filed Friday with the GSA's Board of Contract
Appeals, Bell Atlantic said it should be awarded the contracts
despite a complaint of improprieties in the bidding process.
   ``The fact is, Bell Atlantic won its contracts `the
old-fashioned way' _ by bidding superior services at significantly
lower prices than those proposed by AT&T,'' the brief said.
   The General Services Administration began investigating the
awarding of a total of $55 million in contracts after AT&T
complained last October that information on AT&T's pricing
information was leaked to competitors.
   Bell Atlantic asked the GSA board to rule that AT&T's
allegations are incorrect in connection with the awarding of
contracts to Bell Atlantic for electronic switches in Washington,
D.C., and Philadelphia.
   Hearings on AT&T's protest are scheduled to begin Feb. 16.
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which has
investigated AT&T's allegations, has said its probe found that
Sureshar L. Soni, a GSA employee, leaked secret information from
AT&T's bids to at least two competing telephone companies.
   Bell Atlantic maintained in its brief that its prices never
changed. It said it submitted its initial bids of $18.40 per month
for connection to a switch in Washington and $30.50 in Philadelphia
on April 1, 1987, and those bids remained unchanged on the final
dates for bids of Aug. 19 in Washington and July 29 in Philadelphia.

<HEAD>EEC Nations Agree On Farm Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 12-nation European Economic
Community today ended months of financial crisis, approving an
agricultural reform package that for the first time limits farm
spending.
   The deal to control, although not end, the Community's
burgeoning agricultural surpluses was reached in the early hours,
averting virtual bankruptcy for the trade bloc later this year.
   ``I think it was better to try to strain for agreement today,''
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, looking tired, told
reporters. Her country had made major concessions.
   The emergency summit, which began Thursday, was the third
high-level attempt in eight months to solve the Community's
financial woes. The EEC had operated without a budget since
December.
   Mrs. Thatcher, long isolated by her European partners over
finances, dropped major demands for austerity in the face of
persistent opposition headed by France.
   The summit was marked by particularly angry clashes between Mrs.
Thatcher and French Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Mrs. Thatcher termed ``absolutely crazy'' French insistence that
production quotas on cheaper commodities be referred to a foreign
ministers meeting instead of agreed upon at the summit in an
across-the-board deal.
   Britain and the Netherlands endorsed the package, which dealt
with the most expensive crops, on condition the foreign ministers
approve curbs on the lesser commodities, which was virtually
certain.
   It was the first time in the EEC's 31-year history that leaders
fixed a limit to farm spending, which eats up two-thirds of the
EEC's annucal budget.
   The agreement set a $34.4 billion limit on farm spending in
1988, slightly higher than last year. This can rise by no more than
$2.5 billion over five years. Mrs. Thatcher had wanted a $33.8
billion limit for 1988 and a smaller increase in the years ahead.
   West Germany, the EEC chairman, and France had wanted a $36.9
billion limit.
   Also, the leaders agreed to limit grain production to 160
million metric tons a year, compared with 155 million tons demanded
by Britain and the Netherlands.
   Mrs. Thatcher said her concession was partly offset by a 9
percent automatic price cut over three years for grain production
that exceeds the ceiling.
   The agreement also set strict production quotas on oilseeds
closer to British demands.
   The EEC leaders agreed to raise by 80 percent over the next five
years regional aid to Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, the
poorest members. Spain had sought a 100 percent rise, compared with
a 50 percent rise favored by the rich northern states, including
Britain, France and West Germany.
   The increase will bring regional aid to $16.25 billion by 1992.
   In addition to reducing expenditures, the summit agreed to tap
new revenues by basing membership dues on the relative wealth of
member states rather than sales taxes only. Italy, with a large
economy which isn't reflected in sales tax returns, would have to
pay more.
   The agreement was widely seen as sending a signal to the United
States to rein in its agricultural production.
   ``I hope fervently that our friends across the ocean ... do
their share to control their agricultural spending,'' said Dutch
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers.

<HEAD>`Take Off The Bow Tie' Or Scrap Negative Ads, Gephardt Tells Simon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Gephardt angrily demanded that
rival presidential aspirant Paul Simon take ``attack
advertisements'' off the airwaves or ``take off the bow tie'' that
is the Illinois senator's trademark.
   Simon responded, ``We may be changing ads, but we're not going
to do it in response to his request.''
   Gephardt aides, meanwhile, said they would unveil new ads today
responding to Simon's spots, but they declined to give details.
   Three days before the first primary of the 1988 presidential
season, Gephardt also turned up the heat Friday on Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, who holds a commanding lead in New Hampshire
polls.
   ``If the state of the state of Massachusetts that he gave this
year becomes the state of the union next year, Americans'
individual income taxes are going to go up,'' Gephardt said at an
impromptu news conference after a state Democratic Party dinner.
   But Gephardt was most bitter toward Simon. The Illinois senator
this week began airing ads on television and radio that point out
``inconsistencies'' in Gephardt's record as a Missouri congressman
and question his trustworthiness.
   Gephardt and Simon have acknowledged they essentially are
fighting to place second in New Hampshire. Simon on Friday
acknowledged that a poor third-place showing would force him to
consider dropping out of the race.
   Simon, Gephardt, Dukakis and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt
addressed the Democrats' dinner. Dukakis, standing between Simon
and Gephardt, joked, ``You guys getting along? Anything I could do
to help?''
   Simon did not mention the dispute in his speech, but Gephardt
said, ``I've been attacked lately in this campaign, and that's okay
with me.'' He cited criticism by Simon and Dukakis of his votes for
tax-reform bills in 1981 and 1986, and said, ``I did it. I really
did it. I voted to cut your taxes.''
   ``I just want Paul and Mike to know that when this is all over,
we're going to be friends. And if they keep telling people that I'm
a tax cutter, then we're going to be even better friends than we
are today,'' Gephardt said.
   Afterward, Simon met with reporters and said of the dispute with
Gephardt, ``As long as it doesn't get too acrimonious, I think a
healthy comparison is good for the electorate both here in New
Hampshire and around the nation.''
   But minutes later Gephardt held his own news conference and
escalated his attacks, saying Simon's ad ``impugns my character and
my integrity by saying, can you trust this man?
   ``I've never impugned Paul Simon's character. I've disagreed
with a lot of his crazy ideas ... but I have never once questioned
Paul Simon's motives or his integrity or whether he could be
trusted,'' Gephardt said.
   ``I asked Sen. Simon to take those ads off television. And if he
doesn't, he ought to take off the bow tie because he's just another
politician as long as they're on.''
   Gephardt's campaign counsel earlier sent telegrams to television
stations in Boston, Manchester, N.H., and Portsmouth, Maine, saying
Simon's ads ``contain a savage and willfully inaccurate attack''
and asking stations either to ``discontinue the attack
advertisements'' or sell Gephardt time for a response ad.
   The counsel, Bob Bauer, said the stations have generally agreed
to sell Gephardt such time for the ad, which will begin running
today. Gephardt aides would not describe the ad's contents.

<HEAD>Fed Policymakers Ended Efforts to Lower Interest Rates, Minutes
Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policymakers decided in
December that the easing of credit instituted by the Fed after the
October stock market plunge was no longer needed, according to
minutes of the meeting.
   The minutes, released Friday, showed that the majority argued in
favor of ending efforts to push interest rates lower also because
of concerns about the decline of the dollar.
   Lower U.S. interest rates put downward pressure on the value of
the dollar because foreigners earn less on their dollar-denominated
investments.
   The action was approved at a scheduled meeting of the Federal
Open Market Committee on Dec. 15 and 16 and reaffirmed during an
unannounced telephone conference call Fed officials held on Jan. 5.
   Immediately following the record 508-point drop in stock prices
on Oct. 19, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan promised that
the central bank would do everything necessary to ensure that the
economy had sufficient credit to weather the one-day loss of $500
billion in wealth.
   The December action was approved on a vote of 9-2, while the
re-affirmation of the policy in January carried by a 10-1 vote.
   Martha Seger dissented both times, arguing that ``financial
markets remained too unsettled'' to justify a shift away from
easier credit.
   Since the December meeting, the dollar has stabilized, in part
because of massive intervention by the Fed and other central banks
to prop up the currency's value on foreign exchange markets.
   Fed policymakers met again Tuesday and Wednesday amid
speculation by some private economists that the central bank has
launched further easing moves. These economists noted that a
variety of interest rates, including mortgage rates, have been
headed lower in recent weeks.

   Presidents Reagan and Miguel de la
Madrid meet in this carnival-bedecked Pacific resort today to
discuss how to increase trade in legal goods and reduce traffic of
illegal drugs.
   Reagan, accompanied by Attorney General Edwin Meese, Commerce
Secretary C. William Verity and Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, will be in Mexico about four hours.
   Reagan will have a meeting and lunch with de la Madrid in a
luxurious seaside hotel within earshot of those celebrating the
traditional Roman Catholic pre-Lenten carnival.
   It will be the sixth meeting between the two presidents who,
according to their aides, ``have developed a good working personal
relationship.'' Both are in their last year in office.
   Tight security measures by both countries have not interfered
with the festival atmosphere of this port city of nearly 300,000
residents.
   The leaders will be welcomed by the flags of both nations and
bunting proclaiming Mazatlan a ``City of Friendship.''
   Verity, Shultz and Meese will meet with their Mexican
counterparts to discuss top matters of common concern _ trade,
foreign policy and the illegal drug trade.
   Mexico, struggling with a serious economic crisis now in its
seventh year, is making efforts to expand non-oil exports to the
United States. It also is trying to lower its own tariffs on U.S.
products.
   The Mexicans, however, have made it clear they are not ready to
join the United States and Canada in a North American free trade
zone.
   Unfortunately, Mexico's most successful exports to the U.S.
market are those the two countries want to stop _ drugs.
   Mexico has become a relay point for South American cocaine going
to the United States and a major supplier of marijuana and heroin
also shipped to the U.S. market. The state of Sinaloa, of which
Mazatlan is the second-largest city, is where much of the marijuana
is produced in Mexico.
   U.S. officials have often criticized Mexican efforts to fight
drugs as inefficient and hampered by official corruption.
   Mexico counters that 60 percent of the budget of its federal
Attorney General's Office is used to fight drug traffic and
complains the problem would not be as serious if there wasn't such
a market for drugs in the United States.
   Mexico's foreign policy, often at odds with that of the United
States, especially when it comes to Central America, will be a
minor topic of discussion.
   ``Neither one is going to change,'' said a U.S. source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In the end, trade will dominate the talks.
   Mexico and the United States have worked out trade agreements
dealing with steel, textiles, shoes and beer. The presidents are
expected to formalize some of those agreements during their meeting.
   One U.S. source said U.S. companies would invest more in Mexico
if it could make itself more attractive by offering flexible
legislation when it comes to ownership. Mexico generally demands
majority stock in all joint ventures.
   U.S. investments in Mexico represent 2 percent of the total
value of Mexico's industrial plant and equipment.

<TEXT>
   All airports in the Philippines have
been put on alert following reports that ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos or his relatives may attempt to return to the country, an
air transport official said today.
   Victorino Palpal-latoc, chief of the Air Transportation Office,
issued the alert order Friday to the country's 86 airports, his
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the order was ``just
a reminder'' of a ``long-standing order'' issued nearly two years
ago when President Corazon Aquino's government revoked the
passports of the Marcos family.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, have been living in exile in
Honolulu, Hawaii since the February 1986 civilian-military uprising
that ended Marcos' 20-year rule and swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   The alert came three days after Mrs. Marcos and two aides
reportedly were about to board Philippine Airlines flight for
Manila, but changed their minds at the last minute.
   In his new order, Palpal-latoc told airport officials to be on
the lookout for any ``unusual movement of persons who are
restricted from entering the country.''
   The order did not mention the Marcoses by name, but they are
included on a list of persons not allowed to return to the country,
Palpal-latoc's spokesman said.
   Joe Lazo, a Honolulu travel agent and confidante of Mrs. Marcos,
said the former first lady wanted to return to Manila to rendezvous
with her daughter, Imee Manotoc, who reportedly lives in Morocco
and wants to come home for medical treatment.

   The Central Weather Bureau said the quake measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale and was centered in the ocean about 40 miles
southeast of Taipei. It struck at 3:15 a.m.
   A bureau official said the epicenter was near the Iriomote islet
by the southern tip of Japan's Ryukyu Islands chain. The official

received.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on

   A magnitude of 6 can cause serious damage in a populated area.
An earthquake of magnitude 7 is capable of widespread, heavy damage

<HEAD>University To Treat Homosexual Groups Same As Other Student
Organizations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgetown University, which has waged a
thus-far unsuccessful legal battle to avoid supporting homosexual
groups on campus, has agreed to treat such organizations the same
as it does other student groups.
   The university agreed Friday to give homosexual student groups
``equal treatment.'' A District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruling
late last year had said the university must offer homosexual
organizations the same ``tangible benefits'' given other student
groups, although it did not have to ``officially recognize'' them.
   The university had said that treating homosexual organizations
on campus with equality would ``violate its conscience'' as a Roman
Catholic institution. Church teachings do not support homosexual
acts.
   Georgetown's announcement Friday came one day after the D.C.
Office of Human Rights said it would launch a ``major
investigation'' into the university's treatment of homosexual
groups after three students complained that it had not fully
complied with a court ruling.
   University spokesman Gary Krull said its action had ``nothing to
do'' with the Human Rights Office investigation and the decision
was made before the university learned of the probe.
   Krull also said the decision ``does not prejudice our ability to
file'' a formal request for the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
case. Last month, the high court twice rejected Georgetown's
request to stay the appeals court ruling.
   Krull said Georgetown would give gay organizations on its law
school and main campus ``the same things it offers to any group,''
and would not restrict its assistance to four items specifically
mentioned by the appeals court: a mailbox, computerized label
service, mailing services and an opportunity to apply for
university funds.
   Law school Dean Robert Pitofsky said the broader list of
services and facilities that will be available to the Lesbian and
Gay Association of Georgetown University Law Students includes
photocopying, telephones, stationery, meeting and party rooms, and
offices.

<HEAD>Costa Rican Ambassador Calls for U.S. Concessions Toward Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SELSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To promote peace in Central America, the
United States should immediately lift its trade embargo against
Nicaragua and stop blocking loans to the Sandinista government,
said Costa Rica's ambassador to this country.
   Ambassador Guido Fernandez said Washington's tactic of financing
Contra rebels to force the leftist Sandinista government to allow
democracy in Nicaragua has failed and that other means should be
used to achieve that goal.
   ``The Contras have received $300 million from the United States
from both official and unofficial sources ... but they have made no
gains,'' Fernandez said in a speech Friday night at Rockhurst
College.
   The presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica
and Guatemala signed a regional peace plan last August in Guatemala
City.
   It calls for an end to outside support for insurgencies in
Central America and calls on the signatories to take specific steps
to allow democracy to flourish in their countries.
   The plan also calls for cease-fires, amnesty for political
prisoners and an end to the use of one country's territory to
launch attacks on a neighbor.
   Fernandez said Washington should make concessions now that the
U.S. Congress has denied President Reagan's request to send
military aid to the Contras.
   ``Now that we have withheld the stick, why not use the carrot
more?'' Fernandez asked.
   The Reagan administration has said it is following a two-track
policy toward Nicaragua by applying military and diplomatic
pressure. But Fernandez said he has only seen the use of military
pressure by Washington.
   ``Where is the other track of the two-track policy?'' he asked.
``We would like to see it.''
   Fernandez said the United States should immediately lift its
trade embargo against Nicaragua. He said in comments after his
address that Washington should stop blocking loans by the
Inter-American Development Bank to Nicaragua.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias was awarded the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize for being the architect of the peace plan. Many members
of the U.S. House said they voted against military aid to the
Contras earlier this month to give Arias' plan a chance to work.
   Fernandez said that if the United States grants the concessions
he mentioned, they always could be reversed if the Sandinistas fail
to live up to the plan's provisions.
   As part of the plan, the Sandinistas and the Contras have
initiated meetings to agree on a cease-fire. Fernandez said that if
a cease-fire is established in Nicaragua, the United States should
then negotiate directly with the Sandinistas to address U.S.
security concerns.

<HEAD>Soviets Stage Underground Nuclear Test in Central Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today exploded a nuclear device
underground, the official Tass news agency reported, indicating the
device may have had a yield seven times greater than that of the
atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
   Tass said the nuclear test was staged at 6:05 a.m. Moscow time
(10:05 p.m. EST Friday) ``with a view to upgrading military
technology.'' It gave no further details.
   The test at the main Soviet test range of Semipalatinsk in the
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan was the second Soviet nuclear
test explosion this year. A device was detonated at Semipalatinsk
on Feb. 6.
   Tass said the latest nuclear explosion had a yield of between 20
and 150 kilotons.
   The U.S. atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945
had a yield of 20 kilotons, or the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT.
   The superpowers are holding negotiations in Geneva aimed at
developing a method of verifying the yields of nuclear tests and
working out a possible test ban.
   In January, a delegation of American researchers and officials
visited the Semipalatinsk range, about 2,000 miles southeast of
Moscow, to gather information that may be used in verifying
U.S.-Soviet nuclear test agreements.
   In April, the Americans will use their methods to measure the
yield of a Soviet nuclear blast at Semipalatinsk. At the same time,
the Soviets will use their techniques to calculate the yield of a
U.S. nuclear test at the American test site in Nevada.

<HEAD>Landlord, Dubbed `Reptile' By Tenants, Begins House Arrest In Own
Building</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An elderly landlord shackled by an electronic
manacle brought new furniture and a security guard into his rundown
apartment building as he began a court-ordered stay for failing to
fix leaky pipes and other problems.
   Greeted by angry tenants and a banner reading ``Welcome You
Reptile,'' Morris Gross, 77, began serving a 15-day house arrest
Friday in a Brooklyn building where tenants complain of bugs and
rodents, leaky ceilings and a lack of heat and hot water.
   Gross, who lives in a luxury high-rise in the Brighton Beach
section of Brooklyn, made no comment to a group of tenants who
shouted at him as he walked into the lobby wearing sunglasses and a
gray scarf around his face.
   ``We ask for so many things and they don't do anything,'' said
Errol Ramdeo, who lives in apartment 5A.
   Ramdeo said the door to the apartment where he lives with his
parents is off its hinges, bathroom tiles are falling off the wall
and their stove doesn't work.
   A civil court judge convicted Gross of criminal and civil
contempt in December after the city Department of Housing
Preservation and Development brought action against him for failing
to comply with a court order to correct housing violations.
   The judge gave him the choice of either paying $169,000 in fines
for 420 violations or serving 15 days of house arrest and spending
$137,900 of the fines to repair the 113-unit building in Brooklyn's
Flatbush neighborhood.
   Gross will be confined to a fifth-floor apartment, his movements
monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet to make sure he serves
his sentence.
   When asked why Gross chose house arrest, his attorney, Stanley
Kopilow, said the landlord ``wanted to show to the judge and the
community that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press.''
   On Thursday night, after Gross' decision was announced, workers
began repairs on apartment 5C, including painting and plastering
walls and installing new kitchen tiles.
   Friday morning, delivery men unloaded a new couch, recliner
chair and bureau from a truck which they said were to be delivered
to Gross' one-bedroom apartment.
   Gross' meals will be catered, tenants said, and he will have a
private security guard with him in the apartment for the duration
of his sentence.
   Lawrence Carelli, the HPD attorney who handled the case, said
the only other case he knew in which a landlord was sentenced to
live in his own building involved a 30-day sentence handed down in
Los Angeles last year.
   He said there were still 400 outstanding violations in Gross'
building, some dating back five years.
   Joyce Stewart, president of the tenants' association, pointed
out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from which ``water
comes down like crazy.''
   Another tenant, Vivian Murray, complained of flaking paint chips
which she has discovered her 2{-year-old daughter eating.
   Building superintendent Sydney Pilgrim, while conceding that
Gross ``is not an angel,'' said the landlord had spent $1 million
to repair the building.
   ``We know he should not have let the building run down so far,
but work is getting done,'' Pilgrim said.
   Ms. Stewart countered that cosmetic repairs had been done on
only 10 to 12 apartments.
   ``When you subtract that from 113 apartments, you'll see the
real McCoy,'' she said.

<HEAD>Researcher Finds Foods Loaded with Natural Carcinogens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many foods contain very high levels of natural
cancer-causing agents, suggesting that intense efforts to control
industrial carcinogens may be misplaced, a researcher said.
   Apples, for example, contain high levels of formaldehyde, which
is considered to be a potent carcinogen, said Bruce Ames, chairman
of the biochemistry department at the University of California,
Berkeley.
   Broccoli contains a substantial amount of a substance that is
chemically similar to dioxin. Peanut butter is unavoidably
contaminated with a fungus that is highly carcinogenic.
   ``Does that mean we're being done in by vegetables? Well, that's
what the reality is turning out to be,'' Ames said Friday at the
annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
   Ames said he does not, in fact, believe that the cancer-causing
agents in food are causing us harm, because we have evolved to
defend ourselves against those agents.
   He believes, however, that the defenses we have evolved also
protect us against industrial carcinogens, which cause cancer in
the same ways as do natural carcinogens.
   Peter Preuss, director of the Office of Health and Environmental
Assessment at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said, ``I
think there's a great deal of importance in what Professor Ames
said.''
   He was critical, however, of many of Ames's calculations.
``While the idea is important, I'm disturbed by the details. I
think there's a lot of rigor that has to be introduced into that
science before it's accepted.''
   He noted, for example, that the dioxin-like substance in
broccoli might act differently than dioxin. ``There are a lot of
things that are like that, but, nevertheless, dioxin is unique,''
he said.
   Ames said most of the natural carcinogens in plants evolved as a
natural defense mechanism.
   ``Plants don't have teeth, they don't have claws, they can't run
away,'' he said. ``All plant evolution is plants developing new and
better toxins to fight off predators.''
   Ames began his talk by saying that the world is full of
carcinogens but that they are not as harmful as people believe.
   One line of evidence to support that, he said, is that, with a
few exceptions, rates of cancer have not increased in the
industrial era.
   ``Except for lung cancer, which is due to cigarette smoking,
rates of cancer are staying steady or going down,'' he said.
   While that is true for some cancers, Preuss said, others have
gone up. They include melanoma, lymphoma and cancer of the testes,
prostate and kidney.
   Ames was critical of the use of rats and mice to test whether
substances are carcinogenic. ``It's reasonable to think that
chemicals that are carcinogens in mice and rats would be
carcinogens in people _ but the hook is, at that dose.''
   Rats are given the maximum dose that won't poison them, he said,
but such doses can kill cells in the body and may lead to cancer
simply through the disruption they cause. If that were the case,
the substances would not be expected to cause cancer at the low
doses that humans might be exposed to, he said.
   Ames is the developer of an alternative test that uses bacteria
to identify possible carcinogens.
   Ames presented dozens of examples of carcinogens in plants.
Celery, for example, contains psoralens, which become carcinogenic
when exposed to light. The levels are so high that celery pickers
often develop a rash on their hands and arms as a result, Ames said.
   Potatoes have high levels of solanine and chaconine, which block
the action of a human enzyme called cholinesterase, he said.
Organophosphate pesticides are considered dangerous, said Ames,
because they do the same thing _ block cholinesterase.

<TEXT>
   One day last year, every person on Earth was
bombarded with 10,000 billion ghostly particles called neutrinos
hurled into space by the explosion of a star, an astronomer said.
   However, neutrinos are so incredibly small and elusive that they
passed through buildings, people and the Earth itself with barely a
trace. Besides, said Boston University astronomer Larry Sulak: ``We
are recycled star dust.''
   The neutrinos are the remnants of a supernova, an exploding
star, that suddenly appeared almost a year ago in the skies of the
Southern Hemisphere.
   Such explosions happen regularly, but this one was in the Large
Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy 1 million trillion miles away, which is
close by heavenly standards. It is the brightest, from an earthly
perspective, in 383 years.
   Scientists who have spent the past year studying the supernova
discussed their findings Friday at a meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
   John Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J., said that last Feb. 23, every human on Earth was showered
with about 10,000 billion neutrinos from the exploding star.
   However, people are constantly bombarded with neutrinos from our
own sun, as well, and the added dose did no harm.
   ``Only 1 in 10,000 had as much as a single hydrogen atom changed
by the neutrinos,'' Bahcall said.
   The subatomic particles have almost zero mass and no charge.
   He said the supernova explosion was the equivalent of about one
million billion billion billion atomic bombs of the kind that
destroyed Hiroshima. That's more energy than a hundred stars
shining like the Earth's sun would give off in light over the
lifetime of the universe.
   Scientists at the conference said they were surprised and
delighted that the supernova acted almost exactly like their
theories said it would.
   ``It was expected to make neutrinos, and it did, right on
schedule,'' said J. Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas in
Austin. ``The basic predictions have come to pass with this
supernova.''
   The researchers said that when the star blew up, 99 percent of
its exploding energy was released in the form of neutrinos, while
most of the rest was light. The neutrinos reached Earth three hours
before the light. That light, spotted from a mountain top in Chile
last Feb. 24, was the first sign for astronomers of the celestial
catastrophe.
   Later, though, scientists found traces of the sudden burst of
neutrinos in two huge vats of water, one in the United States and
one in Japan.
   Sulak operates the U.S. experiment, a square tank of water five
stories high that sits in a salt mine beneath Lake Erie. The tank
was built for another purpose _ witnessing the death of protons _
but it also showed that eight neutrinos from the supernova had
collided with water molecules. The Japanese tank recorded 11 such
collisions.
   The experts believe that nickel was formed during the initial
explosion. This decayed in about five days to form radioactive
cobalt, which in turn more slowly breaks down to make iron. The
cobalt gives off both light and gamma rays.
   Robert P. Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics said the steady dimming of the supernova has recently
begun to accelerate. This is because it is spewing out more of its
energy as gamma rays and less as light. However, the destroyed star
is still visible with binoculars.
   Supernovas are important to people, because they are the source
of many elements that are essential to life.
   ``This is the death of a star,'' said Kirshner. ``This is the
place where the elements are made. The calcium in your bones was
made in a supernova explosion.''

   Four delegates were chosen today to represent
this U.S. territory at the Republican National Convention and all
say they support Vice President George Bush for president.
   Those selected at the territory's Republican convention included
territorial Gov. Joseph F. Ada, who said of Bush: ``He knows where
Guam is. His heart is in Guam. He told me that one of these days
the people of Guam are going to vote for president.''
   Although residents of Guam are American citizens, they are not
allowed to cast ballots in presidential elections.
   Bush said of the Guam results: ``This victory is a tribute to
the hard work and dedication of our organization there.''
   About 200 party members who attended the GOP gathering approved
a number of resolutions that will be given to all GOP presidential
candidates.
   One of the resolutions supports the drive to give territorial
residents the right to vote in presidential elections, while
another presses for Guam to become a commonwealth of the United
States.

Tuesday's leadoff presidential primary.
   The newspaper on Friday called Dukakis, governor of neighboring
Massachusetts, ``one man who stands ahead of his colleagues vying
for the Democratic nomination ... a man who has perceptibly grown
in political stature and consciousness of national and foreign
affairs since he began his presidential bid.''
   The newspaper said Dole, the Senate minority leader, has
``credibility and leadership. Those are but two of his strong

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is expressing interest in
the efforts of three Eastern European countries to buy U.S.-made
passenger planes, but cautions there may be some stumbling blocks.
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead said Friday the
three countries, which he declined to identify, have begun talks
with the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft companies to supply
long-range passenger planes to replace aging Soviet equipment in
their national airlines.
   Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
countries involved were Poland, Hungary and Romania.
   Whitehead said that from the State Department's viewpoint, the
sales ``would be feasible and desirable'' but he noted two
potential problems.
   Buying U.S. aircraft would require large expenditures by the
governments and credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for the
purchases would not be available, Whitehead said.
   The aircraft companies, moreover, would be prohibited from
selling equipment on a list of military-applicable goods banned for
export to communist countries. This could limit the type of
airplanes the countries could buy.

   The government is reviewing use of the
insecticide dichlorvos, common in fly-killing pest strips and other
applications, in the wake of studies on laboratory animals that
show the chemical may cause cancer and liver damage.
   A special review, such as that announced Friday by the
Environmental Protection Agency, could lead to fewer or more
restrictions, a ban on the product or its exoneration.
   Some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800
products every year. About 25 percent is used on farm crops, 35
percent on livestock, 25 percent in commercial and industrial
buildings and on lawns and ornamental crops, and 15 percent in
homes and on pets, EPA said.
   Dichlorvos has been used since 1948 against flies, mosquitoes,
gnats, cockroaches and other insects.

<HEAD>Judge Rules EPA Hasn't Justified Continued Sales Of Chlordane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says the Environmental
Protection Agency hasn't produced any evidence to back its
assertion that distribution of remaining stocks of the pesticide
chlordane won't cause undue harm.
   U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer said Friday the EPA
hadn't legally proven it can authorize the retail sale of small
amounts of the pesticide chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately
take the anti-termite chemical off the market.
   The agency's latest court filing does not satisfy federal law
which requires the EPA to determine that a pesticide will not
unreasonably harm the environment, he said.
   The EPA believes that chlordane causes cancer. To avoid a
protracted battle with 197 distributors, the agency has agreed to
let them sell chlordane already in stock. In return, the companies
are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the
pesticide.

   The Navy and Pentagon say they can't explain
why they didn't honor a widow's request to withhold public
announcement that a military laboratory had identified the remains
of her husband who died in the Vietnam War.
   The widow, Erna McKinney of San Diego, Calif., said in a
telephone interview she had asked that the identification be
withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify
the military's forensic work.
   The Navy acknowledged late Friday that ``due to an oversight,''
the remains of Navy Lt. Clemie McKinney, an aviator who was lost
over South Vietnam on April 14, 1972, had been transported from
Hawaii to California this week without informing Mrs. McKinney.
   ``I told them I didn't want them to release the identification
because I wasn't prepared to accept the finding; that I wanted a
second opinion,'' said Mrs. McKinney.
   ``All I can say is that we routinely abide by the family's
desires on that point,'' said Lt. Col. Keith Schneider. ``If we had
been aware of that request here (at the Pentagon), we would have
made sure the identification was not released publicly.''

<HEAD>Millionaire Must Help Homeless In Unusual Sentence For Tax Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrialist Victor Posner must design a $3
million project to aid the homeless and work in a downtown shelter
for vagrants as part of an unusual sentence for tax evasion.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman told the 69-year-old
tycoon Friday that he would have served some of the maximum 40-year
prison term he had faced had Posner not offered to make a large
contribution of time and money instead.
   Posner, whose worth is estimated at more than $240 million,
pleaded no contest Sept. 29 to evading more than $1.2 million in
federal taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a Bible
college as a tax exemption.
   ``If I didn't have the alternative you've given me, Mr. Posner,
then I would turn to the only alternative the law gives me,''
Spellman said. ``That is incarceration.
   ``At your age, I doubt you'd be in jail more than six to nine
months regardless of the sentence,'' he said.
   Spellman also warned Posner, ``Not one dollar of the funds of
this project are tax-deductible!''
   The sentence also includes five years probation, 5,000 hours of
community service, $4 million in back taxes, penalties and interest
and a $75,000 fine.
   Posner must spend six months with a committee of experts
studying the plight of the homeless in South Florida, design
solutions and then pay a minimum of $3 million to implement them.
His sentence begins immediately, spending five hours a week for the
next 60 days at the Camillus House shelter for the homeless.
   Posner fended off questions after the hearing but responded when
asked if the sentencing plan was his idea.
   ``I've been involved in charitable work all my life, and I give
millions and millions to charity,'' he said.
   Prosecutors had asked Spellman to give him jail time, arguing it
would be a deterrent to tax evasion.
   But Monsignor Bryan Walsh, a member of the committee and head of
the charity organization of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Miami, said the sentence could be a great help to the homeless.
   ``There is so little help for the homeless in South Florida,''
he said, noting the city has no permanent public shelters for them.
   Posner was indicted in 1982 on charges of filing false returns
between 1975 and 1979 and of evading taxes by inflating the value
of property he donated to Miami Christian College.
   Miami real estate broker William Scharrer Sr. was charged with
aiding and abetting in the tax violations. He was convicted in 1984
and sentenced to 18 months.
   Posner's holdings include controlling interests in Royal Crown
Cola, Sharon Steel Corp., Arby's and the Graniteville textile
company. He was named America's highest-paid executive by Business
Week magazine in 1985.
   The secretive industrialist, who rarely grants public interview,
reportedly earned $8.6 million in 1986.
   Posner, a high school dropout and son of a Russian immigrant,
has sold off holdings in recent years to pay company debts.
   His Evans Products Co. and Sharon Steel have filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law.

<HEAD>Bomb Explosions in Start of Opposition Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FARID HOSSAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least half a dozen homemade bombs
exploded in Dhaka today at the start of a two-day general strike
called by the opposition to force President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
to resign, witnesses said.
   The explosions rocked a shopping center near the Dhaka
University campus, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The campus is a hotbed of opposition agitation.
   No injuries were reported.
   But a bomb explosion Friday night left one person injured and a
two-story house damaged in downtown Dhaka, police said.
   Police suspect the victim was making a bomb when it accidentally
exploded. The victim and an alleged accomplice were arrested.
   Bombs are frequently used in political unrest, despite tough
government laws that include death sentences for bomb throwers.
   In Dhaka's old district, two scooter rickshaws were set on fire
today, police said.
   The dawn-to-dust strike, scheduled to run through Sunday, was
the 23rd general strike since Nov. 10 called by the opposition.
   The opposition wants Ershad to step down and March 3 elections
for a new Parliament to be held under a neutral caretaker
government. The 21 opposition parties are boycotting the polls,
saying that elections will be rigged to favor Ershad's governing
Jayiya Party.
   Ershad, a 58-year-old former army general who seized power in a
coup in 1982, has refused to resign.
   Dhaka stores remained closed today, and most traffic was halted
in the city of 4 million residents. Some bicycle-powered rickshaws
were seen on the streets.
   Riot police guarded the city's main intersections, but they
appeared relaxed. Some police were seen leaning on their rifles
while others read morning newspapers on the sunbaked streets.
   Meanwhile, the death toll in violence during this week's local
elections in Bangladesh rose to 135, two newspapers reported today.
   The independent Bengali-language daily Ittefaq and the
English-language New Nation reported the toll, which is 55 more
than the official figure of 80 deaths.
   Widespread violence hit Bangladesh Wednesday during voting to
elect 4,370 village councils. The deaths resulted from clashes
among supporters of rival candidates. At least 8,000 people were
injured in the violence.
   The current violence has brought this impoverished nation of 105
million people to its worst political situation in 17 years of
independence. Bangladesh was formerly East Pakistan.
   According to trade estimates, Bangladesh has lost about $17
million a day in reduced production and exports during the general
strikes.

<HEAD>Laughter Helps Alleviate Stress, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OBERLIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who are able to laugh it up under
pressure seem to have greater resistance to stress-related ailments
than those who don't, according to a psychologist studying the link
between humor and health.
   ``This study points to the conclusion that humor does confer
some health benefit when you're under stress,'' Albert Porterfield,
assistant professor of psychology at Oberlin College, said Friday.
   Porterfield based his observations on preliminary results of a
study of 140 Oberlin students who were tested to determine their
sense of humor, then completed questionnaires on incidence of such
stress-related maladies as headaches, rashes, and digestive
problems.
   ``There is a long-recognized relationship between the kinds of
stress one encounters throughout life and depression and physical
illness,'' Porterfield said. ``What isn't well-understood are the
factors that determine how strongly day-to-day stress and
well-being are linked in people.''
   For students whose sense of humor was ranked in the top 50
percent, there was no significant link between their stress levels
and how they felt physically, he said. For those on the lower half
of the humor scale, there was a positive connection between stress
and illness.
   The results were similar when the same students were tested a
year later, Porterfield said. The connection between humor and
resistance to stress-related illnesses seems to show a marked
increase for those above the 60th percentile in the humor rating,
he said.
   The humor rankings were based on two tests: one presents
subjects with hypothetical situations and asks them how they would
respond; the other deals with subjects' use of humor in times of
stress.

   John Crean is a familiar face at
the Exchange Club, even though he has missed about 1,400 meetings
of the civic group since helping found it.
   Crean is one of the club's strongest supporters, said Jerry
Kobrin, a friend and fellow member, ``but for the 27 years he's
been a member, he's never attended a meeting.''
   Well, not exactly; Creen has been to two.
   The local businessman's most recent appearance at an Exchange
Club meeting was Thursday, when members gathered at a Newport Beach
restaurant to present him with a ``Perfect Non-Attendance Award.''
   ``I'm usually busy in the middle of the day and can't find time
to come here,'' Crean explained.
   Then he pointed out that he really didn't deserve the award.
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``I was here once, 10 years ago, so it's
not really perfect non-attendance.''

   Rock music fans are used to standing in
long ticket lines for big concerts, but this week it's the late
playwright Eugene O'Neill who's causing waits of an hour or more.
   ``It's pretty unusual,'' Yale Repertory Theatre Press Director
Robert Wildman said Friday.
   The Yale Rep is presenting two O'Neill plays, ``Ah,
Wilderness!'' and ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' both starring
Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst, from late March through May 21.
   The plays, presented in celebration of the 100th anniversary of
O'Neill's birth, may go on to New York City and the Soviet Union.
   Since tickets went on sale Monday, ticket buyers have had to
wait between an hour and an hour and a half, Wildman said. When
ticket booths opened Monday, more than 75 people waited in a line
that extended onto the sidewalk and around a corner, and the waits
for some were more than two hours.
   Since the performances were announced last August, eager
playgoers have been asking about tickets, some calling from as far
away as Texas, Wildman said.
   Directing ``Long Day's Journey'' is Jose Quintero, who also
directed Robards and Dewhurst in the 1973 Tony Award-winning
revival of ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' another O'Neill play.
   Robards' 1956 performance in O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh,''
also under Quintero's direction, launched him to stardom. The 1956
production also popularized the play largely ignored for the 10
years after its debut.

<HEAD>Huge Heroin Haul Seized, Worth More Than $2 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today said they intercepted
1.4 tons of top-grade heroin bound for New York worth more than $2
billion on the street, in what was believed to be the world's
largest single heroin bust.
   The 2,822 pounds of No. 4 grade heroin were hidden in bales of
rubber sheets on a freighter at Klong Toey Port in Bangkok, said
Viroj Laohaphan, the director general of the Customs Department.
   No. 4 grade heroin is 97 percent pure.
   Viroj said the drug was discovered when customs officials,
acting on a tip, began opening the 665 bales earlier this week.
Heroin had been found in 62 bales by the time the search was
completed Friday night, he told a news conference.
   The ship was to leave for New York later this month, authorities
said.
   ``The packing in rubber sheets prevented police dogs from
smelling the heroin,'' Viroj said. ``If this amount of heroin had
left Thailand, it would have killed an uncountable number of
people.''
   Viroj said the previous largest heroin bust was of 2,640 pounds,
seized in France in 1972.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
the biggest previous heroin seizure that U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration officials in Thailand could recall was a haul also
of 2,640 pounds.
   That seizure was made several years ago on a shrimp boat off the
coast of a Central American country, Petzing said. He said he had
no further details of that bust.
   Petzing said No. 4 grade heroin, cut, diluted and sold on the
streets of New York, would fetch about $1.6 million a kilogram,
which equals 2.2 pounds. He quoted DEA agents as saying the drug
probably was bought in northern Thailand for about $4,400 a kilo.
   The officials said the heroin was believed to have come from
Southeast Asia's ``Golden Triangle'' _ a major drug producing
region where the borders of Thailand, Laos and Burma converge.
   Viroj said Thai authorities have questioned an employee of the
shipping company, but made no arrests. ``It will take time to find
the masterminds,'' he said, declining to give details.
   He said the rubber bales were to have been exported by the
Rubber Plus Import-Export Company to the A.I.C. Company in the New
York City borough of Queens. He said U.S. authorities had inspected
300 bales at the company's Elmhurst, Queens, warehouse but did not
find incriminating evidence.
   Viroj said he received information, however, that a woman
representative of A.I.C. was arrested.
   News reports said the manager of the Rubber Plus Import-Export
had disappeared and police found its offices in Bangkok deserted.
   Thai authorities seized 1,496 pounds of heroin aboard a trawler
off the southern province of Chumphon last Oct. 20 in what was then
described as Thailand's biggest heroin bust.

   Songwriter Frederick Loewe, who
teamed with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner for such hit Broadway musicals
as ``Camelot,'' and ``My Fair Lady,'' was in fair condition today
in a hospital cardiac unit, a spokeswoman said.
   Loewe, 86, was rushed to Desert Hospital Wednesday night after
he experienced chest pains and trouble breathing, said his
guardian, John F. Morris.The songwriter was admitted to the
hospital in serious condition Thursday, said hospital spokeswoman
Linda Riggs.
   Loewe was transferred late Friday from intensive care to the
hospital's cardiac care unit, said a spokeswoman who declined to be
identified.
   He was in fair condition this morning, said a nursing supervisor
who refused to give her name.
   Palm Springs is 100 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Lerner and Loewe's collaboration lasted 18 years, from a
one-night flop in Detroit in 1942 through ``Brigadoon'' in 1947 and
``My Fair Lady'' in 1956. They parted bitterly after ``Camelot,''
their last Broadway hit, in 1960.
   Critic Brooks Atkinson called ``My Fair Lady,'' a musical
adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion,'' ``one of the
best musicals of the century ... close to the genius of creation.''
   ``I Could Have Danced All Night'' and ``On the Street Where You
Live'' were two immediate hits, but ``Get Me to the Church on
Time,'' ``With a Little Bit of Luck'' and ``I've Grown Accustomed
to Her Face'' also became standards. Lerner and Loewe reportedly
needed just 10 minutes to write another song from the show, ``The
Rain in Spain.''
   Other memorable songs included ``Almost Like Being In Love,''
from ``Brigadoon,''; ``Thank Heaven For Little Girls,'' from
``Gigi,'' and ``If Ever I Would Leave You,'' from ``Camelot.''
   The team reunited in 1973 for a Broadway production of ``Gigi,''
which they had done as a film in 1958. Loewe retired permanently in
1974, but they remained friends. Lerner died in 1986.

   It could be months before an ironworker
learns whether he will regain the use of a hand torn off in an
industrial accident and joined to his abdomen for 2{ months to save
it, doctors say.
   Twelve doctors reattached Mike Thomas' hand to his arm during
22{ hours of surgery that ended Friday. Thomas, 31, of Cleveland,
Ala., was in serious condition in an intensive care unit at
University Hospital.
   ``To our knowledge, this is the first time a severed limb has
been kept (alive) this way'' in the United States, said hospital
spokesman Hank Black.
   Even if the surgery turns out successful, the nerve damage to
the hand was such that Thomas ``will never be able to do the type
work he did before,'' said one of the surgeons, Paul Sauer.
   ``Hopefully, we will have a hand which will at least have enough
feeling to serve as a helper to Mr. Thomas' other hand, and one
that is cosmetically superior to a prosthesis,'' he said.
   He said that Thomas would be required to keep his left arm and
hand in a cradle-like position.
   Sauer and another surgeon, Michael Miller, said it might be
months before Miller learns whether he will be able to use his left
hand at all. If the reattachment doesn't work, they said, the hand
might have to be amputated.
   Meanwhile, he will go through intensive therapy.
   ``We think that we can achieve adequate circulation to the hand
and that the bone will grow together, but how well the nerves and
muscles will regenerate is the question,'' Sauer said.
   Using microscopes and sutures thinner than a human hair, the
surgeons reattached two of the three main nerves to the hand.
   Thomas lost the hand, wrist and a small part of his forearm when
he grabbed a cable to break a 70-foot fall from a girder while he
was working at a church Nov. 24. The cable wrapped around his
forearm and pulled the hand off.
   Because the break was not clean, doctors said, they were not
sure at first whether the nerves were damaged too badly to allow
the implant.
   To gain time to study the problem, they decided to attach the
hand's arteries, veins and skin to those on his abdomen.
   Such an attachment has been used twice, once successfully, in
Yugoslavia, with a broken limb attached to blood vessels under an
arm, doctors said.
   Thomas is expected to return home within two weeks.

   Eight convicts armed with
knives and homemade bombs escaped from a southern penal colony by
taking hostage the penitentiary's superintendent and his wife,
police said today.
   The hostages were released later.
   Most of the escapees are serving terms for murder.
   Police said the inmates barged into the chapel of the San Ramon
Prison and Penal Farm and seized superintendent Leonito Narvaez and
his wife as the couple attended Mass late Friday with other prison
officials and prisoners.
   The inmates then walked out the gates of the sprawling complex,
threatening to kill the hostages if guards tried to stop them,
police said.
   Narvaez and his wife were released two hours later in a village
several miles away.
   Most inmates at the penal colony, near Zamboanga City 540 miles
southeast of Manila, live with their families and are allowed to
cultivate small farms within the complex.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking Valentine's Day seriously is the raison
d'etre behind Paris' first ``Salon de l'Amour,'' where the lovelorn
can seek counsel in trying to ignite, revive or fan the flames of
passion.
   ``Why is love always presented in such a fragmented way when
love is indivisible?'' asked Fabienne Baudot, an organizer of the
four-day exhibition. ``The range of exhibitors here is
intentionally vast to give visitors as much information as
possible.''
   Stands around the hall display sense enhancers such as lingerie
and aphrodisiacs. There are counselors on sex and health and a
booth with information on AIDS.
   ``It's not because you love a car that you know how to drive
it,'' said Dr. Jacques Waynberg, a leading Paris sexologist who is
among the specialists lecturing on love at the event that runs
through Valentine's Day.
   The traditional box of chocolates has been replaced by a new
Valentine's Day wine, produced in the Rhone river town of
Roquemaure where the relics of St. Valentine are kept.
   Valentine's Day gets less fanfare in France than across the
Atlantic, and experts say this first salon reflects a trend.
   ``An exhibition founded on the word love wouldn't have been
understood by the French public five years ago,'' Waynberg said in
an interview. Then, people were ``more sensitized to the sexual
dimension of things.''
   An exhibit on eroticism is held in Paris annually. But in
France, as in other Western countries, the trend is toward the less
ephemeral aspects of a relationship.
   Waynberg told a conference that sex is like a job _ to be
learned _ and that sex and love do not necessarily mix.
   ``Erotic life obeys a certain competence. It is a job. You have
to know how to make love,'' he said. Otherwise, ``it's like giving
a beautiful book to someone who doesn't know how to read.''
   Waynberg emphasized the fragile foundations of many
relationships, so often based on passionate or sentimental love,
both volatile commodities.
   ``It's a sentiment that I question as a professional,'' he said.
``In poetry, it is good. In art, it is perfect. In itself, it is
highly questionable .... ``I don't say love is sad, but I say it's
dangerous.
   ``If there is no `marriage de raison' between a couple, then you
must have reason in a marriage of love.''
   The emphasis on passion and sex is falling off, according to a
recent cover story in the newsweekly VSD.
   A 1972 study showed that 80 percent of French adults considered
a successful sex life a determining source of happiness. A poll
taken in 1986 showed that only 39 percent of French people
considered sex a determining factor in their happiness.
   A poll earlier this month indicated that one French woman in
three and one French man in four is ``sometimes'' or ``often''
bored during lovemaking.
   Today's young generation is moving away from the joys of eros,
Waynberg said. The young women are taking a fresh look at their
grandmothers, mistresses of hearth and home, and reassessing their
options.
   ``Grandmother was maybe not such a bimbo after all,'' Waynberg
said.
   As the session closed, a portly, elderly man shook his head in
agreement. Sex and love are two separate things, he said. Then,
turning to his neighbor, he recalled his late wife, who died eight
years ago.
   During her illness, she told him to pay a visit to another woman.
   ``Another woman?'' the man repeated with a hint of amazement and
admiration, and as though the incident were yesterday. ``Now that's
love, isn't it? That's love.''

   Friends urged a teen-age girl bringing
Valentine's candy and flowers home from school to run when her
estranged husband showed up, but he shot her to death before
critically wounding himself, authorities said.
   Janie Gallardo, 16, died shortly after being shot in the back of
the head Friday, said police Sgt. Richard Castillon.
   Her 28-year-old husband, Johnny Gallardo, was in critical
condition today at Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center with a
gunshot wound to the head, said a center employee who refused to
identify himself.
   Gallardo was charged with murder late Friday, and Night
Magistrate Quon Lew set his bond at $100,000.
   Mrs. Gallardo had been in the process of obtaining a restraining
order against her husband, Castillon said.
   ``They were married, but were separated for the past three
months and she had been receiving a lot of harassment from that
guy,'' he explained. The couple had been married three years,
family members said.
   On Friday, the teen-ager was carrying a box of Valentine's
candy, two carnations and a small stuffed teddy bear she had
received during a party at Lowell Middle School.
   ``She was apparently getting off the bus coming from school. As
she and her girlfriends were walking home, they noticed her
ex-husband and they told the girl to `run, run,' but she didn't and
he pulled the gun and shot her once in the back of the head,''
Castillon said.
   ``Just at the same time, he put the gun to his head and fired
twice,'' Castillon said.
   Rosa Ferrer said she saw the girl walking down the street and a
man following her.
   ``Then the first shot, he shot the girl, and then he shot
himself,'' she told KSAT-TV. ``We were the first ones here with the
girl and the boy. She was already dead. He was alive.''

   A five-alarm fire today consumed the landmark
high school that inspired the hit movie and TV show ``Fame,''
injuring 30 of the 200 firefighters battling the blaze in freezing
temperatures and high winds.
   The third, fourth and fifth floors and a section of the roof of
the six-story former High School for the Performing Arts in
Manhattan collapsed, forcing officials to pull all firefighters out
of the building, said spokesman Efrain Parrilla.
   Some firefighters were sent back into the building about two
hours later because there was no other way to get to the blaze,
Parilla said.
   The fire was declared under control by 5:30 a.m., nearly five
hours after it was reported, Parrilla said. Pockets of flame were
expected to continue burning through the morning, but firefighters
were expected to be able to keep it from spreading.
   Four firefighters were sent to hospitals with minor injuries,
Parrilla said. Twenty-six others were treated at the scene for
sprain, cuts, and other minor injuries.
   The fire at what is now Liberty High School near Times Square
was reported at 12:38 a.m. The blaze started on the third floor and
burned up to the roof, Parrilla said.
   High winds and slippery conditions due to recent snow and rain
hampered firefighters, the spokesman said. The National Weather
Service reported winds gusting to 28 mph and wind chills of minus 7.
   The high school was designated a city landmark in 1982. The
performing arts school, part of the public school system, combined
with the High School of Music and Art about three years ago and
moved to a new home.
   Although the Board of Education did not permit film crews to
shoot scenes for ``Fame'' inside the high school building, the
facade was seen in the 1980 film and the TV series.

   Longtime CBS newsman Anthony Streuli, who
was directing the network's coverage of the New Hampshire primary,
died in his hotel room, the network said. He was 43.
   Streuli, from the Boston suburb of Marblehead, apparently died
of natural causes Friday at the hotel that was serving as CBS'
field headquarters, said network spokesman Tom Goodman. No autopsy
was performed, he said.
   ``We shall mourn him and we shall miss him,'' anchor Dan Rather
said in a brief tribute to Streuli on Friday's ``CBS Evening News.''
   ``All of us are stunned by his death, and saddened by this
tragic loss to his family and colleagues,'' said CBS News President
Howard Stringer.
   Streuli, the Boston producer for CBS News since April 1986,
joined the radio network as a newswriter in 1969. During his
career, he worked on the ``CBS Morning News,'' ``CBS Evening News''
and as assistant bureau chief in London.
   A 1966 Colgate University graduate, Streuli was born in Zurich,
Switzerland, and worked for the Armed Forces Radio Network before
joining CBS. He spent 11 years with network radio, and moved to the
television side in 1981.
   He is survived by three brothers: Peter of Lausanne,
Switzerland; Konrad of Bolton, Mass.; and Mark of Stowe, Vermont.

   A winter storm ran out of steam in the Northeast early today,
while light snow fell in the central Appalachians, parts of the
Midwest and along the Great Lakes.
   Snow was expected to taper off today in New England and eastern
New York, where 12 to 18 inches piled up after the storm rolled
into the region early Friday.
   Blowing and drifting snow was expected today in extreme
northeastern Ohio, where more than 2 inches fell overnight.
   Advisories for snow were in effect this morning for the
mountains of western Pennsylvania and West Virginia and the
northern mountains of North Carolina.
   Advisories for lake effect snow were posted tonight for parts of
western Pennsylvania, northeastern Ohio and western New York.
   Heavier snowfall in six hour overnight included 7 inches in
Limestone, Maine, 5 at Lebanon, N.H., and Caribou, Maine, and 4
inches at Burlington, Vt.

Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, the Great Lakes and the Appalachians.
   In California on Friday, record highs for the date were set at
several locations, including San Francisco, where it was 69, one
degree warmer than the record set in 1953.
   A high of 86 in Tucson, Ariz., broke the record for the date of
85 set in 1957.
   Today's forecast called for snow from western New York and
Pennsylvania through northern and central New England; scattered
rain and mountain snow from Washington state and northern Oregon
across Idaho, Montana, western Wyoming and northern Idaho to

   Two U.S. warships violated Soviet territorial
waters, ignored warnings from patrol craft and made ``dangerous
maneuvers'' that led to collisions with Soviet ships in the Black
Sea, a Soviet admiral charged today.
   Rear Adm. Nikolai P. Markov appeared at a hastily called news
briefing to give the first detailed Kremlin version of the incident
that happened off the Crimean peninsula, in which two Soviet navy
vessels grazed the American warships.
   On Friday night, the Defense Ministry accused the American
vessels of violating Soviet waters, but did not mention any
physical contact between them and Soviet ships.
   U.S. Navy officials said the cruiser USS Yorktown and the
destroyer USS Caron were deliberately bumped while exercising their
right to pass through international waters.
   However, Markov and Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov told reporters the U.S. warships were knowingly violating
Soviet waters, and said the collisions were the fault of the
American captains.
   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territorial
limit, the Soviet Union claims a 12-mile limit along its coast.
   Gerasimov said U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock had been summoned to
the Foreign Ministry today, where Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh read him a ``strong protest.
   ``The Soviet side cannot but view the actions of the United
States Navy as aimed at undermining the process of improvement in
Soviet-American relations which has appeared recently,'' Gerasimov
said, quoting from the protest.
   U.S. Navy Cmdr. Richard Schiff, a lawyer, said Friday in
Washington that any country claiming a 12-mile territorial limit
``must allow for innocent passage by the ships of all nations.''
   But Markov and Gerasimov said Soviet law does not provide for
the right of innocent passage in Black Sea waters, which the
Soviets have longed claimed as their own.
   Markov was repeatedly asked to specify what he meant by
``dangerous maneuvers,'' and said the American warships had been
warned both before and after entering Soviet waters.
   ``Generally one can and should regard the very fact of entering
Soviet territorial waters as dangerous maneuvering'' he said.
   He said the two Soviet warships, identified by Pentagon
officials as a Krivak-class frigate and a Mirka-class patrol boat,
were on a ``basically parallel course'' with the U.S. vessels when
the grazings occurred.
   The larger Krivak-class vessel brushed the left side of the
Yorktown, while the Caron was grazed on the same side by the patrol
craft, U.S. officials said.
   Both U.S. and Soviet officials have said the grazings caused no
injuries.
   Markov did not name the Soviet warships, but a small chart
displayed at the briefing identified them as the frigate Bezzavetny
and the patrol ship SKR-6.
   According to the chart, the American warships, steaming
eastward, entered Soviet waters at about 11 a.m. Moscow time south
of Sevastopol, headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea fleet.
   Markov said at one time, the two American ships were as close as
9.2 miles to shore. He said they remained in Soviet territorial
waters following the grazings.
   The Yorktown left Soviet waters at 12:21 p.m. Moscow time south
of the resort city of Yalta, and the Caron, sailing north of the
cruiser, followed about a half-hour later, according to the chart.
   At last notice, the two U.S. vessels were back to ``routine
operations'' in the Black Sea, Navy Capt. Gerry Flynn said Friday
in Washington.
   Markov said the Friday incident was the third of its kind in
recent years.
   In March 1986, the same two ships, the Yorktown and the Caron,
violated Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, he said, and
two American warships penetrated Soviet waters off Kamchatka in the
Soviet Far East last year.
   In Washington, a high-ranking State Department official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said that although the
department had protested the Soviet's behavior, he did not expect
the incident to disturb a U.S.-Soviet effort to narrow differences
on arms control, human rights, regional disputes and bilateral
issues.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is scheduled to go to Moscow
in two weeks to further those efforts and talk about a U.S.-Soviet
summit meeting tentatively scheduled in the Soviet capital in the
spring.

<HEAD>Scientists Say New Ceramics May Lead To Superconductors.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers in Japan, Switzerland and the United
States are experimenting with a new class of ceramics which may
carry larger electric currents than other superconductors, a Swiss
scientist reported.
   Karl Alex Muller, a 1987 Nobel laureate in physics, told a
breakfast meeting at Boston University on Friday the new ceramic
compounds were discovered in Japan in January.
   He said they were duplicated and improved by researchers in his
Zurich laboratory.
   Meanwhile, Du Pont Co. scientists Friday said they had been able
to duplicate the Japanese results and had also identified the
structure and composition of the ceramics.
   Muller is scheduled to address the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, which is holding its annual meeting here,
on Monday.
   ``I am very glad; I'm delighted that we have found these new
compounds,'' said Muller, who received an honorary doctorate from
the university Thursday. ``With these temperatures, you can be much
more optimistic about achieving high currents.''
   The new ceramics may overcome a problem with other materials
which bar the running of large currents through high-temperature
superconductors, researchers said.
   Superconductors are materials which allow transmission of
electricity with no resistance or loss of energy. Materials which
can carry high electric currents and generate large magnetic fields
might lead to very fast computers and-long distance transmission of
electricity.
   A team of scientists at the National Institute for Metals in
Tsukuba, Japan, was the first to find superconductivity in the new
ceramics, working at 243 degrees below zero.
   The material is made up bismuth, strontium, calcium and copper,
mixed with oxygen.
   Muller indicated that his team working for the International
Business Machines Corp. also had been able to identify the
material's structure.
   He said his group had achieved superconductivity at higher
temperatures than the Japanese, but declined to provide details.
   Researchers are writing a report on the results, said IBM
spokesman Gerald Present.
   Researchers in superconductivity have sought to find a stable,
reproducible material that works at temperatures above 288 degrees
below zero. Superconductivity becomes stronger as temperature drops.

<HEAD>Mrs. King Criticizes Original Constitution, Says More Hurdles to
Cross</HEAD>

   Two hundred years after a group of men gathered
to write the Constitution, women and minorities are closing in on
equal status but still have many hurdles to cross, Coretta Scott
King told a national symposium.
   Mrs. King, wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr., said Friday that criticism of the Constitution as it was
adopted in 1787 is justified.
   Her speech came in the closing day of a symposium on women and
the Constitution convened by former first ladies Rosalynn Carter
and Lady Bird Johnson. About 1,500 women from all 50 states and 10
foreign countries attended.
   ``Some people apparently feel that blacks and women should join
in an uncritical celebration of a document that protected the slave
trade and denied women their democratic rights,'' Mrs. King said.
``We still have a way to go before we can say that the Constitution
is working for all Americans.''
   Mrs. King echoed another speaker at the symposium, 1984 vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, in calling for more
political activism on the part of women.
   ``If America is to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, we
will need many more women of all races holding elective office,''
Mrs. King said. ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for
nurturing and compassion which has been finely honed and tempered
in our struggle to raise families in a sexist society.''
   ``We just might save this nation from its pending apointment
with Armageddon,'' she said.
   Mrs. King said the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s
laid the groundwork for the women's rights movements of the years
that followed. She said the kind of organized, non-violent dissent
championed by her late husband is still an effective form of
protest.
   ``The (civil rights) movement showed millions of Americans that
you can, indeed you must, defy authority when that authority is in
the wrong,'' Mrs. King said.
   Earlier Friday, Ms. Ferraro said that while no women are among
the candidates for president in either party, women have reached
higher levels in the campaign organizations than ever before.
   ``The women who hold positions of responsibility in presidential
campaigns, whether or not their candidate is ultimately successful,
will forge contacts and gain credibility that will endure beyond
this election cycle,'' she said.
   ``Many of them will be back, with higher ambitions and sharper
skills, in 1992,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   Ms. Ferraro, whose presence on the 1984 Democratic ticket with
Walter Mondale was a high point for the women's movement, said the
women in some of the 1988 campaigns will go on to be advisers to
the next president.
   ``And that's important, too,'' she said. ``The current
administration has widely been regarded as hostile to women's
issues. That is in part because this president's inner circle of
advisers ... have except for his wife been men.''

<HEAD>Brazil Sets Worries Aside for Carnival</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Carnival, when practically the
whole of Brazil puts its worries aside and parties round-the-clock
for four straight days, struts and sways to a start today.
   The festival ends on Ash Wednesday, Feb. 17, when Brazilians can
begin pondering again the nation's huge foreign debt and corruption
scandals in the suitable bleakness of Lent.
   For now, however, party is the word.
   ``Carnival is an escape valve,'' said Roberto Couri, president
of Rio's Monte Libano Club, a main center of celebration. ``It
doesn't matter what troubles there may be. When Carnival comes,
Brazilians plunge right in.''
   Carnival seems to have been made for Brazilians, and they began
working up to it well in advance. So many people had their minds on
Carnival this week that it was difficult to transact business with
either private companies or the government.
   Not even a strike that began Friday by the nation's two largest
airlines, Varig and Vasp, would stop the party. Flight crews walked
off the job and said they would strike until Sunday, tying up most
domestic and some international flights.
   In Brasilia, the normally sedate inland capital, a pre-festival
highlight was a ``bar-athon.''
   Contestants ran about 3{ miles, and the winner was the person
who swilled the most beer from an accompanying tank truck, not the
one who finished first.
   In Rio, the hub of Carnival, noisy block parties punctured the
week and the first balls were held in a series that continues
through the celebration.
   The dances, which attract thousands of revelers and last all
night, range from the sophisticated Champagne Ball to the earthy
Bum-Bum Ball.
   One of the most popular events is Rio's ``samba school'' parade,
scheduled for Sunday and Monday nights in the ``sambadrome,'' six
blocks of open-air concrete bleachers near downtown.
   Competing will be the city's 16 best samba schools, which serve
as neighborhood social clubs.
   Each school puts 4,000-6,000 brilliantly costumed people on the
route in a spectacle that lasts for about 16 hours each day.
   Most participants, dressed as kings, princesses, Amazon
chieftains, Greek gods and maharajas, toil the rest of the year at
non-descript jobs that often pay the minimum wage of $60 a month.
   When it began, the samba school parade was an informal folk
event. Now it is big business.
   This year the Samba School League, formed in 1985 to protect the
clubs' interests, sold exclusive television rights for the parades
for a reported $1 million to the commercial network TV Globo.
   Samba parade tickets for foreign tourists were jacked up this
year to as much as $238 each, payable in U.S. dollars.
   Many local travel agents refused to distribute them at such
prices.
   The president of the Samba School League, a burly man known only
as Captain Guimaraes, said on television: ``In the past, samba
schools were exploited, yet they were the ones who created the
entire show. Yes, we're after more money ... to protect the
traditional values of samba.''
   Many Carnival tourists are among the estimated 30,000 to 40,000
people who will be affected by the strike of Varig and Vasp flight
crews, the airlines' press offices said.
   Non-Brazilian carriers were not affected by the strike Friday.
Transbrasil, Brazil's other major airline, operated normally after
reaching a separate agreement with its flight crews.
   Edson Antonio Matosinho, one of the directors of Brazil's
12,000-member flight crew union, said in a telephone interview that
about 7,000 Varig and Vasp employees joined the strike.
   The strike was called to demand a 65 percent wage hike,
Matosinho said.
   Flight crew workers' salaries range from $385 to $3,300 a month,
he said.

   A winter storm that plastered the Northeast with more than 2
feet of snow and gale-force winds began to peter out today after
shutting down schools, government offices, highways and much of New
Hampshire's presidential campaign.
   At least 22 traffic deaths were blamed on the storm, although no
one was injured when wind gusting to 50 mph tore down 15 stories of
metal construction scaffolding around a building in White Plains,
N.Y., on Friday.
   The storm, which had gained strength as it moved northward from
Texas through the Great Lakes region earlier in the week, left 12
to 25 inches of snow from eastern New York across much of Vermont
and New Hampshire to southern Maine on Friday, the National Weather
Service said.
   ``It's one of the biggest ones of the year. New York and
Vermont, they get these things one every year or two,'' said Lyle
Alexander of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center.
   Storm warnings for northern Maine and Vermont were still in
effect this morning as the storm headed into Canada, Alexander said.
   ``It's terrible out there,'' New Hampshire state police
dispatcher Norman St. Hilaire, said Friday, reporting numerous
vehicles sliding off highways.
   Ironically, across the continent in Calgary, Alberta, white sand
was trucked in to fill in melting patches on the field used for
today's opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. It hasn't snowed
there for a week.
   Snow accumulations included 25 inches in Crawford Notch, N.H.,
23 in Lebanon, over two feet in Brattleboro, Vt., 14 inches in the
Berkshires of eastern Massachusetts and more than 13 inches in
Jewett, N.Y.
   In the South, up to 3 inches of snow, freezing rain and sleet
left roads extremely slippery across northern sections of
Mississippi and Alabama, and into parts of Tennessee and Kentucky,
and many vehicles slid into ditches.
   A foot of snow and wind gusting to 60 mph immobilized much of
New Hampshire's presidential campaign, holing up Vice President
Bush in his hotel and forcing Democratic hopeful Paul Simon to
cancel his morning schedule.
   Bob Dole and Pat Robertson couldn't get out of the state for
appearances elsewhere, while Jesse Jackson and Al Gore, in
Virginia, and Jack Kemp, in Washington, couldn't get into the state.
   Only Richard Gephardt had a campaign event made to order for
such a day _ watching a dog sled race in Laconia.
   Boston's Logan International Airport closed for about six hours
because of poor visibility in blowing snow and hundreds of
travelers camped out in waiting lounges.
   Connecticut's Bradley International Airport closed for more than
two hours while 8 inches of snow was removed. USAir canceled
flights into Albany, N.Y., during the morning.
   Almost all New Hampshire legislative hearings were canceled, and
state offices closed at noon, and blowing snow led some towns to
close municipal offices in northwestern Massachusetts.
   Ski operators, however, were ecstatic over the storm, which
arrived in time for the presidents' day holiday weekend and
Valentine's Day on Sunday.
   ``It couldn't have come at a better time,'' said Chris Conti,
office manager with the Vermont Ski Areas Association in Montpelier.
   Schools were closed because of snow or icy roads Friday in parts
of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan,
New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Ohio.
   Cold air pushed southward in the storm's wake and Friday morning
temperatures were only in the teens in the South. Record lows
included 11 at El Dorado, Ark.; 2 at Paducah, Ky., 27 below zero at
St. Cloud, Minn., and 32 below zero at Duluth, Minn.
   Traffic deaths attributed to the weather included five in
Arkansas, four in Texas, three in Tennessee and Indiana, two each
in New York and Vermont, and one each in Michigan, Maryland and
Kentucky.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Attack White Farmer's House, Flee Into Zimbabwe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas attacked a white
farmer's house with rocket launchers and firearms early today, then
fled across the border into Zimbabwe, the government said.
   No one was injured in the pre-dawn attack and damage to the
farmhouse was minor, said the regional army commander, Gen. George
Meiring. He said a limpet mine and anti-personnel mines were found
in the area.
   South African officials said the attackers had entered from
Zimbabwe and sent a terse message to the government of the
neighboring, black-ruled state.
   ``The South African government urges the Zimbabwean government
immediately to seek out the attackers and also wishes to state that
it reserves the right to take whatever steps it deems necessary to
prevent further incursions of this nature,'' the message said.
   In the past, South African forces have staged raids into
neighboring countries on suspected bases of the African National
Congress black guerrilla movement.
   Zimbabwe, like several other countries bordering South Africa,
says it allows the ANC to operate politically but not militarily in
its territory.
   Over the past three years, ANC guerrillas occasionally have
placed land mines on the roads of white-owned farms in South
African border areas.
   About 20 whites and blacks have been killed in the attacks,
which the ANC says are justified because most white farmers
participate in an anti-guerrilla civil defense network.
   During the land mine campaign, there have been few assaults on
farmhouses.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to end
white-minority domination in South Africa.
   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services under a
legal and traditional system of racial segregation called
apartheid. The country's 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs.
   In a separate incident, police said two black municipal
policemen were shot and seriously wounded Friday night by unknown
assailants in Soweto, Johannesburg's main black township.
   Black officers have been frequent targets of ANC guerrillas and
anti-apartheid militants who consider them government collaborators.

<HEAD>Three Held in Abortive Assassination Attempt on Gemayel</HEAD>

   Authorities said three suspects were in
custody today in connection with an aborted attempt to assassinate
President Amin Gemayel by planting a bomb in a plane he was to take
to North Yemen and Sudan.
   A police spokesman said the three were being held ``in solitary
confinement pending completion of investigation.''
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
regulations, refused to give the suspects' names. He only said they
were all ``Lebanese airport employees.''
   A one-pound charge of TNT was planted under the pilot's seat of
the Middle East Airlines Boeing 707 that had been scheduled to
leave for Larnaca, Cyprus, Friday and later fly Gemayel to North
Yemen.
   The bomb was found and defused by explosives experts at Beirut
airport.
   Gemayel, 44, left on another Middle East Arlines Boeing 707
today.
   The president usually travels by military helicopter from the
Christian heartland northeast of Beirut to Larnaca, and flies from
there to world capitals.
   Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, has not used the Beirut airport in
the city's western Moslem sector since 1984, when Moslem and
leftist militias wrested control of the sector from the Lebanese
army.
   The airport is now currently controlled by Syrian troops, who
deployed in the western sector nearly a year ago in an effort to
end three years of militia anarchy.
   The police spokesman said the explosive charge was equipped with
``a sophisticated pressure fuse that would have detonated it when
the plane reaches an altitude of 30,000 feet.
   ``This means that the bomb was designed to explode during the
presidential flight from Larnaca to San`a when the plane usually
flies at 30,000 feet and more,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Planes, during the 20-minute trip from Beirut to Larnaca,
usually do not fly at an altitude of more than 10,000 feet,'' he
said.
   Lebanon has been plagued by assassinations, car bombings and
kidnappings since its Moslem-Christian civil war broke out in 1975.
The conflict has claimed more than 130,000 lives.
   Moslem Prime Minister Rashid Karami was killed June 1 by a bomb
planted in a Lebanese army helicopter that was flying him from
north Lebanon to Beirut.
   Moslem leaders blamed the assassination on the Lebanese Forces,
a right-wing Christian militia alliance, and accused Gemayel of
covering up for them.
   Gemayel's brother, Bashir, who led the Lebanese Forces, was
killed Sept. 14 1982 in a bomb explosion at a political gathering a
week before he was to take office as elected president of Lebanon.
   Amin Gemayel was later elected president.

   An airport restaurant employee who says he was
fired for not charging Mayor Eugene Sawyer for a $4.95 beef
sandwich may soon find himself working for the city of Chicago.
   Sawyer, upon hearing about the dismissal of Michael Bueschel,
indicated late Friday that the 23-year-old college student could
end up with a job working for him.
   ``I'll help him find one,'' said Sawyer, who ate the sandwich on
his way to a speaking engagement in Alabama on Thursday. ``If he
can't find one for him, I'll give him one myself.''
   Bueschel, a sophomore at Richard J. Daley College who has been
working his way through college, said he thought all along the
mayor would sympathize with his plight.
   ``He's a very fair person, and I'd be more than honored to work
with him if he deems it necessary,'' he said. ``I had a feeling the
mayor would really take care of me.''
   Bueschel said he was fired for ``misappropriation of company
funds'' from a $5-an-hour restaurant job with Midway Airport
Restaurant Inc. upon reporting to work at the Cafe Volare on Friday
afternoon.
   ``I was informed I had been terminated because I didn't receive
permission to give a sandwich to the mayor of the fine city of
Chicago,'' Bueschel said.
   ``Generally, I would give a public official like that a
complimentary meal to keep up public relations.''
   Restaurant manager Michael Oswald told The Associated Press
Friday he would have no comment.

   A 39-year-old American woman was sentenced
to 10 ears of hard labor for the attempted smuggling of seven
ounces of cocaine, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
   Anita Bennie Lee Temidayo, 39, of Washington, D.C., was arrested
at Lagos Airport with her Nigerian husband in December 1986 while
preparing to board a Pan American Airways flight to the United
States, the agency said.
   Mrs. Temidayo, who was sentenced Friday, confessed to the
attempted smuggling but said her husband, Olurunmi Temidayo, was
not involved. The Lagos Miscellaneous Offenses Tribunal acquitted
Temidayo.
   The tribunal said it could not grant Mrs. Temidayo's request to
serve the sentence in the United States, saying the decision must
be made by the Federal Military Authorities. She told the tribunal
she was suffering from hypertension and high blood pressure.

   An Iraqi jet bomber fired a cruise
missile within eight miles of the USS Chandler in the Persian Gulf
after the American destroyer warned the warplane away with flares,
the warship's captain said.
   The Chandler, which went to full alert, was escorting four
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, and neither it nor the merchant ships
were hit. No injuries were reported.
   The Chandler and the tankers were not the apparent targets.
   The incident occurred Friday night and was reported today by the
Pentagon's Persian Gulf media pool.
   Pool reporters said the incident occurred at about 9 p.m. and
that the Iraqi Badger bomber was on a trajectory toward the Iranian
oil terminal of Sirri island. The Iraqis reported hitting a ``very
large maritime target,'' or supertanker, at Sirri island at about
the same time.
   Reporters could not determine whether any targets were actually
struck at Sirri.
   Iraqi planes occasionally have mistakenly hit fishing trawlers
and other neutral vessels.
   Last May, an Iraqi jet fired a missile into the frigate USS
Stark, killing 37 American sailors. Iraq said the pilot mistook the
Stark for an Iranian warship, and Washington accepted its apology.
   Determining that the Soviet-made Badger was too close for
comfort, the Chandler fired two flares from its 5-inch guns, said
the pool report, filed through Washington by Norman Kempster of the
Los Angeles Times.
   Cmdr. Steve Smith, captain of the Chandler, said he was
concerned because Iraqi pilots often fire at radar blips without
making sure what their targets are.
   ``Having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time, I
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was
heading toward us,'' Smith said over the ship's public address
system after the incident.
   He told pool reporters that the Iraqi pilot fired two C-601
missiles, a 50-mile-range, air-launched version of the Styx, which
China copied in producing its better-known Silkworms.
   Smith said both missiles passed astern of the Chandler, the last
ship in the convoy, but one suddenly changed course and passed
along the starboard side of the ship before veering away. Seconds
later it detonated, producing a bright flash.
   Cruise missiles can have several guidance systems, ranging from
radio to infrared control.
   In a report monitored in Cyprus, the official Iraqi News Agency
said Iraqi warplanes struck their target at 9:08 p.m. Friday. It
gave no other details. Smith said Friday night's incident was the
closest approach of a missile to the Chandler, which has been in
the gulf since Nov. 25. U.S. warships have been escorting reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers through the gulf since July to protect them from
attacks by Iran, which accuses Kuwait of helping Iraq in the
7-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   Smith placed his crew on ``general quarters,'' the highest state
of alert, after the Badger, which had earlier passed the convoy on
a flight south along the gulf from Iraq, turned back north and
headed straight for the ship.
   Smith said he was prepared to try to shoot down the missile if
it appeared to be on a course that would strike any ship in the
convoy. He said he readied the Standard-1, anti-aircraft missile,
shoulder-fired Stinger missiles and the automatic-firing Phalanx
Gattling gun.
   Smith said he informed the Badger by radio that it was
approaching a U.S. convoy and ordered it to turn back. He said the
Iraqi pilot, who did not speak English very well, did not seem to
understand.
   Smith said he then warned the Iraqi jet that he planned to fire
two ``illumination rounds.'' As soon as the flares went off, Smith
said, the Iraqi jet turned sharply away from the ship and fired the
C-601s.
   Iraqi warplanes usually fire radar-guided missiles at Iranian
naval targets and Iraq later announces the hits. The planes are
equipped mainly with heat-seeking, water-skimming Exocet missiles
supplied by France.
   Shipping executives said today that a Danish supertanker struck
late Thursday in an attack initially blamed on Iran now appears to
have been hit by Iraqi warplanes.
   The executives had said Friday that the 339,000-ton Kate Maersk,
laden with Saudi oil, was hit by an Iranian helicopter. A Danish
seaman was killed and three others were injured.
   Salvage tugs that rushed to the aid of the Kate Maersk said
there was a gaping hole above the ship's waterline, indicating it
had been hit by an Exocet.
   Iraq has been attacking Iranian tankers and oil facilities to
cut off its oil revenues, which finance its war. The two have been
fighting since September 1980.
   Iran retaliates by attacking neutral merchant shipping, mainly
vessels involved in commerce with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which
Tehran accuses of supporting Iraq.

   President Reagan said today he and Mexico's
President Miguel de la Madrid would act ``to strengthen the
commercial ties between our peoples'' as they held their sixth
summit meeting in six years.
   In his weekly radio address, pre-recorded in Washington and
released here before the president's departure for today's meeting
in Mazatlan, Mexico, Reagan said commercial ties between the two
countries are ``of great benefit to people on both sides of the
border.''
   ``We've worked hard to make it that way,'' he said. ``Last
November we signed a new framework of understanding that
underscored our special trade and investment relationship.
   ``During our meetings in Mazatlan, President de la Madrid and I
will reaffirm our commitment to take advantage of every opportunity
to strengthen the commercial ties between our peoples.''
   The United States is Mexico's largest trading partner. Mexico is
the fourth largest trading partner of the United States, behind
Canada, Japan and West Germany.
   Although putting the emphasis on trade, Reagan also touched in
his radio address on two subjects - the war on drugs and guerrilla
warfare in Central America - over which the two countries have
sharp differences.
   ``The traffickers would go out of business if people quit buying
illegal drugs,'' the president said. ``That's the real solution,
and it's up to each and every one of us to be part of the
solution.''
   U.S. officials have said that Mexico does not do enough to
combat the drug trade, and Mexican officials in turn have argued
that the United State should act more aggressively to curb demand.
   Turning to Central America, the president said that ``the
establishment of totalitarian regimes, supported by Cuba and the
Soviet Union, is a threat to stability and freedom'' in the region.
``I would hope that the United States and Mexico will find common
interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat,'' he said.
Mexico has opposed the U.S. policy of aiding rebels fighting the
Marxist-led government of Nicaragua.
   Reagan also said that the United States ``will continue to do
our best to help find solutions to the vexing problems of Mexico's
international debt.''
   Mexico owes approximately $80 billion to commercial banks, and
the Treasury Department announced in December it would be selling
the Mexican government up to $10 billion in special U.S. bonds to
be used as collateral to help pay off the debt.
   Reagan said Friday he and de la Madrid would sign a new
four-year textile accord during their meeting at the Mexican port.
   The Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, in an
analysis released in advance of today's meeting, said it would be
difficult for the two countries to achieve an agreement similar to
the one negotiated last year between the United States and Canada.
   The reason, it said, is that the Mexican-U.S. border ``marks the
only such line in the Western world where a remarkably rich market
confronts a remarkably poor one.''
   Reagan, long an advocate of a North American Common Market, on
Jan. 2 signed a U.S.-Canadian agreement negotiated last year that
would eliminate all tariffs and most other trade barriers between
the two countries by 1999.
   Mexico and the United States have, however, worked out trade
agreements dealing with steel, textiles, shoes and beer.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Americans Now Have Firm Convictions About Terrorism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN WINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz said he
once feared terrorism would paralyze the United States but now
believes the nation has firm convictions about how to deal with the
problem.
   ``Above all, the American people understand more clearly the
risks, especially the risks of dealing with hostage situations,''
Shultz said in remarks Friday to the executive committee of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   The secretary, who will travel this month to the Soviet Union
and Middle East, spoke after receiving the Jewish group's Joseph
Prize for Human Rights.
   Shultz made no reference to the Iran-Contra affair, in which
critics said the administration went against its own policy by
pursuing an exchange of arms for hostages.
   He said the Reagan administration's policy toward terrorism is
firm and working.
   ``We will not make concessions to terrorists or compromise our
fundamental principles,'' Schultz said. ``Behavior rewarded is
behavior repeated. Terrorism must not pay.''
   Shultz said he feared several years ago that ``moral confusion
and our instinct for finding fault with ourselves would paralyze us
in the face of (terrorism). Since then, much has happened. But I
believe that we have all emerged from our experiences with a firm
set of convictions about terrorism.''
   The 30-minute speech was interrupted by applause seven times,
including when Shultz said Israel has provided a great example in
dealing with terrorism.
   ``Courage, skill and public support are the watchwords of the
Israeli effort against terrorism,'' Shultz said. ``When the story
is written of how the democracies beat the terrorists, let our
names appear together.''
   Shultz divided administration policy on combating terrorism into
four categories: intelligence-gathering, understanding terrorists'
aims and strategies, security measures to protect Americans and
offensive efforts to disrupt terrorist operations.
   He said intelligence efforts have averted more than 200
terrorist attacks in the past three years, and ``people are alive
and well today who never even suspected they were in danger.''

   Two Palestinians apparently preparing a
homemade bomb were injured today when it unexpectedly blew up,
military officials said, and two others were shot and killed by
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank.
   Scattered protests were reported throughout the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The daily Hadashot newspaper reported that a
secret group uniting Palestinian guerrillas, Moslem fundamentalists
and communists was leading the unrest.
   A military official said Israeli soldiers weren't involved in
the explosion that injured the two Palestinians in Gaza City.
   An Arab reporter in Gaza City said Mohammed Ahmed Ibrahim, 23,
suffered hand wounds and Mahmoud Nimer Mohammed El Halaby, 24, had
head and chest injuries. They were brought to the city's Ahle Arab
hospital.
   Gaza City was paralyzed by a commercial strike, the reporter
said. Black flags of mourning and Palestinian flags, which are
outlawed in Israel, flew from many electricity wires and poles, he
said.
   In one Arab mosques, a Moslem preacher called on worshipers to
``continue the uprising with knives, stones and clubs, and beware
of collaborators.''
   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service reported scattered protests
and stone-throwing incidents in different parts of Gaza City and
the Gaza Strip, as well as in the West Bank towns of Ramallah and
Hebron and Arab east Jerusalem.
   Four people in Gaza City suffered beating injuries and one Arab
was wounded by army gunfire, the agency said. The army command said
it had no information about any protests in the occupied lands. It
described the situation as ``quiet.''
   The army said it lifted a curfew imposed nine days ago on the
West Bank town of Tulkarem, 37 miles northeast of Jerusalem. About
10,000 Palestinians live there.
   More than 20,000 people remained curfewed in the nearby Tulkarem
refugee camp and the village of Anabta and in Gaza Strip's refugee
camp of Deir El Balah.
   The daily Hadashot newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said
Friday that Arab unrest is being coordinated by a secret group of
15 people comprised of representatives from different factions.
   The group unites communists, Moslem fundamentalists and members
of such Palestinian guerrilla organizations as Yasser Arafat's
Fatah, the report said.
   ``They meet in different smaller groups and pass information and
instructions through messengers, after a decision is accepted
unanimously,'' Hadashot wrote. ``They can't expose themselves...for
fear of an expected Israeli reaction: arrest and deportation.''
   Also Friday, the Defense Ministry decided to establish a special
body to gather intelligence in the occupied lands because of a
failure to predict the violent unrest that began Dec. 8, the Al
Hamishmar newspaper said.
   According to United Nations figures, at least 54 Arabs have been
killed in the protests.
   Two Arab teen-agers were killed when protests flared after noon
prayers Friday in the central Nasr Mosque in Nablus, the West
Bank's largest city with 120,000 Palestinian residents.
   Hospital officials identified those killed as Basil Taysir Al
Jatan, 14, shot in the head, and Bashar Al Masri, 17, shot in the
chest.
   Hundreds of Palestinians threw stones at troops, who responded
with tear gas and live ammunition, the army said.
   Arabs fired marbles and ball bearings from slingshots and hurled
rocks from rooftops at army patrols. Others blocked roads with
garbage bins and burning tires, witnesses said.
   Israel Radio said the Palestinians hurled firebombs and flower
pots at soldiers in the city's Arab bazaar.
   Troops broke into Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital, firing rubber
bullets and smashing windows with rifle butts, hospital officials
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said four Arabs
giving blood were beaten and detained.
   Hospital officials said nine Arabs were hit by gunfire in the
market clash and a 10th was unconscious after being beaten on the
head. The army put the number of wounded at three.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State George Shultz declined a request
by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to revise a U.S. peace plan that
calls for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Shultz declined.
   Shamir wants the idea of an international Middle East peace
conference abolished, the timetable for Arab self-rule postponed,
and no set dates for talks about final status of the occupied
territories, Israel television said.

   The leftist Beirut daily As-Safir today
published a St. Valentine's Day message addressed to American
hostage Thomas Sutherland from his family.
   ``To Tom Sutherland. A Christmas picture with Valentine love,
loyalty, strength, perseverance, and steadfast hope and faith,''
read the caption published along with a black-and-white picture.
   The picture was signed by Sutherland's wife, Jean, and other
members of the family in Fort Collins, Colo. Mrs. Sutherland, three
other women, a man and a child appeared in it.
   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on June
9, 1985.
   The Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, underground group has
claimed his abduction.
   The group, believed to be made up of radical Shiite Moslems
loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also claims to hold
American journalist Terry A. Anderson.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of the foreign hostages in Lebanon. He
was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In all, 22 foreigners, including eight Americans, are missing
and believed held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   In addition, a Swede and a Norwegian _ both U.N. relief workers
_ were kidnapped eight days ago by armed Palestinians apparently
acting without a political motive.

<TEXT>
   Houston Lighting & Power Co. officials
say they will pay, without protest, a $75,000 fine imposed by the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission for violations at the South
Texas Nuclear Project.
   HL&P, managers of the estimated $5 billion plant, said the
penalty would not affect customers' rates, company spokesman Glen
Walker said Friday.
   ``It's not unusual for them to levy a fine,'' Walker said. ``We
knew there was a possibility they would.''
   The utility has 30 days to pay the civil penalty or to protest
it, according to NRC spokesman Frank Ingram.
   The violations occurred last October and November while the
plant's Unit I was doing pre-startup testing but before it had
begun power operations, Ingram said Friday.
   The problems, which have been resolved, did not threaten public
safety and had no impact on the plant's schedule, Walker said.
Officials are planning to fire up the reactor in Unit 1 on Feb. 24
and then ask the NRC for a full-power operating license about two
weeks later.
   At one point, Ingram said, three valves were closed, disabling
an emergency core cooling system and violating a plant license
requirement that at least two of the valves be open when the plant
is in the ``hot shutdown mode.''
   In a letter to HL&P dated Thursday, Robert D. Martin, NRC
regional administrator in Arlington, said the violation involving
the closed valves was significant because the condition existed for
51 hours before it was discovered.
   NRC will follow up on the company's long-term corrective
measures during future inspections, Ingram said.

   Representatives of 150 black students
occupying a building at the University of Massachusetts refused to
meet with the chancellor today, saying they would sit in the
building until their demands are met.
   ``It has become obvious to us that you are not being
reasonable,'' said sophomore Mark Codling-Dave, a spokesman for the
students who took over the New Africa House on Friday.
   ``As far as we are concerned, we have nothing else to say,'' he
added.
   The students' demands included prosecution of white students who
allegedly beat two black students and a white woman last weekend,
suspension of white campus police accused of forcing blacks into a
lineup and removal of classrooms to return New Africa House to its
former use as a cultural center for the black community.
   Chancellor Joseph Duffey said after the students refused to meet
with him that he planned to go home and wait for the protesters to
call him. ``Obviously, we have to talk,'' he said.
   University spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins-Stover said earlier that
the protesters had agreed to meet with the chancellor today.
   Duffey said he regretted the lineup by the campus officers and
had ordered them not to do it again. He said, however, that
prosecution of the alleged assailants was a matter for the courts.
   He also said there was too little space on campus to move
classrooms out of the New Africa House. ``My first responsibility
here is education and this building is committed to education in a
range of ways. I'm not about to put black Afro-American professors
out of this building.''
   Duffey said he planned no reprisals against the protesters.
``They're not disrupting anything and I don't think they intend
to,'' he added.
   Dwayne Warren, a student serving as liaison between Duffey and
the protesters, estimated that up to 150 students spent the night
in the building.
   Blacks at the 25,000-student university say an undercurrent of
racism has not abated since Oct. 27, 1986, when blacks and whites
clashed following the Boston Red Sox loss to the New York Mets in
the final game of the World Series.
   Two black students and the white girlfriend of one of the men
filed complaints earlier this week against six white men, alleging
civil rights violations and assault and battery stemming from an
attack last weekend.
   The chancellor issued a statement condemning the alleged attack
after a delegation of black students presented their demands Friday.
   The demands included the expulsion of the accused whites, and
the suspension of white campus police officers who apparently
ordered a lineup of seven black men at a dorm early Feb. 6 after a
white student complained of being harassed by a black man.
   Duffey's statement said two of the students allegedly involved
in the beatings have been ordered to move out of the school's
residence halls. All five face disciplinary hearings within the
next two weeks.
   ``It should be clear once again that the university will not
tolerate physical abuse or racially associated attacks on others,''
his statement said. ``Saying `He started it' or `She started it' is
not an excuse.''
   A court hearing is scheduled Feb. 24 to determine whether there
is enough evidence to charge the men accused of the weekend
beatings.
   The chancellor issued a separate report to the head of campus
police asking him to cease lineups in the future.
   ``The activity was most inappropriate especially in this
particular instance because only minority students were required to
`line up' for possible identification,'' the report said.
   One of the three men in the lineup was arrested on an
outstanding warrant and two others were banned from campus for
trespassing, Ms. Hopkins-Stover said.
   About 7 percent of the students at the school are black.

   A bus carrying 26 West Point cadets crashed
into a jackknifed tractor-trailer rig on a highway covered with
snow and ice, leaving nine people injured, authorities said.
   The jackknifed truck was blocking the southbound lanes of
Interstate 81 near Avoca when the bus hit it Friday evening,
authorities said. A storm had dumped about 6 inches of snow and
slippery pavement contributed to both the truck's mishap and the
bus driver's inability to stop, said state Trooper Edward Chervinak.
   ``It's snowing _ blowing,'' said Trooper Tom Corbett. ``The
roads are frozen solid. It's real bad up here.''
   ``The tractor trailer was in front of us _ jackknifed,'' Army
Maj. Larry Shattuck said. ``We tried to slow down. We were going
about 40 (mph) or so and we just kept going.''
   ``Most of us were sleeping and all of a sudden we heard people
in the back telling us to look out,'' said Cadet Capt. Martin
Olson, 22, of Wisconsin. ``We slid sideways and ran into the truck.
It was just scary. We're just thankful everyone is O.K.''
   The cadets were traveling to an Officers' Christian Fellowship
Conference Center at White Sulphur Springs, near Bedford, said
Andrea Hamburger, a West Point spokeswoman.
   Most of the cadets were not injured, but a couple had broken
teeth and bloody noses, one cadet said. Six were treated at
Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center and released, hospital
officials said.
   Bus driver Charles Raab, 60, of New York, was taken to the
Community Medical Center in Scranton. He underwent emergency
surgery and was listed in critical condition, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   A relief bus driver and the truck driver also were hospitalized,
officials said.

   Communist rebels killed six people

authorities said today.
   Police said about a dozen rebels aboard a jeep opened fire
Friday on policemen directing traffic in downtown Cebu City. Three
officers and a street vendor were killed.
   The gunmen shook off pursuing policemen by exploding a hand
grenade, which wounded more than 30 pedestrians.
   Police said the gunmen were believed to be members of the
communist New People's Army, which recently announced plans to step
up attacks in Cebu City, 350 miles southeast of Manila.
   Police later arrested six people in a series of raids on
squatter settlements in Cebu City and suburban Mandaue. Officials
said two of those arrested admitted taking part in the attacks.
   In addition, Col. Cesar Aberilla, chief of the Philippine
Constabulary's metropolitan district command, said 25 other people
were rounded up late Friday from a movie theater near the scene of
the attacks, where witnesses said some of the gunmen fled.
   Cebu City Mayor Tommy Osmena called the attack ``shocking,'' and
the city's Roman Catholic archbishop, Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, also
denounced it.
   ``I appeal to those people of evil motives, please put a stop to
your savagery,'' Vidal said in a radio broadcast.
   Military field reports reaching Manila today said communist
rebels killed two soldiers and wounded at least seven others in two
clashes Friday in Davao Oriental and Surigao del Sur provinces on
the southern island of Mindanao.
   The reports said a rebel was killed and five others wounded in
the fighting in Surigao del Sur but gave no rebel casualty figures
from the encounter in the other province.
   Two suspected rebels shot and seriously wounded a soldier aboard
a bus in Mindanao's Bukidnon province and escaped with the
soldier's rifle by jumping off the moving vehicle. A military
report said no one else was injured in the incident, which also
occurred Friday.
   Elsewhere, the military said rebels raided a hospital in
Ballesteros, 250 miles north of Manila, and fled, taking a doctor
hostage and stealing about $1,000 worth of medical supplies.
   In another incident, government troops killed a rebel and
captured two others in a skirmish Friday in Pampanga province, 50
miles north of Manila, another military report said.

   A Hong Kong businessman today paid a record
$641,000 to drive away with a license plate bearing the single
digit 8, a number considered lucky by local residents.
   Law Ting-pong, chairman of Laws Fashion Knitters Ltd., said he
hoped for a bright future. He owns two cars, including a
Rolls-Royce, his company said.
   The pronunciation of ``eight'' in the Cantonese Chinese dialect,
which is spoken by most people in Hong Kong, is similar to the
pronunciation of the word meaning ``prosperity.''
   The bidding at the charity auction started at $10,256. The
auctioneer brought the hammer down after Law's winning bid a few
minutes later.
   The government has held 121 license plate auctions since May
1973. The previous record bid was for the number 3, which fetched
$128,000. ``Three'' in Catonese sounds much like the words for
``life'' and ``vitality.''

   The government Saturday announced an
``intensive campaign'' against the evils of spitting in public,
which plagues this crowded British colony of 5.7 million people.
   In a statement, the Urban Council noted that the number of
people convicted of spitting has dropped from 13,013 in 1985 to
11,171 last year.
   ``Despite this, it is considered necessary to further publicize
this anti-social habit so as to maintain environmental hygiene,''
the statement said. The campaign will include distributing leaflets
and stickers and beefing up law enforcement.
   A first conviction for spitting carries a maximum fine of $320,
and subsequent convictions carry fines of $640.

<HEAD>Senator Undergoes Surgery To Correct Aneurysm in Artery to Brain</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Tops with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Biden condition this
morning, picking up 6th pvs, bgng: Smith said</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. was alert and talking
with family members today after undergoing surgery at Walter Reed
Army Medical Center to correct an aneurysm in an artery supplying
blood to his brain.
   The 45-year-old Deleware Democrat was ``progressing
satisfactorily'' this morning and was ``as comfortable as
possible,'' hospital spokesman Pete Esker said.
   Biden underwent a surgical procedure known as a ``clipping'' to
correct the aneurysm, which is a sac formed by local enlargement of
the weakened wall of an artery.
   Esker said Biden's aneurysm was within his cranium, underneath
the brain but not inside the brain itself.
   Pete Smith, an aide to Biden, said Biden was listed in
``seriously ill'' condition but was expected to suffer no
significant aftereffects from the surgery.
   The surgery ``did not involve the removal of any brain tissue
and there is every indication that the senator will recover
satisfactorily,'' Smith said. ``He is awake, alert, oriented and
moving all extremities well. The length of his hospital stay will
depend on his continued progress.''
   ``Clipping'' is a microsurgical technique in which a minute
metal clip is slipped around the aneurysm, parallel to the artery.
The aneurysm is then deflated and the artery heals. The clip is
left in place.
   Smith said the surgery was performed in Friday afternoon but
there was no immediate information on when it began or how long it
took.
   ``I am told that he is in intensive care, which Walter Reed said
is normal for surgical patients, and his family is with him at the
hospital,'' Smith said. Biden and his wife, Jill, have three
children.
   Biden was admitted to the hospital early Friday after being
transferred from St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, Del., where
the senator lives.
   Biden, a three-term senator, had been complaining for a couple
of weeks about what had been diagnosed as a pinched nerve in his
neck.
   He wore a neck brace two weeks ago during hearings on the
proposed Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty with the Soviet
Union. He was ill and unable to vote last week on the confirmation
of Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. Biden, as chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Commitee, had led the committee hearings on
Kennedy's nomination to the top court.
   This week, Biden felt well enough to appear for several speaking
engagements at colleges on the East Coast.
   The senator last June announced he was a candidate for the
presidency, but withdrew from the race in September in the wake of
disclosures that he committed plagiarism during law school and
exaggerated his academic accomplishments during campaign stops.

   Supporters call him, in English, ``The MAN,''
a takeoff on his initials. Critics call him, in Spanish, ``Cara de
Pina'' or ``Pineapple Face,'' because of his pocked and jowly
visage.
   The United States calls him a fugitive from justice, a man who
put himself and his country up for sale to drug traffickers and
made millions of dollars in the process.
   But few would deny that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is a shrewd,
wily and tough politician who will not easily be dislodged as the
de facto ruler of Panama.
   He is sly enough, suggest several U.S. senators, to have conned
the United States government into supporting him for years despite
longstanding rumors of his involvement in drug smuggling, election
fraud and other corruption.
   Washington began to distance itself from Noriega only after the
headless body of one of his leading opponents, Hugo Spadafora,
turned up in a U.S. mailbag in Costa Rica in late 1985. Several
former associates say Noriega ordered the slaying after Spadafora
publicly accused him of drug trafficking.
   Indictments returned by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., on Feb. 5 accuse Noriega of using his position as the
commander of Panama's Defense Forces to allow Colombian drug
traffickers to use his country as a base for smuggling cocaine and
marijuana into the United States.
   Noriega, the indictments say, got a healthy kickback from the
narcotics profits. They put his take at up to $4.8 million.
   By any account, Noriega has done well for someone born into
poverty in a relatively poor country and raised by foster parents
from the age of 5.
   Details of Noriega's early life are scarce and even his birthday
is in dispute. His official biography lists his age as 50, but high
school records put it at 54.
   After attending a military college in Peru on a scholarship,
Noriega entered the Panamanian National Guard in 1962 as a
lieutenant. He quickly became acquainted with a rising young
officer named Omar Torrijos.
   Torrijos took power in Panama in a 1968 coup and less than a
year later named Noriega, then an obscure major in charge of the
country's northernmost province, as his chief of intelligence with
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
   In his new position, Noriega began collecting dossiers on
everyone who counted in Panama, friends and enemies alike. He also
had jurisdiction over the country's customs and immigration
departments, long a source of funds for the military.
   The job also put Noriega in touch with U.S. intelligence
agencies interested in any potential threats to the security of the
Panama Canal, a vital shipping link between the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans.
   When Torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981,
Noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top command
ahead of several more senior officers. It took him two years.
   In addition to drug smuggling, Noriega is reputed to have his
finger in a wide variety of other enterprises, some legal and
others operating on the fringes of the law. They are said to
include duty free liquor stores, maritime services, banks, gambling
casinos, newspapers, a television station and 12 radio stations.
   Although his official salary is $60,000 a year, Noriega lives in
a two-story, colonial-style mansion in one of Panama City's most
exclusive neighborhoods, maintains a fleet of expensive cars and is
reported to own at least a dozen other properties, including an
apartment in Paris and a chateau in the south of France.

<TEXT>
   A gerbil named Ken, campaigning on a
platform of free beer and soft toilet paper, beat five other
candidates to become president of the Student Union at the
University of East Anglia.
   Ken's owner, chemistry student Julian Campbell, 21, said he
entered his pet as a joke and was amazed that the mouselike rodent
won the job, which pays $94.50 a week. The university is in Norwich
in northeast England.
   Ken polled well over a third of the 1,500 votes, beating his
nearest competitor by 194 votes. He celebrated his victory Friday
night with sunflower seeds and a sip of vodka from a water bottle.
   ``I think he'll make a great president. And he definitely won't
be making any boring speeches,'' Campbell was quoted as telling The
Star.
   But outgoing Student Union president Rob Davies, 23, was not
amused.
   ``The students have not taken the vote seriously,'' Davies was
quoted as telling the Daily Mirror. ``I don't think many know how
much hard work goes into the job.''
   Ken was named after Education Secretary Kenneth Baker, whose
education reform bill is currently being considered by Parliament.
But it turns out the name is somewhat of a misnomer.
   Campbell found out during the campaign that Ken is actually a
female and is pregnant.

<HEAD>With AM-Satan's Kids, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA LEVITT RYCKMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Children who become entangled in self-styled Satanism often
share an obsession with heavy metal rock music, but its exact
influence on them is hotly debated.
   Police and parents' groups agree that more than 95 percent of
the teen-agers who listen to heavy metal simply enjoy it and never
act out. A few become more deeply involved.
   ``You might say heavy metal rock music is to self-styled
Satanism what gospel music is to Christianity,'' said Carl Rashcke,
director of the University of Denver Institute of Humanities.
``Very few people get converted to Christianity just by listening
to gospel music on the radio. But (heavy metal) is a very powerful
reinforcement. It legitimizes the nasty stuff the kids are already
into.''
   An attorney for one of three Missouri youths charged in the
beating death of a fourth said they were deeply involved with the
music. One favorite of the client, Ronald Charles Clements, was
``Black Friday'' by Megadeth, whose lyrics Clements had memorized.
   The lyrics, in part:
   ``My hammer's a cold piece of blood lethal steel
   I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal. ...
   Their bodies convulse in agony and pain
   I mangle their faces 'til no features remain.''
   ``I told him that this music just made me want to puke,''
attorney C.R. Rhoades said. ``I asked him to explain to me why he
enjoys it. And he said, `It's just the energy you feel. It gives me
a rush.'''
   That rush can be a physiological reality, said Denver police
Detective Cleo Wilson.
   ``It's used as a hype, and it can become addictive because of
the adrenalin flow it causes in your body,'' she said. ``It causes
the heart rate to go with the beat of the music, so you get a type
of high.''
   Some kids spend up to six hours a day listening to such music.
``You add the words of some of the songs to that ... it becomes a
way of life for them. Because they believe it.''
   At least two lawsuits, neither successful so far, have been
brought by parents who blame heavy metal's influence for their
childrens' suicides. While sometimes violent, the lyrics of the
musicians involved, the group Judas Priest and singer Ozzy
Osbourne, can seem tame compared with songs by so-called ``black''
metal groups such as Venom and Slayer.
   From Venom's song ``Possessed'':
   ``Look at me, Satan's child
   Born of evil, thus defiled,
   Brought to life through satanic birth. ...
   Listen to me and I'll tell you
   Things that will sicken your mind. ...
   I drink the vomit of the priests
   Make love with the dying whore. ...
   Satan, as my master incarnate
   Hail! Praise to my unholy host!''
   Groups that sing about violence and devil worship cite their
right to free expression. The Parents' Music Resource Center, based
in Arlington, Va., agrees that most Satanism in music is a gimmick
and the target of groundless hysteria.
   But heavy metal violence, including songs about necrophilia,
incest, rape, torture and human sacrifice, is something parents
should be aware of, the group says.
   When the concerned mother of a 14-year-old recently phoned the
PMRC, Executive Director Jennifer Norwood suggested she listen to
the music with her child and discuss it calmly.
   ``I tell parents not to take the materials away. We emphasize
the need to communicate with their children,'' she said. ``Children
need to be taught how to think critically about the messages they
get from the media. Then they'll reject these things themselves.''

<HEAD>Convicted `Mercy Killer' Calls Lawyer Inept, Wants New Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted ``mercy killer'' Roswell
Gilbert has asked for a new trial, saying his lawyer botched the
case by worrying too much about selling book and movie rights to
the story.
   Gilbert's current attorney, Bradley Stark, filed a 65-page
motion Friday which included a sworn statment from attorney Joseph
Varon acknowledging he may have erred in handling the case.
   ``It is quite possible that the economic factor of the book and
possible movie or television rights was prominent in my thinking
and perhaps swayed my judgment in some critical areas,'' Varon said
in the statement.
   Gilbert, now 78, was convicted of first-degree murder in May
1985, two months after he fired two shots into the head of his wife
of 51 years at their seaside condominium.
   The retired electronics engineer said he killed his wife, Emily,
to end the misery she suffered from osteoporosis and Alzheimer's
disease. The case made national headlines and was made into a
television movie that aired last year.
   Varon received $50,000 for the sale of Gilbert's television
movie rights. Gilbert got $5,000 of that amount, which he donated
to charity.
   In an attempt to capitalize on widespread publicity and sympathy
for Gilbert, Varon rushed to trial without hiring an investigator
or interviewing witnesses in the case, Stark said.
   In his statement, Varon said he put ``unrealistically great
hopes'' on what he termed Gilbert's ``caretaker defense.''
Basically, the defense was that Gilbert should be pardoned because
of the stress he experienced caring for a wife with Alzheimer's
disease.
   Stark argued that Varon gambled on the caretaker defense to the
exclusion of other strategies because that gave the story the best
chance of being bought by a movie producer.
   He also said that Varon made no effort to plea-bargain on his
client's behalf because that would have scuttled any movie or book
depiction.
   By relying on the sale of Gilbert's story for his fee, Varon was
put in a conflict in which he had to choose between doing what was
best for his client or creating what was most likely to be a
marketable story, Stark contended.
   Varon was vacationing outside the country and could not be
reached for comment by the Associated Press.

<HEAD>Obits, Want Ads Are Daily Staple Of Unusual Radio Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Obituaries, want ads, grocery ads
and all the other news that's fit to print, but usually not fit to
broadcast, are the daily staple of one unusual radio service.
   The Radio Reading Service of Western Massachusetts exists solely
to relay nearly every word in area newspapers to those who can't
read it, said its founder and president, Katharine Surette.
   The service fills a need that even well-meaning friends and
relatives can't, said Ms. Surette, who is blind.
   ``When my fiance reads to me on Sundays, he reads
discriminately, what he wants to read,'' she said. ``Unless I push
real hard, I don't get all the stories.''
   At the radio service, ``we don't editorialize. We try to read
everything,'' she said.
   The 200 volunteer staff members read entire articles of local
interest, supermarket ads, daily lottery payoffs and other
important tidbits that regular news broadcasts usually skip.
   ``Obituaries are very important to listeners,'' said Ms.
Surette. ``If a friend passes away, sometimes they have no other
way of knowing that. Then, they also like the lottery numbers. They
always call when we forget to read the payoffs.''
   Volunteer Edith Favorato, 73, said she has been going to the
studio from her East Longmeadow home every Monday for the past
three years to read magazine articles and books that are not
available in recorded form.
   ``I don't know any visually handicapped people, but I think I
can identify with them,'' she said. ``I feel I'm doing my little
bit to bring some happiness to people who might not otherwise have
it.''
   A speech by Stanley Potter, who began a reading service in
Minnesota in 1969, inspired Ms. Surette to start her own service,
she said. After years of pestering Springfield Technical Community
College for space and equipment, she opened the service on the
campus on Jan. 17, 1983.
   The service had 20 volunteers at the time, twice the number of
listeners.
   ``Anybody who could breathe and speak at the same time was on
the air,'' she said. ``We don't have to do that anymore. We have
enough volunteers that we can do good training.''
   The service has since set up an office off campus with a live
studio, two recording booths and eight employees. Another studio,
in Dalton, provides news from the state's westernmost counties.
   It is financed largely by state agencies, but does conduct
fund-raising campaigns and also receives some donations.
   The program can be heard only through special receivers tuned to
cable television or radio stations. Ms. Surette said there are 500
receivers in homes, nursing homes and hospitals throughout western
Massachusetts.
   Many of the receivers are donated by local charities, loaned to
listeners by the station or sold at cost, about $90. ``The only
thing we ask of listeners is that they be in some way print
handicapped, even if that means they can't hold a paper and turn
the pages,'' Ms. Surette said.
   Each morning in West Springfield begins with a two-hour reading
of the Union-News of Springfield for those in and around the
state's third-largest city. Volunteers in Dalton read The Berkshire
Eagle and other Berkshire County newspapers. The readings are
repeated every night.
   Newsmagazine and weekly newspaper readings are interspersed
through the week. Book readings begin at noon and again at 11 p.m.
``Usually the less colorful _ I shouldn't say less colorful, maybe
less offensive _ books are read during the day,'' said program
director Kathleen Turnbull.

   A 36-year-old woman who had been using
cocaine for two days gave birth to twin boys and left them to die
as she continued to use the drug, police said.
   ``She was just too coked out to care,'' police officer Carey Lee.
   Deborah Stewart, 36, op Oakland, was arrested Friday and charged
with two counts of murder.
   Ms. Stewart began using cocaine on Tuesday evening, Lee said,
and late Thursday morning she went into the bathroom and gave birth
to a premature baby boy.
   ``She left the kicking and squealing infant on the bathroom
floor and went to her bedroom to continue freebasing,'' Lee said.
   Thursday afternoon, Ms. Stewart began to hemorrhage, police
said, and she called paramedics.
   Both infants were found dead in the bathroom, the first on the
floor and the second, wrapped in a towel, in the toilet, Lee said.
Ms. Stewart told investigators she believes the second child was
stillborn.

<HEAD>FBI Suspected Central American Critics In Capitol Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the FBI infiltrated a group of opponents
of President Reagan's Central America policies, it suspected they
were behind the still-unsolved November 1983 bombing of the U.S.
Capitol.
   Secret FBI files made available under the Freedom of Information
Act show that for up to five years the bureau looked for links
between the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador
and a number of terrorist acts. It found none.
   CISPES contends the investigation was really based on its
opposition to administration policies in El Salvador and elsewhere
in Central America. The FBI denies it.
   FBI files also reveal the bureau was investigating whether
CIPSES was considering any violent activities at the 1984 Olympics
in Los Angeles or the 1984 political conventions, or whether it had
any connection with the May 1983 bombing at the Army National War
College in Washington.
   One document said some of those interviewed in the investigation
were told the FBI was checking into bombings of federal buildings
and facilities of defense contractors.
   The documents were among some 2,000 pages of FBI records on
investigation of the El Salvador group released under the Freedom
of Information Act. Large portions of the requested documents were
either blacked out by government censors or withheld entirely.
   References to the bombings were the only indications of what the
FBI was seeking in its investigations.
   The suit was filed on behalf of CISPES by the New York
City-based Center for Constitutional Rights.
   Beth Perry, CISPES spokeswoman, called the allegations that the
group had a connection to the U.S. Capitol bombing or the bombing
at the War College ``absolutely ridiculous.''
   She said some literature on the Capitol bombing was passed out
at a CISPES-sponsored demonstration on Nov. 12, five days after the
bombing, but that the group had nothing to do with distributing
that material.
   Asked about any plans for violence at the 1984 conventions or
Olympics, she said the FBI called the national office of CISPES to
ask what the group planned.
   CISPES referred the FBI agent to its lawyer, who told the agent
that local groups might be planning peaceful demonstrations but no
national effort was planned.
   One of the FBI documents said the Dallas field office received
copies of literature produced by CISPES at a demonstration on Nov.
12, 1983, five days after the bombing.
   ``Among this literature was the Armed Resistance Unit's
communique claiming responsibility for the 11@7@83 bombing of the
Capitol building,'' the document said.
   The bomb severely damaged a corridor and lounge outside the
Senate chamber. The same organization name was used by those who
placed the May 1983 bomb outside the Army War College at Fort
McNair.
   Another document said, ``although not CISPES literature, the
communique claiming responsibility for the 11@7@83 bombing of the
U.S. Capitol building was passed out along with the CISPES
literature.''
   A document on the Fort McNair bombing said an unidentified
individual contacted a local radio station in Washington, D.C., a
few days after the bombing and said, ``We are in Solidarity with
the People of El Salvador and Guatemala, and have taken action
because people are trained at the NWC (National War College).''
   In another document, FBI agents were told, ``Determine extent
and nature of CISPES involvement in organizing@supporting terrorist
activities within the United States with particular attention
placed on the forthcoming political conventions and 1984 Olympic
games.''
   FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney denied the investigation was
political, saying it ``had a narrow focus and was limited to those
leaders and key members of CISPES to ascertain if they were
involved in illegal support of the FMLN, a foreign terrorist
organization.''
   The FMLN is the Frente Farabundo Marti Para La Liberacion
Nacional, a resistance group fighting the U.S.-backed government of
El Salvador.
   Field offices were instructed not to interfere with First
Amendment rights of CISPES members, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan's 1989 Spending Plan Shuns Confrontation With Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan this week will make one last
try at rearranging the national agenda as he sends Congress a $1.1
trillion budget for fiscal year 1989. But it will be just a ghost
of budgets past.
   With neither side spoiling for an election-year budget brawl,
the new Reagan spending plan appears more designed to shun
confrontation with Congress than to stake out new ground.
   To be sure, the budget submitted next Thursday will sound
encores for familiar Reagan tunes: selling off Amtrak, abolishing
the Interstate Commerce Commission, ``privatizing'' regional power
authorities.
   But it is also laden with politically appealing offerings: a $1
billion-plus program for AIDS research, modernization of the
nation's air control system, a speed-up of the environmental
Superfund program and more funds for orbiting a manned space
station.
   The biggest White House concession this year has already been
made: the pre-Christmas agreement with Congress to let defense
spending authority rise by only 2 percent. Since that's less than
last year's 4.4 percent rate of inflation, such an increase is
tantamount to a defense spending cut _ the first ever during the
Reagan years.
   Reagan's earlier spending plans, which envisioned the massacre
of dozens of federal agencies and programs, may have been more
ambitious than the new one, but never were very successful. Not a
single agency Reagan targeted for extinction has ever been
abolished.
   This will be Reagan's final full-fledged budget. He will submit
one next January, but it will quickly be refashioned by the next
president _ just as Reagan redid the budget plan prepared in early
1981 by former President Jimmy Carter.
   That February, a month after his inauguration, Reagan sent
Congress a stark budget calling for deep domestic spending
reductions, a huge tax cut and the promise of a balanced budget by
1984.
   While going along with the tax cuts encompassed in Reagan's
first budget, Congress has never shown much enthusiasm for the
spending-cut side of the equation.
   Congress cut income taxes, left domestic spending pretty much
alone, and went along with Reagan's request for a defense buildup.
The annual budget deficit, at $78 billion when Reagan took office,
is now hovering at near $150 billion.
   Many aspects of this year's budget have been predetermined by an
agreement the White House struck with Congress late last year _ so
members of Congress can't scream as they have in the past about
Reagan's defense request.
   That agreement calls for defense spending authority for fiscal
1989, which begins next Oct. 1, of $299.5 billion. That's up 2
percent from the current level.
   The compromise also calls for $14 billion in new revenues,
including $3.5 billion from the sale of government assets. While
the administration is expected to put in another $8 billion or so
in asset sales, there won't be any surprises on taxes in the budget.
   And the pact also calls for shrinking the federal budget deficit
from $148 billion of fiscal 1987 to $136 billion, the target called
for in the revised Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The administration, assuming that the economy will expand this
year at 2.4 percent and at 3.5 percent in 1989, claims it will be
able to meet that $136 billion through assorted domestic spending
cuts _ but that it will be close.
   The Congressional Budget Office, using more pessimistic
assumptions of 1.8 percent growth in 1988 and 2.6 percent in 1989,
suggested recently that the deficit could grow to $176 billion even
under the agreement between the White House and Congress.
   The deficit shrinks when the economy speeds up because more
revenues come into the Treasury, and it rises when the economy
slows.
   It may be an academic issue. Under the budget law,
administration figures are used in deciding whether the
Gramm-Rudman requirements have been met _ a subtlety that may allow
the year to pass without a knockdown budget fight.
   Another reason why there may be less budget acrimony this year _
Congress will have less time to deal with the issue. Not only is
the spending plan being submitted a month later than usual, but
with party conventions comning up in the summer, followed by
elections, members of Congress will have other things on their
mind. The whole process will be compressed.
   ``We have an agreement (with Congress). I think the rhetoric
will be a lot less this year,'' says Budget Director James C.
Miller III.
   Still, the new Reagan budget will recycle _ if half-heartedly _
many past Reagan proposals, including those for selling off
government assets to the private sector.
   ``Do not be surprised that the president's budget will reflect
his priorities,'' Miller says.
   Expected to be re-proposed are plans to sell Amtrack rail
passenger service, Small Business Administration loans, naval
petroleum reserves, regional power marketing authorities and public
housing projects.
   The new Reagan budget, according to internal budget documents
obtained by The Associated Press, also will renew earlier proposals
to eliminate mass transit grants, abolish the Interstate Commerce
Commission and the Economic Development Administration.
   However, spared from Reagan's budget knife this time will be the
Legal Services Corporation _ which the adminstration has given up
on trying to terminate. Instead, deep cuts will be proposed.
   Few in Congress or in the administration, however, consider it
likely that Congress this year will accept proposed Reagan program
cuts that have been repeatedly rejected in years past.
   Still, in the absence of a budget accord, the Gramm-Rudman law
will take control of the situation _ mandating across-the-board
cuts.
   Actually, even though the Gramm-Rudman law calls for a deficit
in fiscal 1989 _ which begins next Oct. 1 _ of $136 billion, there
is actually a $10 billion margin of error built into the law.
   That means that if Congress can cut the deficit to $146 billion
or less, lawmakers can head home for the year without further worry
about dealing with the deficit this year.
   If a recession hits during 1988, then the picture changes
dramatically. The deficit will probably mushroom back over $200
billion _ where it was in 1985 and 1986 _ as tax revenues fall.
   However, the Gramm-Rudman law has a built in safety valve: in
the case of a recession, the deficit targets are waived.

<HEAD>Unions Regaining Clout But Still Losing Members</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's labor leaders can look
back on 1987 as the best year of a bleak decade. But a tide of
changing economic forces is still rolling against them.
   Despite having regained some of the political and bargaining
clout they lost in the early 1980s, unions are continuing to lose
members amidst the greatest peacetime spurt of job creation in the
nation's history.
   Where they are the weakest is among women, minorities and
immigrants who will fill 85 percent of the new jobs created between
now and the year 2000, according to projections by the government's
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   A new $13 million AFL-CIO media campaign following up on offers
of low-interest credit cards, pre-paid legal insurance and other
lures aimed at potential white-collar and pink-collar recruits is
still in its infancy.
   The payoff is yet to be seen. In absolute terms, union
membership among blacks and women increased by 9,000 and 40,000
respectively last year. But the percentage of non-union workers in
both groups also rose.
   And, despite the restoration of more than 300,000 assembly line
jobs in 1987, union membership among manufacturing workers _
organized labor's biggest base of support for four decades _
declined by 178,000, according to government figures.
   ``Essentially, unions in the past year have moved the ball out
from what had been a goal-line stance to the 7-yard line,'' says
Richard Belous, a labor market analyst for the Conference Board, a
business research house. ``The bottom line is that they are still
very much in the hole.''
   Nonetheless, union chiefs on the AFL-CIO's 36-member,
policy-making executive council convening at this beachside resort
for their annual winter meeting this weekend have reason to be
optimistic for the first time this decade.
   They have become a force again in both the economic and
political arenas.
   Unions last year succeeded in negotiating front-loaded contracts
with the biggest wage gains and benefits coming early, reversing a
pattern of concessionary bargaining and end-loaded contracts in the
early 1980s.
   With the exception of the meatpacking, airline and steel
industries, unionized workers last year received roughly the same
3.6 percent wage and benefit increases of non-union workers,
enabling them to maintain a 36 percent over-all wage advantage.
   Divisive two-tier contracts in which newly hired workers can
never hope to catch up with veteran employees were still being
signed in some industries like meatpacking.
   But those split pay levels were eliminated _ or the wage gaps at
least were greatly reduced _ among several other employer groups
such as aerospace plants, airlines and food stores.
   And, in exchange for productivity improvements from decreased
featherbedding, stronger job guarantees and new restrictions on
subcontracting work to foreign or domestic non-union suppliers were
bargained in the auto, mining and steel industries.
   Those developments, coupled with the reinvigoration of a
legislative agenda dormant for the past eight years, have AFL-CIO
President Lane Kirkland now speaking of the ``resurgent labor
movement,'' a term he was unwilling to adopt just a year ago.
   As the 28 owners of the National Football League proved,
employers are still more than willing seven years later to follow
President Reagan's example with air traffic controllers and hire
strikebreakers.
   While the AFL-CIO staked what some critics consider too many
chips on the football players union and suffered a major symbolic
loss with the failure of their strike, it won several less visible
but no less significant victories in other areas.
   Seventy percent of the air traffic controllers hired to replace
the 11,000 strikers fired by Reagan in 1981 voted to form a new
union. And the Adolph Coors Co. knuckled under to a decade-old
boycott of its beer and agreed to allow unhindered union elections
at its breweries and use union construction workers in building any
new facilities.
   Having played a key role in restoring the Senate to Democratic
control in 1986, unions last year also dusted off a congressional
agenda that had been shelved since 1980.
   Only three months into 1987, the AFL-CIO marshaled its allies in
Congress to help override President Reagan's veto of an $88 billion
highway bill providing jobs for 700,000 mostly union workers.
   Through the summer and into the fall, unions were instrumental
in mounting grass-roots opposition to President Reagan's nomination
of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. In October, Bork's
confirmation was defeated on a 42-58 vote.
   Import-curbing trade bills, the federation's top legislative
priority the past two years, were passed by both the House and the
Senate. A measure requiring 60 days advance notice of layoffs was
attached to the Senate version over intense opposition from the
adminsitration and business lobbyists.
   Kirkland expects this year will be even more active, with
passage expected on several other labor-endorsed measures _
including raising the minimum wage, restricting use of non-union
workers and mandating child-care leaves.
   ``Veto override fights may become frequent, and labor won't win
them all,'' Kirkland predicts. ``But the veto battle will be part
of the 1988 political campaign.''

<TEXT>
   Bertie and John Weaver don't go out to a fancy
restaurant or even share a romantic candlelight dinner to celebrate
their wedding anniversary.
   After 80 years of marriage, the couple prefers a simple
observance of the event that took place on July 27, 1907. They just
remember the good times and give thanks for the life they've had
together since their marriage at age 16.
   ``We've had so many (anniversaries) that we don't make much
to-do over them anymore,'' Weaver once said.
   The Weavers, who live in Glenloch, a rural community in Heard
County about 60 miles west of Atlanta, have had so many
anniversaries, in fact, that they've been honored as the Longest
Married Couple in the nation.
   The distinction was bestowed on them by the Worldwide Marriage
Encounter, an international non-profit organization dedicated to
the enrichment of all marriages.
   Charley Anton and his wife Ida-Marie, coordinators for the group
in Atlanta, found out about the Weavers more than a year ago when a
grandson nominated them for the honor. The Weavers held the
distinction for the state of Georgia last year, and moved to
national prominence this year.
   The award is given each year on ``World Marriage Day,'' which
Anton's group marks on the second Sunday of February; this year, it
happens to fall on Valentine's Day.
   ``They're really a warm, gentle couple,'' Anton said.
   ``They're just amazed at (the award),'' said Mary Steed, the
couple's daughter, who lives near them and visits on weekends and,
if needed, during the week. ``They do a lot of talking and
grumbling.''
   The Weavers, now both 96, have been ill recently and not up to
talking with reporters about their lengthy marriage, Anton said.
   But in a chat with Anton, Weaver attributed the longevity of the
relationship to ``the good Lord watching over us, working together,
respecting each other's feelings, being good to one another and
being understanding with one another....
   ``The simple life is the best life.''
   In a previous newspaper interview, Weaver said he and his wife
``get along as good as two people ever could. I help her with
anything she needs. Every now and then we'll bring up a quarrel,
but not often.''
   Despite their age and fragile health, Weaver gets up each
morning and makes breakfast for his wife.
   Married over the objections of Mrs. Weaver's family, the couple
had 13 children _ six still are living _ 50 grandchildren, 87
great-grandchildren and seven great-great-grandchildren.
   Mrs. Weaver's family objected to her choice of a husband because
he was the son of a sawmill worker. Although the wedding was
supposed to be secret, her family found out and lined the road when
Weaver came to pick up his bride for the ceremony.
   ``I took a back road and picked her up and headed for the
justice of the peace,'' said Weaver, who also was a sawmill worker.
   The Weavers' reaction to being named as the Longest Married
Couple in the United States is mixed, Anton said. On the one hand,
Anton said, they're enjoying the attention. But ``it has made them
very much aware of their age.''

   Three months of violent protests have
pushed this volatile nation to the point of political paralysis.
   At the heart of the conflict is a stalemate between President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad and his tenacious opposition. The upcoming
parliamentary elections only have compounded the standoff.
   Ershad, a former army general who seized power in a 1982 coup
and subsequently was elected president, refuses to accede to the
chorus of protesters demanding his resignation.
   The opposition, which rarely articulates its ideology beyond
saying ``Ershad must go'' and ``The people want democracy,''
persists in calling a general strike every few days in Dhaka and
other major cities.
   The main opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia, say
the nearly 100 percent compliance with their strike initiatives is
proof they have widespread support.
   But random conversations with a score of merchants indicated
that fear, not politics, is keeping the shops shuttered.
   ``Oh, yes, I close. Not because I support the strike, but out of
panic,'' said Abdul Qader, who sells housewares near the Buriganga
River. ``If I open, somebody will loot and burn. That is why I
close. I lose money, about 1,200 takas ($37.50) in sales a day.''
   Of that amount, only about $3.12 represents profit for the
35-year-old shopkeeper, who has a wife and two children.
   Bangladesh has not had a peaceful transition of power since it
broke away from Pakistan in 1971.
   Hasina, daughter of an assassinated president, and Mrs. Zia,
wife of another assassinated president, launched their anti-Ershad
campaign on Nov. 10.
   Since then, confrontations between police and protesters have
left 25 people dead according to the government's count, 100 by
Hasina's tally.
   In addition, more than 100 people were killed during election
day last Wednesday, most in clashes among supporters of rival
candidates in local elections.
   To try to counter the spiraling unrest, Ershad imposed emergency
rule Nov. 27, banning public political activities by everyone
except himself and permitting police to detain people indefinitely
without charge.
   On Dec. 6, he dissolved Parliament and ordered new elections.
But Hasina and Mrs. Zia refused to settle for anything short of
Ershad's resignation.
   Hasina, head of the Awami League, and Mrs. Zia, leader of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, are boycotting the March 3
parliamentary elections, contending Ershad will rig the vote to
favor his Jatiya Party.
   ``We have to stop this election,'' Hasina said in an interview.
``Under him, there cannot be a fair election.''
   Siraj, a 35-year-old truck driver, had another reason for not
voting.
   ``In 1986 I went to vote and was told I had already voted,''
said Siraj, who like many Bangladeshis uses one name.
   A small crowd gathered as Siraj spoke to a foreign reporter
through an interpreter, and one man heatedly told the trucker he
had not spoken the truth.
   Siraj then retracted his remark.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party, which took 212 seats in the 1986
parliamentary election, is fielding candidates in all 300
constituencies. Sixteen unopposed Jatiya candidates already have
been declared victors.
   A hastily formed alliance of 73 small parties, called the
Combined Opposition Party, is contesting 270 seats. The alliance is
visible mostly through campaign slogans painted on public walls.
   Mrs. Zia, whose husband President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated
in 1981, referred to it as ``a briefcase party.''
   The third-largest party in the election is headed by retired
Col. Farooq Rahman, acknowledged mastermind of the 1975
assassination of Hasina's father, President Mujibur Rahman.
   Farooq, who says his funds come mostly from his Consociates Inc.
construction business in Libya, founded the Freedom Party last
August and is running 110 candidates.
   Local and foreign analysts, representing a broad range of
ideologies, say Ershad permitted the creation of the Freedom Party
in an effort to restrain Hasina and the Awami League, which was her
father's party.
   Both Ershad and Farooq deny this.
   Despite the array of candidates, including 302 independent and
minor-party candidates, the election will not provide a test of the
country's major political forces, since Hasina's and Mrs. Zia's
parties are not running against Ershad's Jatiya Party.
   ``This election is not going to solve any crisis, so why are
these elections being held?'' asked Anwar Zahid, who resigned as
information minister last month to protest the decision to proceed
with the vote.
   He subsequently was expelled from the Jatiya Party.
   ``The election that is now scheduled is a sham election,'' Zahid
said in an interview.
   ``There is a political stalemate. The opposition cannot achieve.
The government cannot achieve. There is neither victor nor
vanquished, and the victim is the nation.''

<TEXT>
   Eight seamen and a teen-age boy who were
seized by Lebanon's main Christian militia seven weeks ago were
freed today, officials and militia sources said.
   A source from the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the seamen _ three Poles, three
Danes, a Sri Lankan and a Trinidadian _ were freed.
   Ole Neustrup, Danish charge d'affairs in Damascus, Syria,
confirmed it, saying, ``They have all been released.'' Neustrup
said the 15-year-old boy with the seamen is the adopted son of the
Sri Lankan.
   The former captives were taken to the Dallas Hotel in the
Christian port of Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut, after their
release, Neustrup told The Associated Press by telephone. He would
not release their names.
   He said they would sail from the port of Jounieh to Larnaca,
Cyprus.
   The Lebanese Forces command had imposed a news blackout on the
ship affair and publicly denied any ship had been seized or seamen
detained.
   But a Danish Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Copenhagen on
Friday that the three Danes were among the seamen held by the
Christian militia.
   The group was taken prisoner Dec. 27 after arriving at Beirut
from North Yemen with a cargo of foodstuffs, spokesman Herluf
Hansen said.
   The vessel has been identified as the Ingawebb.
   The crew were accused by the Christian militia of unloading arms
for Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party
militia, press reports said. Jumblatt's militia is the main foe of
the Christians in Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
   A Lebanese Forces spokesman said ``the ship remained in
custody.''
   ``The Lebanese forces command has been annoyed by the term
`hostages' that was used by the Scandinavian media. The eight
sailors were not kidnapped, to be described as hostages. They were
arrested and questioned over a specific charge. Now they are
released,'' the source said.
   Neustrup, who flew to Beirut on Friday to take charge of
negotiations to release the crew, was in Jounieh today to arrange
for their departure, the source said.

<TEXT>
   The historians who determined Kurt
Waldheim knew of and did nothing to stop Nazi atrocities ``were
practically all his enemies'' _ Socialists and Jews, an old friend
and close aide to the president charged.
   In their report, the historians condemned Waldheim for not
objecting to the atrocities they said he must have been aware of as
a German army intelligence officer in the Balkans during World War
II, but said it found no proof he committed war crimes.
   Today, the West German news magazine Der Spiegel, which
published a telegram purportedly linking Waldheim to the
deportation of civilians to concentration camps during the war,
said the document was a fake, and it apologized for printing it.
   ``Spiegel regrets that it presented this ... document to its
readers as `the proof' (of Waldheim's involvement) and not with the
necessary distance,'' the magazine said. It said a document expert,
Bernhard Haas, had concluded the telegram was ``in all likelihood a
fake.''
   The commission that studied Waldheim's wartime past did not have
access to the original telegram.
   ``The commission, they were not his friends, they were
practically all his enemies,'' Karl Gruber said Friday. ``The
German is a Socialist, the others are of Jewish descent,'' he said,
referring to West German historian Manfred Messerschmidt and the
five other members of the international panel.
   Commission Chairman Hans Rudolf Kurz, a Swiss historian,
rejected Gruber's allegations of bias, saying the panel's members
were hired for their scientific expertise and had not acted as
Waldheim's enemies.
   In an interview with Austrian Television, Kurz reacted angrily
to Gruber's comment about the government-appointed panel being
comprised of people of Jewish descent.
   He said he chose Israeli Professor Yehuda Wallach, a Jew,
``because I have known him for many years as an outstanding
scientist.'' Only later did he learn that British commission member
Gerald Fleming was also Jewish, he added.
   Gruber, a resistance fighter against the Nazis, was Austria's
first foreign minister after the war and brought Waldheim into the
diplomatic service. His comments to Italian television were
broadcast on Austrian radio.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a Socialist, sent telegrams to each
commission member apologizing for Gruber's remarks, which he said
``have nothing in the slightest to do with the government's view of
your work.''
   Austria's Jewish community, in a telex to news organizations,
said Gruber's statement expressed ``the deepest hatred of Jews.''
   Vranitzky's government appointed the commission at Waldheim's
request in September, after the U.S. Justice Department put the
president on a ``watch list'' of undesirable aliens that bars him
from the United States.
   Accusations that he committed war crimes arose during the former
U.N. secretary-general's election campaign in 1986.
   Waldheim's office said he will make a five-minute address on
national television Monday, but a spokesman said he could not
disclose its contents.
   The president has consistently refused to resign and said this
week he will stay in office despite the historians' report, which
left open the questions of guilt and moral responsibility. The
202-page document was presented to the government Monday.
   About 500 intellectuals gathered outside Waldheim's offices in
the imperial Hofburg palace at dusk Friday and handed in a petition
demanding his resignation. Organizers said they collected 1,200
signatures.
   Another anti-Waldheim demonstration by prominent intellectuals
is planned for Sunday.
   When asked about Gruber's comment that he was a Socialist,
Messerschmidt described himself as a lifelong liberal who never has
belonged to a political party. Critics of the commission ``should
do their research better,'' he said.

   The advertisement in the
supermarket read: ``Giveaway: lonely 23-year-old male. Shy and
reserved, but likes parties and discos. A dream to look at. Must be
seen. Frustrated mother welcomes all replies.''
   Ron Barber, the bashful bachelor, appeared on the Tyne-Tees
television program Nightline on Friday night and said the response
to the advertisement by his mother, Wendy, had been enormous.
   The first reply was from a woman named Irene, whom Barber had
arranged to meet Friday night. But he canceled the date at the last
minute to appear on the TV program.
   ``I'm no rat,'' said Barber, who works in a factory. ``I got Mum
to ring her and send some flowers for Valentine's Day with my
apologies _ and a promise that I will keep my blind date with her
next week.''
   He said he had been inundated with phone calls and letters from
all parts of the country after publicity about the ad, which was
put up in a supermarket near his Norfolk home in northeast England.
   One 53-year-old woman asked Barber to marry her.
   Barber said he intended to answer every response.

   A Seattle University student rescued a young
woman who was about to be raped in an alley behind his apartment,
then captured her assailant after a three block chase.
   ``I was down those stairs in two seconds. I just reacted. I
didn't even have time to think what I was doing,'' said Christopher
Fox, 19.
   Police said Fox ran out of his building waving an ax handle and
helped save a badly beaten 18-year-old British tourist from further
injury and from being raped early Friday morning.
   Fox then chased the assailant through the University District.
   Seattle police Sgt. Lee Libby said it appears Fox qualifies for
a commendation from the department.
   The woman suffered a gashed forehead where she was struck by a
brick, a swollen eye and scrapes on her face and knees. She was
treated and released at a local hospital.
   Fox said he was in his apartment when he saw a man smashing the
woman's head against the pavement. Fox said he grabbed the ax
handle, shouted at his roomates to call the police and ran out.
   The man ran about three blocks, then stopped and pleaded not to
be hit. Fox said he never hit him.
   Police refused to identify the victim at her own request. They
said the suspect, also unidentified, was booked for investigation
of attempted rape and assault.

   The $2.7 billion nuclear aircraft
carrier Abraham Lincoln was christened and launched Saturday before
a shivering crowd of 3,500.
   ``As it sails through the seas and oceans of the world, this
aircraft carrier will send a clear and unambiguous message to
friends and enemies alike that we have every intention of remaining
true to our commitment to freedom,'' said Secretary of Defense
Frank C. Carlucci.
   The 1,092-foot ship is the Navy's fifth Nimitz class
nuclear-powered carrier. All have been built at the Newport News
Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., where a sixth Nimitz carrier, the
George Washington, is scheduled for completion in 1991.
   The Lincoln, when it is commissioned in late 1989, will have a
crew of 6,000 and carry more than 90 aircraft. It is powered by two
nuclear reactors.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, speaking to the crowd gathered
at pierside in 30-degree temperatures with winds gusting from
between 20 to 30 miles per hour, said ``It is a proud but cold
honor for the 11{ million people of Illinois.''
   Abraham Lincoln, who led the nation during the Civil War, was
raised in Illinois and lived in Springfield before he became
president.
   The ship was christened by JoAnn Webb, wife of Navy Secretary
James H. Webb.

   Kenny Rogers says he is negotiating with
Lloyd's International Inc. to buy the $69 million Stouffer
Nashville Hotel.
   ``I would like to get into the hotel management business,''
Rogers said Friday in an address before some 1,000 radio station
managers attending a seminar. ``I'd like to own more than one.''
   The hotel, which opened last August, adjoins the new Nashville
Convention Center.
   Lloyd's has said the 673-room hotel is for sale. In January
1987, the international financial giant took over the interest
formerly held by a limited partnership. Prior to that, it was the
lead financing institution on bonds issued to finance the hotel.
   Rogers is known for hits such as ``The Gambler'' and ``Islands
in the Stream,'' a duet with Dolly Parton.

   Mike Roark, former mayor of Charleston,
W.Va., who has begun his 179-day prison sentence for cocaine
possession, says it was ``stupid'' and ``weak'' of him to use the
drug that cost him his office.
   ``Why I did it? You picked a question that will probably be the
first thing I ask myself every day for the rest of my life,'' Roark
said in an interview published in Friday editions of the Charleston
Daily Mail.
   Roark, 42, once known as ``Mad Dog'' for his zealous pursuit of
drug offenders when he was a prosecutor, reported to federal prison
here Friday.
   The former second-term Republican mayor was scheduled to report
to the Petersburg Federal Correction Institution on Monday, but he
showed up early because Monday is a federal holiday.
   The former assistant U.S. attorney and Kanawha County prosecutor
resigned as mayor one week after pleading guilty. Roark, who had
been mentioned as a possible GOP gubernatorial or congressional
candidate, told the newspaper he considers his political career
finished.
   Roark pleaded guilty last November to six misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession as part of a plea bargain. In addition to
prison, he was fined $5,000.

   A decision by Idaho's highest court to give
singer Carole King the right to lock a gate on a back-country road
leading to her ranch could prompt legislative action, says the
state's attorney general.
   ``I've heard a figure that there may be up to 65 of these
controversies simmering around the state,'' Attorney General Jim
Jones said Friday, adding that state legislators may want to
provide a legislative remedy.
   The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a district court
ruling that the dirt road leading to the ranch was abandoned by
Custer County in 1939 and therefore ceased to be public.
   King and her husband, Rick Sorensen, put a locked gate across
the road in July 1981, after moving to their back-country ranch.
The Sorensons' action was protested by neighbors who said they had
used the road for years.
   After Custer County declared the road open to public use, the
Sorensens took the matter to court.

   Oral Roberts University is exchanging a
Beverly Hills, Calif., house used by evangelist Oral Roberts for
two south Tulsa office buildings.
   Richard Roberts, the evangelist's son, described the house as a
workplace and said it was valued at $3.25 million. The university
bought it for $2.4 million in 1982, he said.
   The university, Roberts said, will use a $6 million loan from
the Bank of Oklahoma and $1.5 million from the sale of the house to
buy two office buildings owned by the bank. The other $1.75 million
from the sale of the house may be invested in other property, he
said.
   The decision to sell the Beverly Hills house was not related to
the ministry's financial woes or to criticism of the Roberts family
lifestyle, Richard Roberts said. The house, which has four
bedrooms, five bathrooms and a swimming pool, was part of the ORU
endowment.
   In remarks published in a ministry magazine, Oral Roberts said
he has lived in the Beverly Hills house while he wrote books,
recorded the New Testament on audio tape and held ``conferences
with important spiritual leaders who are vital to this ministry.''

   Golfer Jack Nicklaus is planning to
build a resort that will include not only a golf course and luxury
homes, but also a renovated 1890s-era winery.
   Nicklaus said Friday his Tampa, Fla.-based development company
is working with a California developer on plans to build the resort
on 600 acres bought from the Wente Brothers winery and on 700 acres
the partners have agreed to buy from the Catholic Archdiocese of
Oakland.
   Backers, including Carolyn Wente, vice president of the family
owned winery, said they plan to replant 200 acres of Ruby Hills
Vineyards property.
   ``It'll help promote the region and enhance the local wine
industry by bringing in more tourists,'' she said.
   Conservation groups, however, have steadfastly fought
development of the valley's agricultural lands. Last month,
Livermore residents approved a referendum that narrowly overturned
a city council decision in favor of new homes on 154 acres reserved
as farmland.

   Circuit Judge Sam Monk was posing on the front steps of the

only a few feet away. He hid his keys in the robe after the
photographer said they were making his pocket bulge.
   Asked what he thought about the thief's brashness, the judge
said, ``The king's English fails me in that question.''
   ``It's obvious they knew what they were doing and who they were
doing it to,'' said Presiding Circuit Judge Malcolm Street Jr.
``The church choir was not standing on the front steps.''
   ``This is just another glaring example of the lack of proper
security in the county courthouse,'' said Monk. Locks have been
changed at the courthouse, and Monk has had to change locks in and
around his home.
   The robe was found in a downtown garbage bin, but the keys are

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday, which was pre-recorded on Thursday:
   My fellow Americans, today, I am meeting with Mexican President
(Miguel) de la Madrid in Mazatlan, Mexico, so I've pre-recorded
this radio talk. Over these last seven years, maintaining a
constructive and friendly relationship with our neighbors to the
south has been one of the highest priorities of our administration.
   As we review what has transpired, there is every reason to be
pleased. The leaders of our two nations are aware that good
relations and cooperation between us are invaluable to both our
peoples. And that's why the meetings between our top leadership
have been frequent and our talks at those meeting comprehensive.
   My meeting today with President de la Madrid will cover a number
of issues _ from economic concerns, to our mutual commitment to
fight drug traffickers, to the security challenges facing the
hemisphere.
   Mexico is our fourth largest trading partner and we,
correspondingly, are Mexico's largest trading partner. Our
commercial ties are strong and of great benefit to people on both
sides of the border. We've worked hard to make it that way. Last
November we signed a new frameword understanding that underscored
our special trade and investment relationship.
   During our meetings in Mazatlan, President de la Madrid and I
will reaffirm our commitment to take advantage of every opportunity
to strengthen the commercial ties between our peoples. One thing
that cannot be overemphasized is that a healthy and expanding
Mexican economy is in the interest of the United States. We want
Mexico to grow and prosper. And that's why we've done our best, and
will continue to do our best, to help find solutions to the vexing
problems of Mexico's international debt.
   Innovative, market-based methods of managing this burden are
being explored, such as Mexico's offer to exchange debt for
long-term bonds. At the same time, we've been working with our
Mexican counterparts on such things as a new textile accord, a
telecommunications agreement, and a new civil aviation agreement,
which is in the final stages of negotiations.
   I hope that one day all of this will be seen as the initial
steps leading toward an historic freeing of commerce and trade
throughout the continent. We're just now beginning to tap the
unmeasurable potential between Mexico and the United States.
   This can certainly be seen in the Immigration Reform and Control
Act, passed by Congress in 1986. This law offers protections for
more than a million undocumented immigrants living in the United
States, many of whom are from Mexico. It provides a means for them
to find legal employment in our country and to participate openly
and freely in our society.
   Population movement and employment are subjects being examined
closely by joint US and Mexican commissions. A study of the issues
and frank dialogue between us is essential, and I am gratified by
the responsible long-term approach the Mexican government is taking
in this sensitive area. We have found that there are honest and
concerned officials on both sides of the border who are dedicated
to the same ideals.
   Nowhere is that more clear than in the battle against drug
traffickers. American and Mexican policemen and law enforcement
officials have lost their lives in this fight. We've been allies
with brave individuals, men and women of integrity, who are putting
their lives on the line against this evil, and the corruption and
bloodshed that follows in its trail.
   I might add that each and every one of us can make a
contribution to winning this war against drugs _ first, by refusing
to use illegal drugs ourselves, and second, by helping others to
get off drugs, and the traffickers would go out of business if
people quit buying illegal drugs. That's the real solution, and
it's up to each and every one of us to be a part of the solution.
   Finally, my talks with President de la Madrid will also cover
the security threat to this hemisphere. Since 1980, we've witnessed
an impressive expansion of democracy throughout the Americas.
However, this progress cannot be taken for granted. The
establishment of totalitarian regimes, supported by Cuba and the
Soviet Union, is a threat to stability and freedom. Nowhere is that
threat more acute than in Central America.
   I would hope that the United States and Mexico will find common
interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat. The peoples and
governments of the United States and Mexico are and ought to be
friends. Our national interests dictate it, our peoples demand it.
It is in this spirit that I meet today with President de la Madrid.
I will pass on to the people of Mexico your very best wishes.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magazine said today that a
document purportedly linking Austrian President Kurt Waldheim to
the deportation of civilians to concentration camps during World
War II was a fake, and it apologized for publishing it.
   ``Spiegel regrets that it presented this ... document to its
readers as `the proof' (of Waldheim's involvement) and not with the
necessary distance,'' the Der Spiegal news magazine said in its
latest edition.
   Der Spiegel said Bernhard Haas, a document expert from
Stuttgart, concluded that the military telegram was ``in all
likelihood'' a fake.
   The telegram, published Feb. 8, allegedly linked Waldheim, a
former U.N. secretary-general, to the deportation of more than
4,000 civilians while he served as an officer in the German army in
Yugoslavia in 1942.
   The West German magazine published the text of the telegram two
weeks ago, which it said ``for the first time will prove Austrian
President Kurt Waldheim's complicity in war crimes during World War
II.''
   The document published said: ``Very urgent. Lieutenant Kurt
Waldheim from the staff of General Stahl demands that 4,224
prisoners from Kozara, most of them women and children and
approximately 15 percent older men, be sent on their way: 3,514 to
Grubisino Polje and 730 to Zemun.''
   Both places were prison camps near Belgrade during World War II.
   The Hamburg-based magazine said the document was discovered by
Yugoslav military historian Dusan Plenca. Spiegel has not said how
it obtained the document.
   Waldheim has consistently denied allegations he participated in
war crimes while serving with the German army in the Balkans during
the war.
   After Der Spiegel published the document, a Waldheim spokesman
dismissed it as a ``probable fake.''
   A panel of historians assigned to study Waldheim's past
presented its report to the Austrian government last Monday and
condemned the president for not objecting to atrocities it
concluded he must have known about.
   But the commission also said it found no proof Waldheim actually
participated in war crimes. It did not have access to the original
telegram published in Der Spiegel.
   Plenca never produced the original document. The commission
appealed unsuccessfully to the Yugoslav government to help it find
the original.
   Yugoslavia placed Waldheim on a list of suspected war criminals
and asked for his extradition from Austria in 1947, but it never
pursued the extradition request and never publicly explained why.
   Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said this week that the telegram
was a ``forgery.''
   Tanjug said a Yugoslav commission, ``formed of historians,
archivists and other experts, came to the conclusion that the
telegram is not an authentic document and that there exists a
founded suspicion that it is a forgery.''

<TEXT>
   Panama began four days of Carnival this
weekend with the country's future as unpredictable as the route of
shambling revelers wending from one sidewalk beer stall to another.
   The festival was expected to be subdued this year, clouded by
months of political unrest and the recent indictments in the United
States of the country's de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega. He was charged in Miami and Tampa, Fla., with drug
trafficking and money laundering.
   The indictments deepened the polarization of a nation already
sharply split along economic lines. They caused Noriega to try to
reinforce his power by criticizing the United States and left his
opponents confused.
   ``If there ever was a chance that Noriega would relinquish power
gracefully, the indictments in Florida appear to have quashed it,''
said one European diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Leaders of Panama's growing opposition movement acknowledge that
their goal of removing the general was made more difficult by the
indictments and subsequent congressional testimony last week by
several former Noriega associates.
   The grand juries in Miami and Tampa and the testimony of
Noriega's former friends lent weight to what the opposition has
been charging all along _ that the general is up to his jowls in
corruption.
   ``But what can we do now?'' asked Aurelio Barria, president of
the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a leading
opposition figure who returned home two weeks ago after several
months of self-imposed exile.
   The opposition has ruled out further demonstrations like the
ones that shook the country last summer when Noriega sent the army
into the streets with guns, clubs and tear gas.
   At least three people were killed and hundreds injured in the
disturbances organized by the National Civic Crusade, a coalition
of civic, professional, labor and other groups.
   Subsequent calls for popular demonstrations met with dwindling
enthusiasm.
   ``We just can't ask people to go out in the streets and face
that kind of repression,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, the
president of the Christian Democratic Party and another leading
opposition figure.
   Barria, Arias Calderon and other opposition leaders spoke
hopefully of arranging the general's ouster through talks with his
supporters in the Democratic Revolutionary Party, which is closely
linked to Panama's military.
   But they acknowledged that they may not be able to arrange such
talks and they appeared to have no other firm course of action to
oust the general from his post as head of Panama's Defense Forces.
   Barria spoke of the possibilities of a coup by junior officers,
a presidential order removing Noriega, a nationwide general strike,
greater involvement in the ouster effort by the Roman Catholic
Church and united diplomatic and financial pressure by other Latin
American nations.
   Opposition leaders began talking about a general strike a week
ago, but Barrios said they were still discussing the action ``with
various (economic) factions'' and no date has been set for the
shutdown attempt. Previous strikes have been only partly effective.
   And few officers in the military seem to command enough respect
to launch a successful coup.
   Barria said he and other opposition leaders have personally
taken their case to the presidents of Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil,
Guatemala and Uruguay, but none of those leaders has yet spoken out
against Noriega.
   Nor has the Roman Catholic Church, widely respected in this
predominantly Catholic country, given the opposition movement the
support that Barria and others would like to see.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle, widely seen as a puppet dancing
on Noriega's strings, has the constitutional authority to dismiss
the general. But few believe he will do it.
   Still, Delvalle was the object of much speculation. Grafitti
appeared on walls in Panama City saying ``Watch Out For Delvalle.''
   He was absent Thursday night when an estimated 8,000 people
crowded into a Panama City convention center to pay homage to Gen.
Noriega on his birthday _ either his 50th or 54th, depending on
differing records.
   Noriega's triumphant appearance at the gathering capped a week
of speeches around the country in which he blamed his troubles on a
plot by the Reagan administration to renege on a 1977 treaty that
will turn over control of the Panama Canal to Panama at the turn of
the century.
   That accusation is vigorously denied in Washington, but Noriega
has been using it for months to whip up anti-U.S. sentiment.
   Noriega also demanded the removal of the U.S. Southern Command
from Panama, which the Pentagon and the White House initially
interpreted as a call for the transfer of some 10,000 servicemen
and their 20,000 dependents from Panamanian soil.
   Washington immediately rejected that, saying the the American
troops were legally in the country and would remain here to protect
the canal until it is handed over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega later said he was referring only to the headquarters
unit responsible for U.S. strategic military planning. American
military sources said that would involve the removal of only about
300 officers and men.
   During his birthday speech, Noriega's biggest ovation came when
he declared: ``If they want me out, they'll have to kill me.''

   Adolfo Calero, a leader of U.S.-backed
guerrillas in Nicaragua, denied on Saturday that his troops trained
in Panama or received funds from the Panamanian government.
   ``We never had anyone training in Panama,'' Calero said. ``I
don't know anything about it. We have absolutely nothing to do with
Panama, nor with the Panamanian government.''
   ``We have never received any money from Panamanian sources,'' he
said.
   Calero's comments, in an interview after appealing to a
convention of U.S. conservatives to send donations to his cause,
was his first reaction to congressional testimony on Wednesday by a
former top Panamanian intelligence officer, Jose I. Blandon.
   Blandon told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that Panama
provided military training for the rebels after a 1985 request from
then-White House aide Oliver North. At the time, direct U.S.
assistance to the rebels was banned by law.
   In addition, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian
military leader whose ouster the Reagan administration is urging,
said last week that he and another former White House aide, John
Poindexter, discussed the possibility of a U.S. invasion of
Nicaragua. U.S. government spokesmen have denied such talks took
place.
   Asked if he thought Noriega, who was indicted last week by a
grand jury on drug charges, fabricated the story about invasion
plans to divert attention from his current fight with the United
States, Calero replied: ``Yes, he's the one in hot water.''
   The testimony by Blandon and the comments by Noriega have raised
several questions, including: Was the United States using Panama to
help the Nicaraguan rebels at a time direct U.S. assistance was
outlawed?''
   Also at issue is the relationship between the United States and
Noriega, who has now been accused of criminality by a grand jury.
According to Blandon's testimony, the CIA gave Noriega classified
reports on anti-Reagan administration senators.
   The CIA denied the allegation, but Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-NY,
said ``the fact of the matter is that it has been well know that
Noriega _ the thug and racketeer _ has been on the payroll of the
CIA for many years and remained there, I am given to understand,
until rather recently.''
   In his speech to the annual Conservative Political Action
Conference, Calero lamented anew congressional rejection of an
administration request for $36.2 million in aid for the Nicaraguan
resistance.
   He solicited private donations, but said ``private support
cannot substitute for U.S. government aid.''
   ``However, we do need private support of a humanitarian, or
non-lethal nature,'' Calero said.
   The Reagan administration, whose solicitation of private funds
for the Contras in previous years created a huge furor, has
publicized a White House memo ordering officials to take no part in
private fund raising.
   Calero said the vote against Contra aid will force the
resistance forces to reduce their activities in the coming year,
but he added, ``We will continue the struggle no matter what.''
   Opponents of the U.S. government assistance said it would harm a
peace plan signed by Nicaragua and other governments in the region.

   A department store is offering Japanese Cupids the
ultimate arrow this Valentine's Day _ a $7,700, 10{-ounce heart of
pure gold engraved with the sender's message.
   Two of the palm-sized hearts have been sold so far, one to a
devoted husband seeking a special gift for his wife's 77th birthday
and the second to a bank, said Hanshin Department Store spokesman
Toru Imamura.
   More cost-conscious schoolgirls and secretaries choose from a
wide array of fancy chocolates and novelty gifts.
   Besides the old standbys _ chocolate hearts with long ribbons
and miniature chocolate whiskey bottles _ this year's items have a
decidedly domestic flavor. ``Sir Dean'' chocolate fish come paired
in a sardine tin with rollback top.
   Flip up the lid to another can of chocolates and you find
chocolate bandages in familiar red, white and blue wrappers with
the warning, ``This chocolate is not medicated sweets.''
   ``Baby Choco'' is softly nestled in a mini-package of disposable
diapers with a smiling tot on the front.
   For the objects of this sweet attention and invention, all is
not a bed of roses. Obligatory chocolates given to male bosses and
colleagues outnumber those of romantic intent, spurring receiving
males to compete in an annual popularity contest.
   The possible embarrassment of being giftless at the end of the
day is enough to keep some men home from work, according to a
Daimaru Department Store survey of 400 men aged 20 to 30.
   Less drastic ways of avoiding embarrassment are broad hints,
extra nice behavior or even buying one's own chocolates for
prominent display. A few men console themselves by saying that
Valentine's Day is a foreign holiday with a short postwar history.
   Chances are good that generosity on Valentine's Day will be
returned on March 14, called ``White Day'' by Japanese candy makers
who urge men to give their favorite women hard candies.

<TEXT>
   NATO members must work to reinvigorate the Western
alliance because the arms control treaty with the Soviets does not
mean the Kremlin has given up its ambitions of world dominance,
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said Saturday.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., delivering his party's weekly radio address, said
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty leaves nagging
questions.
   ``Where is the evidence that a half-century of Soviet pursuit of
dominance and control has been bridled?'' asked Byrd, who is
leading a bipartisan congressional delegation that is consulting
with European leaders.
   ``We are heartened to find that NATO leaders view the new Soviet
leadership with a healthy dose of realism,'' he said. ``We know
that our adversary has not abandoned its historic goals on the
world scene.''
   Byrd said Western Europe and the United States ``are the only
real foil to Soviet expansionism'' and should use the treaty ``as
an invitation to fashion a stronger alliance among ourselves.''
   ``The key to peace is cohesion,'' he said. ``We must redeclare
ourselves as an alliance. The Soviets must be convinced of our
public support, the depth and flexibility of our armed response _
and our staying power.''
   ``We are still far from a time when the world is in perfect
balance,'' Byrd said. ``Although nuclear deterrence is an essential
component in the pursuit of peace, NATO must soon offer a strong
proposal on conventional and chemical weapons control.''

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the Democratic radio address,
delivered Saturday by Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va.:
   This is Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd. 1988 promises to
bring about a massive shift in the way most of the free world sizes
up its own security. A new arms control treaty _ the INF treaty _
is before the Senate. People in this country and in Europe are
concerned about what it means to their future.
   For that reason, I led a bipartisan delegation this week to five
NATO countries to raise some crucial questions, and to pledge to
European leaders that America's commitment to NATO is unshakable,
unchanged, and undiminished.
   The signing of the INF treaty has opened the door to new
optimism, new uncertainties and new risks for NATO. The treaty is
an invitation to fashion a stronger alliance among ourselves, and a
more pragmatic strategy toward the Soviets.
   We were heartened to find that NATO leaders view the new Soviet
leadership with a healthy dose of realism.
   Much of their skepticism _ and ours _ can be laid to Mr.
Gorbachev's stunning achievement in eclipsing his predecessors in
style and message. At times, he seems to have almost mesmerized
Western publics with the prospect of detente with his adversaries
abroad and the trappings of glasnost at home.
   American polls are now recording a trust toward this Russian
leader where none existed before. Yet, there are some of us who are
still nagged by questions:
   _Where is the evidence that a half-century of Soviet pursuit of
dominance and control has been bridled?
   _Why should we risk deterrence on the professed good will of a
man only three years into power? Glasnost must not be confused with
the freedom of the press or freedom of speech by Western standards.
   The INF treaty is, in large measure, due to the courage and the
cohesion of the West. We proved that, together, we are the match
for any aggressor, that we are the only real foil to Soviet
expansionism.
   We know that our adversary has not abandoned its historic goals
on the world scene. So, our course should be one of new initiative
to constantly test the new Soviet leadership under Gorbachev.
   The leaders we consulted this week agreed that NATO has a
twofold task: first, to fashion sound solutions for our common
defense and our common approach to a skillful protagonist; second,
to persuade our peoples of the realities we face.
   Our message must be clear and constant: Arms control is not an
end in itself. It is a means to an end. The end being a more secure
Western alliance.
   I was born at a time when Woodrow Wilson proclaimed World War I
the ``war to end all wars.'' And I was a young man when Franklin
Roosevelt galvanized a nation with his call to arms.
   A generation has come of age since America and Europe last
fought side by side. That that generation has been spared the
trauma of war is a credit to the trust and strength we have given
on both sides of the Atlantic.
   In the coming months we must declare our unity of purpose, not
just to the Soviets, but to the American people and to the people
of Europe.
   We know we are still far from a time when the world is in
perfect balance. Although nuclear deterrence is an essential
component in the pursuit of peace, NATO must soon offer a strong
proposal on conventional and chemical weapons control.
   In the end, the key to peace is cohesion. We must redeclare
ourselves an alliance. The Soviets must be convinced of our public
support, the depth and flexibility of our armed response _ and our
staying power.
   The leaders in Europe with whom we met share our concerns. They
are realistic about Mr. Gorbachev and they welcomed strong American
leadership of the NATO alliance. We pledged to them our support of
the alliance and the continued commitment of the American people to
the common destiny of Europe and America; for Europe's security is
our security.

   People who live on Barlow Street say they support
two neighbors who face arraignment on charges of setting a house on
fire. The residents cheered because they said the house had been
used, since last summer, to sell crack.
   Residents of the working-class neighborhood where blacks, whites
and Asian-Americans live side by side said the two men acted as
good neighbors.
   Robert Firmstone said he's taking up a collection to help pay
legal expenses for Angelo ``Bruce'' Parisi, 28, and Perry Kent, 29,
who are free on $10,000 personal bond pending a Feb. 26 arraignment
on two charges each of burning property.
   Both men have admitted setting the fire but insist they are not
vigilantes, and their lawyers say they were acting in self defense.
   ``They are not vigilantes,'' said Firmstone, who has lived on
Barlow Street for 15 years. ``They are not going around the city
burning down crack houses.
   ``Ninety percent of the people in this block support them. When
they set the fire, everybody in the neighborhood knew they were
going to do it and they knew why they were going to do it,'' he
said.
   ``This is a peaceful neighborhood,'' said Firmstone. ``This
isn't a rich street, but we look out for each other.''
   However, Guy Martin, another neighbor, said, ``I don't agree
with their means. They did take the law into their own hands. But I
don't want a crack house in my neighborhood. They did what they
thought they had to do.''
   The suspected crack house was destroyed by fires Oct. 28 and
Nov. 15. Parisi, an unemployed landscaper, and Kent, an unemployed
machinist, are accused of dousing the house with gasoline and
setting the blazes.
   Lt. Jon Bozich, an arson investigator, said he plans to question
neighbors who told reporters they contributed to a neighborhood
collection for the gasoline. Neighbors could face conspiracy
charges, fire officials have said.
   Earlier, Parisi said he and Kent collected less than $10 from
neighbors to buy gasoline and a can.
   ``If I could do it over, I would call the police,'' Parisi said.
``I wouldn't do this again. It's scary.''
   Kent said he was so distressed he has sent his wife and three
children out of town. ``We did it for our kids; now we're not sure
we'll be around to see them grow up,'' he said.
   ``Maybe we overreacted, but something had to be done,'' Parisi
said. ``All we want is a peaceful, quiet neighborhood.''
   Renee Lynch, president of Detroit Area Residents East, applauded
the goal of Parisi and Kent but not their method.
   ``I think people get frustrated,'' Lynch said. ``You call those
drug telephone numbers and the police and you don't get any
feedback. Those two men were thinking of their children. I don't
think they should go to jail, though I fear they will be made an
example of.''

   Frederick Loewe, who wrote such
musicals as ``Camelot'' and ``My Fair Lady'' with partner Alan Jay
Lerner, was hospitalized in fair condition Saturday, an official
said.
   The 86-year-old songwriter was brought to Desert Hospital late
Wednesday because of chest pains and breathing trouble, according
to his guardian, John F. Morris.
   Hospital officials said he was in serious condition when he was
admitted but a nursing supervisor said he was in fair condition
Saturday.
   During an 18-year partnership, Lerner and Loewe wrote such hits
as ``Brigadoon'' in 1947, ``My Fair Lady'' in 1956 and ``Camelot''
in 1960.
   The team reunited in 1973 for a Broadway production of ``Gigi,''
which they had done as a film in 1958.
   Loewe retired, permanently, in 1974. Lerner died in 1986.

   An American destroyer wary of another
Stark-type attack fired flares at an Iraqi bomber racing toward a
convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf, U.S.
military officials said Saturday.
   The plane, a Soviet-built Tu-16 Badger, veered sharply away from
the convoy just before it launched two missiles Friday night. The
missiles exploded in a flash on the horizon a minute or so later,
according to journalists aboard the destroyer Chandler.
   On May 17, two Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi F-1 Mirage hit
the missile frigate USS Stark, killing 37 U.S. sailors. Iraq said
the attack was a mistake.
   Friday's incident was the second time in five days that an Iraqi
aircraft on a raid against Iranian targets had come within eight
miles of a U.S. warship in the central gulf as it prepared to fire
its missiles.
   U.S. military sources said officers aboard the battle cruiser
Richmond K. Turner had a ``tense moment'' last Sunday night when
they thought an Iraqi missile had been fired at their ship. That
missile, also launched from a Badger bomber, was visible when fired
and when it exploded, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   There was no word on what the Friday's projectiles actually hit,
but Iraq announced it had carried out an air strike against ``two
large maritime targets'' near Iran-held Sirri island at 9:08 p.m.,
the same time as the Chandler's sighting.
   Sirri is a little-used oil terminal about 60 miles northwest of
Dubai and 40 miles from the Iran coast. There was no other
verification of the claimed attack.
   Cmdr. Steve Smith, skipper of the 8,300-ton Chandler, told
members of the Pentagon-organized news pool that Iraqi pilots often
fire at radar blips without being sure of what they are.
   ``Having watched the geometry of their attacks for some time, I
was concerned that he would be firing his missile while he was
heading toward us,'' he informed his crew by ship's intercom.
   Many U.S. officers sailing the gulf say their greatest single
concern is an errant Iraqi air attack, such as that which
devastated the Stark.
   Iraq later apologized for the attack and agreed to pay
compensation to the U.S. government and the victims' families. The
State Department said recently it was in the ``final stages'' of
preparing claims.
   The Chandler was one of two warships escorting the upbound
convoy, which included four of the 11 state-owned Kuwaiti tankers
re-registered under the Stars and Stripes last year for protection
from Iranian attack. Iran considers Kuwait an ally of Iraq in their
seven-year war.
   U.S. warships routinely go on top alert when Iraqi warplanes
show up on radar, and the Chandler's crew was at ``general
quarters,'' or battle stations, as the Badger was tracked down the
gulf and looped eastward toward its target.
   The ship's Phalanx gun, designed to hurl a storm of radar-guided
shells at an incoming cruise missile, was on automatic, and its own
missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft teams were ready to fire.
   As the Iraqi jet turned behind the convoy and appeared to head
for the trailing Chandler, the destroyer fired two flares from a
5-inch gun and radioed the pilot to change course. Smith said the
pilot spoke poor English and did not seem to understand, but veered
away immediately when the flares lit up.
   Smith said it was the closest an Iraqi plane had come to the
Chandler since its arrival Nov. 25. The ship, originally built for
the Iranian navy but never delivered, is specially equipped to
monitor air activity.
   The skipper also said the Iraqi Badger, a twin-engine jet
bomber, carried Chinese-made C-601 missiles rather than the
French-built Exocets normally used by Baghdad's air forces.
   It was apparently the first disclosure that Iraq uses the C-601,
an air-to-ground version of the Silkworm anti-ship missile that
China has furnished to Iran. The basic design is Soviet and more
than 30 years old.
   Meanwhile, a Danish supertanker, crippled in a mysterious attack
on Thursday, continued under tow to a shipyard outside the gulf.
   Gulf shipping executives and military sources in the United
States said there were indications that the 339,000-ton ship was
hit by an Iraqi missile, rather than an Iranian helicopter, as
first reported.
   One seaman was killed and three others injured in the attack on
the tanker Kate Maersk, which was badly damaged by fire.
   The U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
was no helicopter in the vicinity, but noted that Iraq had claimed
an air raid on a ``large naval target'' about the time of the
attack.
   Salvage officials, also speaking privately, said the tanker had
what one called ``a gigantic entry hole'' in its superstructure,
suggesting a hit by a large, Exocet-type missile.
   Officials of A.P. Moeller, the ship's Copenhagen-based owners,
said they could not comment on what may have hit the tanker.

   A large windowless room here has witnessed
the assassination of an overbearing naval commander and mass
firings when officers failed to follow orders. It has seen treaties
broken and weapons used up.
   But not a drop of blood has been spilled. The room on the campus
of the Naval War College is used for war games, a serious pastime
that draws participants from around the world.
   Players call their activity, aided by maps and computers, fun
and exhilarating. But war gaming is played as the next best thing
to the real thing and even the scenarios are top secret.
   ``We try to stimulate the thinking process of these players,''
said Navy Cmdr. Tim Barker, who acts as umpire, keeping players
within the confines of the possible and showing them the
consequences of their decisions.
   ``Should I make my boats report? Should I move my boats into the
area? Should we respond to terrorist activity? All these things are
being played out,'' he said.
   On occasion, war games are handy in light of current events.
   When the United States began providing naval protection last
summer to U.S.-flagged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, the war
gaming staff played it out.
   ``We didn't come up with any surprises,'' said Capt. Joseph
Hurlburt, who has since retired as head of the college war gaming
department. He wouldn't elaborate but shook his head ``no'' when
asked if the Persian Gulf situation might explode.
   But war gaming can't predict all real-life actions, as shown by
a letter, displayed in the lobby, that was written to the war
college by Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander in the Pacific during
World War II.
   ``The war with Japan had been re-enacted in the game rooms at
the Naval War College by so many people, and in so many different
ways,'' Nimitz wrote, ``that nothing that happened during the war
was a surprise ... absolutely nothing except the (Japanese suicide)
kamikaze tactics toward the end of the war; we had not visualized
these.''
   Often games produce no clear winner. Instead, the objective is
to test theories, develop trends, build consensus and assess
technology and logistics, and to give War College students an arena
in which to practice what they've learned.
   When a war game is on, the building is off-limits to outsiders.
But during a recent rare visit, monitor screens blinked with
numbers and, in big red letters, the word ``CLASSIFIED.'' Other
screens showed maps indicating the locations of ships, submarines
and aircraft.
   The notion of two-sided war games in which players pretend to be
the adversary is relatively modern. It was invented early in this
century in Prussia and refined between the two world wars.
   Today, war games are sometimes played in seminars, where the
armaments and battle lines are drawn in the imagination. But the
Naval War College prides itself on its use of computers as a
resource for reality. They give more dimension to the simulation by
bringing in political variables and millions of facts.
   Computers hold the information from which the gamesters recreate
the world, including statistics on the shape and climate of ports,
the inclinations of their inhabitants and the details of other
countries' ships, aircraft and bombs.
   The number of players varies greatly, from a dozen to hundreds,
depending on the complexity.
   Each summer World War III begins anew, played out in three weeks
with 1,200 participants. There are NATO games and games with other
allies.
   Players are assigned to a force in computer-equipped rooms
called cells. One is designated the ``red cell,'' for Communist
forces. Cmdr. Robert Simeral is a Navy intelligence expert with
intimate knowledge of the Soviet Union, so he often plays the
Soviet side.
   ``The goal of the red cell is to play a consistent red threat.
However, you can never really crack the skulls of the Soviets,'' he
said, pointing up a flaw inherent in war games _ the best you can
do is imitate the enemy.
   Each game takes on a life of its own, animated by the players
and their options, Simeral said. ``Tempers flare. People get fired.
Military leaders get upset with the civilian command. You get an
acting president firing a commander in charge of the Pacific for
contradicting policy.''
   The professional warriors all stressed that the ultimate
objective of trying out such scenarios is to keep the peace. Said
Barker, ``We don't necessarily want a good juicy war, but to make
people think about it.''

   Some law enforcement and other government
officials are challenging the credibility of witnesses who gave the
Senate a startling, detailed account of ties between Latin American
leaders and a huge Colombian drug cartel.
   But the two senators who ran last week's hearings, Massachusetts
Democrat John Kerry and New York Republican Alfonse D'Amato, are
unbowed by the criticism and promise more revelations to come.
   ``When you're trying to prosecute the devil,'' said Kerry,
referring to Panamanian strongman Manual Noriega, ``you don't go to
heaven for the witnesses.''
   Though Noriega, who denies all charges, is under federal
drug-trafficking indictments in Miami and Tampa, and the
administration has distanced itself from its one-time ally, some
officials are challenging parts of the Senate testimony as
undocumented and tainted by the criminal background of key
witnesses.
   The critics include Vice President George Bush, officials of the
Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. attorney in Miami and
Democrat David Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
   Kerry is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee
on terrorism and narcotics, which has spent the past year
investigating ties among Latin American leaders and drug kingpins
in Colombia.
   Last week's hearings produced dramatic testimony from Jose I.
Blandon, a former close associate of Noriega who was fired last
month, and Ramon Milian Rodriguez, an accountant who is serving a
43-year prison term for laundering money for the drug cartel.
   At one point, Blandon said the CIA had provided Noriega with
details about the personal lives of U.S. senators.
   The CIA categorically denied that assertion. Boren, traveling in
Europe, said he had ``no reason to believe that there is any
truth'' to the charge.
   Kerry said Blandon ``was a very credible witness. I haven't
talked yet to Sen. Boren about his statement, but I intend to when
he returns from Europe.''
   D'Amato, who has been interested for years in the way drugs
reach the United States, sided with Kerry. ``Blandon is credible,''
D'Amato said. ``I don't know about the truth of every single
statement he made, but an awful lot of what he said can be checked
out and has been fully checked out.''
   Blandon also said that two hours before the U.S. invasion of
Grenada on Oct. 25, 1983, Bush passed a warning to Cuban president
Fidel Castro that Cuban troops shouldn't oppose the U.S. action on
the Caribbean island.
   Bush said he'd never given such a warning.
   Rodriguez testified about the money laundering operations of the
drug cartel, based in Medellin, Colombia. He asserted that the
cartel had helped bankroll the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, and
also said he received money from the CIA.
   Echoing complaints of federal drug agents, Richard Gregory,
chief deputy U.S. attorney in Miami, said ``When Rodriguez was
arrested (in 1983), he never told us any of the things he's talking
about now. I've talked to the agents in this office who worked on
his case and they don't believe him. Every time anything reached
headline status in the last five years, he'd say he knew about it.''
   When U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner sought the indictment in Miami
against Noriega, returned two weeks ago, Rodriguez wasn't used,
Gregory said.
   Gregory also said investigators from Kerry's subcommittee were
told that Rodriguez wasn't credible, but Kerry used him anyway.
   ``You know,'' said Kerry, ``if you go back to the Iran-Contra
hearings, there were witnesses who came forward with totally
different stories, totally inconsistent with each other, day after
day. That has not appeared here. Witness after witness has
corroborated the money laundering, corroborated the (drug) network,
corroborated the names.''
   Kerry added that ``I certainly don't quickly forget the fact
that there were long and indignant and repeated denials by the
White House and others about selling arms to Iran. There were long
and repeated denials by the CIA and State Department about those
and many other things, including illegal support of the Contras.''
   D'Amato agreed. ``A lot of people don't want to believe the
things that Blandon and Rodriguez are saying, so their credibility
is attacked,'' he said. ``But if you look at it very closely, an
awful lot of what they are saying has been corroborated by
documentation, by statements from other people. The international
drug trafficking problem is very serious and it won't go away by
attacking someone's credibility.''
   When the hearings resume next month, Kerry says he plans to
focus on the alleged connections among the drug cartel, the Contras
and the CIA.

   Killer bees from South America will probably begin
swarming into the United States in the next year or two, and any
attempt to head them off at the border is likely to fail, experts
predicted Saturday.
   The nasty, aggressive bees have already reached southern Mexico
and are winging northward at a rate of 200 or 300 miles a year. One
authority said they might even hit Brownsville, Texas, late this
year.
   U.S. and Mexican officials have set up a BRZ, or bee regulated
zone, in southern Mexico in an effort to at least slow down the
intruders.
   However, experts at a conference of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science said Saturday that the arrival of the
Africanized bees is inevitable, although they are not sure how far
north the bees will spread. Some believe they will be limited to
the warm southern states, while others say they might spread over
much of the nation.
   ``In my view, to eradicate a social insect is almost
impossible,'' said David W. Roubik, a staff scientist with the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa, Panama.
   ``It's too hard to get every last one,'' he said. ``Any mass
eradication program would be a filter. I don't see any possibility
of ridding the Americas of Africanized bees.''
   The bees descended from South African bees that escaped from a
researcher in Brazil in 1956. In South and Central America, they
have largely displaced their gentler cousins, descended from
European bees.
   Unlike ordinary honeybees, the Africanized variety is easily
riled, and hundreds may attack unsuspecting intruders who go near
their nests, leading to the popular name killer bees. They
sometimes kill animals and people with their stings.
   The Africanized bees are thought to be a major threat to the
U.S. beekeeping industry. Commercially maintained bees are
important for pollinating crops ranging from almonds to
blueberries, and the Africanized bees are poor pollinators.
   Killer bees frequently take over commercial hives, where they
are difficult to handle. They are poor honey makers, and they
frequently pack up and fly off without warning.
   In a report prepared for the meeting, Orley R. Taylor of the
University of Kansas predicted the arrival of the bees in Texas
later this year. He said the bees will clearly have an impact in
the United States, but whether it ``will be in the billions of
dollars or only in the tens of millions over the next 20 years is
not yet clear.''
   An effort to halt the bees at the narrowest point in Mexico, the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec, already shows signs of failing. Officials
hoping to trap and kill the bees in a belt across the isthmus have
already had to fall back to a second line of defense.
   Like several other experts scheduled to speak at the meeting, Al
Dietz of the University of Georgia was not able to attend because
of bad weather in Boston, but his research report was read to the
conference.
   He said the bees were able to survive as successfully as
European bees in the cold mountains of Argentina, even when covered
with snow for a month. He said they might survive in the United
States south of the 40 degree latitude, which crosses the country
from Philadelphia to Denver to northern California.
   Suzanne W.T. Batra of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
she believes they will thrive along the coasts as far north as
Washington state and Boston but live only in the southern states in
the nation's interior.
   Roubik said that the Africanized bees may need tropical flowers
and nest-uilding materials, and this could stop them from getting
established in colder parts of the United States.
   David J.C. Fletcher of Bucknell University said in a report that
bees in Africa are more gentle, make more honey and are easier to
control than their Africanized descendents in the Americas. He
proposed bringing friendly bees from Africa to the United States
and letting them breed with the killer bees so they will pass on
their desirable traits.
   However, it is currently illegal to bring live honeybees into
the United States. Efforts to crossbreed killer bees with European
honeybees have proven unsuccessful because the Africanized bees are
genetically dominant.

<HEAD>Nuclear Politics in New Hampshire: It All Boils Down to Seabrook</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates, edits throughout; no pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis Clouthier is a conservative
Republican _ pro-Star Wars, pro-Contra aid and opposed to the
U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms treaty. Yet in 1986, he voted for a
liberal Democrat for governor solely because the GOP incumbent
championed the Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   The stalled, $5.2 billion project on New Hampshire's seacoast
has been a leading state and regional issue throughout much of its
16-year history. Now its foes hope voters like Clouthier will make
it an influential factor in the first presidential primary of the
1988 season _ possibly ruining the presidential bid of Vice
President George Bush.
   All seven major Democratic presidential candidates are to some
extent opposed to Seabrook, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
playing a key role in blocking a license for the completed reactor.
But there are some sharp distinctions among the five Republican
aspirants.
   Seabrook opponents criticize pro-nuclear Republicans at the
bottom of the polls _ former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and former
television evangelist Pat Robertson. But their chief target is
Bush, whose front-runner status in New Hampshire polls has been
jeopardized by his third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses.
   Bush views on Seabrook have echoed those of his state campaign
chairman, Gov. John Sununu: Its fate should be left to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, not state governors.
   ``George Bush is going to do terribly on the seacoast among
Republicans because of Seabrook, and it could end up costing him
the presidency,'' said Kurt Ehrenberg of Search '88. He noted that
a little-known, anti-Seabrook challenger to Sununu in the 1986
gubernatorial primary won 22 percent of the vote statewide, and up
to 45 percent in some seacoast towns.
   To try to help fulfill that prophecy, Ehrenberg's group last
week began airing radio ad on seacoast stations that concluded:
``If you don't want Seabrook, you don't want George Bush.''
   Bush campaign aide Andrew Card disputed Ehrenberg's prediction.
   ``I don't think (voters) are that parochial,'' Card said. ``It
will be an issue, but one of many, many issues in the primary _ not
a cutting issue.''
   ``Electing a governor and electing a president are two different
things,'' said Paul Young of New York Rep. Jack Kemp's campaign.
But he also speculated that Seabrook could have an impact if it
costs Bush support on the seacoast.
   Kemp, a strong proponent of states' rights, has asked federal
regulators to hold up a low-power license for Seabrook before
evacuation plans are developed that win the confidence of people
within the plant's 10-mile emergency planning zone.
   ``I want to make clear, he is not against nuclear power _ just
for the health and safety of the people,'' Young said.
   However, the Kemp camp has not been trumpeting its positions on
Seabrook.
   ``I understand that. That's politics,'' said Mimi Fallon of the
group Republicans Against Seabrook Station. ``They're afraid
they're going to lose the people they already have on the other
side'' who support the plant, said Fallon, who supports Kemp.
   Another Republican hopeful, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, has
suggested that the non-partisan National Academy of Sciences review
Seabrook's evacuation plans because of a perception that the NRC
favors the industry it is supposed to regulate. In December, Dole
also asked the NRC to hold up low-power testing until evacuation
issues are settled.
   ``I'd like to see Senator Dole go a little further, but I'm not
knocking what he's done,'' Ehrenberg said. ``He's a tough guy to
move on some issues, that's clear. He's a very careful politician.''
   What irks the anti-Seabrook activists is Dole's insistence that
governors should not have veto power over nuclear plants. But in an
interview this month, Dole also said a governor ``has got to be
certain that the rights of his people are protected.''
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis is fighting in federal court
against an NRC rule change that would allow approval of evacuation
plans developed by utilities when governments balk. Dukakis tried
to reinforce his standing with anti-Seabrook voters last week by
holding a news conference with the reactor in the background.
   Ehrenberg speculated that Dukakis' action against Seabrook may
have gained him some early organizational support in neighboring
New Hampshire, but that hasn't stopped the other Democrats from
wooing the anti-Seabrook vote _ in some cases, in spite of
generally pro-nuclear records.
   Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt said he served on the
presidential commission that investigated the 1979 Three Mile
Island accident and recommended the evacuation-planning rules that
have become Seabrook's major obstacle.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart said he sat on a congressional
panel that helped write those recommendations law.
   Jesse Jackson favors a rapid phase-out of all the nation's
nuclear power plants and notes that he opposed Seabrook in his 1984
preidential campaign, before the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet
Union.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois calls Seabrook a ``white elephant''
that should not operate, and he held a news conference last week in
the same place Dukakis did to criticize pro-nuclear votes by Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   Simon noted that a nuclear industry lobbying group said last
year that Gephardt voted with the industry 53 percent of the time
in recent years. But Gephardt says his votes came under a more
vigilant NRC and he has learned since Chernobyl.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee voted with the nuclear
industry 55 percent of the time when he was in the House, but has
taken a low-key position on problems at the Tennessee Valley
Authority nuclear reactors.
   Clouthier, the New Hampshire voter who is a quality-control
manager, said he doesn't see Seabrook as an overriding issue in the
primary.
   ``But I think they're all avoiding it like a hot potato because
it is so controversial,'' Clouthier said.

   City Park in New Orleans is a marvelous place.
   Its Museum of Art Friday framed a new face.
   Not a Mondrian modern or unknown Jurassic,
   Not Van Gogh or Matisse or some other old classic.
   They brought this Seuss fellow fresh from the West Coast
   to personally bring what he does the most.
   To a place which has showcased Peruvian gold,
   King Tut and old glass _ 'twas a stroke the most bold _
   They've brought cats with tall hats, creatures so long and
slinky ...
   And how did he draw them with eyes that go winky?
   They invited, as well, (just to welcome him there)
   a few fellow artists. Oh, heavens! Beware!
   Reporters! Cartoonists! Writers! Art Critics!
   Will they be converted? Perhaps catalytic?
   All joined in Big Easy at Carnival time
   to welcome the master of nonsense and rhyme.
   Dr. Seuss is the fellow, we know him as Ted.
   Geisel's the last name. Stick that in your head!
   It seemed such a good scheme, when the directors thought it,
   that no one, not even the ombudsmen fought it.
   They wanted something classy to put on a show.
   And so they went shopping in San Diego.
   What they got were some prints, some old manuscripts, too,
   to put up on the walls in red, yellow and blue.
   The old master walked in, looking fit and well-tanned
   and saw that the media there was well-manned.
   So he pitched out some quotes which they all gobbled up
   from the floor where they fell like fat-bellied pups.
   Asked what children might gain if they see Dr. Seuss,
   the sage quickly replied, ``Well, what will they lose?''
   Then he chuckled and said, trying hard not to pun,
   ``Why, my only hope is they'll have them some fun.''
   Kids sometimes come to museums, escorting mommies and daddies,
   and wait holding thick fingers, wishing for peppermint patties.
   But here's an exhibit that all can admire.
   There are creepies and crawlies, and creative fire.
   ``Don't worry 'bout this, don't worry 'bout that,''
   said Seuss, ``this is stuff just to be looked at.''
   The doors will be open until April 10.
   So get yourself down here and walk yourself in.
   And if you're afraid of an encounter with culture
   why, you're in New Orleans _ just mask as a vulture!
   Oh, yes _ all the journalists, cynical, tired _
   After seeing the Doctor ... they all left inspired!

<HEAD>Waycross Residents Disagree Over Significance Of Racial Incidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WAYCROSS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customers at the Waycross Newsstand usually
discuss politics, football and current events over coffee, but
lately talk has focused on charges of discrimination against blacks
in the mostly white Ware County school system.
   Newsstand owner Jack Perry said the complaints stem from
``isolated incidents'' and are not a sign of serious racial
problems in the county.
   ``I think we have a fine racial situation,'' said Perry, 59,
whose family has lived in this southeast Georgia town of 19,500 for
75 years. ``There are some isolated incidents, but we make an
effort to resolve our differences.''
   Around the corner from the newsstand is the office of Huey
Spearman, attorney for the Waycross branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Spearman disagrees with Perry's assessment. He says three recent
incidents demonstrate a pattern of discrimination that is condoned
by school officials.
   Ten black students say a white school bus driver forced them to
sit in the back of a bus after they missed school on Martin Luther
King Day last month.
   The bus driver, Dale Dixon, wrote a letter to school officials
and passengers saying she seated the black students at the rear to
facilitate loading and unloading.
   In another incident, Spearman said, school officials failed to
discipline two white Ware County High School cheerleaders who
blackened their faces at a pep rally and posed as clumsy football
players from predominantly black Waycross High.
   Black leaders also have charged that until black parents
complained, school officials failed to discipline white students
who wore Ku Klux Klan-style hoods at a ``toga party.''
   ``I think we're seeing vestiges of the '60s,'' Spearman said,
noting that the county school system is 4 percent black while the
city school system is 65 percent black.
   ``I think it probably goes back to the days when the schools
were segregated,'' he said. ``A lot of people moved into the county
so they would not have to integrate. I think the white parents, as
well as the school administration, would like to keep it white.''
   Last week, he gave the school board a list of steps the NAACP
felt were necessary. They included the dismissal of the bus driver,
disciplinary action against school officials for improper handling
of the incidents and a public apology to black students barred from
county school buses for refusing to sit in the back for a second
day.
   ``We're going to try hard to do what's right,'' said Donnie
Griffin, chairman of the Ware County Board of Education.
   On Friday, the board refused to act against the bus driver, but
agreed to erase suspensions from the records of three black girls
who refused to obey her order.
   Griffin, a pharmacist, said he thought Ware County had been
blessed with good race relations and he was surprised when the
controversy surfaced.
   ``For the most part, I think we get along very well,'' he said.
``We have a great community. We want to work to make this community
even better.
   ``My number one concern is to let everyone know there will be no
discrimination, whether by race or income or handicap. We've got a
good board and we're going to do what it takes to keep it a good
system.''
   After black teen-agers and their parents testified about the
three incidents at a board meeting Tuesday night, at least two
black students got menacing phone calls, Spearman said.
   He said consolidation of the city and county school systems
should be the ultimate goal, but that merger is not likely any time
soon because many whites still cling to old racist attitudes.
   ``I think the people in the county would fight it vigorously,''
said Spearman, adding that he believes the Reagan administration
has contributed to racial problems by failing to take a strong
stand on civil rights.
   ``Supremacists seem to be on the rise again,'' he said.

   Cultural differences and national pride
distinguish Russian from Estonian and divide parent from child in
Estonia, home of a small ethnic group caught between stronger
neighbors for centuries.
   Dissidents plan protests Feb. 16 in Lithuania and Feb. 24 in
Estonia to mark the days when the Baltic republics declared their
independence from Soviet Russia months after the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917.
   Last August, in an event dissidents say showed the authorities
they had lost control, thousands of people marked the anniversary
of a secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union
that led to the 1940 Soviet takeover of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania.
   Soviet authorities now are encouraging the republics' growing
non-Baltic populations to learn the native language and in some
cases are seeking to restrict immigration from other parts of the
Soviet Union.
   People of the Baltic nations, very different ethnically from the
Soviet Union's dominant Slavic population, always have maintained a
strong cultural and ethnic identity.
   One of the Estonian dissidents is 21-year-old Tina Hallik,
daughter of faithful Communist Party members.
   ``People think if I'm free, if I'm not in prison or slave labor
camp, then maybe I can do a little something. But nothing is
getting done. Nothing changes,'' said Ms. Hallik.
   The dissidents are seeking permission for a demonstration in the
center of Tallinn, capital of Estonia, on Feb. 24. They have not
yet heard from officials but say they have the support of average
Estonians.
   ``If they try to isolate every one (of the group) the people
will come out because they will have heard something is
happening,'' she said.
   On Thursday, Ms. Hallik's 55-year-old mother, Klara, was among
writers, scholars and officials from the Baltic republics taking
part in a panel discussion of national problems organized for
foreign reporters by the government news agency Novosti.
   Klara Hallik discounted the importance of nationalism as a
problem in Estonia, and she and other panel members drew a
distinction between nationalism and cultural differences.
   Her daughter said she respects her mother's views but that they
sharply disagree. Superiors at work and the KGB have put pressure
on her parents because of their daughter's views, Ms. Hallik said.
   Little open conflict is evident between ethnic groups in
Estonia. Writer Ulo Tuulik, a member of the officially sponsored
panel, said Estonians and other ethnic groups ``could be compared
to the Mississippi and Volga rivers. We just live our own lives and
don't have great conflicts.''
   Estonians number just more than 1 million and make up 61 percent
of their small republic, but that figure has dropped from almost 75
percent in 1959. Russians now make up 28 percent of the population.
   According to 1987 official statistics, only 25 percent of the
Estonians spoke fluent Russian, the dominant language of the Soviet
Union. One out of 10 non-Estonians could speak fluent Estonian.
   In Latvia in 1979 there were about 1.3 million Latvians and
821,000 Russians, but Lithuanians made up 80 percent of the
population of their republic.
   The official group blamed nationalist protests on a small group
of ``extremists.''
   Toomas Karjaharm, a professor of history at Tallinn State
Conservatory, said the protests are ``tied to social and economic
problems which have gotten worse in the past few years,'' and which
officials are trying to solve under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform
policies.
   Officials say the number of Estonians in the republic is
dropping because Estonians have one of the lowest birth rates in
the Soviet Union, and that many of the non-Estonians who move there
are young people attracted by good jobs in the republic's
industries.
   But one Estonian dissident, speaking on condition of anonymity,
dismissed Gorbachev as ``a loud voice of an empty barrel rolling
along.''
   To limit the migration, officials are requiring state-run
industries that seek workers outside the republic to put up about
$25,000 for each worker's housing. A similar program is in effect
in Latvia.
   Officials also are trying to publish more books in the native
languages of the Baltic republics and are encouraging people of
non-Baltic origin to learn the languages of the indigenous
nationalities.
   The official media also accuse Western radio stations of
stirring up nationalist feelings in the Baltics.
   Most of the protests in the Baltic republics have been peaceful,
but the dissidents report more surveillance and pressure.
   Dissident sources say activists in Lithuania and Estonia have
been arrested for refusing temporary military service. They charge
that the temporary call-up in both cases was an attempt by
authorities to discourage protests.
   The official Lithuanian press has warned that activists face
prosecution if they disrupt public order, and Soviet President
Andrei A. Gromyko addressed the issue in a visit to Vilnius,
Lithuania, a week ago.
   Two members of a group trying to establish an alternative to the
Communist Party in Estonia, Vello Vaartnou and Eke-Part Nomm, said
they were forced to emigrate Saturday to Sweden.
   The Baltic Helsinki Group, a human rights group based in
Stockholm, Sweden, quoted Nomm as saying he and Vaartnou had been
told by Soviet authorities to leave the country or face
imprisonment.

   It's not safe to be mayor in this western
Nebraska community of 10,000. There have been three of them in 37
days and two of them were recalled.
   ``This office is scared. I'm scared. I don't know if this stuff
is going to die,'' said Kevin Horn, executive director of the
Chamber of Commerce.
   Horn and other community leaders are worried about the city's
image and how it will attract new residents and businesses.
   ``I was 100, 150 miles from home and people would laugh _ here's
the Alliance guy. What's going on up there?'' said Hal Murray, a
liquor salesman who was an organizer of the first recall drive.
   Anti-drug crusader Dick Zellaha was ousted as mayor in that
recall on Dec. 15, and his successor, rival Duane Worley, was
officially recalled Jan. 20.
   Car salesman Richard Robb, appointed to the City Council in
October to fill a vacancy, is the latest to hold the title of
mayor, a ceremonial job that pays only $575 a year.
   The mayor serves as president of the City Council, while City
Manager Wolfgang Bauer runs the town's day-to-day business.
   ``I think the key word for Alliance at this point is
`polarized,''' said Horn, who was warned before moving to Alliance
to take the Chamber job that ``this was a community that would
fight.''
   Since Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle was recalled in January 1987, the
state has seen a big increase in recall elections of mayors, city
councilmen, school board members and other elected officials. The
Omaha recall was considered a trigger to many of the other recalls,
all in small communities.
   According to a study by a legislative committee, there were 11
recall elections in the state from 1984 through 1986. In 1987,
there were 17.
   The Nebraska Legislature is considering a bill that would make
it tougher to recall an elected official. The bill would require
petition groups to state reasons for the recall, and the reasons
would have to be more serious than mere disagreement with the
official's voting record.
   At the center of the Alliance controversy is Zellaha, 49, a
former department store manager and one-time amateur boxer who
called himself ``The Great Lakes Mauler.''
   Zellaha, who is unemployed but supports himself with investments
and his wife's salary, believes he was recalled because people were
jealous of the attention his anti-drug campaign received, including
a letter from first lady Nancy Reagan.
   His opponents said the problem was much deeper. They accused him
of unethically and illegally using his office to promote his
personal gain.
   Council members elected Zellaha mayor in December 1986, and one
month later his son was seriously injured in a traffic accident.
Shane Zellaha, now 25, owned up to a drug problem, and father and
son began giving talks on drug abuse.
   Critics said Zellaha wasn't able to separate his personal
campaign from his responsibilities as mayor. The recall committee
also accused him of harassing the police department, shouting at
meetings, misusing city stationery and postage and bringing
ridicule to the city.
   Asked if he did anything in office that was illegal or
unethical, he replied, ``Oh heavens no, heavens no. I never did.''
   Worley and Council member Wendy Fierstein were recalled for
allegedly not honoring a group's request that electrical rates be
lowered and that the city manager be fired.
   Worley said Bauer had done nothing to warrant firing. He also
said the city was working to adjust the electrical rates.
   Worley, whose recall was the work of another committee, said he
is disturbed by the publicity the recalls have created.
   The acting mayor's council seat and three others are up for
election this year, with the primary on May 10. Robb won't say if
he'll run. Zellaha has promised his wife he won't run but their son
is a candidate.
   ``This would have been a good place to do two things: a study on
government ... and another one on psychology,'' said Bauer. ``How
the psychology of this whole thing worked, and how it transpired
and what the emotions were and how ugly it got.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Subpoena Issued for JAMA's Records of Mercy Killing
Essay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury has requested all records linked to
a ``mercy killing'' essay written by a doctor whose identity has
not been revealed by the Journal of The American Medical
Association, the Chicago Sun-Times said Saturday.
   The newspaper, in its early Sunday editions, said the grand jury
wants the cover letter from the author, the original manuscript and
all correspondence between the Journal and the author.
   With a subpoena, the Cook County grand jury also has requested
any in-house memos about the essay and minutes from editorial staff
meetings concerning the Jan. 8 article, the Sun-Times said, citing
sources it did not name.
   But a spokesman for the AMA and the editor of the Journal said
they had not seen the subpoena. ``I have no information about
that,'' editor Dr. George Lundberg told The Associated Press.
   AMA spokesman Tom Toftey said, ``We have not been subpoenaed as
far as I know, and I am quite certain that I would know if we had.''
   The state's attorney's office had no comment, spokesman Terry
Levin said Saturday.
   The essay, titled ``It's Over, Debbie,'' has sparked debate
about the ethics of euthanasia. Medical experts and prosecutors
have urged the journal to release the name of the doctor who wrote
the article.
   The essay, which AMA officials admit wasn't verfified, describes
how an exhausted gynecology resident gave a fatal injection of
morphine to a young woman suffering from ovarian cancer.
   Some doctors have questioned whether the incident ever took
place.
   State's Attorney Richard M. Daley became involved in the matter
because the Journal is published here. The essay did not indicate
where the author lived or where the incident took place.
   Lundberg said the state's attorney's office had called AMA
general counsel Kirk Johnson, asking him to reveal the name of the
doctor. Johnson refused.
   Previously, Johnson has said the organization would challenge,
under First Amendment protections, any efforts to obtain the name
of the author of the essay.
   The newspaper said Johnson would go to court to fight the
subpoena. He has, however, stated that the Journal would make the
name public if confronted with a formal court order.

   A smoldering shell was all that remained
Saturday of the former High School for the Performing Arts, which
helped launch the careers of future stars and inspired the movie
and TV series ``Fame.''
   The landmark structure was destroyed by an overnight fire that
apparently started near a stage in a second-floor auditorium. ``But
we don't know why,'' said Pat Foley, a battalion fire chief.
   Al Pacino, Liza Minnelli, Eartha Kitt, Suzanne Pleshette and
Anna Maria Horsford, who plays the minister's daughter on the TV
series ``Amen,'' are among the successes who studied there.
   ``So excited because I'm going to go to the High School of
Performing Arts!'' exclaims the character Diana Morales in the
long-running Broadway musical, ``A Chorus Line.''
   Detailing the rigors of the school, the character, a native of
sunny Puerto Rico, sings about riding a make-believe bobsled in
class.
   ``And Mr. Karp turns to me and he says, OK Morales, what did you
feel? And I said, `Nothing. I'm feeling nothing.' And he says,
`Nothing could get a girl transferred.'''
   The performing arts school, part of the public system, was
combined with the High School of Music and Art about three years
ago and moved to a new home. The old building became known as
Liberty High School.
   It was the original school that was used as a model for
``Fame.'' Although the Board of Education did not permit film crews
to shoot scenes inside, the facade was featured in the 1980 film
and subsequent television series.
   ``The school had a very positive and very motivating
reputation,'' said dancer Paula Brown, who appeared in the series
for two years. ``It made a lot of kids successful.''
   Working on Fame ``was like being in school. I was 22 years old
and I felt like I was 15, starting all over again,'' said Ms.
Brown, who currently is appearing in the new Spike Lee movie,
``School Daze.''
   The school, just north of the Times Square area in Manhattan,
caught fire about 12:30 a.m. and burned out of control for 5{
hours. The third, fourth and fifth floors and the rear portion of
the roof collapsed,
   Thirty firefighters _ struggling against a wind chill of minus 7
and wind gusts of 28 miles an hour _ suffered minor injuries.

<HEAD>Members of Unofficial Groups Protest in Moscow Square</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven members of unofficial social and political
groups demonstrated Saturday in a Moscow square against the
government's attempts to restrict their activities, one protester
said.
   The protesters held posters in Pushkin Square and spoke
peacefully with about 150 passersby, said Yevgenia Debryansky, a
member of the unofficial Group for Establishing Trust Between East
and West.
   In a telephone interview, she said the demonstration continued
unimpeded by militiamen for 15 minutes, but that a KGB agent then
ripped away one of the posters and the crowd dispersed.
   ``The passersby were very interested in what we had to say and
asked many questions,'' Ms. Debryansky said.
   She said she and the other demonstrators were demanding that
Soviet authorities let them in on discussions of any new laws that
would restrict the activities of the unofficial groups that have
sprung up under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness on some social issues. Rumors have been
circulating that such laws are under consideration, but their exact
nature is unknown, she said.
   There have been other signs that authorities are cracking down
on unofficial, unsanctioned groups. On Sept. 1, the Moscow city
council announced it would not allow protests near the Kremlin, Red
Square or on other squares in the city's center.
   On Feb. 1, the Communist Party newspaper published a lengthy
article attacking what it called ``political freak'' organizations
of the right and left. Pravda said there are more than 30,000 such
groups nationwide.
   On Dec. 27, Pravda warned that unofficial groups would create
anarchy by establishing alternatives to the Communist Party or
official trade unions.
   The state-controlled publishing industry also is under orders
not to print material prepared by groups lacking official
recognition.
   Ms. Debryansky said the other groups taking part in Saturday's
demonstration were Democracy and Humanism, Perestroika '88,
Memorial, and Freedom of Emigration for All.

   After 75 years, love still blooms for
Charles and Fannie Forespring.
   The couple, who eloped on Valentine's Day in 1913 after their
parents told them they were too young to marry, have been
inseparable since their wedding, living a rather quiet life in
Somerset County.
   ``We had our fights. But we never stayed mad at each other,''
said Forespring, 94. ``I'm the kind of person who can't stay mad at
people, even my wife.''
   The couple moved into the White Star Residence in Jennerstown
two years ago after living various places in Somerset County. They
have four children, 16 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.
   Forespring was a member of the New Centerville country band when
he met his future wife while playing at a Memorial Day service. But
he had trouble getting past her father when he tried to call on her
at her home in Berlin.
   ``My father wasn't too pleased,'' said Mrs. Forespring, 93. ``He
told me we were too young to be getting serious.''
   She said her family also was opposed to the marriage because she
was needed at home.
   ``I quit high school in my senior year and went to work for a
dentist. We had a large family and needed the money,'' she said.
   After dating for several months, the two decided they couldn't
wait.
   ``We devised a plan,'' Forespring said. ``On Fridays when Fannie
was visiting with her aunt and uncle, her uncle would take her to
the railroad station in Rockwood on his sleigh and put her on the
train.''
   But on Friday afternoon, Feb. 14, 1913, Forespring was waiting
in the hotel across from the railroad station and hopped the train.
   ``We made our way to Cumberland, Md. We were sure a preacher
friend of her family would marry us,'' he said. ``Somewhere along
the way, I really don't remember, we obtained a marriage license.''
   Mrs. Forespring said a Rev. Styles, who had been pastor of the
Reformed Church in Berlin, agreed to perform the ceremony.
   ``We were married, stayed overnight in Cumberland and the next
day headed back to New Centerville,'' Forespring said. ``Monday
morning I was back at my job as a teamster with the Atlantic
Refining Co.''
   Mrs. Forespring said there are days when she feels like she's 16
and times when she feels her age.
   ``I never let my age bother me,'' she said. ``Why, I just gave
up driving a car four or five years ago.''

   To Alice Leitner, her fiance is ``my Prince

   Her Valentine present was a box wrapped in pink and fuchsia

   When she opened the box in a parking stall Friday she found a

   Leitner, an architectural designer, won't identify her
boyfriend. She says he has been very generous during their
seven-year relationship.
   ``He always does very romantic surprises,'' she said.
   ``If I come home (from a trip) he'll always have 10 dozen roses
for me. Once he gave me a ring with dolphins on it.''
   For her 1987 Valentine's gift, Leitner received a gold ``love
bracelet,'' which fastens with two gold screws. He keeps the
screwdriver.
   ``I'm so lucky,'' she said on Friday. ``This is better than a
movie. He's my Prince Charming.''

<HEAD>New Ad Targets Bush, Dole On Contra Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential hopeful Jack
Kemp predicted Saturday he will beat Pat Robertson in New
Hampshire's primary and aired a new television commercial targeting
rivals Bob Dole and George Bush.
   Kemp's 30-second spot says Vice President Bush and Senate GOP
leader Dole have not done enough to help the Contra rebels fighting
the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   It did not mention Robertson, the former television evangelist
whom Kemp is battling for conservative support in the primary on
Tuesday.
   ``We're not that worried about Robertson,'' Kemp press secretary
John Buckley said after the New York congressman held a news
conference to unveil the ad.
   But after finishing a distant fourth in Monday's Iowa caucuses
while Robertson placed second, behind Dole and ahead of Bush,
Kemp's White House bid hinges on at least a third-place finish in
New Hampshire _ preferably ahead of Robertson.
   Asked if his campaign would be dead if Robertson beats him
Tuesday, Kemp said, ``He's not going to beat me in New Hampshire.''
   However, a poll conducted Thursday and Friday nights in New
Hampshire and published Saturday in The Boston Globe indicated that
Roberston is in third place with 11 percent, while Kemp had 8
percent, although the difference was half the sample's margin of
error.
   Buckley said Kemp would air two more new ads as the New
Hampshire campaign wound down, but neither would criticize any of
the other candidates.
   The spot focusing on Contra aid opens with a picture of Bush
presiding over the Senate, a male voice saying: ``President
Reagan's request for aid to the freedom fighters narrowly loses
when eight Republicans who endorsed George Bush desert the
president.''
   The spot continues: ``Communist dictator (Nicaraguan leader
Daniel) Ortega continues his military buildup. Yet Bob Dole told
The Boston Globe he wasn't concerned about Ortega or his army. Is
that leadership?''
   ``Contra leader Adolfo Calero said, `Jack Kemp is the only one
who lifted a finger to help us.' That's leadership.''
   Kemp acknowledged that Dole voted for Contra aid, but said, ``He
didn't lift a finger, according to Adolfo Calero, to get ... more
money'' last summer.
   Buckley later added, ``Sure (Dole has) voted in the right place.
But this guy has run for the last year on leadership. And the
question that we're raising here ... is whether or not he's really,
truly had the leadership he's claimed to have had, to have gotten
more aid to the Contras.''

   Danny and the Juniors must have had the gift of
prophecy when they recorded ``Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay'' 30
years ago.
   The number of radio stations nationwide playing rock music of
the late 1950s, the 1960s and 1970s has doubled in the last five
years, and the trend is continuing, according to the authoritative
Broadcasting@Cablecasting Yearbook.
   For 1981, the yearbook listed 232 AM or FM radio stations
playing the gamut of popular music of past decades: ``oldies,
golden oldies, nostalgia, classic rock, old gold, solid gold, and
classic rock.''
   That number had grown to 464 by 1986, and members of the
yearbook staff at the main office of Broadcasting magazine in
Washington said recently the 1988 yearbook will list 537 of the
country's 10,219 stations as playing oldies.
   There are indications most are doing well in a highly
competitive business.
   Figures at Arbitron Ratings, the service that keeps tabs on the
nation's listening habits, show that in many large markets oldies
stations are among the top 10 draws.
   There is no clear-cut explanation for classic rock's popularity,
but many in the industry believe millions of baby boomers prefer
the music they grew up with.
   ``I think it really comes down to the music,'' said WODS program
director Dave VanDyke, whose Boston station went on air last
October with its ``oldies'' format. ``For the adults of today, the
music that's being released just doesn't do a thing for them, but
teen-agers (also) are desiring this kind of music more than what's
being recorded today.''
   In New York, Joe McCoy, program director at WCBS-FM, said his
station's ``oldie'' format transcended the generations.
   ``This is the stuff parents grew up on, this is the stuff they
were weaned on, so they're translating it to the kids today,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   In Hartford, Conn., where WDRC-FM plays ``solid gold rock 'n'
roll'' with emphasis on music between 1964-1975, the station's
program director, Frank Holler, agreed the oldies had appeal for
young adults.
   But Holler, himself a baby boomer at 39, was most eloquent when
describing the meaning of WDRC's music to others of his age.
   He spoke on the telephone to a background of Peter and Gordon's
``World Without Love.''
   ``The people love it, it reminds them of a very special time of
their lives,'' said Holler of his station's music. ``There is a
familiarity that both men and women are immediately comfortable
with, and it has not been played to such excess within the last 15
years as to be burned out.''
   ``I think as long as the baby boom generation is alive with
disposable income that the advertisers are looking to reach, the
music of the '50s, '60s and '70s is going to continue to be
popular,'' he said.
   Garry Guthrie, whose Edinborough Rand Inc. advises stations on
formats, agreed that ``there is considerable advertiser interest''
in baby boomers.
   ``Most of them are in the $35,000-plus range,'' he said, in a
telephone interview from Scottsdale, Ariz. ``You are giving ...
(advertisers) a large block of people with discretionary income who
want to be on top of trends, who are willing to buy durable goods.''
   Guthrie said he has overseen about 12 station changes to classic
rock formats since he set up business in October 1985, and ``we
have yet to have any failures.''

   From the sweaty cities on the
Amazon to the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, revelers Saturday shed
their inhibitions, sobriety and clothing for the first day of
Carnival.
   Banks, stores and government offices closed down for the four
days of drinking, dancing and abandon. They will re-open Ash
Wednesday, Feb. 17.
   In Rio, the festival was kicked off in the morning when Mayor
Saturnino Braga handed over the keys of the city to a jolly and fat
King Momo, Carnival's symbolic sovereign.
   The city ball late Saturday was the first of the official
all-night parties.
   Late Friday, poorer Brazilians hailed in the pre-Lent festival
as they beat out Samba rhythms on homemade instruments and danced
beneath pouring rain.
   Wealthier Rio dwellers headed for a lavish celebrity-studded
ball atop Sugar Loaf Mountain.
   And after 10 days of torrential rains and mudslides that have
left 198 dead and more than 11,000 homeless around the state, the
sun briefly put in an appearance, buoying spirits.
   Elsewhere around the world, festivals got under way in Spain,
Portugal, Trinidad, Peru and other predominantly Roman Catholic
countries celebrating one last fling before marking Jesus' fasting
in the wilderness.
   Radio Trinidad predicted Saturday that up to 3 million people
will take part in the festival starting Saturday night and ending
midnight Tuesday.
   Parades, calypso, king and queen contests, and 13 steel bands
were expected Saturday night at Queens Park in Port-of-Spain, the
capital.
   Haiti was also planning its first Carnival since
President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into French exile Feb.
7, 1986.
   With the election of Leslie Manigat on Jan. 17, Carnival started
up again but on a small scale _ nothing like days of old when
Port-au-Prince used to rock with the rhythms of Haitian meringue.
   Portugal imported Brazilian rhythm to its Carnival celebrations
with samba-style processions planned in several cities.
   Even the uncrowned monarchs of the Portuguese Carnival were
Brazilian: Regina Duarte and Lima Duarte, two stars of the
immensely popular television soap opera ``Roque Santeiro.''
   Carnival processions in Portugal feature floats, often poking
fun at prominent political figures, and horseplay amongst the
crowds who throw flour bombs, soak each other with squirt guns and
shower the streets with confetti and streamers.
   But gamblers planning on a holiday spree in Lisbon were
disappointed. Workers in Portugal's gambling casinos began a strike
Saturday over government plans to tax their tips.
   Carnival in Spain was banned during the 36 years of the Franco
regime. It returned after his death Nov. 20, 1975, but with scant
following.
   The most important carnival in Spain is that in Tenerife, in the
Canary islands, which began Friday with colourful parades.
   In Madrid the celebration began Saturday with a parade of floats
and costumed revellers through main streets.
   In Peru, celebrations have declined over the past half century.
Carnival today is mainly observed by children, who splash water on
each other or throw water balloons from windows and rooftops at
pedestrians and vehicles passing below.
   But in Brazil, Carnival is serious fun.
   Along Rio's famous Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, Brazilians
and visitors from around the world danced to the contagious music
of impromptu samba bands.
   And for the more professionally inclined, Rio offered up its
``samba school'' parades during which neighborhood groups _ wearing
skimpy bikinis or ornate feather and sequin costumes _ compete for
such prizes as best rhythm, costumes, music and theme.
   Seats in choice locations were sold for $58,000 a dozen,
according to local newspapers.
   With inflation running at 16 percent per month, the foreign debt
at $114 billion and Brazilians poorer than ever, the dance themes
were expected to be particularly political.
   The first group to samba was to represent the theme, ``And now
what Jose?'' a reference to Jose Sarney, Brazil's first civilian
leader after 21 years of military rule. Sarney took office two
years ago but still hasn't been able to put the economy in order
and is under pressure to step down.
   The second dance was to explore racism in this mixed-race
country of 141 million. Slavery was abolished in Brazil 100 years
ago.
   But in Petropolis, a nearby mountain resort about 40 miles
northwest of Rio, the festival was called off after mudslides
buried at least 65 people beneath there homes during 10 days of
rain. On Saturday, rescue workers continued the search through
thick, foul-smelling mud for victims.
   In two other low-lying slum suburb towns near Rio, where floods
turned whole regions into lakes, Carnival festivities were also
canceled.
   About 10,000 Brazilians and tourists were stranded by an airline
pilot's strike that began early Friday.

<HEAD>President Rejects Goria's Resignation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The president of Italy on Saturday rejected the
resignation of Giovanni Goria and told him to stay on as premier to
get the country's 1988 budget approved.
   President Francesco Cossiga summoned the Christian Democrat
politician to the presidential palace to inform him of his decision.
   A statement from the presidential palace said Goria was asked to
return because his presence was an absolute necessity to pass the
national budget. The deadline for parliamentary approval of the
budget is April 30.
   Goria said in a statement that he accepted the decision because
he understood ``the difficulties of the moment and the call to a
sense of responsibility that everyone of us must have.''
   Goria's resignation Wednesday marked the second time he had done
so since November. When he resigned last week, he cited factional
fighting within his own Christian Democrat party and accused party
dissidents of demonstrating a lack of responsibility.
   He met later Saturday night with Senate President Giovanni
Spadolini and Nilde Iotti, the Communist speaker of the Chamber of
Deputies, to tell them Cossiga's decision.
   Just before he met Iotti, one Italian jounalist told him
``Welcome back.'' Goria quipped: ``Never left.''
   Cossiga's other options included appointing a new
premier-designate to try to form a new coalition government or
dissolving Parliament and calling early general elections.
   Goria, at 44, is Italy's youngest ever premier. He resigned
after a series of defeats on secret votes on the budget convinced
him he could no longer govern. At the time, Cossiga asked him to
remain in a caretaker capacity until the decision on a new
government could be made.
   While Cossiga's decision at least temporarily resurrects Italy's
47th postwar government, it does not resolve the problems within
the governing coalition that led to the collapse.
   Even before the decision was announced, Goria's reappointment
for the approval of the budget had emerged as the principal
short-term solution.
   ``This would allow us to move on to the next phase in a less
convulsive way,'' said Arnaldo Forlani, a top Christian Democrat.
   Cossiga opted to reject Goria's resignation after consultations
with leaders of the five parties in the coalition. Only the
opposition Communist Party sharply opposed the idea to reinstate
him.
   The plan was supported by Goria's dominant Christian Democrats
and the Socialists, the second largest party in the coalition,
which also included Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals.
   In fact, the Socialists have warned that unless Goria was
reappointed, the country might be forced to hold early elections.
   Goria took office 6{ months ago. But from the start, his ability
to hold the fragile coalition together has been in doubt.
   He resigned once before, in November, in a budget dispute with
the tiny Liberal party. But he was convinced by Cossiga to withdraw
his resignation and continue as premier.
   Goria's recent losses in the secret votes in the Chamber of
Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, were due in part to
factional fighting within his own party.
   Analysts suggest some Christian Democrats are trying to
undermine Goria to make party secretary Ciriaco De Mita the prime
minister.
   The leadership of the long-dominant party is considered by many
the most powerful post in Italy and some party insiders would like
to move De Mita out of the post at the party congress in April by
making him premier.
   Other members of the party reportedly have voted against Goria
secretly because they want to give Foreign Minister Giulio
Andreotti the premiership for a sixth time.

<HEAD>Funeral For Two Homeless Conducted At City Hall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the homeless bore the plain,
wooden caskets of a man and woman to a Pennsylvania Avenue plaza
across from city hall on Saturday and prayed for a world where
people ``do not die in the cold.''
   Bundled against sub-freezing temperatures and a bitter wind,
about 40 activists conducted a funeral service dubbed ``tasteless''
by city officials, a day after the authorities lost a legal fight
for custody of the corpses.
   Mitch Snyder, leader of the Community for Creative Non-Violence,
said the public service, prior to cremation of the bodies, was
designed to call attention to the deaths of 10 homeless people this
winter on the streets of the capital. The city says 13 people have
died of hypothermia, seven of them homeless.
   Snyder's group said prayers for Henry Dixon, found dead of
hypothermia Jan. 2 at a parking attendant's booth three blocks from
the funeral site, and for an unidentified woman who died Jan. 7.
   The Rev. William Wendt, holding his left hand on the casket of
the woman called ``Jane Doe'' read the names of the dead as those
surrounding him cried out ``Forgive us'' after each name.
   ``Let us pray for ourselves who are tested by their deaths,''
Wendt said. ``May God grant us, and others too, new courage to face
life and do something about it ... This world should be a place
where people have a home and do not die in the cold.''
   CCNV says it has picked up from the city morgue the remains of
about 40 people in the last eight years who have died of
hypothermia and whose families have not come forward to claim the
bodies. The city had agreed in the past to turn the bodies over to
CCNV in the group's capacity as a ``friend'' of the homeless. The
group has preserved the ashes of each victim.
   Jerome Woods, director the Department of Human Services, ordered
the two bodies held this week, however, citing a city law that
allows the government to withhold the remains if they are to be
used in a ``tasteless'' way.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the bodies
released Friday, saying CCNV's plans for a service on Pennsylvania
Avenue were no different, in principle, than the public funeral
corteges of President Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``I can't believe we had a tug-of-war over this,'' said Snyder,
wrapped in a blanket against the cold winds. ``The city doesn't
care about these people when they're alive, and all of a sudden
they care when they're dead.''
   CCNV members said the city has ignored a city law passed last
month requiring public buildings to be opened to the homeless when
the temperature falls below 25 degrees.
   City officials countered that an elementary school was opened to
the homeless, but wasn't fully utilized by them.

<TEXT>
   Three suspects were in jail and President
Amin Gemayel resumed his travels Saturday, one day after avoiding
an assassination attempt when a bomb was found planted in his
jetliner.
   A police spokesman identified the suspects only as Lebanese
airport employees and said they were being held in solitary
confinement pending completion of an investigation.
   A 1-pound charge of TNT found under a pilot's seat of the Middle
East Airlines Boeing 707 jetline that was to leave for Larnaca,
Cyprus, on Friday to carry Gemayel to San'a, North Yemen. The bomb
was defused by explosives experts at Beirut airport.
   Gemayel was assigned another aircraft and arrived Saturday in
North Yemen, where he was greeted by North Yemeni leader, Col. Ali
Abdullah Saleh. The two presidents are to discuss Lebanon and other
Arab issues.
   Gemayel, 44, usually travels by military helicopter from the
Christian heartland northeast of Beirut to Larnaca and flies from
there to world capitals.
   The Maronite Catholic has not used Beirut airport in the city's
Moslem sector since 1984, when Moslem and leftist militias wrested
control of west Beirut from the regular Lebanese army.
   Beirut airport, surrounded by Shiite Moslem slums, is controlled
by Syrian troops who were deployed in the capital's Western sector
almost a year ago in an effort to end three years of militia
anarchy.
   The police spokesman said the explosive charge was equipped with
a sophisticated pressure fuse that would have detonated it when the
plane reached an altitude of 30,000 feet.
   ``It was obviously an attempt to kill the president,'' the
spokesman added.
   Lebanon has been plagued by assassinations, car bombings and
kidnappings since its Moslem-Christian civil war broke out in 1975.
The conflict has claimed more than 130,000 lives.

   Reading, writing and arithmetic will join politics
this week as Communist Party leaders meet to reform the country's
vast public education system and clarify the futures of two fallen
proteges of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The 300-plus-member party Central Committee will convene in
plenary session at a time when, as the Soviet magazine New Times
recently put it, ``everyone seems dissatisfied with the present
education system.''
   Gorbachev, the party's general secretary since March 1985, has
repeatedly urged improvements in education as part of his drive for
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, of society.
   Education, the 56-year-old Soviet leader has said, is key to
improving Soviet technology and management and to making the
country more competitive on world markets.
   Changes made by the Central Committee in the country's public
education apparatus could have sweeping consequences for a large
part of the Soviet population.There are 40 million students and 3
million teachers in the Soviet Union, the official Tass news agency
reported recently.
   The date of the Central Committee meeting has not been
officially announced, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said it would be held sometime this week.
   The ruling Politburo, which directs the party's work between
plenary sessions of the Central Committee, discussed education at a
closed-door meeting on Feb. 4, but no details have been released.
   The Central Committee is officially the party's policy-making
body, and is composed of top national officials, local party bosses
and Communists from the armed forces, government ministries,
industry and agriculture.
   By party rules, it is the sole body empowered to make changes in
the Politburo, and this week's session could see some changes in
the ruling 13-member body.
   At the Central Committee's last plenum on Oct. 21, Gorbachev
protege Boris N. Yeltsin strongly criticized style of leadership
and said the pace of reform was too slow. Yeltsin, 57, was removed
as Moscow party leader on Nov. 11. A week later he was given
another job _ first deputy director of the state construction
committee, which made him a government official with the rank of
minister.
   Yeltsin was stripped of two lesser positions in the Moscow city
government on Nov. 14. Recent press articles have mentioned him
without referring to his position as a non-voting Politburo member.
   This could indicate the Central Committee will formally strip
Yeltsin of his Politburo post.
   Another fallen Gorbachev ally and candidate Politburo member,
Nikolai V. Talyzin, is also in the spotlight. Talyzin, 59, was made
head of the State Planning Committee in October 1985, but last
June, Gorbachev criticized him by name.
   The next blow came Feb. 6, when Tass announced that Talyzin had
been relieved of his planning job and made chairman of the obscure
Social Development Bureau. The Central Committee now may sack
Talyzin from his non-voting post on the Politburo.
   The committee could name immediate replacements for Yeltsin and
Talyzin and add another voting Politburo member.
   At its October session, the committee dropped Politburo member
Geidar A. Aliev, 54, who oversaw light industry and public
transport and was the last man to rise to the ruling body under the
patronage of President Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   Aside from personnel changes, the Central Committee may set the
agenda for the first nationwide conference of local Communist Party
leaders to be held since the Stalin era. Gorbachev has said the
topics of the conference, to be held in June, will include
electoral and judicial reforms.
   The last party conference was held in February 1941. A party
conference can be held between party congresses, which take place
every five years, and Western observers believe Gorbachev will use
the occasion to put his stamp even more firmly on the party's top
bureaus.
   From a Western perspective, Soviet education appears extremely
rigid, with the curriculum for the country's schools set by a
central ministry in Moscow and little variation allowed at local
schools. In the classroom, pupils are taught largely by the rote
method and conformity is stressed.
   ``They are discouraged from studying independently, educating
themselves and developing self-reliance,'' New Times quoted Soviet
educator Victor Tomashkevich as saying.
   In the past, Soviet officials stressed the nation's 99 percent
literacy rate and the state's payment of all education costs for
citizens. Soviet education in the basic sciences and mathematics is
regarded in the West as strong.
   It is not known exactly what changes the Central Committee might
make in the educational system, but some of the ideas that have
been floated in the press include more flexibility in determining
the curricula and teaching method at the local level, increasing
teachers' salaries and reducing class size.
   One key to the country's technological advancement, computer
training, has already been made part of the basic education
program, but computers and qualified teachers are scarce, Soviet
officials acknowledge.
   The Central Committee also could mandate changes in the Academy
of Pedagogical Sciences, which is in charge of training teachers.
   The youth newspape Komsomolskaya Pravda lashed out at the
academy on Feb. 2, saying it has turned into ``social security for
retired ministers, directors and other non-functioning
functionaries of education.''

   Mozambique rebels said Saturday they
attacked and occupied army barracks 15 miles from the South African
border and killed an undisclosed number of soldiers.
   The Mozambique National Resistance said it attacked the barracks
in Moamba on Tuesday and ``destroyed three battalions of the 2nd
brigade'' of the Mozambique army. Moamba is about 30 miles
northwest of the capital, Maputo.
   A rebel statement distributed in Lisbon said the survivors of
the attack fled toward South Africa.
   The statement also denied any responsibility for reported
massacres of civilians over the past 15 days.
   The rebels, also known as RENAMO, have been fighting since 1977
to topple Mozambique's Marxist government.

   A Chinese railroad worker was sentenced to life

that killed 34 people, China's official news agency reported.
   Guo Zhongqi was found guilty of illegally carrying flammable
paint onto the train, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
   It said Guo dropped a lighted cigarette onto some paper that had
been used to wipe some spilled paint from the container, causing
the fire to break out.
   The Jan. 7 fire killed 34 people and injured 30 others and
damaged two cars on the train, which was traveling between Canton
and Xian, the report said.
   The news agency, monitored in Tokyo, said the Intermediate
Railway Transport Court of the Guangzhou Railway Administration
also sentenced another worker, Nie Chunhua, to three years in
prison for providing Guo with the paint.

<TEXT>
   The weekend takeover of a University of
Massachusetts building by black students protesting campus racism
is the latest in a series of incidents at the school in recent
years.
   Minority students say school administrators have contributed to
the problem by being insensitive to their concerns and by moving
slowly in implementing recommendations made in a stinging 1987
report that said the school has acted superficially and
sporadically to deal with racism.
   The most-publicized incident on campus was a fight between white
and black students following the New York Mets' victory over the
Boston Red Sox in the final game of the 1986 World Series.
   In 1984, a black UMass senior who was arrested and jailed for
two days before being cleared of setting a string of campus fires
complained that her arrest was motivated by ``impermissible racial
considerations.''
   Last year the university disciplined six white students who
admitted chasing and beating a black student after the World Series
game. They pleaded no contest to assault charges.
   It was the report ordered after that incident that lambasted
UMass for not intervening to stem an apparent surge in racial
tensions.
   ``The administration's historical denial of racial problems
caused not only the failure to predict and prevent the incident,
but also caused black student, faculty and staff discontent with
its conduct of the subsequent investigation, a discontent which was
exacerbated by a perception that the quality of campus life for
minorities at UMass is generally declining,'' the report said.
   It called for the hiring more minority faculty and
administrators and urged anti-racism education for administrators.
Blacks constitute 7 percent of the school's 18,000 undergraduates,
and only 38 of 1,464 UMass professors are black.
   UMass officials vowed when the report was released five months
ago to work harder to improve race relations on campus. But
students interviewed in the past week following two recent
incidents say little has changed.
   ``Racism comes from inside,'' said Matt Bigg, black affairs
editor at a student newspaper. ``I can't express how much it hurts
when a person hates you for something you can't help being. It's a
dull pain that never goes away.''

   Republican presidential candiate Pat
Robertson has canceled interviews and ducked questions when asked
to back up anecdotes he's told, including one about a woman who
caught AIDS by kissing her impotent husband, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   The Concord Monitor said the former television evangelist also
has failed to document assertions he knows a little girl in
Pittsburgh whose reading level soared from second to seventh grade
in 20 days under a money-saving program to improve reading skills.
   The newspaper said it has asked Robertson and his staff for
documentation, but details have not been produced and interviews
have been canceled.
   The newspaper said it asked for details after an AIDS expert,
concerned with Robertson's remarks, said acquired immune deficiency
syndrome is spread through sex, blood or needles and mother to
infant.
   Robertson said Saturday the story about the woman catching AIDS
``was a news story gathered by our news department.''
   ``It was strictly off the wire reports but was gathered when we
did a series on my television program dealing with this subject,''
Robertson said.
   Robertson's staff has not identified the girl whom the candidate
has cited as an example of an inexpensive method of improving
children's reading skills, the Monitor said.
   All of the stories are ``verifiable,'' Robertson said. ``We gave
them the names of who to check. Every one of them is true.''
   ``Three weeks ago, the Monitor asked for documentation of the
AIDS case, the account of the little girl and two other anecdotes
Robertson has used in interviews,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Aides offered names of people they believed could substantiate
two of the anecdotes; at best, their comments offered partial
support. In the other two instances, the staff provided no
documentation, and people contacted by the Monitor said the stories
were unlikely.
   ``Initially, staff members said they would respond to the
Monitor's request for documentation. Last week, they recommended
asking Robertson himself. Campaign aides arranged two interviews
this week; both were canceled.
   ``Stopped in an elevator in the Statehouse on Thursday,
Robertson said, `I haven't got time for that, really. That's
background.'
   ``Robertson missed a third interview, by telephone, arranged by
his staff for later Thursday night,'' the newspaper said.
   The newspaper said that Friday, Marc Nuttle, Robertson's
campaign manager, said the examples were taken from segments of the
700 Club, a program on Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network,
but he did not know how producers who worked on the stories could
be reached.
   Regarding AIDS by a kiss, the Monitor quoted Robertson at from a
December news conference: ``I know one man who was impotent who
gave AIDS to his wife and the only thing they did was kiss.''
   ``In an earlier interview with the Monitor, Robertson said that
if a person is `in a room with 25 people with AIDS and they're
breathing various things into the atmosphere, the chance of
somebody catching it has become quite strong,' '' the newspaper
said.
   The Monitor said Scott Hatch, a spokesman for Robertson, said
that information was taken from a British medical report, ``which
he said he sent to the Monitor by overnight mail about a week ago.
It did not arrive.''

   President Kurt Waldheim was quoted Sunday
as saying he will not resign because a ``great'' and ``silent''
majority supports him despite the furor over his World War II
conduct.
   ``I feel the group who makes the demand that I should resign is
relatively small compared to those who want me to stay in office,''
the president said in an interview published in the tabloid Kurier.
   On Saturday, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky launched his harshest
criticism yet of Waldheim when he said that mere non-involvement in
war crimes did not qualify one to be president of Austria.
   A top government official disclosed meanwhile that a majority in
the Socialist Party, which is governing Austria with Waldheim's
conservative backers, wants the president to resign.
   Vranitzky, a Socialist and head of government, spoke in a radio
interview about Waldheim, whose duties as head of state are mostly
ceremonial. He criticized the president's conduct throughout the
international debate about his wartime past.
   Without mentioning names, Vranitzky berated Waldheim and his
conservative backers for accepting word from six military
historians who said they found no evidence Waldheim was involved in
war crimes, but dismissing the rest of their report.
   The 202-page document, presented on Monday, established
Waldheim's ``close proximity'' to wartime atrocities in the Balkans
and seriously questioned his moral integrity as a German army
officer during World War II.
   Last year, the U.S. Justice Department barred Waldheim from the
country as an undesirable alien and said his unit sent thousands of
Jews to Nazi death camps.
   Vranitzky told Austrian radio: ``After all, nobody has ever
conducted an election campaign by saying: `Please vote for me
because I am not a war criminal.'
   ``The federal president will certainly continue to be confronted
with a series of questions and will have to face up to them.''
   In the Kurier interview, Waldheim said: ``I do not at all share
the opinion of the historians' commission'' that he had kept silent
about or belittled his wartime activities.
   ``I was also ... of the opinion that it did not belong in the
framework of this task (of the commission) to make such assumptions
and interpretations.
   ``After all the surveys I am rather convinced that the great
majority, which is very often the silent one, wants me to stay
on,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Waldheim was in Innsbruck Saturday with Jordanian King Hussein
and Queen Noor in his first public appearance since the
commission's report was released.
   The president was greeted by about 50 whistling protesters who
called for his resignation and threw eggs at waiting limousines.
   Waldheim was scheduled to address the nation in a five-minute
television appearance Monday night.
   In West Germany, Der Spiegel magazine said Saturday that a
document linking Waldheim to the deportations of thousands of
civilians during World War II was a fake and apologized for
publishing it.
   ``Spiegel regrets that it presented this ... document to its
readers as `the proof' (of Waldheim's involvement),'' the magazine
said in its latest edition.
   Spiegel said Bernhard Haas, a document expert from Stuttgart,
concluded that the military telegram was ``in all likelihood'' a
fake.
   The telegram allegedly linked Waldheim to the deportation of
more than 4,000 civilians while he served as an officer in the
German army in Yugoslavia in 1942.
   The document was not used by the commission investigating the
president.
   Heinrich Keller, a chief secretary in the Socialist Party,
reported that for the first time a majority of party members want
Waldheim to resign.
   Keller, who was also interviewed by Austrian radio, said he saw
``a turnaround'' in rank-and-file sentiment in the wake of the
commission's report.
   The Socialists are senior partners in the coalition government
with the conservatives.
   At the Socialist Party congress last October, a majority of 198
delegates voted against a resolution calling for Waldheim's
resignation, while 101 supported the motion. There were 276
abstentions.
   ``I would believe that such a vote today would have rather the
reverse outcome,'' Keller said.

   A county judge, hoping to cash in on the
marriage business, is leading a wedding march from the courthouse
to his own back door.
   Liberty County Court-at-Law Judge L.J. ``Boots'' Krueger built a
tiny, white-steepled chapel _ he calls it ``The Chapel of Love'' _
next to his house; six couples will be married there Sunday on
Valentine's Day.
   ``My chapel is unique. People like the rural setting, and the
chapel gives a little more dignity to the wedding,'' he said.
``It's better than a judge's chambers.''
   On a trip to Wisconsin, he photographed a quaint chapel nestled
in the woods. He then paid $6,000 to have it duplicated on his
50-acre ranch just north of here.

   Secretary of State Ken Hechler, a
lifelong bachelor, remembers the most successful love letter he
ever wrote. Only it was for someone else.
   It was during World War II, and one of Hechler's army buddies
was about to lose his girlfriend to another suitor. Sensing that
Hechler had a way with words, the soldier hired him _ for $1 _ to
write a letter to win her back.
   ``I really poured out my heart,'' Hechler recalled last week.
``I wrote the most persuasive love letter I could dream up. I had a
lot of Shakespeare and Browning and other literary allusions in
it.''
   The soldier, more than satisified with the results, copied it in
his own hand and sent it off to his straying girlfriend.
   ``About 10 days later he came up to me very distraught and
waving the letter from the girl and he said, `What am I going to do
now? She says she's coming down and wants to get married this
weekend!''
   But Hechler had a response to that, too.
   ``The dollar just covered the letter, not the consequences,''
Hechler said he told his friend.

   Cupids, hearts and faces of young lovers
peer from the neatly kept scrapbooks of Eileen Williams, whose
valentine collection includes cards dating to 1857.
   ``We had to use this one again on account of the Depression,''
someone named John scribbled in pencil to his sweetheart on the
back of a 1932 valentine.
   Cards with moveable parts, pop-up cards, shaped like fans,
adorned with flowers and birds from England and Germany and cards
from the high-lace heyday of valentine-giving are among the more
than 1,000 cards Mrs. Williams plans to pass on to her children.
   ``I enjoy the beauty of the old ones. They're so much more
sentimental than the ones of today,'' said Mrs. Williams, who
started the collection in 1970. ``They had more of a loving touch
to them. Those are the ones I really wanted to collect.''

   Several Chicago Bears coaches and players
donated items for a Valentine's Day auction to raise money for a
young frostbite victim whose lower legs were amputated.
   Ed Jacobson, president and owner of the Chicago-area Edwardo's
Natural Pizza chain, will sponsor a 12-hour-long, silent auction on
Sunday.
   Autographed photographs donated by Bears' Coach Mike Ditka,
quarterback Jim McMahon and linebacker Mike Singletary are among
items that will be sold to the highest bidder.
   A basketball signed by Chicago Bulls guard Michael Jordan and a
hockey stick signed by Chicago Blackhawks player Troy Murray the
NHL also will be auctioned.
   The auction is the latest of many fund-raising events to help
Darlwin Carlisle, 9, found in the attic apartment of an abandoned
Gary house by a construction worker on Jan. 17.
   Surgeons at Wyler Children's Hospital in Chicago had to amputate
the child's lower legs, which had been severely frostbitten.

   Love may be blind, but it need not be
unenlightened, according to a new book being published on
Valentine's Day.
   In ``The Psychology of Love,'' 22 psychologists write on
subjects such as styles of love, ways to maintain relationships,
the components of love and possible evolutionary origins of love
behavior.
   ``It's not as if there is any one right kind (of love),'' the
book's co-editor, Robert J. Sternberg, a Yale professor of
psychology, said. ``It's more that you sort of find something that
is right for you.''
   Sternberg said the book may help a reader figure out what is
right in love for him or her; its contributors are regarded as
strong researchers and theorists, he said.
   Sternberg said he and co-editor Michael L. Barnes, a Yale
graduate student of psychology, wanted the book to be of scholarly
interest, although lay readers may find some chapters easy to
comprehend.

<HEAD>Leon Goossens, Famed Oboist, Dies at 90</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leon Goossens, a pioneering oboist who redefined
the instrument's potential and inspired composers to write music to
showcase it, has died at age 90, his family said Saturday.
   Goossens died Friday night at Nuffield Hospital in Tunbridge
Wells, Kent, after a long illness.
   Funeral arrangement still were pending, said his son-in-law,
Raymond Cooke.
   The Liverpool native was the son of conductor Eugene Goossens.
He began studying the oboe when he was 10 years old, and at 16 was
offered a place with the Queens Hall Orchestra by Sir Henry Wood.
   By the next year he was principal oboist and had already begun
to redefine the oboe's role as an orchestral instrument.
   Goossens was part of a family rich in musical talent. He is
survived by his two sisters, both harpists, Marie, 93, and Sidonie,
87, who was principal harpist with the British Broadcastng Corp.
Symphony Orchestra for 50 years.
   Goossens joined the Liverpool Orchestra, which paid him 22 cents
a night, plus an extra 9 cents for tackling the cor anglais solo in
Rossini's ``William Tell Overture.''
   He played with some of the finest orchestras of the day and by
1927, after joining Sir Thomas Beecham at the London Philharmonic,
he became a soloist.
   His playing inspired many original works for the oboe. Among the
composers who dedicated works to him were Benjamin Britten, Francis
Poulenc and Sir Edward Elgar, whose 1934 Soliloquy for Oboe and
Strings, one of his last works, was composed in honor of his friend
Goossens.
   The oboist was made a Commander of the Order of the British
Empire in 1950 and received the Cobbett Medal for services to
Chamber Music in 1954. He toured the world until 1962, when a
serious car crash temporarily halted his career.
   Goossens played and recorded for many top orchestras and bands,
including Jack Hylton's jazz orchestra at London's plush Kit Kat
Club.
   His other interest was sailing, and he was a stalwart of the
London Corinthian Sailing Club.
   Goossens' wife of 52 years, the former Leslie Burrows, died in
1985.
   ``He was the finest woodwind instrumentalist this country has
ever produced,'' said James Brown, 58, oboist with the English
Chamber Orchestra. ``He was a great influence not only on myself,
but on woodwind playing in general.''
   Celebrated clarinetist Jack Brymer, 73, said Goossens ``did more
for the development of woodwind playing throughout the world than
any other person. When I became a professional musician, I became
friends with him, and he was not only a great musician, but a
humorous and pleasant individual.
   ``He opted out of the orchestral world at a fairly early age,
but remained a great soloist almost to the end of his very long
life.''

   A man who doesn't believe in lotteries
and wouldn't spend $1 on a ticket became Florida's first $1 million
lottery winner Saturday thanks to a ticket he found on the ground.
   ``You cannot beat dumb luck,'' said Tom Sawyer, 45, after
beating six other finalists in a random drawing for the top cash
prize.
   ``If I had $5 that I was going to spend, I'd rather go to a
two-hour movie than spend a minute and a half scratching off five
tickets,'' he said.
   Sawyer found the ticket on the ground outside his paint store
and scratched off the covering to find the word ``ENTRY'' three
times. Tickets with that combination were to be mailed in for a
drawing, and in spite of Sawyer's feelings he didn't hesitate to
send it in.
   ``I send in to Publishers' Clearinghouse, for a 22-cent stamp
you always have a chance,'' he said.
   His was one of 460,000 tickets mailed in. Gov. Bob Martinez last
week picked seven out of a barrel to be on Saturday's award show.
   Sawyer called himself ``fantastically lucky,'' and said he would
use his winnings to educate his children, two whom are approaching
college age. One daughter is engaged, so he expects to pay for a
wedding soon. He said 10 percent would go to his church.
   Sawyer said he still won't support the lottery or buy a ticket.
He voted against it, and maintains those who play are the ones who
can least afford it.
   ``If you've got all your obligations taken care of and that's
how you want to handle your spendable income, that's fine,'' Sawyer
said. ``I have no problem with that. What I believe is for me, and
I'm not trying to lay that on you.''
   He said he doesn't expect the winnings to change his lifestyle
and expected to be back at work Monday, but he conceded that he
will probably have to get an unlisted telephone number.
   The game of chance began Jan. 12. The second $1 million
``Millionaire'' drawing will be held in about a month.

   For the first time in nearly three decades, the
name Henry Maier will be missing from the ballot when Milwaukee
voters choose their mayor.
   Maier, 70, has held the office since 1960, longer than any other
big city mayor in the country. But residents will see fresher faces
when the city holds its primary vote Tuesday.
   ``It has been forgotten that I said the president is too damn
old to be president at 70,'' Maier said last June when he announced
he would not seek re-election. ``And I believed that then, and I
believe that now, and I think it's true of me.''
   Former Acting Gov. Martin Schreiber and state Sen. John Norquist
are the leading contenders in the non-partisan race to fill Maier's
job.
   When asked to list his accomplishments, Maier points to the
city's revitalized downtown, the annual Summerfest, which the mayor
once called ``the Super Bowl of festivals,'' and a fiscal policy
that has given Milwaukee an AA-bond rating.
   He has cultivated a folksy image, with his public sing-alongs at
Summerfest and other events and the annual Christmas tree lighting.
   But Maier also has a feisty reputation. He has been combative
with the local press, has criticized the federal government for
cutting aid to cities, and has blamed suburbs for not sharing their
wealth and causing many of the city's problems with poverty.
   ``For the average Joe in Milwaukee ... he needs a mayor whose
image is supportive, to lean on,'' Maier said in a 1983 interview.
``He has to feel he has a champion, someone who is representing him
vigorously, willing to stand and fight.''
   But some community leaders say Maier has not done enough to help
the city's black population. Statistics released last fall by the
Milwaukee Urban League show Milwaukee is the most segregated major
metropolitan area in the country, and more than 40 percent of the
city's black children live in poverty.
   Some black leaders complain that the stability of Maier's 28
years has led to stagnation in addressing inner city issues.
   ``The city hasn't done much with what we wanted,'' said Felmers
Chaney, president of the Milwaukee chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``Maybe (Maier) did the best he could. I don't know,'' Chaney
said. ``Whoever takes his job now needs to come out with a firmer
stand.''
   Maier, however, has demonstrated support from blacks and the
population as a whole.
   He repeatedly has dismissed notions of seeking higher office at
the state capital or in Washington.
   In 1984, just before being re-elected for the last time, Maier
said, ``I have never wanted to go to Madison. I have never wanted
to go to Washington. I have never wanted to leave the soil of this
city.''

   An Australian who was sentenced to
death on heroin trafficking charges was freed after the Supreme
Court threw out the charges, Corrections Department officials said
Saturday.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Donald
Tait, 54, was released Friday and was awaiting deportation.
   Tait, of Sydney, was arrested in July 1985 on the southern
resort island of Phuket with 4.4 pounds of heroin in his suitcase,
according to police.
   He pleaded innocent to charges of possessing heroin with intent
to sell.
   A provincial court sentenced him to death in November 1985. In
January 1986, an appeals court in Bangkok overturned the verdict on
grounds of lack of evidence, and the Supreme Court upheld the
appeal.

   Some 1,500 women who spent two days discussing
how they could secure the Constitution's ``blessings of liberty''
were urged to become more active in politics and to run for
elective office.
   It was no accident that the event was sandwiched between last
week's Iowa presidential caucuses and Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary, said Linda Kurtz Hallenborg, a member of the symposium's
executive committee.
   ``This is a way to highlight the fact that we need to get more
women involved in politics,'' she said in an interview Friday. ``We
need to make it clear to the presidential candidates that we make
up 53 percent of the electorate, and women's issues need to be
taken seriously.''
   Those attending the symposium included U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; 1984 vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro; Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.; syndicated newspaper columnist Erma
Bombeck; and former New York congresswoman Bella Abzug.
   The two-day symposium on ``Women and the Constitution'' at the
Carter Presidential Center was convened by former first ladies
Rosalynn Carter and Lady Bird Johnson.
   In speeches and seminars, women who attended the event that
ended Friday heard that political power could be their best hope to
achieve equality in other fields besides politics.
   They also heard that the Constitution, as originally drawn up
200 years ago, deserved criticism as unfair to women and minorities.
   ``Our criticism of the unamended Constitution is not intended to
be divisive,'' said Mrs. King. ``Some people apparently feel that
blacks and women should join in an uncritical celebration of a
document that protected the slave trade and denied women their
democratic rights.''
   Sixty-eight years after the ratification of the 19th Amendment,
which guaranteed women the right to vote, women make up just 14
percent of the higher statewide political officeholders around the
country, according to the National Women's Political Caucus.
   There are 23 women in the U.S. House and two in the Senate. Two
women are governors of states.
   Both Ms. Ferraro and Mrs. King urged women to run for office and
continue working in other campaigns. Ms. Ferraro described a
``ripple effect'' that she discovered when her 1984 campaign
generated thousands of letters from women whom her candidacy had
inspired.
   ``It's the young woman writing after the election, `I've decided
to go to medical school because of you,''' Ms. Ferraro said. ``It's
the 7-year-old writing from her school in Minnesota, `Someday I'm
going to run for president.'
   ``If you don't run, you can't win.''
   While Ms. Ferraro spoke of a future in which women will share
equally in the political landscape, Ms. Hallenborg said the present
administration _ and a return to traditionalism by some women _ has
slowed down the women's movement.
   ``I think the Reagan presidency has been extremely detrimental
to the progress we have made,'' she said. ``Every president up to
Reagan made progress in bringing women into power.''
   The 1988 elections represent an opportunity for women to
reassert themselves at the ballot box, and the outcome could
determine whether eight years of Republican conservatism has
splintered the women's equality movement for good, Ms. Hallenborg
said.
   ``This is a clarion call that women need to rise up and be
counted in the political process,'' she said.

   Two U.S. warships collided with Soviet ships in
the Black Sea when they violated Soviet territorial waters, ignored
warnings from patrol craft and made ``dangerous maneuvers,'' a
Soviet admiral charged Saturday.
   The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Gennady I. Gerasimov,
called the Friday incident off the Crimean peninsula an American
``military provocation'' and likened it to the 1960 downing of a
U-2 spy plane that forced cancellation of a superpower summit.
   ``We hope that this will not hinder the process of improvement
in Soviet-American relations'' Gerasimov said of the warship
collisions.
   Gerasimov and Rear Adm. Nikolai P. Markov appeared at a noon
news briefing to give the first detailed Kremlin version of the
grazing of the cruiser USS Yorktown and the destroyer USS Caron by
two Soviet navy vessels.
   The Soviet Defense Ministry on Friday night accused the American
vessels of violating Soviet waters, but did not mention any
physical contact between them and Soviet ships.
   U.S. Navy officials said the Yorktown and the Caron were
deliberately bumped while exercising their right to pass through
international waters.
   But Markov and Gerasimov told reporters the U.S. warships were
knowingly violating Soviet waters, and that the collisions were
solely the fault of the American captains.
   ``If we look back at history, always when there is a tendency
toward improvement in our relations we see some military
provocation,'' Gerasimov said.
   Soviet anti-aircraft units downed the spy plane piloted by
Francis Gary Powers on May 1, 1960 near Sverdlovsk. The resulting
uproar doomed a meeting planned that year between Soviet Premier
Nikita S. Khrushchev and President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Gerasimov said U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock had been summoned to
the Foreign Ministry Saturday morning, where Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh read him a ``strong protest'' over
the Black Sea incident.
   ``The Soviet side cannot but view the actions of the United
States Navy as aimed at undermining the process of improvement in
Soviet-American relations which has appeared recently,'' Gerasimov
said, reading from the protest.
   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territorial
limit, the Soviet Union claims a 12-mile limit along its coast.
   U.S. Navy Cmdr. Richard Schiff, a lawyer, said Friday in
Washington that any country claiming a 12-mile territorial limit
``must allow for innocent passage by the ships of all nations.''
   But Markov and Gerasimov said Soviet law does not provide for
the right of innocent passage in Black Sea waters, which the
Soviets have longed claimed as their own.
   Markov referred repeatedly to ``dangerous maneuvers'' by the
U.S. warships. When asked to explain, he said the Yorktown and
Caron had been warned both before and after entering Soviet waters.
   He said the two Soviet warships, identified by Pentagon
officials as a Krivak-class frigate and a Mirka-class patrol boat,
were on a ``basically parallel course'' with the U.S. vessels when
the grazings occurred.
   The larger Krivak-class vessel brushed the left side of the
Yorktown, while the Caron was grazed on the same side by the patrol
craft, U.S. officials said.
   U.S. officials said the grazings were intentional, but Markov
said the captains of the Soviet ships ``did not have such an
intention.''
   Markov did not name the Soviet warships, but a small chart
displayed at the briefing identified them as the frigate Bezzavetny
and the patrol ship SKR-6.
   The official news agency Tass later quoted the captain of the
Bezzavetny as saying the Soviet ships came within two yards of the
American vessels when ``they demanded anew that they leave the
USSR's territorial waters.''
   ``Without receiving an answer, the Bezzavetny and the SKR-6 came
close to the U.S. warships' sides with a view to ousting them,''
the captain, Vladimir Bagdashin, was quoted as saying. ``No damage
was caused to either the Soviet or the U.S. ships.''
   Defense Department spokeswoman Susan Hansen said the two U.S.
ships have continued what she called ``routine'' operations. The
Pentagon has declined to say when the ships were to leave the Black
Sea.
   Markov said the Friday incident was the third of its kind in

   Golfer Steve Wells will take a hole-in-one
any way he can get it _ even if it means sharing the golf course
with a private plane forced to make an emergency landing.
   Wells approached the eighth hole of the Mohawk Golf Course on
Friday shortly after the two-seater plane landed. The pilot and his
passenger walked away uninjured.
   Wells and his partner, Doug Smith, were determined to finish
their game, despite the winged obstacle that remained on the
382-yard, par-4 hole. But police cordoned off the area around the
damaged plane, which put the tee box out of reach.
   Wells and Smith improvised, making their own tee box on the
other side of the plane. The next thing you know, Wells got his
second-ever hole-in-one.
   ``I hit it about as good as I could,'' Wells said.
   Emergency personnel attending to the plane witnessed the feat.
   ``Bruce Gardner, the chopper pilot for the police, is the one
who told me it went in,'' Wells said.

   The folks who live on Stamper Place want
to stamp out that name and dub their quiet, hillside cul-de-sac
Mystic View Court.
   ``The name Stamper doesn't reflect the feeling of the
neighborhood,'' said Tom Hoefel, a leader of the campaign to change
the street name. ``We just felt the street needed a pretty name.''
   The eight homeowners plan to present the issue to the City
Council on Tuesday.
   The street was named after the Rev. Larry Stamper, a Methodist
minister who was a councilman in the early 1980s when the area was
developed.
   Aside from not being pretty, the street name is sometimes
confused with nearby Stanford Road or referred to as Thumper Place,
Hoefel said.
   Council members don't oppose the change.
   ``I don't believe in naming streets after elected officials
anyway,'' said Mayor Michael Hastings, ``except maybe somebody
who's really important like (John F.) Kennedy or Gerald Ford.''

<HEAD>Scattered Snow Around Great Lakes And Mountains Of West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that had crossed much of the nation moved out of New
England on Saturday after dumping up to 2 feet of snow, and
elsewhere snow was scattered around the Great Lakes and over the
mountains of the West.
   Record lows Saturday included 12 at Greer, S.C., and 7 below
zero at Rockford, Ill.
   The storm that spread snow from Texas to Michigan in the middle
of last week trailed out of Maine during the day with wind gusting
to 30 to 40 mph and temperatures in the teens and 20s.
   Snowfall totals included 22 inches at Brattleboro, Vt.; 25
inches in the western mountains of Maine; 17 at Lewiston, Maine; 15
inches at Albany, N.Y.; 13 inches in the Catskills at East Jewett,
N.J.; and more than 2 feet in parts of southern Vermont, the
National Weather Service said.
   ``Not a record-setter, but a pretty bad one,'' said
meteorologist Art Lester in Maine.
   The storm was blamed for 23 traffic deaths: five in Arkansas;
four in Texas; three in Tennessee and Indiana; two each in New York
and Pennsylvania; and one each in Kentucky, Michigan, Vermont and
Maryland.
   Wind gusted to 35 to 40 mph across western and northern New York
state, and about an inch of snow had fallen at Rochester and
Buffalo. Six inches to a foot was possible in localized squalls,
forecasters said.
   Up to 8 inches of snow fell along the Lake Erie shore of
northeastern Ohio.
   A cold front stretching from the northern Rockies into central
California produced scattered snow showers and gusty wind. Snow was
reported across northern Utah as well as west-central and
south-central Montana. Mountain areas of Utah received 2 to 5
inches of snow with valleys getting up to an inch.
   Wind-whipped snow in Utah contributed to a collision involving
about 30 cars, a tractor-trailer rig and a horse trailer Saturday
that closed southbound Interstate 15 at Point of the Mountain for
two hours, police said.
   Wind gusts to 51 mph were recorded on the southern end of the
Great Salt Lake. In Wyoming, wind blew at 30 to 45 mph at Casper,
and a gust of 62 mph was reported near Casper Mountain.
   Snow and blowing snow advisories were posted for the northern
and central mountains of Coloradom with up to 6 inches of snow
expected.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Champaign, Ill., to 77 at El Cajon, Calif. The
early-morning low for the day was 21 degrees below zero at Hibbing,
Minn., and Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered snow showers were forecast from eastern
Wyoming through the upper third of the Mississippi Valley and upper
Great Lakes, with snow also scattered in northern Maine. Showers
and a few thunderstorms were forecast from eastern Texas into
Louisiana and Arkansas, with showers also scattered from central
and eastern Kansas into northern Missouri, across southern Ohio and
in northwestern Washington state.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were predicted from the northern
Plains across the upper Mississippi Valley and northern Great Lakes
into the upper Ohio Valley and much of New England; in the 30s from
the northern and central Rockies across the central high Plains and
lower Great Lakes into southern parts of New England; in the 60s
and 70s from central and southern California through the desert
Southwest, all of Texas except the Panhandle, the lower Mississippi
Valley and the Gulf Coast into Florida; and in the 40s or 50s
across most of the rest of the nation.

   A man shouting that the Democratic Party
was encouraging homosexuality disrupted the televised debate by
presidential candidates Saturday and was removed from the
auditorium by police and security agents.
   The man, who identified himself as Paul Morrissey of Jackson
Heights, N.Y., was ordered off the campus of St. Anselm's College,
where the debate was being held. He was not arrested.
   Morrissey disrupted the debate during its opening minutes, just
as moderator Edwin Newman addressed a question to Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis. The debate halted as the man stood shouting
and Secret Service and other officers subdued him and took him from
the building.
   Morrissey, interviewed after being released by authorities, said
he was objecting to the use of the church-supported school's
facilities for a Democratic Party function.
   ``We are fed up and outraged at the Democratic Party using
church facilities to promote their homosexual and abortion agenda _
both of which are part of the Democratic plank,'' Morrissey said.
   Asked to explain, he cited ``special privileges'' for
homosexuals included in the party's 1984 platform.
   Morrissey identified himself as chairman of Morality Action
Committee Inc. He said he did not actively support any of the
presidential candidates but would vote for Republican Pat Robertson
``if I had a chance.''
   Lt. Paul Lambert of the Goffstown Police said the man was told
to leave the campus or he would be arrested.

   Organizers of a much-delayed voyage to
Israel by Palestinian deportees said they chartered a new vessel
Saturday and would leave Monday, but some European politicians
dropped plans to go along.
   ``Really, we are going on Monday,'' said Hanna Nasser, a member
of a committee for the voyage by 130 Palestinians deported by
Israel and hundreds of journalists and observers who have gathered
in Athens.
   The ``journey of return'' is designed to focus attention on
Israel's use of deportations to punish Palestinians in the
territories it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   It was initially set to start Tuesday, was rescheduled for
Wednesday and then for Saturday.
   PLO officials said Israeli pressure led ship owners to back out
of charter deals. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel has
referred to the trip as ``an act of war.''
   Early Saturday, sources among the organizers said no contract
had been signed for a ship.
   But Fouad Al-Bittar, the PLO's diplomatic representative in
Athens, said a contract to charter a vessel was signed at midday.
   PLO officials refused to give details about the ship, citing
security concerns.
   ``I have a ship name, but I'm not going to give it to you,''
Bassam Abu Sharif, chief spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat,
told reporters.
   The new plan was announced at a 5 p.m. (10 a.m. EST) meeting set
as a deadline by European parliamentary observers for a final word
on the voyage.
   Even so, some who had planned to make the trip said they had to
back out because of the delays.
   ``I simply can't clear one more week'' on the schedule, said
Lord Christopher Mayhew of Britain.
   Others expressed fears that the latest plan might fall through.
   ``I have been told this (that the boat would sail) every day ..
. and it hasn't happened,'' said Michael Ferris, an Irish senator.
   But several other observers, including an Italian senator,
Raniero LaValle, promised to make the voyage.
   A small group of Greek and Italian leftists staged a
demonstration outside the Israeli diplomatic mission in Athens on
Saturday to protest alleged Israeli efforts to block the trip.
   Luciano Neri, a member of Italy's Proletarian Democracy Party,
chained himself to the mission fence for two hours.
   There were no arrests.
   The trip is modeled after the voyage of the Exodus, which tried
to take Jewish refugees to Palestine in 1947 but was turned back by
British authorities. Miriam Algazi, who took part in the Exodus
voyage, also planned to journey on the Palestinian ship.

   Thousands of moviegoers packed West Berlin
theaters Saturday as the 38th International Berlin Film Festival
began its first full day.
   More than 60 films were scheduled to be shown Saturday, among
them is American director Woody Allen's ``September.''
   The 11-day festival features 750 films from 48 countries.
   The festival officially was opened Friday night by Mayor
Eberhard Diepgen of West Berlin. The opening ceremonies were
followed by the showing of West German director Reinhard Hauff's
subway musical, ``Line No. 1.''
   A festival official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
many showings were sold out, including those of ``September'' and
American director Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street.''
   Twenty films are competing for Silver and Gold Bear awards.
   A host of international film and entertainment personalities are
scheduled to attend the festival, including Cher, Alec Guiness,
Richard Attenborough, Omar Sharif, Jean-Luc Godard, Chuck Berry,
and Eric Clapton.

   An airport bartender who was fired for giving a
$4.95 sandwich away to Mayor Eugene Sawyer was offered his job back
Saturday, but he said he didn't want it.
   ``I'm hoping to hear from the mayor's office in reference to a
job instead,'' Michael Bueschel said. ``But I don't want to be
pushy. I will sit back until they call me.''
   Bueschel was fired Friday from his $5-an-hour job at a Midway
Airport restaurant for giving away food without permission, manager
Guy Accettura said.
   The dismissal was rescinded Saturday.
   ``We felt there was a major misunderstanding on Mike's part and
our part. With everything involved _ it was the mayor _ we
full-heartedly invited Michael back to his position,'' Accettura
said.
   The mayor, waiting for a flight to Alabama on Thursday, gave one
of his security men $10 to buy a sandwich. The guard returned with
the money, a sandwich and a note from Bueschel, which read: ``Mr.
Mayor, Keep up the good work. Compliments of Cafe Volare.''
   Bueschel, 23, a college student, said police officers routinely
received free coffee, doughnuts and sandwiches at the airport.
   ``I figured if Chicago police officers could get a free
sandwiches, why couldn't the mayor? He's the boss,'' he said.
   ``The mayor is a fair, good man. I like the way he came into
office and took charge,'' said Bueschel.
   ``It's a big city to take care of and it seems he is keeping
things under control,'' he said.
   Sawyer heard about Bueschel's firing Friday and vowed he would
soon have a new job.
   ``I'll help him find one,'' Sawyer said at the time. ``If we
can't find one for him, I'll give him one myself.''
   Sawyer's spokesman, Monroe Anderson, could not be reached for
comment on Bueschel's comments Saturday about a job. His home phone
was unanswered.
   ``I would like to get on the fire department _ that's a real
long shot, but my dad is a fireman and I'd like to keep up the
family tradition,'' Bueschel said.

   Officials of the Boy Scouts of America have
voted to allow women in leadership positions, including
scoutmaster, ending a policy often challenged in court of providing
only male leadership, a spokesman says.
   The Boy Scouts had successfully defended legal challenges over
its policy for the past 12 years, but decided to drop the
restrictions because the court challenges had become too costly, a
spokesman said Saturday.
   David Corti, a spokesman in Dallas, cited the ``great cost to
the organization, both in terms of money and in the perception of
what we are.''
   ``We have, however, won our court cases and probably would
continue to do so,'' Corti said
   The Boy Scouts' National Executive Board voted for the change
Thursday during a meeting in Washington, D.C., said Barclay Bollas,
national news editor for the Boy Scouts. The organization is based
in Irving.
   ``Our volunteer hierarchy felt boys of this age group should
have the opportunity to be associated with male role models,''
Bollas said of the former policy.
   ``It has cost the organization millions of dollars to defend a
position that makes common sense,'' said Ron Phillippo, executive
director of the Indianhead Council, which includes eight counties
in eastern Minnesota and four in western Wisconsin.
   ``Experts are saying men must spend more time nurturing and
providing male role models for youth and Boy Scouting has provided
this in spades,'' Phillippo said.
   Women had been barred from becoming scoutmasters _ the job of
leading a Boy Scout troop, as well as assistant scoutmasters,
varsity or assistant coaches, or leaders of Webelos, the program
for the age group between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.
   But many positions already were open to women, including the job
of leading a Cub Scout troop, officials said. Of the 1.1 million
volunteers within the program nationwide, about 500,000 are women,
Bollis said.
   ``In fact, there are many instances of women serving as trainers
of scoutmasters,'' he said. ``There was never a question of the
ability of women. It was just that the Boy Scouts felt there ought
to be male role models for boys.''
   Other Boy Scouts officials agreed.
   ``I think it is important to provide men an opportunity for
nurturing. Too many institutions do not afford men that
opportunity. We feel we have that role in society,'' said Clarence
Hammett, executive director of the Viking Council, which includes
15 Minnesota counties.
   That viewpoint was supported by Judith Erickson, a consultant
for the Viking and Indianhead councils and an associate professor
at the University of Minnesota's Center for Youth Development and
Research.
   ``The value in scouting's former policy has been that it
provided boys with a nurturant male role model,'' she said. ``With
this change in policy, men must be serious about taking on the
nurturant role in this and other organizations, or this will be one
more instance of women alone developing that type of close
relationship.''
   But a 69-year-old grandmother who waged a 14-year legal battle
to become a scoutmaster said Saturday that ``we straightened out a
wrong.''
   ``I think that it is a great thing that happened and I think
it's about time, after trying hard for 14 years, to get this stupid
situation straightened out,'' said Catherine Pollard of Milford,
Conn., who fought an unsuccessful court battle over the issue.
   ``I do think that this is marvelous because there have been
women all over the United States, in fact all over the world, that
have been doing these things for the Boy Scouts because they could
not get a male leader but we could not get recognition for the
things we've done,'' she said.
   Mrs. Pollard, the mother of two boys and two girls and
grandmother to seven boys and four girls, said she has proven that
a woman can be a successful scoutmaster.
   Mrs. Pollard, who has been involved with the Boy Scouts since
1950, ran a Milford troop from October 1973 to January 1975 because
no men volunteered to lead it. Her formal application to attain
scoutmaster status was denied by the Boy Scouts in 1974 and 1976.
   ``As long as your character is good and you haven't done
anything wrong for the position you'd like to hold, I think we
should hold those positions,'' Pollard said.
   Mrs. Pollard said she plans to become scoutmaster for a new
troop, adding, ``I have some irons in the fire. I had them before
the news came out.''

<TEXT>
   Police used electric prods to break up
thousands of opposition supporters demanding ``free elections''
Saturday, the eve of an election that government leaders said
President Alfredo Stroessner will win by a landslide.
   ``We are sure the number of votes cast on Sunday for President
Stroessner and Colorado Party candidates will not be less than 80
percent of the total,'' said Sabino Montanaro, interior minister
and president of the ruling Colorado Party, during a news
conference Saturday.
   Stroessner, a 75-year-old army general, has governed since 1954,
longer than any other head of state in the Western Hemisphere.
   The government's predictions contradicted a poll by the National
Catholic University and West Germany's Friedrich Naumann Foundation
of 18,000 urban voters.
   The poll indicated 43 percent favor Colorado candidates, 31
percent said they will abstain from voting and 11.6 percent plan to
cast a blank vote. Balloting is required by law among Paraguayans
aged 18-60.
   About 1.4 million of the country's 3.7 million population are
registered for the election. Voters are to choose a president, 36
senators and 72 deputies who form the two-house Congress.
   Voting was scheduled for 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 7,192 polling
places. All sports and social events are banned during the
balloting.
   Police used electric anti-riot prods and tear gas Saturday to
break up a rally of 5,000 anti-government demonstrators in front of
the National Pantheon, which contains the remains of the country's
heroes.
   Roman Catholic radio station Radio Caritas said the
demonstrators included Domingo Laino, president of the Authentic
Radical Liberal Party _ not recognized by the government. In a
brief speech, Laino described the elections as ``a new farce and
new fraud.''
   ``But the people want freedom and we will continue making
demands in spite of the regime's savage bullies,'' said Laino, who
police had held under house arrest for two days last week.
   The radio said no one was arrested although several suffered
slight injuries.
   Colorado Party leaders meanwhile made last-minute calls for
voters in this landlocked, California-sized nation to turn out en
masse Sunday to re-elect Stroessner to an eighth straight term.
   ``It's a shame Stroessner can't be elected for life,'' said
Central Bank President Cesar Romeo Acosta at a rally in Raul
Arsenio Oviedo, 250 miles east of Asuncion. ``He represents the
greatness, the splendor, the freedom and the independence of
Paraguay.''
   Sen. Luis Maria Vega of the Liberal Party and Rep. Carlos
Ferreira Ybarra of the Radical Liberal Party are running against
Stroessner, but men admitted they have no chance of winning.
   The party winning the majority of votes takes two-thirds of the
Congressional seats. The remaining third is divided proportionally
between the two other parties.
   Stroessner seized power in a May 1954 coup that ended nearly two
decades of political chaos in Paraguay. The U.S. State Department,
in its 1987 human rights report released Wednesday, said,
``Paraguay has not had a democratic government since its
independence in 1811.''

   A newspaper reported Saturday that more than
80,000 files have been stolen from a Nazi documentation center in
Berlin.
   The Berliner Morgenpost tabloid claimed many of the missing
files from the Berlin Document Center were sold to collectors
around the world, and some were used to blackmail former Nazis.
   The report, which is to be published in the newspaper's Sunday
edition, quoted unnamed West German investigators and could not
immediately be confirmed.
   The newspaper telexed a copy of its report to other news media
in advance.
   Many of the documents contained ``secret information about
leading figures in the Third Reich,'' the newspaper said.
   The newspaper said West German investigators believe the
documents were sold for ``incredible sums.''

<HEAD>Murphy's Role Increasing With Dukakis' Absence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few politicians in Massachusetts have more
interest in the success of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' presidential
campaign than the woman who would fill his Statehouse office if he
captures the White House.
   But Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, the first woman ever to hold a
constitutional office in Massachusetts, is neither overwhelmed by
the prospect of occupying the governor's seat nor pressing for that
power.
   Murphy, 47, spent ``eight years, day and night, seven days a
week, 16 hours a day'' to get where she is today, she said in an
interview last week. ``By anybody's measure, it was a long time to
get elected.''
   But for Murphy, an economist with a Ph.D. from Duke University,
it was an investment made not so much as a stepping stone to the
governor's office one floor above her own.
   ``I looked at it as a place in which I could show people what I
could do,'' she said.
   Murphy finds herself at a moment that may be unique in the
history of the ill-defined No. 2 seat of authority in
Massachusetts' state government.
   When she campaigned for the job in 1986, she had to pitch a need
for the post as much as her ability to fill it. John Kerry, who had
defeated her in her first bid for the job in 1982, abandoned the
office after being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984. For the next
two years the office was vacant, without much concern to anyone.
   Then, shortly after she won the lieutenant governorship in 1986
on a platform of turning the office into a long-range planning arm
of state government, Dukakis launched his White House bid. Three
months into her term, Murphy found her job had taken on new
importance.
   ``When we started out, I wasn't quite clear what an acting
governor does when the governor sets out to be president,'' Murphy
said. Her role has slowly expanded as Dukakis spends more time on
the campaign trail.
   But during her first year, Murphy had her own agenda to keep.
She had her Blueprint 2000 project, a two-year series of regional
hearings, statistical analysis and predictions aimed at assessing
the commonwealth's needs into the 21st century and developing
``some very basic, simple, fundamental directions'' for the decade
ahead.
   Then there was there requests from groups across the state
wanting to get a look at the first female lieutenant governor.
   There were 1,000 requests in the first six months alone, she
said, ``and you feel an obligation to go out and speak because
people want to see what this `thing' is all about.''
   Murphy's role as Dukakis' surrogate has been eased by the
``philosophic agreement'' they achieved working together off and on

and later as his economic affairs secretary.
   Murphy compared her development as lieutenant governor to
Dukakis' as a presidential candidate.

   Democratic presidential candidates
Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt swapped charges and drew fire
from the rest of the pack Saturday in a high-voltage debate
reflecting the importance of Tuesday's lead-off New Hampshire
primary.
   Gephardt, the narrow winner in Monday night's Iowa caucuses,
apologized to Sen. Albert Gore Jr. for profane remarks made by his
campaign manager.
   But when Gephardt complained that commercials being run by Paul
Simon's campaign were ``over the line,'' he was brought up short by
Gore.
   ``What Paul Simon has done is simply to spell out the record.
And you ought to respond to the substance ... rather than taking it
personally,'' said the Tennessee senator.
   Dukakis, the runaway front-runner in the polls for next week's
primary, came out swinging with an attack on Gephardt's acceptance
of contributions from political action committees and his call for
an oil import fee. But then he was forced to field criticism from
Gary Hart and Bruce Babbitt, both men struggling for survival in
the presidential race.
   Dukakis and Gephardt were the frequent targets of barbs because
of their position in the race, the Massachusetts governor as
front-runner in the New Hampshire polls and the Missouri
congressman as victor in Iowa.
   Gore continued his assault on Gephardt after the event ended. He
told reporters his rival ``has changed an incredible list of
positions...Of course it's fair for Paul Simon to say your
positions are 180 degrees different,'' he said.
   Jesse Jackson and Gephardt engaged in an intense conversation
afterwards, with Jackson waving his finger at his campaign
competitor. Neither man would say what they were talking about.
   Jackson sought to play peacemaker during the debate as he urged
his rivals to address the issues rather than engaging in a game of
``how bruised I am.''
   It was Babbitt, the former Arizona governor, who spoke most
frankly about the importance of New Hampshire where he said voters
have the ``power of life and death over my candidacy.''
   In a bid to attract voters from the audience watching the debate
on Cable News Network, the Gore campaign aired a 30-second
commercial within a half hour of the conclusion of the event.
   The candidates exchanged barbs from the very beginning in a
reflection of the struggle for survival that the New Hampshire
primary has become. They spent only a few moments at mid-debate
criticizing the Reagan administration.
   Hart and Babbitt continually chided the top-three in Iowa for
failing to provide specific proposals, Hart complaining that
Dukakis didn't have an energy policy or a budget plan either.
``Where's the beef?'' he asked, in a reprise of the line that
Walter F. Mondale used effectively against him in the 1984 race.
   ``You don't know anything about'' putting together a budget,
replied Dukakis, who has served as governor of Massachusetts for 10
years and has said that now is not the time to deliver a detailed
federal spending plan.
   ``And what is your energy policy?'' Hart said. ``I haven't heard
a Dukakis policy yet.''
   ``That's because you haven't been campaigning,'' shot back
Dukakis. ``Gary, wait a second, if you'd been around in the long
hot summer and fall months you'd have heard about my energy
policy,'' he said in a reference to Hart's withdrawal from the race
after questions were raised about his relationship with Miami model
Donna Rice.
   Babbitt, supporter of a national sales tax to reduce the
deficit, taunted Dukakis, saying, ``Where's your budget plan?''
   Simon, locked in a battle for second place with Gephardt
according to the polls, was the first candidate to speak during the
debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters.
   He began with an attack on the Missouri congressman, complaining
that Gephardt's support of President Reagan's ax bills had led to
the huge budget and trade deficits.
   At one point Gephardt defended his own shift in positions on
several issues, noting that Simon had endorsed Republican Tom Dewey
for president in 1948 and ``now you base your campaign on Harry
Truman.''
   The 60-minute debate was interrupted at the outset by a heckler
who stood at his seat and began shouting ``When is the Democratic
party going to do something about AIDS?'' He was quickly hustled
from the hall by security officials.
   ``Where were we?'' said Dukakis as the commotion died down.
   Where they were was a Dukakis attack against Gephardt's practice
for taking PAC funds. ``You can't beat up on the establishment and
take their money,'' said Dukakis.
   ``Where are the PACs for the homeless, where are the PACs for
the working people who don't have health insurance,'' he said.
   Babbitt, who finished fifth in Iowa and places the same in New
Hampshire polls, took a shot of his own at Gephardt for being a
congressional insider but campaigning as an anti-establishment
figure. ``That's not a flip-flop; that's a triple back somersault
with a half twist,'' he said.
   The Democrats have been trading attacks and counterattacks in
speeches and television ads this week as the battle moved into the
final 72 hours.
   The sharpest exchanges came between Gephardt and Simon,
concerning a new television ad attacking Gephardt for his votes on
nuclear power, the B-1 bomber, taxes and other matters. Simon said
the ad reveals inconsistencies in Gephardt's record but the
commercial infuriated Gephardt, who demanded it be taken off the
air.
   Gephardt's apology came when Gore asked him about comments made
earlier in the week by campaign manager William Carrick disparaging
Gephardt and his staff. Gephardt first said that Carrick was sorry,
but Gore persisted and asked if he was, too.
   ``Of course Al, of course. You're my friend.''
   The League debate is the latest in the long series of
confrontations between the 1988 presidential hopefuls. By one
campaign's count, it is the 19th such debate in 1987 and 1988.

   When George Bush canceled an appearance at
the last minute, former Gov. Hugh Gregg raised a copy of Bush's
speech before the jilted audience and asked, half-heartedly, for a
show of hands from those who wanted him to read it.
   So few responded that he pocketed the papers and sat down.
   ``It's like promising your wife Arpege and giving her Vigoral,''
a vitamin tonic, Gregg said.
   But when the Arpege is spread too thin, or being applied in
other parts of the country, candidates often apply a substitute in
the form of movie stars, members of Congress, sports figures and
local heroes to draw crowds and drum up support.
   George Bush has Gov. John Sununu and Rep. Judd Gregg, son of the
former governor.
   Jack Kemp has been getting a boost in person and in television
ads from Sen. Gordon Humphrey and Rep. Robert Smith.
   Bob Dole often has Sen. Warren Rudman of Gramm-Rudman and
Iran-Contra committee fame at his side, accounting for the fourth
and final member of an all-GOP congressional delegation that has
been working overtime in advance of Tuesday's
earliest-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary.
   Rudman is so highly thought of that when Bush mentioned him
during a nationally televised debate, Dole quickly reminded the
audienc that Dole, not Bush, is Rudman's candidate.
   Kemp has brought football stars and television celebrity Chad
Everett into the state.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, though a neighbor, has
called on Boston sports stars to represent him while he campaigns
in other places.
   Early in the campaigns, surrogates are used to make phone calls
and enlist party activists who fan out to help round up the rest of
the troops.
   ``I can't say how many people will vote for George Bush because
John Sununu is supporting him, but a lot of people who are working
to see that George Bush wins the primary are working because John
Sununu asked them to,'' Bush's New Hampshire political director,
Will Abbott, said.
   ``When I do anything, I stick my fingers in the pie,'' said
Sununu, who has made phone calls, walked in parades and even
traveled to Iowa on Bush's behalf.
   Kemp's people say Humphrey and Smith are more valuable.
   ``They are true grass-roots conservatives, and it's the
conservatives who turn out for Republican primaries,'' Kemp's state
director, Paul Young, said.
   Paul Jacobson, Dole's New England press secretary, is one of
several members of Rudman's staff on leave to help Dole's
presidential effort.
   They, and Rudman, have a knowledge of New Hampshire, and access
to Rudman's campaign files.
   ``You can't transfer popularity, but you can eliminate
legwork,'' said Jacobson, adding that Rudman can be used as a
surrogate ``on almost the same level of credibility as Dole.''
   Rudman, Humphrey and Sununu have been at odds, holding news
conferences to complain about the others' candidates.
   Sununu complained that Kemp's tactics and ads have been
``stretching the fabric of the Republican Party.'' Rudman said Kemp
has been ``engaging the politics of fear and distortion ... that
could cause major rifts in the party.''
   Humphrey complained that Bush and Dole are distorting their
gun-control records.
   But they all say they will bury the hatchet when the primary is
past.
   ``This is an intramural contest. You expect some bumping and
jostling and that's good. That's healthy,'' Humphrey said.
   Sununu said, ``Those guys are my good friends.'' He said he and
the senators and congressmen ``will keep tweaking each other's
tails'' during the final days of the campaign, ``but afterward
we'll have a big party.

   The European Economic Community on
Saturday reached an agreement to end its cash crisis by limiting
farm subsidies, putting the trading bloc on course toward a bigger
role in the international economy.
   The deal also has allowed the group to step back from political
stalemate at a time when improved relations between the superpowers
have stirred new efforts by Western Europe to reassert itself on
the world stage.
   Even so, few of the European leaders who worked out the
four-point agreement were willing to predict how long the new
momentum would last.
   ``Don't get too cheerful,'' said British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who has been at the center of a series of fierce
negotiating battles to limit EEC spending since she took office in
1979.
   She and leaders of the 11 other EEC, or Common Market, countries
said the Brussels accord, while important for its new approach to
controlling farm spending, did not necessarily mean the Common
Market had seen its final budget crisis.
   Over the past decade, bickering over money has been the main
cause of stagnation in the EEC. It has retarded the organization's
development and hampered its efforts to keep up with a
fast-changing world economy.
   The financial pressure will ease now, assuming the Brussels
agreement is, as expected, ratified by the 12 national parliaments
and implemented as drafted.
   It was the first time in the EEC's 31-year history that leaders
fixed a limit to farm spending, which eats up two-thirds of the
EEC's annual budget. The agreement set a $34.4 billion limit on
farm spending in 1988, slightly higher than last year.
   The deal contains four main points:
   _ Subsidies to grain producers will, for the first time, be
legally limited. If effective, the system of production ceilings
and punitive price cuts for farmers will ease one of the EEC's
biggest farm problems.
   _ The total budget of the EEC will grow substantially by
revamping the way member countries chip in from national
treasuries. The new system will gradually make the governments'
contributions correspond more closely to their national wealth.
   _ Aid to the group's poorest members will be increase by 80
percent over five years. This serves two main purposes: to put all
the members on a more even economic footing and to help the poorer
ones cope with stiffer foreign competition once the Common Market
has completed its drive to remove all internal barriers to trade by
1992.
   _ Annual increases in overall farm spending will, for the first
time, be strictly limited. Under a new formula, each 10 percent
increase in the EEC's total economic output would allow a 7.4
percent rise in the budget.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she would approve only if EEC foreign
ministers approve additional controls on farm subsidies. That
should happen soon.
   The summit accord was reached in the early hours Saturday after
two full days of debate. Two previous EEC summits, last June and
December, had failed to bridge gaps between an austerity-minded
faction led by Britain and a West German-led group that wanted
looser spending controls.
   The previous failures had left the Common Market without a
formal budget for this year. It was due to run out of money by late
summer.
   Henning Christophersen, the EEC budget commissioner, said
Saturday that the EEC could get its 1988 budget approved by the
European Parliament by May. Leaders of the 518-member legislature,
which shares the budget writing authority with the member
governments, have given the reforms a grudging approval.
   While the immediate crisis now appears to have passed, future
harmony is not assured.
   A fundamental split remains in the member countries' views about
how far the Common Market should go in transforming itself from a
trading bloc dealing mainly with economic issues to a true
political union.
   Britain stresses the need to remove trade barriers between EEC
countries to give European business a wider ``home'' market from
which to compete on a global scale with the United States and
Japan. The Brussels accord is likely to make this goal more
attainable.
   France and other members want to keep alive the dreams of the
EEC's founding fathers: to create a single political entity, a kind
of United States of Europe in which the 12 member countries would
share common foreign, defense and economic policies.
   Reflecting this hope, Jacques Delors, the EEC's chief executive
and a former French finance minister, told reporters that the
significance of the Brussels accord went beyond the issues of
budgets and agriculture.
   ``We now have the political tool for the relaunching of the
European union,'' he said.
   Still, the EEC's track record would suggest that new progress
toward political integration will come only gradually, and only
after new, unforeseen financial crises emerge and threaten serious
setbacks.

   About 2,000 supporters of impeached Gov.
Evan Mecham turned out to sing songs, sign petitions and bash a car
symbolizing his foes with sledgehammers Saturday at a fund-raising
picnic.
   Mecham and his wife, Florence, wearing boots, blue jeans and
checked cowboy shirts with silver and turquoise bolo ties, barely
finished their meal before fans began lining up for hugs,
autographs and words of encouragement.
   There were ``Mecham For President'' T-shirts and cassette tapes
of his January 1987 inaugural address. There were leaflets and
former Mecham administration aides and an auction in which a bidder
paid $15,600 for the $20,000 car that Mecham's auto dealership had
let Mecham drive as governor.
   Mecham brought the crowd gathered at a park here to its feet
with a prediction that he would prevail despite what he said was
the unwillingness of his opponents to abide by the 1986 election
results that saw him win a three-way race on his fifth try at
governor.
   ``You know, in some countries they'd call it a coup,'' he said.
``But in this state, it's not going to work.''
   He added, ``without my threatened veto, you're going to get your
taxes increased this year unless I get back there before the
appropriations bill goes through.''
   Booths offered voters petitions to force recall elections on
Mecham's political opponents, much as the Republican governor's
foes have forced one on him for May 17 if he survives impeachment
and a criminal trial.
   Supporters flocked to a battered Chevy Chevelle with the words
``Media Bias'' ``Special Interest Groups,'' ``Hidden Government,''
and ``Selective Prosecution'' painted on it.
   For $1, they bought three whacks at their favorite target with a
sledgehammer. A stream of children and adults, some in coats and
ties, kept up a steady rain of blows until the sledgehammer broke.
   Additional hammers were found, and the battering continued.
   Tucson chef Greg Seader put huge dents in a panel labeled
``Media Bias.'' As his wife, Cheryl, took her turn, he said, ``Too
bad it wasn't a couple of reporters.''
   Don Ruzicka, chairman of a Mecham support group known as
Concerned Arizona Voters, had already taken his whacks but said
``Oh, I see what I want to hit'' and promptly ponied up another
dollar.
   ``I had a hard time choosing,'' he said. ``I'm going to have to
spend more money to hit all of them.''
   Organizers say they sold 3,000 tickets at $25 each. Actual
turnout was estimated at 2,000.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's impeachment trial is
embroiled in controversy even before it begins, with disputes over
closed state Senate meetings and whether the trial should be
delayed.
   The Senate is scheduled to begin hearing testimony Feb. 22, but
Mecham's lawyer says he wants the trial put off until after the
governor stands trial on separate criminal charges.
   Senate leaders are being criticized by the news media for having
decided to hold closed meetings periodically during the impeachment
trial. The first closed meeting was held Thursday, minutes after
the senators were sworn in as trial judges.
   Part of the confusion, according to state Sen. Greg Lunn, is
that Arizona senators aren't used to acting as judges and jurors
instead of lawmakers.
   ``We don't do this very often,'' said Lunn, who was one of the
Republican governor's earliest critics in the party. ``Certainly
impeaching a governor is an unprecedented situation in this state.
Everyone feels the burden.''
   Mecham was impeached Feb. 5 by the House on 23 separate articles
alleging that he concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, misused
$80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto
dealership and tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death
threat by a state official.
   Two-thirds of the 30 Senate votes are required to convict him. A
conviction would automatically remove him from office, and the
Senate could bar him from holding any political office in the
future.
   Mecham also faces a March 9 criminal trial on six felony charges
involving the $350,000 loan. And he faces a May 17 recall election,
in which he plans to run, probably against a number of opponents.
   Mecham's lawyer, Murray Miller, said he will file a motion this
week asking that the Senate trial be delayed until after the
criminal case, on grounds the impeachment trial could endanger
Mecham's constitutional right to a fair trial in criminal court.
   ``You know, in some countries they'd call it a coup,'' Mecham
told cheering supporters Saturday in Glendale. ``But in this state,
it's not going to work.''
   About 2,000 Mecham supporters attended the fund-raising picnic,
many paying $1 to take whacks with a sledgehammer at a battered car
labeled with the words ``Media Bias,'' ``Special Interest Groups,''
``Hidden Government'' and ``Selective Prosecution.''
   If the Senate rejects the motion to delay the impeachment trial,
Miller said, he may take the matter to court, adding that he
believes courts have jurisdiction in such cases.
   But Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, disagreed.
   ``I would be interested in finding the judge that would do
that,'' Kunasek said. ``It's called the separation of powers, I do
believe.''
   Miller said he will probably also bring a motion challenging the
``sufficiency'' of the impeachment articles, an effort to get a
Senate vote on whether the allegations in the articles of
impeachment warrant a trial.
   Miller also doesn't like the Senate's decision to hold closed
meetings.
   Majority Leader Bob Usdane, a Republican, said the meetings are
intended to permit lawmakers to consult with their lawyers, discuss
which witnesses should be called and go over questions.
   Usdane said the senators also could conduct final deliberations
behind closed doors before voting on whether to convict Mecham.
   In Thursday's meeting, senators hashed out final details on
procedural rules for the trial. The rules then were adopted on the
floor with no debate.
   Kunasek promised that the trial itself will be held in the open.
And Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat, contended the
issue was being blown out of proportion by the media, since the
final vote will be public.
   ``Each and every member will be on the verge of tears or
whatever ... because we're going to have the same traumatic
decision that was made in the House,'' Stephens said.
   Lunn said he thinks closed meetings fuel unnecessary controversy.
   ``The only issue should be whether Evan Mecham should be
impeached in light of the facts and the law,'' Lunn said. By having
closed meetings the Senate will play into Miller's hands by giving
him something to criticize, he said.
   Rep. Mark Killian, a Republican who cried during the House
impeachment vote when he bitterly criticized the governor but voted
against impeaching him, said he thought the Senate should have
closed meetings only when consulting with attorneys.
   Otherwise, Killian said, ``If he's convicted everyone will say,
`Well, they were scheming to convict the governor,' or if he's
acquitted they'll say, `They were scheming to acquit him.'''
   The trial is becoming expensive. House special counsel William
French already has been paid $200,000 to $250,000 for conducting
the investigation that led to the impeachment.
   Additional fees for French and the other House counsel, Paul
Eckstein, and for their assistants could go over $100,000, House
leaders say. The Senate has hired a lawyer, John Lundin, at $175 an
hour.
   Mecham is the 16th governor impeached in U.S. history. If he is
convicted, he will be the seventh to be removed from office by an
impeachment conviction.
   He would be succeeded by Secretary of State Rose Mofford, a
Democrat who is acting governor pending the impeachment trial's
outcome.

<HEAD>Sandinista Leader Warns Draft Opponents; 12 Rebels Reported Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-ranking Sandinista party
official threatened potential draft evaders with jail Saturday and
charged that recent anti-draft demonstrations were deliberately
organized by rightist elements.
   Also Saturday, the Defense Ministry reported that troops loyal
to the leftist Sandinista government battled Contra forces in
southeastern Nicaragua, killing 12 rebels in two firefights.
   A communique from the ministry said government troops killed 10
rebels near El Jobo, a village 174 miles southeast of the capital,
and two other rebels in Cano Dos Bocs, about 150 miles southeast of
Managua. The communique said both battles took place Friday but did
not list government casualties.
   Commander Bayardo Arce Castano, deputy coordinator of the ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front's political commission, said
evaders of the government's compulsory military service, ``will be
sent to jail, to make the boots and the uniforms of the Sandinista
soldiers.''
   Arce Castano made his comments before 1,000 young people at a
military induction ceremony in Masaya, 20 miles southeast of
Managua and the site of two days of protests against the draft.
   The ceremony was held in the Monimbo district, where anti-draft
demonstrators clashed with Sandinista Youth supporters and police
on Monday and Tuesday.
   Two persons were injured and police arrested 13, including
several opposition political leaders, during the protests.
   Arce Castano accused 14 conservative and ``pseudo-leftist''
opposition parties of attempting to weaken compliance with the
compulsory service law, which he called ``the basis of defense
against the North American aggression.''
   Noting the protests surfaced after the U.S. Congress rejected
additional military aid for the Contra rebels on Feb. 3, Arce
Castano charged opposition parties were seeking ``to give the
Reagan administration time to obtain illegal resources and other
means to continue its criminal war against our people.''
   The government estimates about 43,000 people have been killed in
the war.
   Presidents of five Central American nations signed a Central
American peace plan in Guatemala last Aug. 7. The plan calls for
amnesties, cease-fires and democratic reform to end insurgencies in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.

   Black students occupying a building at the
University of Massachusetts to protest alleged racial harassment
stockpiled food and sleeping bags Saturday and said they would stay
until their demands are met.
   Protesters refused to meet with Chancellor Joseph D. Duffey when
he went to New Africa House on Friday afternoon. On Saturday
morning, Duffey again went to the house, but was stopped on the
landing by two students who said no meeting would be held until he
met all their demands.
   Duffey said the school would take no reprisals against the
protesters. ``They're not disrupting anything, yet,'' he said.
   But he declined to outline what action might be taken if the
building is still occupied when school reopens Tuesday after the
Washington's Birthday holiday.
   ``We consider the Third World control of the New Africa House to
be a permanent one,'' said Rudy Krigger, a protester. He said
Saturday afternoon there were about 125 minority protesters still
in the building.
   The students took over the building Friday after talks with
Duffey on a list of demands, which include prosecution of five
white students accused of attacking two blacks after a dormitory
party last weekend.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, taking time from his Democratic
presidential campaign swing through New Hampshire, called the
racial incident ``intolerable behavior'' and said he discussed the
situation with Duffey and Franklyn Jenifer, chancellor of the
statewide higher education system.
   ``They know I want this kind of (racial) problem dealt with
firmly and promptly, not only at Amherst but throughout the
system,'' Dukakis said. ``They've assured me that's exactly what is
happening.''
   The students also asked Duffey to suspend a campus police
officer who they say arranged a police lineup of black men after
white and minority students complained of harassment, and called
for New Africa House be returned to use as a cultural center for
the black community.
   But Arthur Hilson, head of the campus police, denied Saturday
that any such lineup occurred, adding that it was a rumor that was
blown out of proportion.
   The New Africa House building now contains the Afro-American
Studies department in addition to other academic offices and
classrooms. About 7 percent of the school's 18,000 undergraduates
are black.
   ``This place being turned into an academic building is robbing
them of their cultural base on campus,'' said Dwayne Warren, a
senior acting as liaison between protesters and administrators.
   ``My first responsibility is education and this building is
committed to education in a range of ways,'' said Duffey. ``I'm not
about to put black, Afro-American professors out of this building.''
   The protesters, who have so far declined to talk publicly, are
not affiliated with any group and numbered 150 at the height of the
takeover Friday night.
   The protesters were allowed free access to and from the building
and no banners or other indications of the takeover were visible to
spectators.
   Within hours of receiving the demands Friday, Duffey issued a
statement condemning racism and asked campus police to no longer
use lineups.
   Two of the five white students accused in the beating were
ordered to move out of campus residence halls Friday after a
disciplinary hearing. A Feb. 24 court hearing is scheduled to
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to charge the five
students with criminal violations.
   The head of campus police met Saturday with students and black
community leaders ``to line up creature comforts'' in case of
arrests.
   ``I want to be prepared to do something in a sensitive, caring
and humane way'' said Hilson, a black Baptist minister who came to
the police department from the career planning office amid
criticism of police handling of a 1986 racial clash.
   ``I think there is a way to do it other than the ways I've seen
in the past,'' said Hilson. ``We're talking about students making a
statement, not criminals. These are students who have a belief in
what they're doing.''
   Food, money and sleeping bags had been donated to the students.
   Mark Codling-Dave, a sophomore and spokesman for the protesters,
said earlier the group had received an ``inadequate response'' to
its demands.
   The protesters cited racial tensions that have surfaced at the
school since 10 students were injured in a racial clash on Oct. 27,
1986, following the Boston Red Sox loss to the New York Mets in the
final game of the World Series.
   Blacks at the university, which has a total of 25,000 students,
said an undercurrent of racism has not abated since that clash.

<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police investigating the fatal stabbing
of a senior nuclear scientist on Saturday arrested a woman found
collapsed near his body from a drug overdose, authorities said.
   Thames Valley Police said Georgina Stuart, 51, was detained by
detectives immediately after her release from a hospital in Oxford,
about 65 miles west of London. She was taken to a police station in
Didcot, about 10 miles south of Oxford.
   Police said Mrs. Stuart was being questioned about the death of
Dr. Colin Fisher, 50. Fisher was a nuclear scientist at the
Rutherford Laboratories in Chilton, near Didcot, for more than 20
years.
   Fisher was at the home of Mrs. Stuart, a team manager in the
laboratory's nuclear physics department, when the stabbing occurred
Thursday, police said. Police, in a statement, raced to the house
after receiving a telephone call from Mrs. Stuart and found Fisher
dead of stab wounds and Mrs. Stuart collapsed nearby. When Mrs.
Stuart was found Thursday, police said she had collapsed from a
drug overdose.
   Fisher's death was the eighth reported since August 1986 among
scientists working on defense-related projects in Britain. Some
were recorded as suicides while no cause has been given for others.
   Fisher was married and the father of two children. Mrs. Stuart,
who was divorced and also has two children, lived alone.
   Rutherford director Paul Williams described Fisher as a ``most
respected'' scientist whose work on nuclear particle physics was
known internationally.

   Pat Robertson predicted a strong finish
as his New Hampshire campaign entered its final weekend, while a
television interview aired in which he said Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi should have been captured or killed.
   Robertson, in a wide-ranging interview with David Frost, said he
would not have hesitated to kill Gadhafi, that repeated acts of
adultery would disqualify a potential president and that
homosexuals should receive no special legal protection.
   Meanwhile, in an interview with The Associated Press, the former
television evangelist said a strong showing in Tuesday's primary
will boost his Republican presidential campaign as he heads toward
friendly territory in the South.
   Robertson said Gadhafi, whose adopted infant daughter was killed
during an attack on his headquarters by U.S. Navy jets in 1986,
should have been taken out of the picture completely.
   ``My sentiment was that we should have taken him prisoner, gone
after him, somehow taken his power base away from him, whatever
that took,'' Robertson said. ``I wouldn't have hesitated to kill
him. He's a madman and he was a terrorist.''
   Regarding adultery, he said: ``How could we be secure if we
thought that the president of the United States was bedding down
with a girlfriend of a Mafia boss, as John Kennedy did _ or Gary
Hart, who knows who his girlfriends would normally be?''
   ``In today's world, I think, repeated dalliances and lies to
cover them up, I think are a disqualification'' for a presidential
candidate, Robertson said.
   Robertson said homosexuals should be treated like other
citizens, but ``I cannot see that we would write this sexual
practice into our law ... and give it a protected status.''
   Robertson, who finished second in the Iowa caucuses, trailing
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole but ahead of Vice President George
Bush, told the AP he expects to finish no lower than third in New
Hampshire.
   ``Whether I come in third, second or first, I will be
beautifully positioned to go out of here into the South,''
Robertson said. ``I have a very strong organization in the South.''
   ``My polling shows that 38 percent of the New Hampshire
Republican and independent voters are still undecided with only a
few days left to go,'' he said.
   He said the second-place finish in Iowa has helped his fund
raising, but he would not reveal how much money has come in.
   He said former Secretary of State Alexander Haig's withdrawal
from the GOP race Friday and his endorsement of Dole is not going
to make a great deal of difference in the outcome in New Hampshire.
   ``I'm going to pick up some of the Haig support and some may go
to Bob Dole but I don't think there's going to be much of a ripple
for any of us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Abu Nidal's Group Condemns Italian Court Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abu Nidal's radical Palestinian guerrilla
group on Saturday denounced as ``blackmail'' and ``a disgrace'' an
Italian court verdict that convicted him of masterminding a 1985
bombing attack at Rome airport.
   ``The verdict is an attempt to overshadow the glorious uprising
of our people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli
occupation. It is a disgrace to Italian justice,'' said a statement
issued by Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction.
   The statement was issued in Beirut a day after a Rome court
handed down the conviction verdict and sentenced Abu Nidal in
absentia to life in prison.
   Sixteen people were killed and more than 80 injured in the
grenade and rifle fire attack at Rome airport on Dec. 27, 1985. An
almost simultaneous bombing attack at Vienna airport killed four
people and wounded 47.
   The statement signed by Atef Abu Bakr, the group's chief
spokesman, accused the Italian judiciary of bias.
   ``Italian justice closes its eyes to the crimes Israel is
committing against our people in the occupied territories. These
crimes place Israel on the top of the terrorists' list,'' it said.
   ``Why has Italian justice failed to make any move when Israeli
secret agents assassinated several Palestinian leaders on Italian
soil? Isn't that evidence that Italian justice covers up for
Israeli crimes? Isn't that blackmail?,'' the statement said without
elaborating.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is a former
official of Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. He split with Arafat in
early 1970s and heads the Fatah Revolutionary Council. His group is
not part of Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.

   The disk-shaped Milky Way galaxy is not flat, but
resembles instead a warped phonograph record and is adorned with a
delicate, scalloped edge, new observations show.
   ``The scalloping is something we don't understand,'' Leo Blitz,
an astronomer at the University of Maryland, said Saturday.
   Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, Blitz said, ``Our picture of the galaxy
has changed significantly in the last five to 10 years.''
   The Milky Way, once considered merely a typical example of a
spiral galaxy, is now thought to be a much more exciting and
interesting aggregation. Among the recent findings reported
Saturday were:
   _ Ninety percent of the galaxy is invisible, and nobody knows
what this huge ``dark halo'' is made of.
   _ The galaxy is powered by two compact objects at its center
that might be the remnants of starburst formation or that could be
associated with a black hole.
   _ The galaxy's dark halo could be full of remnants of the big
bang called weakly interactive massive particles _ or WIMPs.
   The galaxy consists of a slim star-studded disk about 100,000
light-years across, Blitz said. (A light year is about 6 trillion
miles.)
   Surrounding that visible disk is a cloud of hydrogen gas
extending another 25,000 light-years.
   It is at the edge of that gaseous disk that radio astronomers
have found warping and scalloping, Blitz said.
   Beyond that lies 90 percent of the mass of the galaxy. It is
invisible, and astronomers don't know what it is, said Martin Rees
of Cambridge University.
   It could be made of a trillion very small, faint stars, each
one-tenth the size of the sun. Another possibility is that it is
composed of black holes, the remnants of massive stars.
   Or it could be made of WIMPs, an explanation that Rees said is
more radical than the others.
   ``What we want to do is narrow down the possibilities,'' Rees
said. ``What we see is a trace of sediment in a universe where
galaxies in a cosmic sea are dominated by this missing matter.''
   The galaxy's oddities are not limited to its outer edges,
however. ``The inner 10 percent of our galaxy seems to be unique,''
said Leonid Ozernoy of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. ``The star density is huge there.''
   It is also a powerful source of radiation, emitting infrared,
X-rays and gamma rays, Ozernoy said.
   A black hole could lie at the center of the galaxy, driving its
rotation. Such a black hole ``could be the remnant of starburst
formation,'' Ozernoy said.
   Observations yet to be made could resolve some of the puzzles
that remain, Rees said.
   It might be possible, he said, to use gravitational lenses _
areas in space in which gravity bends light in the same way that a
magnifying glass does _ to see small, faint stars in the dark halo,
if they exist.
   Experiments are being planned in the United States and Europe to
try to identify the WIMPs, if they exist, Rees said.
   The problem of missing mass is one that extends across the
entire universe, not only in the Milky Way, Rees said, and the
discovery of new particles in this invisible matter would have a
payoff ``so colossal that the modest investment in such experiments
seems more than justified,'' Rees said in his prepared remarks.

<HEAD>NATO Commander: New Chemical Weapons Should Be Deployed in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO's American commander was quoted
as saying Saturday that new U.S. chemical weapons should be
deployed in Europe but acknowledged that objections by European
allies could prevent the move.
   In an interview with the Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche
Zeitung, Gen. John Galvin, chief NATO commander in Europe, was
quoted as saying the new binary chemical weapons ``should be
stationed where the troops are.''
   The view is at odds with an agreement between the United States
and West Germany not to replace aging chemical weapons stored in
West Germany with a new generation of such weapons.
   The newspaper said Galvin acknowledged there were ``objections''
to his position among NATO allies.
   ``If these objections cannot be resolved, then we will have to
find an alternative. That alternative appears to be not to station
the weapons in Europe,'' Galvin was quoted as saying.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
and other West German officials have repeatedly called for the
worldwide destruction of chemical weapons.
   Horst Jungmann, a security expert for the opposition Social
Democrats, on Saturday criticized Galvin's comments and the U.S.
decision to build the weapons.
   ``The U.S. decision to begin production of binary chemical
weapons has set back any hope of achieving an agreement to
eliminate such weapons in the near future,'' Jungmann said in a
radio interview in Hamburg.
   He said the Social Democrats would oppose the deployment of new
chemical weapons in West Germany.
   In December the U.S. Army resumed producing chemicals for the
weapons. President Richard Nixon ordered U.S. production of
chemical weapons halted in 1969, but President Reagan said the
resumed production was needed to offset the increasing Soviet
arsenal of chemical weapons.
   The binary weapons are composed of two chemicals kept separate
until a bomb drops or an artillery shell is fired. The two then
mix, forming a deadly gas.

   Thousands of people grabbed for cheap beads
and aluminum doubloons tossed from parade floats Saturday, the
opening day of an unusual four-day Mardi Gras weekend, and
thousands more queued up to board a giant aircraft carrier.
   The glitziest, the Krewe of Endymion, boasted party pooch Spuds
McKenzie _ accompanied by his corps of non-canine cuties, the
Spudettes _ as its grand marshal. Spuds is the first animal to
serve as grand marshal of Endymion, which always invites a
celebrity of some sort to lead off its fancy floats.
   The beer company spokesdog rode low in a tall director's chair,
snout between paws, nose pointing down and sporting a hangdog look.
   Spuds' float followed those of country-western charmer Dolly
Parton, who tossed doubloons; ``Dynasty'' star Heather Locklear,
whose black sequined gown drew shouts from the crowd; and soulful
crooner Smokey Robinson.
   In all, nine parades were scheduled Saturday in New Orleans and
its suburbs, starting at noon and ending well after dark. There
will be parades every day through Fat Tuesday itself.
   A line five deep and about four blocks long snaked from the USS
Forrestal, which docked at New Orleans to give its crew of 5,000 a
great weekend and to give civilians a look at the largest warship
ever to come to the city.
   Announcements over speakers from the ship and military police on
shore patrol advised people in line that it would take those at the
end three to four hours to get aboard.
   For those unwilling to wait that long or uninterested in seeing
the 1,039-foot-long ship and its fighters, attack bombers,
anti-submarine jets and electronic warfare planes, there were the
parades.
   Mardi Gras is a state holiday, and the federal government's
celebration of Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays gave state
workers Monday off as well.
   All New Orleans parades have one thing in common _ the masked
and costumed riders throw beads and plastic toys to the crowds,
which scream, scramble and sometimes even scuffle for the trinkets.
   Why?
   ``I've been here for 22 years and I still wonder what makes
people go bananas over junk jewelry,'' said Dr. Fred Koenig, a
sociology professor at Tulane. ``It's not even jewelry. Junk.''
   Still, the parade watchers will go to extremes for the plastic
beads, whistles, dolls and so on _ and maybe even once in a while a
doubloon, a big aluminum coin designed for each parade group.
   Even babies perched high atop step ladders are encouraged to beg
for the trinkets as the crowds scream, ``Throw me something,
mister.''
   ``It's having a chance to get something that is free, that is
not easy to get,'' Koenig said. ``That has some appeal. You get
this kind of gratification. Prestige. Like knowing somebody on a
float.''
   ``It's competitiveness that is engendered there on the sides of
the parade routes,'' explained Dr. Cameron Camp, an assistant
professor of psychology at the University of New Orleans. ``You
want to get it before someone else does.''

   Forty percent of Americans believe Japanese
products are better than those made in the United States, and half
favor tougher trade barriers against imports to protect American
jobs, a Newsweek poll released Saturday said.
   The products of other Asian countries didn't fare as well among
the people surveyed, with just 3 percent describing Taiwanese
products as better than U.S. products and 53 percent describing
them as worse. By comparison, the fraction rating Japanese goods as
worse was just 19 percent.
   The survey was conducted by telephone on Feb. 3 and 4.
   Pluralities also rated the U.S. goods better than those from
Hong Kong (47 percent), South Korea (42 percent) and China (40
percent).
   While 50 percent felt the U.S. needed tougher trade barriers, 54
percent felt Japanese trade barriers were already unfair to the
U.S. And 39 percent thought it was at least ``somewhat likely''
that Japan will become an enemy of the U.S. in the future.
   Fifty-four percent said China could become a U.S. enemy and 53
percent said South Korea could as well. Asked which Asian country
could become dominant by 2050, 49 percent chose Japan and 42
percent chose China.
   Sixty-nine percent of those polled also said Asian allies of the
U.S. such as the Philippines, Japan and South Korea pay too little
of their defense budget.
   The poll of 613 adults was conducted by The Gallup Organization,
and the margin of error is plus or minus 6 percentage points.

<HEAD>White Man Accused in Racial Incident May Work 200 Hours for NAACP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white man accused of threatening blacks with a
baseball bat and yelling racial slurs would be ordered to work for
the NAACP, under a proposed sentencing agreement.
   ``I think working 200 hours for the NAACP is certainly going to
teach him something,'' Cook County Judge Stuart Nudelman said.
``He's going to learn how to be a responsible human being.''
   James Kalafut, 22, is charged with aggravated assault and ethnic
intimidation. He is accused of joining a group of six whites and
Hispanics who brandished baseball bats and threw bottles as they
chased two blacks from a transit stop last August.
   Neither black was injured, police said.
   Nudelman said he plans to sentence Kalafut Feb. 23. Officials of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
could reject the court-arranged agreement after interviewing
Kalafut.
   Kalafut's lawyer, Barry Silver, said his client will accept the
agreement to perform community service work for the NAACP. If the
agreement falls through, Kalafut would stand trial and would face
up to a year in jail on each charge if convicted.
   ``The sentencing is a very good move by the judge to help the
young man remove a prejudice ...,'' Silver said. ``It is a terrific
idea _ it lets the punishment fit the crime.''
   ``Perhaps with his gang he could be a terror, but when he has to
survive in the middle of the black community, he might have a whole
different presence,'' said Edward McClellan, executive secretary of
an NAACP branch on the South Side.
   ``If there's a new way to deal with old kinds of problems, why
shouldn't we interact?'' he said.
   Still, McClellan said, he wants to interview Kalafut to gauge
his attitude about the sentence. ``If it is not constructive in
nature, then I give him back to the judge,'' he said.
   Kalafut's teen-age brother, Larry, was sentenced last March to
six years in prison for firebombing the home of a black family who
moved into Gage Park, a predominantly white neighborhood.

<TEXT>
   An underground nuclear weapons test will
be conducted Monday at the Nevada Test Site and may produce
off-site ground motion, a Department of Energy spokeswoman said
Saturday.
   The test, code named Kernville, is the first announced test of
1988 and will range between 20 and 150 kilotons in size, department
spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg said. It is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
Monday.
   ``Because of the size of the test, there is a chance there will
be ground motion off the test site. Managers of tall buildings
should be aware this is going to happen,'' Ms. Yoerg said.
   The test could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including
weather, ``which does not look great,'' she said.
   The blast will be conducted 1,800 feet below Pahute Mesa, about
105 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The test is weapons-related and sponsored by Livermore National
Laboratory, Ms. Yoerg said.
   Kernville will bring to 675 the total number of announced blasts
at the Nevada Test Site since testing began there in 1951. It will
be the 470th test announced by the United States since the limited
test ban treaty of August 1963, she said.
   The most recent test was Mission Cyber, conducted Dec. 2, 1987.

   Nearly 850 airline flights to and from
Florida and the Southeast were delayed when a flight data computer
system failed for three hours, federal officials said.
   The malfunction Friday night affected flights in airspace
bordered by central Florida, Alabama and North Carolina, said Paul
Pascel, supervisor at the Federal Aviation Administration's
Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center.
   ``You could call it a major problem, but not a safety problem,''
said FAA spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta. ``It slowed down flights
at any airport within the center or through the center area.''
   A severed cable left the Jacksonville center idle between 5:09
p.m. and 8:14 p.m. Friday, Barker said. Orlando International
Airport and Tampa International Airport both reported 25 flights
delayed as much as an hour, he said.
   The computer system automatically logged the name of the
airline, type of aircraft, route and altitude. When the system
crashed, all departures and arrivals were halted until the
information could be transmitted among the various airport control
towers by telephone and teletype.
   The Jacksonville center controls thousands of miles of airspace
and about 6,250 flights a day, Pascel said. It is one of 20 such
traffic control centers in the United States.

   A ferryworkers union in Liverpool and the Isle of
Man, whose dispute sparked a national strike, reached a tentative
agreement Saturday to return to work, a union spokesman said.
   Roger Wilkins, deputy general secretary of the National Union of
Seamen, said he expected the workers to approve the agreement with
the Isle of Man Steam Packet Co. and return to work Sunday.
   The strike, begun at the end of December, led to a nationwide
walkout Feb. 2 that crippled ferry service at 12 ports. The High
Court ruled the strike illegal.
   Union leader Sam McCluskie had ordered men who were striking in
support of their Isle of Man colleagues to return to work, but said
other seamen striking because of their own local grievances could
stay out.
   Sealink company crews at the ports of Holyhead, Liverpool and
Fleetwood, and P and O crews at Dover, have remained on strike. The
agreement would not affect their walkout.
   Wilkins said management, which had wanted to lay off 80 of its
161 crewmen in economy moves, agreed to fire 47.
   ``I think the members will accept it, because we have got the
best possible deal in the circumstances,'' Wilkins said.

   Agents seized 106 pounds of heroin
valued at $38.5 million in raids Saturday in Bombay and a man died
after jumping from the balcony of an office where drugs were
seized, the United News of India reported.
   The Narcotics Control Bureau said it was acting on a tip when it
raided two buildings in the Bombay dockyard, UNI said. Opium and
hashish also were seized, it said, and one man was arrested.
   In New Delhi a businessman being questioned after a raid Friday
by narcotics agents ``jumped from the balcony of his office during
interrogation'' and later died of his injuries at a local hospital,
the news agency said.
   More than 6{ pounds of heroin valued at $2.7 million were
confiscated in the raid on the commercial office, it said. Two
other people were taken into custody.
   India increasingly has been used by drug smugglers to transfer
drugs moving to Europe and North America.

Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A couple locked in a legal tug-of-war
over Baby M will meet with Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould in an attempt
to reach a settlement on visitation for the surrogate mother, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   William and Elizabeth Stern agreed to a private meeting ``after
much soul-searching,'' said their attorney, Gary N. Skoloff, The
Star-Ledger of Newark reported.
   When the state Supreme Court ruled on the case earlier this
month, it directed a Superior Court judge to set visitation
guidelines for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and the nearly 2-year-old child.
   The state's highest court overturned a lower court decision that
upheld a $10,000 contract under which Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was
artificially inseminated with Stern's sperm and bore the child for
him and his wife.
   In addition to stripping her of her parental rights, the lower
court last March 31 awarded custody of the baby to the Sterns.
   The Supreme Court maintained custody for the Sterns, but voided
the contract and and the termination of Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights, and ruled she was entitled a hearing on visiting
her child. She now gets to visit the child two hours a week, under
a temporary visitation order.
   As of late last week, a court date for a visitation hearing
before Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween had not been set.
   Harold Cassidy, attorney for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, did not say
what visitation she would seek during the meeting with the Sterns,
or when the meeting would take place, the newspaper said.
   The proposed meeting marks the first time the Sterns have
pursued an out-of-court settlement in the dispute over Baby M,
named Melissa by the Sterns.
   The Sterns ``have decided, after much soul-searching and
additional professional advice, that it is in the best interest of
Melissa Stern to seek a meeting'' with the surrogate and her
husband, Dean Gould, Skoloff said.
   Cassidy did not return a phone call to his home on Saturday.
There was no answer at Skoloff's office.

   Nelson Benton, a broadcast journalist who
covered the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and the nation's
capital in more than 20 years with CBS News, died Saturday of
cardiac arrest. He was 63.
   Benton died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, a day
after collapsing at the city's Union Station.
   He began his broadcasting career at radio station WSOC in
Charlotte, N.C. In 1960, he joined CBS News in New York as an
assignment editor and reporter. He worked in Dallas when President
Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 and became CBS News New Orleans
bureau manager and reporter in 1964.
   He covered the civil rights movement in the South and the
Vietnam War from Saigon, then spent the next decade as a Washington
correspondent.
   In 1982, he left CBS News to become a news anchorman at WMAR-TV
in Baltimore. He left in 1984 and worked for the Mutual
Broadcasting System as White House correspondent. Most recently, he
was co-anchor of a daily U.S. Information Agency news program
broadcast overseas, ``America Today.''
   Bob Schieffer, anchoring the CBS Evening News on Saturday, said
Benton was ``a fine reporter. He was also a fine person.''
   He lived in McLean, Va.
   A funeral was set for Tuesday in Danville, Va. Survivors include
his wife, Mildred, of McLean; a son, Joseph Nelson Benton III of
Washington; his mother, Margaret O. Benton, and a sister, Kathryn
Wyatt, both of Danville, and two grandchildren.

   U.S. television evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart thanked President Daniel Ortega for letting him take his
religious crusade to thousands of Nicaraguan enthusiasts in
Managua's Plaza of the Revolution.
   ``We have not come to involve ourselves in the politics of the
nation, but to exhalt Jesus Christ,'' he declared Friday night in
an apparent reference to the 6-year-old civil war between the
leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   The service was the first by a U.S. minister in the central
plaza since the Sandinistas came to power in July 1979, and
Swaggart thanked Ortega ``for the facilities lent by his
government.''
   Swaggart also brought power generators to prevent his service
from being uninterrupted by Managua's frequent blackouts.
Government officials have blamed the country's energy shortage on
the rebels' sabotage of power installations.
   Swaggart, who preached in English and was translated into
Spanish, sang his first song in Spanish.
   The state-run radio station La Primerissima cautioned listeners
that Swaggart ``generally assists the foreign policy of the United
States administration,'' but did not specify how.
   Government radio, television and newspapers had advertised
Swaggart's arrival, as did the opposition paper La Prensa.
   In a letter published by La Prensa, a Roman Catholic reader
complained of the advertisement on Sandinista television, ``which
has been denied to Catholic bishops, especially his eminence
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.''
   Obando y Bravo, the archishop of Managua, has been a frequent
critic of the government. The country is predominantly Roman
Catholic.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, speaking
Saturday at the dedication of a new National Historic Site in his
hometown, praised the integrity and compassion of his neighbors,
saying they have traits that could benefit the rest of the country.
   ``This is not just an opportunity to tell a story about a little
farm boy who became president,'' Carter told 450 shivering
well-wishers gathered at the 19th century railroad station that
served as his 1976 campaign headquarters.
   ``It is an opportunity to tell the story to visitors from this
nation and around the world of what America is all about.
   ``You can talk to almost anyone who lives here and see
characteristics of strength, of honesty, of integrity, of
compassion, of understanding and of support,'' Carter said.
   Legislation signed into law Dec. 23 designates Carter's home,
the railroad depot, a vacant brick building where he graduated from
high school in 1941 and his boyhood home in nearby Archery as a
National Historic Site.
   John Tucker, who will manage the site in addition to his duties
as superintendent of the Andersonville National Historic Site, said
the park service will open the depot for tours and preserve Carter
memorabilia displayed in a small museum there.
   The Park Service also will offer tours of Plains and eventually
will restore the depot, the high school and Carter's boyhood home.
The Carters will donate their four-bedroom, ranch-style house built
in 1961 to the Park Service, but will continue to occupy it
throughout their lifetimes.
   On hand for the ceremony were Sen. Wyche Fowler and Rep. Richard
Ray, two Georgia Democrats who led a six-year effort to win
congressional approval for the site.
   Ray, whose district includes Plains, said the success of a farm
boy who went on to become a state senator, a governor and the
nation's 39th president is an ``example of what this country is all
about.''
   ``President Carter was an excellent president, and during the
past five to seven years, we've found out he was an even better
president than we thought he was,'' he said.
   William Penn Mott Jr., director of the National Park Service,
said Plains has the potential to become one of the top visitor
attractions in the South.
   ``By itself, the life story of Jimmy Carter has earned a place
in our hearts as well as our history,'' he said. ``But it struck me
that we also have an opportunity to tell another story here _ the
story of the rural South, its agricultural heritage, the strength
and character of its people.''
   Currently, about 80,000 visitors a year stop at Plains' small
welcome center. In a few years, after the Park Service has improved
some of the attractions, Plains could attract up to 300,000
visitors a year, Tucker said.

   A note purportedly from the kidnappers of
two U.N. relief workers said Saturday the hostages would be freed
within a week if their interrogation proved their ``innocence.''
   Also Saturday, Palestinian refugees set fires and blocked roads
to protest the kidnappings, which the U.N. relief agency blamed on
Palestinian individuals acting without a political motive.
   In other developments, a Beirut newspaper printed a valentine
from the heartsick family of an American hostage and received
hundreds of other cards supporting other foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon. Also, a Christian militia freed eight men and a
15-year-old boy taken seven weeks ago from a Danish ship it claimed
carried arms for a Druse militia.
   The handwritten note in Arabic, left at a Western news agency
office in Beirut, was the first claim of responsibility since Jan
Stening, 44, and William Jorgensen, 58, were abducted by gunmen on
the outskirts of Lebanon's southern port city of Sidon Feb. 5.
   ``The abduction ... was not a stupid or silly action,'' the note
said. ``It was carried out for security purposes. They will be
interrogated in light of the information in our possession.''
   ``If their innocence is established they will be set free within
a maximum period of one week,'' it added.
   It was not clear what the reference to ``innocence'' meant,
since the note did not make any specific accusations against the
two men.
   The note did not identify the kidnappers. But it carried the
alleged signatures and thumbprints of the two captives.
   An official at the Lebanon headqarters of the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency in Beirut, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the signatures appeared to be authentic.
   Earlier Saturday, Palestinians in five south Lebanon refugee
compounds burned tires and closed roads to their camps to show
anger over the abductions.
   A general strike called by Palestinians upset with the
abductions closed schools and shops in refugee camps in Sidon and
Tyre.
   The U.N. relief organization removed four other foreign staffers
from Lebanon after the abductions. The evacuations apparently
sparked fears among the Palestinians that agency might suspend
services that cover 270,000 refugees in Lebanon if the two
Scandinavians were not released.
   In an interview published Saturday in the daily Al-Ahram
newspaper in Cairo, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was quoted as saying
that his forces have surrounded the hideout of the kidnappers, but
that the Swedish and Norwegian governments requested that it not be
stormed.
   In Beirut, the leftist daily As-Safir on Saturday published a
picture of the family of American hostage Thomas Sutherland, along
with a Valentine's Day message.
   The message read: ``To Tom Sutherland. A Christmas picture with
Valentine love, loyalty, strength, perseverance, and steadfast hope
and faith.''
   The photo was signed by Sutherland's wife, Jean, and other
members of the family in Fort Collins, Colo. Mrs. Sutherland, three
other women, a man and a child appeared in the picture.
   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut June 9,
1985. The group Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has claimed his
abduction.
   The group, believed made up of radical Shiite Moslems loyal to
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also claims it holds American
journalist Terry A. Anderson.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the longest-held
foreign hostage in Lebanon.
   Sateh Noureddine, an editor at As-Safir, said that hundreds of
letters of support for the hostages had arrived at his office and
he would ``try to publish some of them,'' the Rochester (N.Y.)
Democrat & Chronicle reported in its Sunday editions.
   Former hostage David Jacobsen, who was released Nov. 2, 1986
after 17 months in captivity, had suggested that valentines be sent
to the newspaper and the State Department for the hostages.
   In all, eight Americans and 16 other foreigners are missing and
believed kidnapped in Lebanon since 1985.
   Captivity ended Saturday for eight seaman and a 15-year-old boy,
who boarded a ferry Saturday for Cyprus after seven weeks of
captivity in Lebanon. They included three Poles, three Danes, two
Sri Lankans and a Trinidadian.
   ``They have all been released,'' said Ole Neustrup, Danish
charge d'affaires in Damascus, Syria, who took charge of the Danes
after they were freed by the Lebanese Forces militia.
   Neustrup would not release the names of those freed.
   The Danish captain, two Danish officers, the crewmen and the boy
were taken prisoner Dec. 27 after their vessel, the Ingawebb,
arrived from North Yemen with a cargo of food, said Herluf Hansen,
a Danish Foreign Ministry spokesman in Copenhagen.
   The Christian militia accused the crew of unloading arms for
Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia
at its port south of Beirut before sailing into the city's harbor,
news reports said.
   The party is the main foe of the Christians in Lebanon's nearly
13-year-old civil war.

   President Reagan and Mexican President
Miguel de la Madrid met in this sun-drenched resort Saturday,
stressing positive relations but acknowledging sharp differences
over Central America policy and illegal drug trafficking.
   De la Madrid, at a luncheon with Reagan, complained that
Mexico's efforts to curb drug production and trafficking ``are
still not appreciated to their full extent'' and are the target of
``disinformation.''
   He said it was unlikely that any country devoted as much
resources to the fight as Mexico.
   In a pointed reference to the United States, de la Madrid said
the battle against drugs cannot be won unless drug consumption is
attacked with the same vigor as the fight against production and
trafficking.
   Although about 25 percent of the Mexican army is engaged in the
antidrug campaign, the United States says the effort is not enough,
is hampered by official corruption and that the flow of drugs is
increasing.
   Reagan, in his luncheon remarks, said, ``The people in the
United States are now turning away from drugs'' and that
development ``should curb the demand that fuels the trafficking.''
   The two leaders held private talks in a seaside hotel in
Mazatlan, which is in the state of Sinaloa, the main center for
Mexico's illegal drug trade. Following the four-hour meeting,
Reagan was flying to California for a four-night stay at his Santa
Barbara ranch.
   The leaders conferred privately for 45 minutes with only
notetakers present. Reagan told de la Madrid that Mexico has been
very cooperative in fighting drugs but urged him to work harder.
   ``This is the year we have to show results,'' Reagan told the
Mexican leader, according to a White House statement.
   Reagan pronounced himself ``extremely pleased with our
discussions and the remarkable record of achievements'' of their
talks.
   As they posed for pictures, Reagan was asked if he agreed with
de la Madrid that drug use was the root of the whole problem. ``It
always has been,'' Reagan replied.''
   Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, told reporters on Air Force One there was ``a serious
possibility'' the United States would find that Mexico should
remain eligible for aid from international financial institutions
even though its drug program falls somewhat short.
   A firm opponent Reagan's campaign to fund the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua, de la Madrid called for negotiated settlements in
Central America ``that take into account the legitimate and
essential interests of the parties in conflict, with a sense of
fairness and even-handedness.''
   He said peace would be possible only if all the governments of
Central America ``comply with the commitments that they have made
at the highest level.''
   For his part, Reagan said ``our commitment to democracy in our
hemisphere must be unshakeable.''
   He said totalitarian systems in the Soviet Union, Cuba and
Nicaragua ``have demonstrated for all to see that tyranny doesn't
work. Mexico and the United States have a common interest in
stable, free and democratic governments in this hemisphere.''
   He expressed hopes for a common U.S.-Mexican stand ``against the
expansion of totalitarianism.''
   The White House statement said Reagan, in his private talks,
underscored his support for the Contras and ``repeated his
commitment to the peace process.'' It quoted de la Madrid as saying
Mexico is supportive of the four-nation peace accord signed in
Guatemala.
   Later, at a briefing for reporters, Secretary of State George
Shultz said that while differences over Central America were
discussed, ``there were no heated words.'' Asked whether the two
sides had come closer on the subject, he said, ``that was not a
particular focus'' of the talks.
   Asked if Mexico should do more to combat drugs, Shultz said,
``Yes, and so does the United States. So do we all. It's a
tremendous problem.''
   In his luncheon remarks, de la Madrid said Mexico's huge foreign
debt _ $105 billion _ ``continues to be one of the major obstacles
to development in my country.''
   He said ``there is an urgent need ... to find new formulas to
adjust debt servicing to the capacity of debtor countries to pay
and to permit them to boost growth and recover their living
standards, which have been so greately affected by this long
crisis.''
   Reagan said there is ``reason for optimism'' on the debt
problem. He said Mexico's plan to exchange some of its debt for
special bonds which are backed by U.S. zero coupon bonds was an
innovative idea.
   Reagan got a red-carpet welcome and a 21-gun salute as he
stepped off Air Force One.
   In his welcoming remarks, de la Madrid said, ``Today, we affirm
that our relations are conducted on a very positive level.''
   He said their summit _ the sixth and final meeting of the two
outgoing presidents _ would ``strengthen the basis for good and
productive relations'' and be a forum for discussing problems ``as
frankly as we always have.''
   Reagan cited U.S.-Mexican steps on trade, economic problems and
law enforcement and said, ``We can be proud of what has been
accomplished in so short a period.''
   He said their meeting paved the way for ``a new generation of
political leaders in both our countries who will soon follow us and
build on the foundation we've laid.
   ``That foundation is cemented by our shared values and common
goals _ a better quality of life for our peoples, opportunties for
our children and the dignity of living peacefully in free and
democratic societies,'' Reagan said.
   He said much remains to be done ``but we can be proud of the
legacy we leave.''
   While the two leaders met, senior officials from both countries
held talks of their own, focusing on foreign policy trade, drugs
and law enforcement.
   Reagan was accompanied by Shultz, Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, and Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   One agreement was signed, allowing more Mexican textile and
apparel exports into the United States.
   The agreement, already in the process of being implemented,
gives Mexico, the sixth largest supplier of textiles to the United
States, an automatic 6 percent increase in exports to that rich
market in the next four years.
   Although minor in scope, the pact symbolizes the cooperation
between the two countries as Mexico seeks to increase its exports
and at the same time open its own market to more U.S. products by
reducing tariffs.
   Another accord, dealing with telecommunications, had been
expected to be signed, but was pulled back because of a
``last-minute minor screw up,'' said Abrams. He said he expected it
would be signed in a few days.
   Reagan also devoted his weekly radio address to the summit.
   While avoiding direct criticism of Mexico's support of the
leftist government of Nicaragua, Reagan said the establishment of
Soviet- and Cuban-backed totalitarian regimes is ``a threat to
stability and freedom.
   ``Nowhere is that threat more acute than in Central America,''
Reagan said. ``I would hope that the United States and Mexico will
find common interest in opposing any such totalitarian threat.''
   The summit falls just two weeks before Reagan must ertify
whether drug trafficking nations such as Mexico have made adequate
progress attacking the problem.
   For nations that fail to win certification, the United States is
required by law to vote against proposed loans in the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund and other international financial
institutions.

   Upcoming U.S.-Soviet negotiations on nuclear
testing are expected to finalize a plan on joint test blasts to be
held in both countries by June, a Soviet envoy said Saturday.
   In a related development, The New York Times reported that
Moscow wants limits on sea-launched, non-nuclear cruise missiles, a
move that appeared to toughen the Soviet position at the arms talks.
   Igor Palenykh, Moscow's chief delegate, said the test blasts
will help the two sides reach agreement ``preferably in the first
half of 1988'' on anti-cheating measures intended to lead to the
ratification of two 1970s superpower treaties limiting the power of
test blasts.
   Palenykh said that after ratification on the 1970s test ban
treaties, both sides should proceed to limit and ultimately ban
nuclear tests.
   He spoke to reporters at Geneva airport after arriving for a
second round of nuclear talks to begin Monday.
   In the first round of talks in November, U.S. and Soviet
negotiations reached basic agreement to demonstrate technology for
detecting blast yields during experiments at the main U.S. and
Soviet test ranges.
   The second round is expected to set the dates and settle all
questions of ``the preparation and conduct'' of the joint tests,
Palenykh said.
   In January, teams of U.S. and Soviet scientists made five-day
inspection tours of the Soviet test range at Semipalatinsk and the
U.S. site in the Nevada desert.
   The Times, in its Sunday editions, said the Reagan
administration officials thought the two sides agreed during the
December summit meeting in Washington that cruise missiles carrying
conventional warheads will not be covered by a new strategic arms
treaty.
   The Soviets are asking that the number of the long-range
sea-launched weapons armed with conventional warheads be limited to
600, the newspaper reported.
   It said the Soviet proposal calls for a limit of 400
nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles, for a total limit of
1,000 of the guided long-range, subsonic weapons.
   The United States, which is planning to have 2,643
conventionally armed cruise missiles for use at sea, opposes the
inclusion of such missiles in a new treaty, arguing they are needed
to improve the United States' capability to fight without nuclear
weapons, the Times said.
   The Times said some experts speculate that the Soviet Union
wants a cap on the total number of sea-launched cruise missiles
because it is difficult to distinguish between cruise missiles
armed with nuclear and non-nuclear warheads.

   Communist East German authorities released four
protesters who had been arrested during a visit by West Berlin's
mayor, officials in West Berlin said Saturday.
   The protesters were seized last week when they gathered in front
of West Germany's mission in East Berlin during a visit by Mayor
Eberhard Diepgen.
   A West Berlin government spokesman, Winfried Fest, said that
according to information received from East German authorities, the
four will not face criminal charges.
   Delegates at a gathering of East German church officials in
Dresden meanwhile criticized the government's recent handling of
dissidents in the country.
   East Berlin's Lutheran bishop, Gottfried Forck, told conference
members he was ``deeply troubled'' by the recent expulsions of
dissidents to West Germany.
   East Germany has expelled more than 60 protesters who tried to
demonstrate at a state-sanctioned rally last month.
   Several leading dissident artists were among those expelled.

   Customs agents seized 1.4 tons of
heroin hidden in bales of rubber sheets bound for New York in what
is believed to be the world's largest heroin bust, officials said
Saturday.
   The 2,822 pounds of No. 4 grade heroin with a street value of $2
billion, were aboard a freighter at Klong Toey Port in Bangkok,
said Viroj Laohaphan, director general of the Customs Department.
No. 4 grade heroin is 97 percent pure.
   Viroj said the drug was discovered when customs officials,
acting on a tip, began opening the 665 bales earlier this week.
Heroin had been found in 62 bales by the time the search was
completed Friday night, he told a news conference.
   ``The packing in rubber sheets prevented police dogs from
smelling the heroin,'' Viroj said. ``If this amount of heroin had
left Thailand, it would have killed an uncountable number of
people.''
   Viroj said Thai authorities have questioned an employee of the
shipping company, but made no arrests.
   The ship was to leave for New York later this month, authorities
said.
   Customs officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
rainstorm Thursday aroused suspicions about the cargo. The
officials said nothing was found until officials noticed the white
powder seeping out of bales wet with rain and noticed that some
soaked bales weighed more than others.
   Viroj said the previous largest heroin bust was of 2,640 pounds,
seized in France in 1972.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
the biggest previous heroin seizure that U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration officials in Thailand could recall was a haul also
of 2,640 pounds.
   That seizure was made several years ago on a shrimp boat off the
coast of a Central American country, Petzing said. He said he had
no further details of that bust.
   Petzing said No. 4 grade heroin, cut, diluted and sold on the
streets of New York, would fetch about $1.6 million a kilogram,
which equals 2.2 pounds. He quoted DEA agents as saying the drug
probably was bought in northern Thailand for about $4,400 a kilo.
   The officials said the heroin was believed to have come from
Southeast Asia's ``Golden Triangle'' _ a major drug producing
region where the borders of Thailand, Laos and Burma converge.
   He said the rubber bales were to have been exported by the
Rubber Plus Import-Export Company to the A.I.C. Company in the New
York City borough of Queens. He said U.S. authorities had inspected
300 bales at the company's Elmhurst, Queens, warehouse but did not
find incriminating evidence.
   Viroj said he received information, however, that a woman
representative of A.I.C. was arrested.
   News reports said the manager of the Rubber Plus Import-Export
had disappeared and police found its offices in Bangkok deserted.
   Thai authorities seized 1,496 pounds of heroin aboard a trawler
off the southern province of Chumphon last Oct. 20 in what was then
described as Thailand's biggest heroin bust.

<HEAD>Engineers' Report Urges Changes in Space Shuttle Nozzle Coating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of engineers has urged NASA to change
the heat-resistant lining on the nozzle of the space shuttle's
booster rockets because of questions about the material's
durability, a published report said Sunday.
   Four of the six engineers who took part in the study believe
that the lining could produce a ``borderline performance'' and
should be altered before the next shuttle flight, scheduled for
August, The Washington Post reported.
   The two other researchers dissented, stating that the problem
was not quite so serious.
   Tests have resulted in ``fractures ... so numerous, so large, so
closely spaced and so extensive that the integrity of the entire
(nozzle) came into question,'' said the scientists' study, obtained
by the Post.
   The report was prepared by a team of engineers from Morton
Thiokol Inc., the shuttle rocket's manufacturer, and from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It was presented to
NASA two weeks ago.
   The nozzle is a sort of exhaust pipe at the bottom of the
shuttle's two booster rockets, more than 12 feet in diameter,
through which superhot gases are blasted during lift-off.
   The nozzle's interior is coated with an inch-thick
carbon-and-resin material in which NASA scientists have noted
erosion in flights as long ago as 1983.
   The report blames the erosion on excessive water and gases
trapped in the material during its manufacture, and recommends
changes in processing techniques.
   But one of the two dissenting engineers, former Thiokol engineer
G.C. Lamere, wrote that the changes would ``unnecessarily''
increase costs and that there is ``insignificant data'' to show
that they would be effective.

   Mrs. Marcos has maintained Imee Marcos Manotoc is ill in Morocco

get Imee into the United States without having to testify against
her father. A grand jury in Virginia is investigating alleged

   U.S. officials have said Imee would be arrested upon arrival in

<HEAD>Benedict Sentenced In Racketeering Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday sentenced a
former state auditor general to six years in prison for
racketeering and tax fraud related to ``a sickening pattern of
soliciting, accepting and paying bribes.''
   Al Benedict, a one-time gubernatorial hopeful, also was fined
$20,000 by U.S. Middle District Senior Judge Malcolm Muir, who said
the sentence was intended as a deterrent for other public officials.
   The judge ordered Benedict to surrender to U.S. marshals on
March 14.
   Benedict, 58, pleaded guilty last month to charges of
racketeering and tax fraud. The racketeering charge encompassed 10
state bribery-related charges, which the government said occurred
between April 1976 and November 1984.
   Benedict acknowledged accepting bribes in return for hiring and
promoting state workers and for awarding no-bid contracts. He also
admitted making a $6,000 payoff to a lawmaker in return for a
bigger state appropriation for his department.
   ``I could never express to you how I feel ... the pain,
suffering, embarrassment, humiliation,'' Benedict said in court.
``All I can attempt to do is atone for my transgressions and sins.''
   Benedict refused to answer reporters' questions as he left the
courthouse. His lawyer, Arthur Goldberg, said Benedict was
surprised but not angered by the sentence.
   He could have been sentenced to up to 23 years in prison and
$125,000 in fines. Federal prosecutors asked for a light sentence,
citing Benedict's cooperation in a continuing investigation of
state-government corruption.
   The defense, in a memorandum filed by Goldberg, asked for a
one-year sentence with early parole and a term of public service.
   The memorandum portrays Benedict, a former television
commentator who became de facto head of the state Democratic Party
during two terms as auditor general, as a broken, humiliated man.
   It also places the blame for Benedict's predicament on his
former top aide, John Kerr, who was convicted of masterminding the
job-selling scheme. Kerr was sentenced to two to five years in
prison and remains free on bail. He led investigators to Benedict
late in 1986.
   Among the spectators at the sentencing was Joanne Dwyer, widow
of state Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer. Her husband killed himself during
a news conference last year, one day before he was to be sentenced
by Muir on bribery-conspiracy charges.
   She criticized the plea-bargaining system that allowed Benedict
to shorten his prison term and said her husband never got a chance
to bargain because he was innocent and had been framed.

   The 4-0 vote was recorded after Education Commissioner W.N.
Kirby told the Committee for Students he did not believe the
education board had the authority to outlaw corporal punishment.
   Schools now set their own policies on paddling of students.
   The petition was presented by Jimmy Dunne of Houston, a former

<TEXT>
   Anticipating higher numbers of refugees from
Southeast Asia and Soviet bloc countries, two organizations urged
the United States on Friday to raise entry ceilings rather than
shift immigration quotas among regions to compensate.
   The U.S. Committee for Refugees, a refugee protection agency,
and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, migration agency of the U.S.
Jewish Community, urged the Reagan administration and Congress to
invoke emergency procedures of the 1980 U.S. Refugee Act for
raising the total number of admissions.
   The administration has been considering a shift of 5,000 from
the Southeast Asian entry quota to provide for additional places
for Soviet Jews and Armenians from Europe, said USCR Director Roger
P. Winter in a statement.
   Such a shift would have a ``disastrous impact'' on the safety of
Vietnamese ``boat people'' refugees fleeing to Thailand, Winter
said. This is because temporary refugee entry into Thailand depends
on prospects for resettlement elsewhere.
   The government is also proposing to reallocate 4,000 entry
places originally allocated for 1988 refugees from Africa, the Near
East and Latin America, Winter said.
   The increased refugee flow from the Soviet Union and other bloc
countries is ``a direct result of the foreign policy successes of
this administration,'' said Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society official
Karl D. Zukerman in a telegram to Secretary of State George Shultz.
   ``Such a challenge to our human rights and refugee policies
cannot go unanswered, nor should the lives and dignity of one set
of refugees be balanced against others,'' Zukerman said.

   TRW Inc. has told 1,000 aerospace
workers here they will lose their jobs because federal budget cuts
forced the Pentagon to cancel several key programs.
   That's only about a third as many as TRW had indicated earlier
this month might have to be furloughed. Nonetheless, the action
marks a sharp reversal for TRW, which has avoided major layoffs for
at least 15 years.
   ``Within the next few days, we will have provided notice of
layoff to 1,000 people,'' said Julie Wright, spokeswoman for TRW
Space & Defense in Redondo Beach. ``We believe that a few hundred
layoff notices may remain.''
   TRW, which builds satellites, defense electronics and manages
several government weapons programs, has about 18,000 employees in
Redondo Beach.
   Ms. Wright declined to say what programs were cut, but observers
speculated that one of the programs was a secret surveillance
satellite.
   TRW also has lost a major subcontract on a NASA satellite
program and an Air Force communications system contract.
   The first layoff notices went out late last week, telling
workers they had two to 12 weeks left with the company, depending
on length of service.

   A televised debate scheduled for Saturday between
GOP presidential hopefuls has been canceled, event organizers said.
   As of Friday, only Rep. Jack Kemp and Pete du Pont had agreed to
participate in the forum, which was to be sponsored by the Boston
Herald and Boston's WBZ-TV.
   Regan Communications, which was organizing the forum, issued a
statement Friday evening that said, ``The decision to cancel the
debate came after Pat Robertson abruptly withdrew from the forum,
prompting Sen. Robert Dole to also withdraw.''
   However, Barbara Gattullo, of Robertson's Virginia headquarters,
told the Associated Press on Thursday that he would not attend the
debate. Tim Arche, a spokesman for Dole, the winner of the Iowa
caucuses, said Friday Dole had not decided whether he would appear.
   Vice President George Bush had declined the invitation to
participate.
   The other candidate, Alexander M. Haig Jr., withrdrew from the
Republican race Friday.
   The forum was to be broadcast to New Hampshire and picked up by
the NBC affiliate in Atlanta, WXIA-TV, for many of the Southern
states participating in the Super Tuesday primaries March 8.
   It was also going to be offered to more than 70 stations
affiliated with WBZ's parent company, Westinghouse Broadcast, and
to C-Span, the public affairs television network.

   A teen-ager who officials say
terrorized a neighborhood was held in a youth detention center
Friday on charges of capital murder in the shooting death of a
tennis center employee, officials said.
   The boy was arrested Thursday in connection with the Feb. 3
slaying of Lerlean Fuller Shaw, 59, at a city-owned recreation
facility, police said. The woman was shot in the head as she tried
to run away, authorities said.
   ``This individual is well-known to us,'' Lt. Albert Ortiz said.
``This individual's name kept coming up again and again as someone
who was terrorizing the neighborhood. He has torched several
buildings on the East Side.''
   The 14-year-old boy's name was withheld because he is a juvenile.
   A small-caliber handgun was recovered at the time of the arrest,
but police have not determined if the gun was the one used to kill
the woman.
   Juvenile officials decided in a detention hearing Friday that
the boy should remain at the center because he is accused of a
felony and could be a danger to himself and others, said Tom
Broussard, chief juvenile probation officer.
   The boy was on probation for an attempted burglary in August
when he was arrested Thursday, according to police and juvenile
authorities.
   Police charged the juvenile with capital murder because they
believe Mrs. Shaw was killed in a robbery attempt. The youth will
be subject to a new law passed by the 1987 Legislature.
   If convicted, he could be sentenced to as many as 30 years in a
detention center, including time in a Texas Department of
Corrections facility, Broussard said.

<TEXT>
   A judge Friday sentenced an anti-nuclear
protester to 33 months in prison for sabotaging the Navy's Project
ELF submarine communications site last August.
   Ashland County Circuit Judge William Chase rejected a defense
recommendation calling for probation with restitution through
community service. A college president and local priests had
offered to provide community service jobs for George Ostensen in
lieu of a prison term.
   Ostensen, 33, formerly of Baltimore and West Hampton, N.Y., was
convicted by a jury Jan. 8 on one count of sabotage and acquitted
on a second count. The conviction carried a possible maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and $10,000 fine.
   Authorities said he caused $11,000 damage to the ELF site at
Clam Lake. He admitted cutting down transmission poles and damaging
electrical boxes at the site Aug. 16 _ the date of the harmonic
convergence, a time said by believers to be the peak of a period
when the earth moved into a new era of peace and harmony.
   The damage caused the transmitter to shut down for about 29
hours. Biblical references were also spray-painted throughout the
ELF compound, and banners with quotes from the Bible were hung.
   The ELF (extremely low frequency) transmitter sends coded
signals providing worldwide communications with underwater Trident
submarines. The Clam Lake antenna has operated since the 1970s and
another is under construction in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   The judge said he shared Ostensen's concern about a buildup of
nuclear weaponry but said he felt compelled to give Ostensen a
prison sentence because committing sabotage was not the way to make
his point.
   Ostensen said he took full responsibility for the actions, but
felt he had to do something to get people to think about
humanitarian efforts instead of relying on a nuclear arsenal for
defense.

<HEAD>Man Uses Sign Language to Talk Deaf Stranger Out of Suicide</HEAD>

   A man used sign language to dissuade a
distraught deaf man from killing himself at a service station by
igniting the gasoline-soaked interior of his car, authorities said.
   ``I saw the manager trying to communicate with the man and he
was saying `Can you read my lips?''' said Mansour Attia, who had
gone to the station to get his carburetor fixed.
   Attia, who has three deaf brothers and signs in English and
Arabic, offered to intervene after police officers and the station
manager were unable to calm the man.
   ``I asked him what was the problem,'' Attia said. ``He said that
he felt like everyone was against him.''
   Robert Hall, 36, had bought $2 in gas on Wednesday, doused the
inside of his car and threatened to ignite it with a cigarette
lighter, officials said. He told Attia that he thought his problems
stemmed from his disability.
   The two men talked in sign language for an hour before Hall
agreed to come out of the car.
   ``He was very hurt and very frustrated,'' Attia said. ``I told
him, just because a few people rejected him did not mean that
everyone else would.''
   Hall was taken to San Bernardino County Medical Center for
72-hour observation, sheriff's Deputy Pam Williams said.

<HEAD>First-Graders To Begin 12-Year Anti-Smoking Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of anti-smoking groups next fall will
launch a 12-year campaign to teach first-graders nationwide about
the dangers of cigarette smoking.
   The National Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and
the American Heart Association want to persuade the graduating high
school class of 2000, estimated at more than 3 million students,
not to smoke.
   Officials hope that at least a third of the first-graders in
school this fall will be introduced to specially tailored
anti-smoking material throughout their grammar school years.
   ``The momentum is with us,'' said Michele Kling, a spokeswoman
for the lung association. ``We see these children, the class of
2000, as the ambassadors of a future smoke-free generation.''
   Previewed Thursday at a public hearing of the National Cancer
Advisory Board in Miami, the campaign is a response to U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop's challenge to make the United States
smoke-free by 2000.
   The Class 2000 project also parallels the National Cancer
Institute's goal of cutting the annual cancer death rate in half by
2000 through increased prevention, detection and screening.
   The first-year goal of the campaign is to reach students in
27,000 elementary schools.
   Lobbyists for the tobacco industry, which anti-smoking forces
criticize for running ads seductive to teen-agers, were unwilling
to predict what impact the project could have on the industry.
   Although they didn't endorse the concept, they stopped short of
criticizing it.
   ``We don't think kids ought to smoke either, so from that
perspective I don't have a problem with it,'' said Brennan Moran,
assistant to the president of the Tobacco Institute. ``My feelings
about this change when we're talking about adults. When someone is
an adult they have the right to make their own decision.''
   During the first year, children will learn what No Smoking signs
mean and how to politely ask a smoker not to smoke, said Dorothy
Marcus, spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society and coordinator
for the project.

<HEAD>High Stakes Drug War Claims Record Number of Victims in Nation's
Capital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A short ride from the White House where
President Reagan has waged a seven-year campaign against drugs,
people are being gunned down, one-by-one, in a high stakes drug war
that shows no signs of abating.
   The murders are coming at a record rate, double that of last
year. Police say ``it's just a matter of time'' before a bystander
is struck in the crossfire.
   ``This drug problem is by no means unique to the district but
has now reached epidemic proportions affecting the entire nation,''
Inspector Larry Soulsby, former head of the district police
homicide branch, said recently.
   ``It has now become a man-made plague acting as a cancer which
eats away at the very fabric of our society,'' he said.
   Still, the death toll in Washington alone is staggering. In the
first 43 days of 1988, there were 46 murders, 35 of them attributed
to the drug trade. Police said many were ``open hits'' in which
victims were shot several times.
   Last year, 57 percent of the 228 murders in the city were drug
related, compared to 33 percent in 1986.
   Police Chief Maurice Turner says police will be issued 9mm
semi-automatic weapons to match the firepower drug dealers from New
York and Miami are using to force their way into the city's drug
market.
   Police claim many of these out-of-town drug dealers are
Jamaicans, and they have formed a ``Jamaican task force'' with
officers from federal agencies and other police departments in the
region.
   Turner said the dealers are importing the highly potent cocaine
derivative ``crack'' and using extreme violence to stake out their
turf.
   ``Crack is now the drug of choice in the nation's capital,''
replacing the hallucingen PCP, Turner said.
   Vials of crack that sell for $10 to $15 in New York may sell for
more than $30 in Washington, according to narcotics investigators.
   Turner said more than 200 dealers come to the nation's capital
each weekend from New York City, some carrying 1,000 vials of
crack. They sublease apartments where they make their sales.
   ``On Monday morning, they go back to New York richer than when
they came here. They make big money. They spend big money. And they
go back with big money,'' Turner said.
   ``The residents here tell you about their fear and concern that
drug dealers are terrorizing neighborhoods,'' said Turner. ``It
reminds me in some cases of Wild West shoot-outs.''
   The city says it is fighting back, by coordinating among city
agencies, neighboring jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia, and
the federal government and putting more police officers on the
street.
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. refuses to put a dollar figure on the
city's effort. ``Money is not the only answer, it is only part of
it,'' he said. ``We are going to use whatever resources we have.
Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better.''
   Federal spending for drug enforcement, prevention and treatment
has tripled since Reagan took office, rising from $1.1 billion in
1981 to $3.4 billion in 1988. The White House is requesting that
$3.8 billion be allocated for fiscal 1989, said Paul Sirovatka,
policy analyst for the White House Drug Abuse Policy Office.
   In Washington, 15 of the murders have been in the Seventh Police
District, a far corner of the city's poor Anacostia section which
police say holds the greatest share of Washington's estimated 50 to
60 open-air drug markets.
   Thirteen of the 15 have been blamed on drugs.
   Bobby Larnell Parker Jr.'s death last Monday is an example of
the ``open hit'' that has become all too familiar in the city.
   Police said Parnell had recently stolen four kilos of cocaine
worth $280,000 and cash from a drug dealer.
   As he drove a new, luxury automobile through a busy section of
Anacostia in the early evening, he was shot him a dozen times with
semiautomatic and automatic weapons.
   ``That was an open hit, there's no question about it. That's
very brazen. Very daring,'' Turner said.
   Even as the police chief spoke Wednesday afternoon, a Baltimore
man was being killed in a hail of gunfire behind an apartment
complex in Anacostia.
   The shooting of Charles Edward Russell, 29, also appeared to be
drug related, police said later.
   ``The general public is not caught up in this now, but it's just
a matter of time before someone is struck'' in the crossfire, said
the police chief.
   ``We have younger and younger individuals who are arming
themselves with semiautomatic weapons,'' the chief said.
   Stressing the point to reporters, police last week displayed
some of the 410 firearms they have seized in the city so far this
year, 68 percent more than they had gotten in the same period last
year.
   There were several Uzis laid out before television cameras and
one officer said the arsenal would be well-suited for warfare in
the Middle East.
   Parents and church leaders, meanwhile, are appalled at the
involvement of youths in big-time crime.
   Nineteen of the murder victims last year under 18 years old,
compared to just six in 1986.
   There were 1,780 juvenile arrests in the city in the first 11
months of 1987, more than twice the total of 883 for all of 1985.
   On Jan. 26, two 14-year-old youths were arrested at a motel with
$48,000 worth of drugs, police said.
   A 12-year-old boy was arrested in early January in southeast
Washington carrying a 9mm semiautomatic weapon.
   Barbara Merriweather formed a group called Citizens Redirecting
Youth after her 17-year-old son, Kendall, was fatally shot on the
way to school last December. His killers wanted his boom box radio,
police said.
   ``Our children are being killed and there's a reason why,'' Mrs
Merriweather said. ``I know that drugs play a part, but society as
a whole also plays a part. We have to put some morals back into our
children and back into society.''

   In Ottumwa, Iowa, Kathy Pietraszewski stood in the doorway at
the place where the Republican caucus was held last Monday night to
encourage shy voters to cross the threshhold for Pat Robertson.
   She was a oldier in Robertson's ``invisible army.''
   ``There were two of mine that couldn't come because they were
sick, but there were four who surprised me,'' says Mrs.
Pietraszewski, 35, mother of two. ``I knew them all as they came
in; I went out and personally met them so they wouldn't be afraid
to go to the caucus.''
   When the heads were counted, there were 64, and 43 of them gave
the nod to Robertson.
   Statewide, Robertson finished second, behind Bob Dole but ahead
of Vice President George Bush _ a shock to many, but not to some
Robertson people who like Mrs. Pietraszewski had been working for
their candidate for months. (``I told my family there will be lots
of other Christmases, but this one's different.'')
   The Robertson ground troops, new to politics and excited by
success, are starting to ask themselves if they have it within
their power to put their man in office.
   ``A lot of people have said, well, I agree with Pat Robertson's
stands, but I don't want to waste my vote,'' the Rev. Walter
Holder, pastor of the First Baptist Church told the Concord (N.H.)
Monitor. ``That was before Iowa. My impression is now he's a little
more electable. There may indeed be a groundswell.''
   The Rev. John Fortin of the Faith Christian Center in Bedford,
N.H., puts it this way: ``If Pat is God's man then somehow he's
going to get in there. But not without a lot of hard work and
prayer.''
   And the Rev. Ken Borchers, pastor of the United Methodist Church
in Ashland, tells of a lunch that a group of clergymen had with
Robertson. After getting to know him as a person, Borchers said,
``We all laid our hands on him and prayed for him. We prayed for
strength and guidance and prayed if it is God's will, that he be
elected.''
   Jeffrey K. Hadden, a University of Virginia sociologist and a
Robertson biographer, says Robertson came up with a masterstroke in
insisting that three million followers sign petitions before he
would decide to run. The tactic gave Robertson an army.
   ``He asked people to pledge that they'd work for him, pray for
him and give him money,'' says Hadden. ``Political historians may
view it as one of the most ingenious things a candidate ever did.''
   These days, Robertson soft pedals the church-based foundation of
his candidacy. He says he should be thought of as a television
network executive and the chancellor of a fully accredited graduate
university. To call him merely a TV evangelist, he protests ``is
bigotry and it's an insult. And it denigrates who I am and what I
am and I'm sick of it.''
   For all that, most of Robertson's followers come out of the
evangelical churches of America. They know him best as a man of God
_ and they speak of him, often, in language unblushingly tinged
with theology.
   ``I just believe Robertson is going to win,'' says Gloria
Widmann of Waterloo, Iowa. ``He operates in miraculous wonders in
terms of what the Bible says _ prophecy, healing, miracles. He
operates just like Jesus did and he loves just like Jesus did. And
we need a man of God in the office.''
   In Port Huron, Mich., Billye Knoik, who quit her job as a church
secretary to work for Robertson, scoffs at the term the press has
given Robertson's political flock.
   ``These are just your common, everyday folks from various and
sundry backgrounds and Pat is touching these people,'' she says.
Mrs. Knoik, mother of three grown children, got to know Robertson
from watching the 700 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Network.
   In New Hampshire, where on Tuesday Robertson faces his first
test in a primary, Mrs. Maria Farris, 37, of Londonderry, town
chairman and Robertson's local coordinator, says the conventional
wisdom _ that Robertson will have trouble in a primary election _
has missed the point.
   ``It's there,'' she says of a Robertson post-Iowa surge.
``There's a tremendous force that hasn't been really identified in
the normal political process.''
   Registration ended last weekend in New Hampshire and city and
town clerks say they were so busy for three weeks they didn't have
time to leave their offices and grab lunch.
   The lines were long. Nearly 1,000 people registered in
Manchester on a Saturday. Many are first-time voters. Many
registered undeclared, meaning they can vote Democrat or
Republican. Secretary of State William Gardner estimates the late
surge added 15,000 to 25,000 voters in a state where Ronald Reagan
won the primary in 1980 with 73,000 votes. Gardner can't guess how
many of the new registrants are Robertson supporters.
   The Rev. Keith Marsh, a pastor at the Dartmouth Area Christian
Fellowship in New Hamsphire, says in 1986 about 50,000 residents of
the state gave money to the Christian Broadcasting Network.
   After Iowa, all the candidates flew to New Hampshire, but
Robertson went to Minnesota, which holds caucuses Feb. 23 and where
a strong ``pro-life'' movement has ties to fundamentalist churches.
   Dole's Minnesota co-chairman, Carl Ludeman, says Jack Kemp is no
longer Dole's greatest threat. ``We feel that in Minnesota we have
only one competitor in grass roots organization, that's Pat
Robertson.''
   In Hawaii, where Robertson won overwhelmingly in the Feb. 4
Republican caucuses, GOP chairman Howard Chong credits a 60 percent
rise in party registration tp Robertson's appeal.
   Says Robertson co-chairman Gene Ward: ``We draw from mainstream
conservatives, evangelicals and those who know Pat from the 700
Club.''
   In Iowa, retiree Chuck Underwood of Des Moines, a lay pastor,
says Robertson's appeal politicized the non-political _ like
himself.
   ``I've got to get with it,'' Underwood tells a reporter. ``I've
got to get involved. I'm ashamed to say that's the first caucus I
ever attended.''
   Were Robertson people in Iowa told to be evasive to pollsters so
the Robertson strength would come as a surprise?
   No, Underwood says: ``People have a little bit of a problem with
the role of the media. They were tight-lipped on the thing.''
   Guy Rodgers of Shenandoah, Iowa, a Robertson activist who has
worked for a number of Christian causes: ``We had a lot of people
support Pat who we referred to as closet supporters. I saw that in
my own precinct. I saw people we hadn't identified, people we
didn't know. There were extra numbers here that we weren't aware
of.''
   The Rev. David Nelms, pastor a Des Moines Baptist Church, says
evangelical churches didn't outright support Robertson, but they
sure gave up preaching that politics is securlar business to be
shunned in favor of the Lord's work.
   ``For years, we heard Christians should stay out of politics,''
he says. ``Of late, our leaders have encouraged the opposite.''

<HEAD>Stocks Respond Sluggishly to Falling Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market has reacted with
uncharacteristic confusion to a drop in interest rates over the
past several months.
   A long decline in interest rates from their lofty levels at the
start of the 1980s was widely cited as one of the primary forces
behind the great bull market in stocks. When rates surged upward
last spring, the stock market ran into trouble.
   Since the crash in October, interest rates have come down again,
with yields on long-term Treasury bonds falling from above 10
percent to 8.4 percent as of Friday. But stock traders have shown
little enthusiasm.
   Of course, they have other worries on their minds. Black Monday
on Oct. 19 cast a long shadow.
   Beyond that, however, analysts say the latest drop in rates
doesn't fit into the kind of textbook pattern that would lift
investors' spirits.
   Sustained declines in interest rates often occur in recessions,
prompted by weak demand for credit. As rates fall, they help set
the stage for a rebound in business activity.
   This time, however, they have moved lower against a backdrop of
an economic expansion that is more than five years old. And many
observers see them as an early symptom of a business slump.
   There has been very little corroborating evidence for that view
in the statistical measures of the economy so far.
   U.S. exports set a record for the second straight month in
December, attesting to a revival in manufacturing. If the latest
data on retail sales are to be believed, consumers haven't run out
of spending money.
   ``Over the last several weeks, there has indeed been an
accumulation of positive fundamentals,'' said John Connolly, an
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``They have moved the bond
market rather than the stock market, but that still counts.
   ``It is quite normal for the bond market to react first and, in
a sense, clear out a path for the stock market.''
   Stocks did rally in the past week, pushing the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials up 72.78 points to 1,983.26.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.51 to 144.86;
the American Stock Exchange market value index 6.89 to 277.00, and
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market 7.52 to
353.27.
   Big Board volume averaged 179.43 million shares a day, against
192.13 million the week before.
   Recession worries have been heightened by a run of three
consecutive monthly declines in the government's index of leading
economic indicators.
   But Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc., argues that the
declines only portend ``a business slowdown instead of an outright
recession.''
   In the past, Harris says, three-month declines in the leading
indicators have foreshadowed recessions in cases where the Federal
Reserve has been constrained from easing credit by other problems _
most notably inflation.
   This time, he maintains, with inflation still subdued, the trade
deficit improving and the dollar having apparently stabilized,
``the Fed will respond to signs of weakness with an easier monetary
policy.''
   Just a couple of months ago, the Fed and its chairman, Alan
Greenspan, appeared to be caught in a dilemma: The central bank
couldn't raise interest rates without hurting the economy, and it
couldn't lower them without risking a continuing slide of the
dollar's value in foreign exchange.
   Now, says Connolly, the Fed is ``in the most flexible position
in a long time. Greenspan must feel relieved.''

<HEAD>Economists Differ On Urgency Of Shrinking Trade Gap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fresh off the biggest yearly trade deficit in
history, U.S. policy-makers and economists are divided about how
urgent it is to lower the gap in 1988.
   The trade deficit is a favorite punching bag of presidential
candidates, but many economists say the Reagan administration could
make matters worse by trying to do away with it too rapidly.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that the gap between
imports and exports in 1987 totaled $171.2 billion, up from the
previous record of $156.2 billion in 1986.
   A big drop in the dollar, the surest method of closing the trade
gap, would trigger higher inflation by raising the cost of imports
and straining the production capacity of U.S. exporters.
   The Federal Reserve would try to cool off high inflation by
clamping down on credit, which could very well send the economy
into a severe recession.
   Recession would become a certainty if Congress simultaneously
slashed the federal budget deficit, the other step demanded by
presidential campaigners.
   A sudden, sharp decrease in the federal deficit, whether by tax
increases or spending cuts, would undercut demand for goods and
services that keeps the economy growing.
   Since the United States remains the major engine of world
growth, a recession here would mean recession abroad, many
economists say.
   At the same time, few doubt the wisdom of shrinking the federal
budget deficit and the trade deficit in the long run.
   The question, then, is how quickly the United States should be
moving to cut its trade and budget deficits, given the dangers of
going too far, too fast.
   ``I'm rather sick and tired of people haranguing the United
States for not getting its fiscal and trade deficits under
control,'' Robert Brusca, chief fixed-income economist for Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc., said in a speech this past week.
   The budget deficit is rising, but the trade deficit has turned
decisively downward, he and other economists note. In December the
merchandise trade gap was $12.2 billion, the lowest since January
1987.
   Brusca argues that the dollar has fallen far enough to make U.S.
goods competitive in world markets. He predicted the dollar will
rebound to 140 Japanese yen by the middle of 1988, from about 131
yen Friday.
   Only slightly less optimistic, Fred Peck of First Boston Corp.
predicts the dollar will reach the 140-yen mark by the end of the
year. The United States, he says, is on a ``slow boat'' to
regaining balance in trade.
   At the other extreme are economists such as Rudiger Dornbusch of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who argues that the
dollar needs to fall to 100 yen.
   Dornbusch advocates a cheaper dollar even though it makes the
United States a poorer country _ harder for Americans to afford
imported products and easier for foreigners to scoop up U.S.
products and assets.
   The dollar must fall, he argues, for a number of reasons: Latin
America is too burdened with debt to buy U.S. exports at current
dollar levels; Asian nations have become more competitive;
foreigners have gained permanent beachheads in U.S. markets; and
the United States for the first time since before World War I has
to pay more to foreigners in investment income than it earns abroad.
   Dornbusch said he would like the dollar to fall, gradually,
about 30 percent more in the next year or so. But if it comes to a
choice between a steep, sudden fall and no fall, he would prefer
the steep one.
   ``If it is locked in at its present rate, we shall have to pay
for a much larger and steeper plunge sometime later,'' Dornbusch
said last fall in an article published by the Federal Reserve Bank
of Atlanta.
   To a great extent, the argument over the dollar's level will be
decided by the world's capitalists, who decide whether the United
States is a good place to stash money.
   History shows the dollar's value is only loosely tied to the
nation's trade performance. The dollar began to soar in value in
1982 at the very time the trade deficit was starting to worsen,
notes First Boston's Peck.
   Even though Americans sent plenty of dollars overseas from 1982
to 1985 to pay for their mounting trade deficits, Peck recalls,
foreigners were hungry for even more dollars because of attractive
U.S. interest rates and optimistic forecasts for U.S. economic
growth.
   Perhaps, the optimists say, that kind of confidence in the
dollar is returning.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: is returning.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Business inventories jumped 0.8 percent in December, the
government reported.
   _The steepest climb in food prices in nearly 18 months, only
partly offset by falling energy costs, pushed wholesale prices up
at a brisk 0.4 percent in January.
   _Retail sales rose 0.5 percent in January, and some economists
said the gain was evidence that consumer confidence has nearly
recovered from the October stock market crash.
   _U.S. manufacturing executives see only a one-in-four chance of
a recession this year and by a wide margin expect profits and
exports to exceed 1987 levels, the National Association of
Manufacturers said.
   _Consumer confidence continues to gain even though a quarter of
adults polled in a recent survey thinks jobs are hard to come by,
according to a Conference Board study.
   _The New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange
Commission are investigating rumors that subversion of a key
selling rule may have contributed to the October crash, NYSE
Chairman John Phelan said.
   _A federal appeals court refused to review a Federal Reserve
Board decision allowing bank holding company subsidiaries to
underwrite and deal in securities.
   _A management-led group offered to buy J.P. Stevens & Co. for
$666.5 million, sending the textile giant's stock soaring on
speculation that higher bids would emerge.
   _The accounting profession announced regulatory changes aimed at
increasing the responsibility and clarifying the role of auditors
who review corporate financial statements.
   _Ten men were charged with fradulent trading in commodity
futures, including one scheme in which non-exchange members
allegedly used wigs, makeup and phony credentials to gain access to
the trading pits.
   _General Motors Corp. said fourth-quarter earnings more than
doubled from the previous year, although much of the improvement
was attributed to accounting changes and tax benefits.
   _The cost of providing health care benefits to employees jumped
to an average of $1,985 per worker last year as employers hunted
for new ways to control costs, according to a private survey.
   _Carl C. Icahn, single largest shareholder in Texaco Inc. and an
ardent critic of the company's takeover defenses, nominated himself
and four allies to the beleaguered oil giant's board of directors.
   _Black & Decker Corp. said it would attempt to gain control of
American Standard Inc.'s board and remove a ``poison pill'' defense
aimed at thwarting its $2.1 billion takeover bid.
   _A group led by Coniston Partners said it had accumulated a 6
percent stake in Gillette Co. and was seeking to meet with
potential buyers of the company.
   _The board of directors of Stop & Shop Cos. unanimously rejected
a $1.03 billion buyout offer from Dart Group Corp.
   _The influx of women into the working world is turning the work
place into marriage hunting grounds and putting pressures on
managers to deal with office romances, nepotism and sexual
harassment, a private study said.

<HEAD>Corporate Borrowing On The Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent sharp downturn in interest rates has
sent corporate America on a borrowing spree.
   ``There's been ... no really big issues but a steady activity
among all the higher-grade to medium-grade companies,'' explained
Anthony Naylor, a corporate bond analyst for Rodman & Renshaw Inc.
``People had been waiting some time to see something happen.''
   During the final week of 1987, only a couple of issues were put
on the market totaling $152.06 million, according to Securities
Data Co. Inc., which compiles financial information.
   But by the following week, the number of issues jumped to 30
valued at $2.76 billion, and in the last seven days of January they
peaked at 76 totaling $5.56 billion, Securities Data said.
   Activity slowed slightly this past week due to what traders
described as a general malaise in the credit markets prior to the
release of December trade figures on Friday.
   The sudden spurt in volume had been prompted largely by the
rapid fall in interest rates and subsequent rise in bond prices,
which paralleled a growing spate of negative economic news.
   Traders in the credit markets believe that the Federal Reserve
remains poised to keep rates low to avoid sending the economy into
a recession. Rates had been on the rise until the Oct. 19 stock
market crash. In the Treasury market alone, the yield on the
bellwether 30-year bond had been nearing 10{ perlcent before the
crash, and it's now trading slightly above 8\ percent.
   ``It's almost the same as you or I dealing with our finances,
when we see rates come down, we decide at some point it's
attractive enough to take action,'' said James J. Drury, a
corporate bond analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``A lot of (corporate) treasurers are thinking now's a good time
to get into the market because the odds are that either rates won't
go down much more or they might go up in the short term.''
   Among the companies jumping into the market were: General
Electric Capital Corp., which issued $300 million in debt in early
January; Quantum Chemical, which issued the same amount a week
later; and General Motors Acceptance Corp., which issued $200
million in notes earlier this month.
   Analysts say most of the bond issues have been for capital
spending or stock repurchases rather than for refunding of previous
debt.
   ``Some have put the money (from the issues) in their corporate
kitties for use down the road and what we call `prefunding,''' said
Drury.
   Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought bonds prior
to the recent rate decline have seen their securities rise in value.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, has risen about 6 percent since the start of the year.
   Jon Cuscani, who runs Nikko Securities Co. Intl. Inc.'s
corporate bond trading, notes that Hydro-Quebec's 30-year bond sold
for around $991 per $1,000 face amount and yielded 10.81 percent
when issued about the time of the crash. Lately, each of those
bonds has sold for around $1,100, he said.

<HEAD>Nervous Cattle Market Ignoring Big, Bullish Picture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle futures traders have developed the jitters on indications
that the three-month bull market may be coming to an end, and a
report due out on Tuesday may seem to support that notion.
   But a look at the big picture shows how deceptive the numbers
can be, an analyst says.
   The Agriculture Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report for
the seven largest cattle-producing states is widely expected to
show a modest reduction in both the number of cattle slaughtered
and the number placed on feedlots in January compared with the same
month a year ago.
   Taken at face value, a reduction in those figures would seem
positive for cattle prices because it apparently would indicate
tightening supplies.
   The problem is that supplies should not be declining, at least
not in the near term.
   The number of cattle placed on feedlots for fattening back in
August and September was higher than the placements figure a year
earlier, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicago for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Those animals would normally have begun reaching acceptable
slaughter weights in January, which should logically be reflected
by a higher January marketings figure in Tuesday's USDA report,
Levitt said.
   Instead, analysts who track the daily flow of cattle from
feedlot to market expect the January marketings figure to be
anywhere from 1 percent to 7 percent below the January 1987 figure.
   ``That's creating some nervousness within the industry that
maybe they're falling behind in marketings, which would mean a
larger carryover of cattle from January to February of this year,''
Levitt said.
   An increasing backlog of cattle destined for slaughter would
have a negative influence on prices, especially in these days of
consumer concern over the fat and cholesterol content of red meat.
Beef products already face stiff competition from poultry and fish,
which are lower in cholesterol, and an increase in beef supplies
would likely drive prices lower.
   Those fears surfaced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange this
past week in three straight days of declining cattle futures prices
after two days of fairly sharp gains.
   But Levitt said the Monday and Tuesday advances tell the real
story of the market's eventual direction.
   The sharp surge on Monday and follow-through buying on Tuesday
were reactions to the USDA's semi-annual cattle inventory report,
which was released the previous Friday.
   That report showed the nation's cattle herd had shrunk for the
sixth consecutive year, and that the number of calves under 500
pounds _ those that could be fattened for slaughter later this year
_ was down 10 percent from a year earlier.
   Feedlots are jammed now as producers attempt to take advantage
of current high prices, but the decline in calf numbers eventually
will become the dominant factor in the market, Levitt predicted.
   ``The number (of cattle) out there that are not yet on feedlots
is getting smaller and smaller,'' he said.
   ``We're supporting larger feeder inventories now, but that's not
going to last forever,'' Levitt said. ``Halfway through this year,
our on-feed number will be lower than a year ago. And that's why
we're so bullish.''

   Hospital Corp. of America on Friday
reported net income of $33 million for the final quarter of 1987
but a $58.4 million loss for the full year.
   The company's fourth-quarter profit, which amounted to 40 cents

<HEAD>U.S. Trade Deficit Drops To Yearly Low, But 1987 Still Was Worst
Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Record exports helped push the nation's trade deficit down to
$12.2 billion in December, but 1987 still went down as having the
highest shortfall ever, the government reported.
   The deficit for the full year totaled $171.2 billion, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
   On Wall Street, the stock market had a subdued response to the
report. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.72 to
1,983.26. Bond prices fell as concern grew about inflation, but the
dollar soared against most major currencies.
   December's merchandise trade deficit was down from $13.2 billion
in November and from $17.6 billion in October, and was the smallest
figure since a $11.9 billion trade gap in January 1987, the
Commerce Department said.
   The improvement was driven by a 4.2 percent rise in exports,
which reached record levels for the second month in a row.
   Both private and government analysts pointed toward the December
report as strong evidence of the long-awaited reversal in the
nation's trade peformance.
   Exports in December were $24.8 billion, a new record, up from
$23.8 billion in November, the previous record. Imports, meanwhile,
held steady at $37.0 billion, the same as the month before.
   For all of 1987, Americans imported $424.1 billion in goods
while exporting $252.9 billion, compared with 1986 imports of
$383.0 billion and exports of $226.8 billion.
   Analysts credited the slide in the dollar _ now worth half of
its 1985 value against the Japanese yen and key European currencies
_ as being the major factor in the recent export surge.
   A devalued dollar makes American goods cheaper abroad.
   In other economic data on Friday:
   _The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose 0.4
percent in January, equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of
4.6 percent, with higher costs for a variety of items, including
food, offsetting lower energy prices.
   _The Commerce Department said business inventories shot up 0.8
percent in December, the third consecutive large monthly advance,
pushing unsold stockpiles on shelves and backlots up by $5.45
billion to a seasonally adjusted $701.87 billion.

   Oil prices have closed out the week on a
negative note, pulled lower by technical factors and slumping
prices in Europe.
   Traders were also more interested in selling than buying because
they do not want to be holding contracts over the three-day
weekend. The market will be closed Monday in observance of the
Presidents Day holiday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for March
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
closed at $16.75 per 42-gallon barrel, down 36 cents from Thursday.
   Among refined products, wholesale heating oil contracts fell
0.75 cent to 46.60 cents per gallon, while wholesale unleaded
gasoline sold for 46.28 cents per gallon, down 0.37 cent.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said he did not see any fundamental reasons for Friday's declines.
   ``It was really pretty much a technical market all day today,''
he said.
   He added that crude _ having failed to break above $17.75
earlier this week _ appeared to be on the downward path in its
year-long range between $15.75 and $17.75.
   Another factor pressuring crude prices was an overnight decline
in North Sea Brent crude on the London exchange, said Jayne Ball, a
broker at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   She said the holiday also played a part.
   ``Traders all closed their books and said, `Forget this
stuff,''' Ms. Ball said.
