   The nation's governors appealed to the White
House Sunday for relief from 163 federal rules and regulations, and
heard a former governor call for a constitutional convention to
restore states' rights.
   New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu, opening the National
Governors' Association's winter meeting, said that the time has
come to press for a new division of authority between the states
and Washington.
   ``There has been an erosion of the fundamental balance struck
200 years ago in Philadelphia,'' Sununu, the NGA chairman, said at
a news conference before gaveling the first plenary session to
order.
   President Reagan, at a black-tie dinner for the governors Sunday
night, told the governors he envied the balanced-budget
requirements and line-item vetoes that many of them possess. ``Not
one of you would put up with the mess that we have here in
Washington at budget time,'' the president said.
   He also said he did not want to tie his successor's hands, but
expressed hope the next president would continue his tradition of
inviting the governors to the White House for dinner each year.
   Reagan exchanged toasts with Sununu, who said to Reagan, ``From
all of us to one of us: You did it your way. You did it well. God
speed.''
   The president planned to hold a working meeting with the
governors Monday to hear their concerns about regulations and other
matters.
   The Dave Brubeck Quartet brought the Reagans and their guests to
their feet with a concert that included W.C. Handy's ``St. Louis
Blues,'' Duke Ellington's ``Take the A Train'' and Brubeck's own
signature piece, ``Take Five.'' Brubeck was joined by his longtime
clarinet player Bill Smith, Randy Jones on drums and Brubeck's son,
Chris, on bass guitar and slide trombone.
   Reagan paid tribute to the jazz great, saying, ``It is magic. I
know it's sort of a cliche, but they not only don't write 'em that
way anymore, there aren't many around who play 'em anymore.''
   Forty-four governors were on hand for the affair, including
presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, who quipped
about his visit to the White House, ``We've been looking it over,
checking it out. I've never lived over the store before.''
   Dukakis planned to depart the governors' meeting Monday to
resume campaigning in South Dakota and Minnesota, which hold a
primary and caucus respectively Feb. 23.
   James C. Miller III, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, told the governors the Reagan administration has carried
out nearly 50 of 80 recommendations the NGA made 16 months ago to
reduce red tape and administrative burdens on state and local
governments.
   Eyeing the new stack of 163 recommendations, Miller said,
``There's a lot more out there that needs to be done. It's hard to
do.'' But he added, ``There is no question that our federal system
of shared power between the federal and state governments ... is
healthier today than it has been in years.''
   The governors heard just the opposite from former Georgia Gov.
George Busbee, who warned, ``We are about one recession away from a
complete breakdown of domestic government in this country.''
   Busbee, an Atlanta lawyer who governed Georgia from 1975 to
1983, urged the governors to press for a constitutional convention
``to break the gridlock, sift through the blue smoke and mirrors
and restore a sense of order and accountability in American
government.''
   The federal government is raiding state and local revenue
sources and dumping unfunded mandates on the states, Busbee said,
and most of the presidential candidates are talking of new federal
initiatives in such areas of traditional state control as
education, welfare, economic development and criminal justice.
   ``Begging Congress or the administration to pay attention to
federalism is, in my opinion, a waste of time,'' said Busbee, a
Democrat. ``Governors and legislators are not treated much
differently from the `National Association of Ball Peen Hammer
Producers' _ except that (they) have a PAC (political action
committee) and you don't.''
   Even as Miller and Sununu exchanged thick lists of regulatory
reforms _ past, present and yet to come _ North Dakota Gov. George
A. Sinner was asking the OMB chief if he could stop a controversial
effort to force state Guananteed Student Loan agencies to send a
quarter-billion dollars of their reserves back to Washington.
   But Miller said that was part of the bipartisan
deficit-reduction measures Congress and the administration hammered
out late last year, and ``I don't think it's likely to be changed.''
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton said he thought the Reagan
administration was ``genuinely trying,'' but there are still too
many ``conflicting regulations that drive us nuts,'' especially in
health and welfare.
   ``It took us two years to get rejected for a waiver on welfare
reform,' Clinton complained.
   Reagan and the governors tried and failed to engineer a grand
swap of federal and state responsibilities in 1982, including a
complete federal takover of the Medicaid program. Reagan's
so-called ``new federalism'' foundered as the administration tried
to inflict simultaneous budget cuts on the programs.
   The theme of the governor's winter meeting, ``Restoring the
Balance: State Leadership for America's Future,'' is hardly new.
The governor's 1980 meeting centered on ``Restoring Balance to the
Federal System.''
   But Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles said that does not gainsay
the importance of the new federalism initiative. ``Federalism is a
process. ...'' he said. ``It's a journey rather than a
destination.''
   The winter meeting runs through Tuesday. Sununu said he hopes
the governors will decide by their meeting this summer on what
strategies to pursue on regulatory reform, any changes in federal
laws and the possibility of a constitutional convention.
   The governors' list of 163 regulatory reforms includes a raft of
proposals for standardizing eligibility rules for food stamps and
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and easing up on
strictures for running job training, education and health programs.

   Iranian-backed Hezbollah extremists shot
at Shiite militiamen searching a southeastern village for a
kidnapped U.S. Marine on Sunday and declared support for his
abductors.
   The members of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's mainstream Shiite
Amal militia fired back with rocket-propelled grenades during the
half-hour clash in Ein el-Tineh but no injuries were reported, a
police spokesman said.
   Hezbollah gunners later pounded Israel's self-designated
security zone in south Lebanon with mortars, said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations.
   He said Israel retaliated by shelling 13 southern Shiite
villages for three hours. Four civilians were wounded, police said.
   A Hezbollah leader said he believed the U.S. Marine, Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, had been smuggled out of south Lebanon.
   ``We declare solidarity with, and full support for, the
strugglers against America who confront the plots of the great
Satan,'' said a statement from Hezbollah, or Party of God. ``The
demands of the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth are just.''
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth on Friday claimed
responsibility for Higgins' kidnapping, charging he was a CIA spy.
U.S. and U.N. officials denied the charge.
   The group early Monday called on Berri to order his Amal militia
to stop house raids and arrests in connection with Higgins'
abduction.
   ``The pretention that he is defending the U.N. peacekeeping
forces in south Lebanon is not a viable excuse for rescuing an
American espionage agent,'' the group said in a typewritten
statement delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar
just after midnight.
   ``We are lying in wait for any other suspicious American,'' the
Arabic language statement said.
   Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran and a one-time military
assistant to former U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, heads
a 76-man observer group attached to a U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon. He was kidnapped on Wednesday near the ancient port
city of Tyre.
   In Washington, President Reagan said Sunday night that ``we're
doing everything we can and exploring every avenue'' to free
Higgins.
   Asked if he hoped to get all American hostages freed from
Lebanon before he leaves office next January, the president said,
``I'd like that better than anything else.''
   ``It is such a terrible situation and you're afraid you'll do
something that will harm them (the hostages). We don't know who
they (the captors) are or where they are,'' Reagan told reporters
during a reception at the White House for the National Governors'
Association.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization for
pro-Iranian groups holding foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Ein el-Tineh, a Hezbollah stronghold, is 31 miles east of Tyre,
where Hezbollah claims Amal has arrested more than 150 of its
members in connection with Higgins' abduction. Amal spokesmen say
only 40 fundamentalists have been detained.
   The abduction prompted the U.N.'s Interim Forces In Lebanon to
withdraw 20 observers from Higgins' unit to its headquarters in
Naqoura, near the Israel-Lebanon border, according to Timor Goksel,
spokesman for the UNIFIL.
   Goksel said the observers were withdrawn both for security
concerns and to protest Higgins' abduction. The rest of the
observer group remained Sunday in positions overlooking Beirut's
green line, which divides the city into Moslem and Christian
sectors, he said.
   Goksel declined to comment on reports that U.N. troops had
abandoned checkpoints around Tyre.
   Ten UNIFIL troops were withdrawn Thursday to Naqoura from an
area close to an Amal checkpoint on the Qassmieh highway bridge
north of the city. But UNIFIL troops did not withdraw from any of
their own checkpoints south and east of Tyre.
   UNIFIL units and Amal militiamen, aided by helicopters and dogs,
continued to search for Higgins Sunday in olive and citrus groves
and cave-lined valleys southeast of Tyre.
   Berri has called Higgins' abduction a threat to the security of
the predominantly Shiite population of south Lebanon. He said Amal
was bent on defending the U.N. peacekeeping force irrespective of
the nationality of its officers.
   Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a Hezbollah leader in south Lebanon,
was quoted by Beirut radio stations Sunday as saying he believes
the kidnappers have managed to smuggle Higgins out of the south.
   Obeid told warshippers at a mosque in the southern village of
Jibsheet that Higgins was in charge of UNIFIL's ``spying
operations.''
   As a condition of Higgins' release, the Oppressed on Earth has
demanded that Israel withdraw from the security zone it carved out
in south Lebanon when the bulk of its occupation army withdrew from
Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year invasion.
   It also demanded the release of Lebanese and Palestinian inmates
held at the Khiam detention camp in the security zone and in
Israeli jails.
   An estimated 300 detainees are believed held at Khiam, run by
militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
   Higgins was the third U.N. official abducted in south Lebanon in
three weeks.
   Jan Stening, 44, of Sweden and Willian Jorgensen, 58, of Norway,
both employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that cares for
Palestinian refugees, were kidnapped Feb. 5 near Sidon, 25 miles
north of Tyre.
   There are 22 other foreigners missing in Lebanon. They are eight
Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans, an
Italian, an Indian and two unidentified men.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Authorities on Sunday began freeing
detained Solidarity activists who had been stopped from attending a
weekend meeting of the outlawed trade union.
   In southeastern Poland, meanwhile, eight farmers protesting
higher prices were arrested.
   Police in the provincial city of Rzeszow detained the farmers
during a march by 150 people chanting: ``We want meat. We want
bread.'' The march followed a national gathering of the banned
farmers' union, Rural Solidarity.
   Earlier at a Mass in Rzeszow attended by 2,000 people, local
Bishop Ignacy Tokarczuk sharply criticized the government's
treatment of peasant farmers.
   ``The countryside should be united and only then it will win its
demands,'' he said.
   The farmers' meeting coincided with the seventh anniversity of
the government's 1981 agreement to recognize Rural Solidarity as a
bargaining agent for farmers. The union later was declared illegal
following the imposition of martial law.
   On Sunday, authorities began to free members of the Solidarity
free trade union's national executive commission jailed over the
weekend just before a planned meeting called in Gdansk by
Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa.
   At least seven of the commission's 10 members and the union's
national spokesman, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, were taken into custody
Friday and Saturday.
   Opposition sources said a small group of Solidarity activists
managed to meet anyway, and that a statement would be issued later.
   Zbigniew Bujak, former underground chief of the union and the
Warsaw-region representative on the commission, was freed Sunday
morning from a downtown Warsaw police station, said Ludwika Wujec,
a Warsaw Solidarity activist.
   Union sources said others released later in the day were:
Onyszkiewicz, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk of Wroclaw, Antoni Stawikowski of
Torun, Antoni Tokarczuk of Bydgoszcz and Stanislaw Weglarz of
Lublin.
   There was no confirmation of the release of Stefan Jurczak,
representative for the Krakow region, and Bogdan Lis of Gdansk, but
they were also expected to be freed.
   In a sermon Sunday in Gdansk's St. Brygida's Church, the Rev.
Henryk Jankowski spoke angrily about the detentions.
   ``Man's right to freedom and his freedom of thought are
trampled,'' said Jankowski, an adviser to Walesa. ``This is an act
of lawlessness that does moral harm to the nation.''

   Paramount Pictures and the Disney Co. are
running neck and neck as the two giant film companies continue
their battle for box office supremacy.
   For the past two years, Paramount has been the unqualified
leader among major distributors, scoring with such blockbusters as
``Top Gun,'' ``Crocodile Dundee'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop II.''
   Paramount's share of the domestic film market was 20 percent in
1987, according to Daily Variety financial expert Art Murphy.
Runners-up were Buena Vista, the Disney distributing company, with
14 percent, and Warner Bros. with 13.
   In the first two weeks of 1988, Buena Vista took the lead on the
strength of the smash hits ``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``Good
Morning Vietnam'' _ 26 percent to Paramount's 17. It was a happy
triumph for Disney chairman Michael Eisner and Jeff Katzenberg,
Disney's film production chief; both had previously worked for
Paramount.
   But no matter who takes the box-office crown, everybody wins in
1988.
   ``Movie booms last at least 2{ years; the longest has been 3{,''
Murphy said. ``This boom has lasted a year and a half, and I see no
slowdown.''
   The year has opened strongly, with a record take of $100 million
in January. The period from Jan. 1 to Memorial Day is traditionally
the slowest period of the movie year, contributing 20 percent of
annual ticket stales, compared to 40 percent for the three summer
months.
   What wonders will theaters offer in the first five months of
1988? The mixture, as before, has a heavy accent on comedy.
   John Hughes invades the yuppie world with ``She's Having a
Baby,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern. Ann-Margret
falls for her daughter's boyfriend, C. Thomas Howell, in ``A
Tiger's Tale.'' Joe Piscopo and Treat Williams play it for laughs
as cops in ``Dead Heat.''
   Neil Simon returns with the second of his autobiographical
trilogy, ``Biloxi Blues,'' with Matthew Broderick and directed by
Mike Nichols. George Roy Hill (``The Sting'') is back with ``Funny
Farm,'' in which New Yorkers Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith try the
rural life. Richard Pryor as an engineer moves his family from New
Jersey to Idaho in ``Moving.''
   The ageless George Burns changes brains with his grandson in
``18 Again,'' which might bring to mind ``Like Father Like Son.''
   ``The Gods Must Be Crazy II'' follow the adventures of the
engaging African bushman, N!Xau. Richard Dreyfuss continues his
roll as an actor who impersonates a Central American dictator in
``Moon Over Parador.''
   ``Front Page'' is replayed in TV land with Kathleen Turner, Burt
Reynolds and Christopher Reeve in ``Switching Channels.'' Sally
Field and Tom Hanks star as a pair of stand-up comics in
``Punchline.''
   Those raucous rookies return in ``Police Academy 5: Assignment
Miami Beach,'' this time without Steve Gutenberg.
   Distributors always release a heavy load of dramas in the early
part of the year, when competition for the youth market is at a
minimum. The most anticipated film is ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being,'' based on the modern classic novel by Milan Kundera. It is
the first movie by Philip Kaufman since ``The Right Stuff.''
   Also long-awaited is Robert Redford's first film as a director
since ``Ordinary People'' _ ``The Milangro Beanfield War,'' about a
New Mexico native who fights developers.
   After sinking with ``Pirates,'' Roman Polanski goes back to the
mystery-adventure genre with ``Frantic,'' starring Harrison Ford as
a surgeon whose wife disappears. Kelly McGillis and Jeff Daniels
appear in a postwar drama about the smuggling of Nazi criminals
into the United States, ``House on Carroll Street.'' Edward James
Olmos (``Miami Vice'') and Lou Diamond Phillips (``La Bamba'')
appear in ``Stand and Deliver,'' about a dedicated teacher in East
L.A.
   Roger Vadim has modernized his 1957 film ``And God Created
Women'' with Rebecca DeMornay in the role that helped make Brigitte
Bardot famous. Blake Edwards presents an imaginary teaming of Tom
Mix (Bruce Willis) and Wyatt Earp (James Garner) to solve a murder
mystery in ``Sunset.''
   Sidney Poitier returns to the screen as an FBI agent in a pair
of films: ``Shoot to Kill,'' a crime chase with Tom Beringer; and
``Little Nikita,'' with River Phoenix as son of Soviet spies.
   Alan Alda breaks his absence from films as director-writer-star
with Ann-Margret in ``A New Life,'' about a divorced pair seeking
new lives.
   In ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' Michael J. Fox abandons his
sunshiny image to play a cocaine-sniffing yuppie in the Manhattan
fast lane. Kelly McGillis and John Shea are pioneering Israelis in
``Dreamers.'' Don Johnson takes a shot at the big screen in ``Sweet
Hearts Dance,'' a romantic drama co-starring Susan Sarandon.
   The new year will bring plenty of action, too. Comic Jay Leno
makes his film debut as a Detroit cop teaming with a Tokyo
detective (Pat Morita) in ``Collision Course.'' Gene Hackman is a
pilot downed in Vietnam and Danny Glover is his rescuer in ``Bat
21.'' The Vietnam trend continues with ``Off Limits,'' in which
Willem Dafoe and Gregory Hines investigate murders of Vietnamese
prostitues.
   Academy Award winners William Hurt and Timothy Hutton combine
for a World War II thriller, ``Destiny.'' Sean Penn appears in two
films: ``Judgment in Berlin,'' as one of three East Berliners
escaping in an airplane; and in ``Colors'' as a police partner with
Robert Duvall battling Los Angeles gangs.
   The macho men are also back: Charles Bronson investigates Mormon
cult murders in ``Messenger of Death''; Scott Glenn is a cop who
becomes an Al Capone henchman in ``Verne Miller.''
   There's an ample supply of horror and teen films, as well as
some that are hard to classify: ``Eat the Rich,'' ``Killer Klowns
(from Outer Space),'' ``Hazing in Hell'' and ``Zombie Cop.''

<HEAD>Soviet Defector Says Waldheim Wasn't Working For Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was never a
Soviet agent, according to his former under-secretary at the United
Nations, Arkady Shevchenko, a Soviet defector who lives in the
United States, a London newspaper reported Sunday.
   In light of allegations surrounding Waldheim's service in the
German army during World War II, there has been speculation in the
Western press that the Soviets might have held incriminating
documents against him and threatened to use them if he did not
comply with their policies when he was U.N. secretary-general from
1972 to 1982.
   The Sunday Telegraph said it was told by Shevchenko in
Washington recently that the speculation is unfounded.
   Shevchenko was reported as saying the Soviet foreign ministry
had other candidates in mind when Waldheim's name first came up for
the U.N. post.
   ``It was only when we saw he was likely to emerge as clear
favorite that we gave him our backing and actually put him up for
the job,'' Shevchenko said.
   Shevchenko defected from his U.N. post in 1978. Before taking
his post at the United Nations he was secretary in Moscow to Andrei
Gromyko, then Soviet foreign minister.
   The defector said he saw Gromyko's personal file on Waldheim.
   ``It mentioned that he had fought on our Russian front and had
been wounded there. But there was absolutely no reference to any
war crimes,'' Shevchenko was quoted as saying.
   Shevchenko was further quoted as saying that senior officials of
the Soviet KGB secret police in charge of Soviet citizens in New
York, complained of their inability to influence Waldheim in
getting more Soviets appointed to his staff and of their being
frozen out of his inner circle.
   An international commission has investigated allegations
Waldheim was involved in German atrocities in the Balkans in World
War II while serving in the German army. Waldheim has repeatedly
denied the allegations and has rejected calls that he step down as
president.
   The historians' commission, formed by the Austrian government,
concluded this month that Waldheim was ``in close proximity'' to
some Nazi atrocities in the Balkans, knew they were going on and
made no attempt to prevent them. It also said Waldheim concealed
his wartime past and tried to make it seem harmless once he could
no longer hide it.
   The commmission's report did not support allegations Waldheim
committed atrocities. But it left open the question of whether he
was guilty of any crime.

<TEXT>
   A commuter plane that plowed through a
stand of trees just after taking off, killing 12, was only 3 years
old and had just been inspected, the company president said
Saturday.
   At least nine other people died in plane crashes Friday and
Saturday in New Jersey, Texas, California and Connecticut. One man
was missing and presumed dead.
   American Eagle commuter Flight 3378 had just taken off from
Raleigh-Durham Airport at Morrisville, N.C., on a flight to
Richmond, Va., when it disappeared from radar and crashed about
3,000 feet from the runway, officials said.
   ``It sounded like a blast or something ...,'' said Mary H. Ward,
who lives in a mobile home about three miles from the airport. ``It
wasn't too awful loud. It was kind of muffled.''
   ``The airplane is completely disintegrated,'' deputy airport
director R.C. Shackleford said Saturday.
   The plane apparently skimmed just over the surface of Beir Lake,
a flood-control reservoir that laps around the end of the runway,
and hit an earthen bank before crashing through tall pine trees.
   Some trees were broken off and others were skinned as much as
200 yards beyond the lake. Shackleford said the wreckage, with none
of the pieces more than 8 feet long, was scattered over about an
acre.
   ``We don't know what happened,'' Shackleford said. ``Anything
anybody tells you or anything you deduce is pure speculation.''
   ``There was no indication to the tower that the plane was in any
danger prior to takeoff,'' said Teresa Damiano, public affairs
manager for the airport.
   An investigative team from the National Transportation Safety
Board arrived Saturday from Washington, and two officials with the
state medical examiner's office in Chapel Hill were on the scene,
Ms. Damiano said.
   Donald Paschall, chief of airport security, said the crash was
reported at 9:27 p.m. Friday by a guard at a nearby construction
site.
   ``He just reported a loud crash and a ball of fire,'' Paschall
said.
   The victims were two crew members and 10 passengers, most from
North Carolina and Virginia.
   The deaths were the first fatalities in eight years of operation
by AVAir, American Eagle's parent company, said Larry Rednour, the
company's executive vice president.
   ``Our shock is all that much greater because this was a seasoned
crew operating their first flight of the day,'' Glenn Schaab,
president and chief executive officer of AVAir, said in a statement
issued Saturday. ``They were in a plane less than 3 years old,
which had undergone scheduled maintenance and inspection this
week.''
   And the pilot, Capt. Walter Cole, last week took a test flight
periodically required for commercial pilots. ``He passed without
any problem at all,'' Rednour said.
   The airplane was a Swearingen SW-4 twin-engine turboprop.
   A twin-engine plane of the same type crashed last month in
Colorado, killing nine people on a ski vacation. The plane was not
required to have cockpit voice recorders or flight data recorders,
said James P. Burke, a member of the NTSB investigative team
assigned to that crash.
   Elsewhere, three people were killed when a small plane crashed
in a wooded area about two miles from the airport at Atlantic City,
N.J., after a flight from Norwood, Mass.
   Kathleen Bergen, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman,
said the twin-engine Piper Navajo disappeared from radar in dense
fog and driving rain shortly after 10 p.m. Friday.
   Airport fire and rescue crews found the plane about an hour
later and worked throughout the night to remove the bodies, Ms.
Bergen said. They were hampered by the weather and deep woods.
   In Big Bear City, Calif., a pilot and a passenger were killed
when their small plane, practicing rollovers near the campsite of a
church group, crashed Saturday in the San Bernardino Mountains,
authorities said.
   No one on the ground was injured when the single-engine
Beechcraft Muskateer hit the ground at 3:15 p.m. near Dead Man's
Lake and Onyx Summit, said Jim Bryant, spokesman for the San
Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
   In El Paso, Texas, a twin-engine plane skimmed over morning
rush-hour traffic and crashed on a freeway access road, killing all
three people aboard and spewing flaming debris that destroyed two
parked cars, authorities said.
   ``It looked like it was going to attempt maybe to come onto the
freeway, but as soon as it got over the freeway, it just
nosedived,'' said motorist Victor Armendariz.
   The Gulfstream Commander 680 went down in moderate snow and
light fog after takeoff Friday from El Paso International Airport,
NTSB spokesman Tommy McFall said.
   The pilot ``was still in radio contact with the tower,'' NTSB
spokesman Tommy McFall said of the pilot. ``The pilot said that he
was having trouble with the landing gear and was coming back to the
airport.''
   A small cargo plane operated by U.S. Express went down in Long
Island Sound off Stratford, Conn., early Saturday. One body was
found and authorities called in divers to help search for the body
of a second man, said Stratford police Sgt. Andrew Knapp.
   The search was called off in the afternoon and there were no
plans to resume it, Coast Guard Petty Officer Roberto M. Ramos
said. Authorities said the man was presumed dead.
   The plane was en route from Albany, N.Y., to Boston, with a
scheduled refueling stop at Bridgeport, Conn., authorities said.
   Besides the pilot, the victims of the North Carolina crash were
identified by AVAir as 1st Officer Kathy Digan; Glenn Bogitsh and
Libby Bogitsh, both of Nashville, Tenn.; Terry Bower, Mike Grindle,
John Oliver, Richard W. Ross and Marcia Ferris, all of Richmond;
Henry Lewis, U.S. Army stationed at Fort Lee in Richmond; Chris
Wells of the Raleigh, N.C., area; and Roger Wilcox of Florida.
   The New Jersey crash victims were identified as pilot Thomas
Johnson, 22, of Philadelphia; co-pilot Thomas Thorn, 40, of
Pleasantville, N.J.; and passenger Simon Siegel, 69, of Brookline,
Mass.
   The Texas crash victims were identified as Jesus Aaron Puentes,
11; his mother, Rosa Linda Puentes, 31; and pilot Don McCoy, 57,
all of El Paso.
   Roberto Nucifero of Plymouth, Mass., died in the Connecticut
crash. Missing and presumed dead was Henry Lipincott of Sandwich,
Mass., police said.
   Names of the victims of the California crash were withheld
pending notification of relatives.

   William Claiborne ``Red'' Hayes Jr., the
NASA official who greeted astronaut John Glenn after his
history-making flight in 1962, died Saturday. He was 63.
   Hayes, who spent 27 years with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, directed the at-sea recovery efforts that
plucked astronauts from the ocean after their space capsules had
returned to Earth.
   When Glenn was brought aboard the Navy aircraft carrier Randolph
after America's first manned orbital flight, Hayes was the first to
greet him and shake his hand.
   Hayes, a Norfolk native, joined the National Advisory Committee
on Aeronautics in 1952 and was there when NASA was organized a few
years later.
   From 1952 to 1961, he was assigned to NASA's Langley Research
Center where he worked with wind-tunnel research.
   In 1961 he was transferred to the Manned Spacecraft Center in
Houston, Texas, and was given charge of the Recovery Operations
Section. Hayes directed the recovery of astronauts Glenn, Scott
Carpenter, Walter Schirra and Gus Grissom.
   The rescues were not without mishaps. Grissom had to be rescued
after his capsule sank, and Carpenter's capsule seemed to disappear
after its re-entry into the atmosphere and it took an hour to
locate it. When Carpenter was finally airlifted to the carrier
Intrepid, Hayes again was first in line to shake his hand.
   In 1969, Hayes became director of the Advanced Aerospace
Projects Office at NASA-Langley, and in 1971 he was named executive
assistant for planning in the office of the director for Center
Development and External Affairs at Langley.
   A year later, he was named director of the Manned Space
Technology Office at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., where
he was responsible for the development of advanced technology
requirements for the Space Shuttle, space stations, planetary
spacecraft and other projects.
   Hayes retired in 1979.
   He is survived by a wife, Mildred McWilliams Hayes; a son; and a
daughter. Funeral services were scheduled for Monday in
Purcellville.

   Much of the city fire department's day
shift called in sick Saturday, apparently because of a dispute with
city officials over the equipping of new emergency units, a city
spokeswoman said.
   The city late Saturday afternoon persuaded Superior Court Judge
John E. Orton III to issue a temporary restraining order requiring
the firefighters to return to work Sunday, said Barbara Cottam,
spokeswoman for Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. It is illegal for
municipal employees to strike in Rhode Island.
   Leo Miller, president of Providence Firefighters Local 799, said
he expected the firefighters to return to work Sunday. City
officials had vowed to return to Orton and seek contempt citations
if the job action continued, Ms. Cottam said.
   ``That's what the city tells you,'' was all Miller would say
when asked if the sickout was organized as part of a contract
dispute. ``What I'm going to say is that we thought we had a
contract with them but they have reneged.''
   Neither Ms. Cottam nor Miller had figures on the number of
firefighters who called in sick. The city covered the shifts of the
absent workers by holding the Friday night shift over, Ms. Cottam
said.
   The city, in a contract reached last year with the firefighters'
union, agreed to increase the number of rescue units in the
department from three to five.
   Ms. Cottam said the union is insisting that the two new units,
like the existing ones, be equipped with advanced life-support
equipment.
   ``That was never discussed or agreed to and it is not
necessary,'' Ms. Cottam said. ``The need is not there.''
   She also said the department does not have enough rescue workers
with the special training required for the advanced life-support
systems to staff five units.

   Two women were killed and two wounded Saturday
night after they were herded into an apartment bedroom, bound and
shot execution-style in an apparent drug related incident, police
and television reports said.
   Officers found one woman dead at the apartment in the Northwest
section of the nation's capital and a second woman was pronounced
dead at the Washington Hospital Center, said police Capt. William
Ritchie. He said police were seeking four suspects.
   The Washington Hospital Center was treating a third victim in
its intensive care unit, a spokeswoman, who refused to be
identified, said. The fourth woman, who was shot in the arm, was
treated at Howard University Hospital and released, said
administrator Deborah Shields.
   Reporters on the scene for WRC-TV and WTTG-TV said police
entered the apartment to find one woman dead of a gunshot wound to
the head and two others severely wounded. Four small children, some
of them in diapers, were huddled around.
   The woman shot in the arm managed to crawl to a neighbor's
apartment and called for help, the TV reports said. Police said
they received the call at 7:21 p.m.
   The television reports said the women were described by the
police as in their early 20s and as possibly Jamaican.
   On Jan. 22, police in nearby Prince Georges County, Md., found
four men and one woman shot dead in what was also described as a
drug-related slaying. Police have issued arrest warrants in that
case for three Jamaican men from Brooklyn, N.Y.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said his
government wants to play ``a more active role'' in the search for
an Arab-Israeli settlement as he opened talks Sunday with Secretary
of State George P. Shultz.
   The issue of Soviet participation is among key items on Shultz'
agenda for his two days of talks here.
   Shultz on Saturday said the Soviets should ``face up'' to their
human rights problems and establish relations with Israel if they
intend to take part in the talks he will try to set up when he goes
to the Middle East next week.
   But Shevardnadze, chatting with a reporter while waiting for
Shultz at the Soviet Foreign Ministry's elegant guest house in
central Moscow, said his government already was playing a
``constructive role'' in the region.
   ``We want to play a more active role also in the negotiations,''
he said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has resisted Soviet
participation in the search for a Middle East settlement.
   The Soviets have supported Jordan and Egypt in calling for an
international conference to serve as a framework for Arab-Israeli
negotiations. Shamir is cool to the idea, and appears to have
support from Shultz.
   Shultz' talks here are intended to prepare for the next
superpower summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It is to be held in Moscow, likely by
mid-summer, but the date has not been set.
   A date could be set before Shultz departs.
   Shultz flew in from Helsinki, Finland, where on Saturday he met
with reporters to discuss Soviet policy on human rights and
regional problems.
   The presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan and U.S. support
for Afghan rebels is also on the agenda. Gorbachev announced
earlier this month that a Soviet pullout could begin May 15 and be
completed within 10 months if U.N.-sponsored negotiations in Geneva
next month can put together a formal agreement by March 15.
   Talks between Soviet and U.S. officials traditionally cover four
areas _ arms control, human rights, matters of bilateral interest
and regional conflicts.

   Talks between representatives of Pan Am Corp.
and 4,500 Teamsters workers broke up Sunday after continuing six
hours past a 12:01 a.m. strike deadline, and union officials said
employees would return to work Sunday.
   The negotiations, aimed at resolving a dispute over Pan Am's
demands for wage cuts and work-rule changes, were scheduled to
resume Sunday afternoon, said Alex Calder, a spokesman for the
Teamsters' airlines division.
   Calder refused to discuss the status of the talks, saying the
union leadership is hesitant to read too much into them.
   Earlier Sunday, William Genoese, director of the airline
division of Teamsters Local 732, announced that the workers had
overwhelmingly authorized a strike, although he refused to release
figures on the vote.
   ``These people are fed up,'' he said of the workers. The
Teamsters union contends it has made sufficient concessions to aid
the financially ailing airline.
   Pan Am said that in case of a strike, it would maintain service
by using replacement workers for the union members, who are
employed as reservation clerks, customer service agents and in
various clerical positions.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said talks resumed at 10:30
p.m. Saturday in New York at the request of a federal mediator.
   Genoese said that despite the resumption of talks, there was a
good chance of a strike. ``They waited too long. They dragged their
feet,'' he said.
   The 12:01 a.m. deadline marked the end of a 30-day cooling-off
period mandated by the government.
   The Transport Workers Union voted Friday not to support a
Teamsters' strike, and the financially ailing airline's pilots,
flight attendants and flight engineers unions were not expected to
back a strike.
   Another Pan Am spokesman, Jeff Kriendler, said: ``The company is
prepared to negotiate and wants a settlement. But if there is a
strike we're fully prepared to operate.''
   Replacement workers, including management employees, were
trained and ready to replace strikers, Kriendler said.
   Genoese said Thursday that there was enough support for Local
732 among other Teamsters locals to cut off the airline's supplies
of fuel, laundry and liquor around the world.
   The union represents workers at airports in Boston, Detroit,
Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Hawaii,
Houston, Washington, New York and the Florida cities of Tampa,
Orlando and Miami.
   About 2,300 of the workers are employed in New York and another
1,300 are in Miami, Goenese said.

<HEAD>China Not Expected to Block Iranian Arms Embargo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China reaped a $1 billion bonanza from weapons
sales to Iran last year, but is not expected to block an Iranian
arms embargo the United States is seeking in the United Nations
Security Council, U.S. officials said.
   The most recent U.S. intelligence estimates show that Iran
received up to 65 percent of its armaments from China last year,
said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   American experts were quoted four months ago as saying Chinese
arms to Iran were flowing at a rate of $1 billion a year, and the
officials said that figure appears to have held up through the end
of 1987.
   China also has sold huge amounts of weapons to Iraq since the
beginning of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, but those sales slacked off
last year, the officials said.
   There is still some question whether China is continuing to ship
Silkworm missiles to Iran, according to the officials. These
anti-ship missiles are the most notorious weapons in the Iranian
arsenal because they have been fired from shoreline batteries
against international shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   The United States _ notably during a face-to-face confrontation
by Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Beijing last spring _
pleaded with China to stop the Silkworm sales. For months, China
denied the sales were taking place. Then it acknowledged that Iran
may have been getting them indirectly through other countries and
said it would try to stop that flow.
   ``This was construed as a face-saving way for China to say two
things at the same time: they weren't selling Silkworms to Iran and
that they were stopping them,'' an official said.
   Also in Iran's arsenal of Chinese weapons are small arms,
ammunition, machine guns and artillery, the officials said.
   The United States has protested the sales by ending a
decade-long process of easing restrictions on the type of high-tech
U.S. equipment China can buy. The decision will make it harder for
China to buy computers and advanced electronics now reaching the
market.
   According to one official, China has sold $7 billion in arms to
Iran and Iraq since 1979, but Congressional Research Service
estimates indicate this figure might be inflated.
   In a report to Congress last May, the service estimated that
China's total arms sales to all Third World countries totaled
nearly $7.3 billion between 1979 and 1986. In the last four years
of that period, China ranked fourth, behind the Soviet Union, the
United States and France, in that order, in sales to Third World
countries.
   Even with the discrepancy, ``there's no doubt that Chinese sales
to Iran are very large,'' a congressional expert said.
   Last July 20, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
calling upon Iran and Iraq to end the war and said it would follow
with a second resolution imposing an arms embargo on whichever
country failed to heed the truce call.
   Iraq has agreed to a cease-fire, but Iran has not, so the United
States and its allies on the U.N. body are now pressing for the
arms embargo against Tehran.
   Shultz is expected to press the Soviets, during talks in Moscow
this week, to agree to the second resolution.
   China, a permanent member of the Security Council, theoretically
could veto an arms embargo resolution.
   An official specializing in Chinese affairs said, however, the
Chinese are unlikely to exercise that right.
   ``China has always taken a passive role at the United Nations,''
the official said. `` Being influential at the U.N. goes against
the Chinese view that it should not seek to hegemony in world
affairs, as it charges the United States and the Soviet Union
always does.''
   ``They are not going to favor the resolution _ it will hurt them
too much financially _ but they probably won't block it,'' the
official said.

   State officials have silenced a proposal
by two units of the Department of Environmental Protection for a
morning ``quiet hour.''
   Employees in the water pollution and waste disposal units
planned to initiate a ``quiet hour'' from 10 a.m. to noon. During
that time employees wouldn't take calls or visitors without an
appointment.
   Supervisors said the department's office building in Hartford
was so noisy and crowded that employees needed the time to get work
done.
   ``The building is a pit. We've got to do something to make it
possible for people to do their work,'' said Michael J. Harder,
assistant director of the department's water compliance unit.
   The proposal, however, was rejected. ``We're a public agency,
and we have to remain open to the public,'' Deputy DEP Commissioner
John Anderson said Friday.

   Two men were accused in a federal indictment
of persuading more than 1,000 people to invest $12.6 million in
recordings by celebrities, which were promoted as tax shelters.
   The recordings, which included a cooking lesson, sports
instruction program and religious story, were performed by
celebrities including Tommy Lasorda, Vincent Price, Billy Dee
Williams, Pat Boone, Dale Evans and Shirley Jones.
   None of the celebrities was accused of wrongdoing.
   According to the indictment unsealed Friday, the programs were
operated in 1981 and 1982 by Entertainment Marketing Co. Inc.,
which was based in Hollywood and controlled by Johnathan D'Orio,
40, now of Akron, Ohio, and Daniel F. Schustack, 38, now of New
York City.
   The indictment alleged the two bilked 1,150 investors out of
more than $12.6 million by inflating the value of the audio tapes
and promising huge tax credits.
   The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the tax deductions and
credits and assessed interest and substantial penalties against
investors, Katz said.
   D'Orio was due in court in Akron on Monday, while Schustack will
be summoned to appear in court in Los Angeles, Assistant U.S.
Attorny David Katz said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of homeless people in Boston rose more
than 17 percent to about 3,400 in the last 15 months, and more
women and children are living on Boston's streets and in its
shelters than ever before, according to preliminary results of a
survey.
   Ann Maguire, director of Boston's Emergency Shelter Commission,
said the new figures were complied from a homeless census taken
early Friday, when more than 100 volunteers counted homeless people
in city streets and alleys.
   Boston officials said no other city in the country does similar
street counts. The first street census of the city's homeless,
conducted in November 1986, found about 2,900 homeless people.
   Of the approximately 3,400 counted Friday, 20.4 percent were
women, 10.5 percent children and adolescents and the rest men,
Maguire said Saturday.
   A survey of 26 cities released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors
in December found a 21 percent increase in the demand for emergency
shelter, ranging from a 44 percent jump in Kansas City to no change
in Louisville.
   The national survey found families with children accounting for
one third of homeless in 1987.
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn is chairman of the mayors
conference Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness. Boston increases
its number of shelter beds last year by 47 percent, Maguire said.
   In a telephone interview Saturday night, Flynn called on other
cities to conduct similar surveys to give the mayors conference a
weapon during congressional budget deliberations.
   Flynn said most members of Congress ``believe the problem is
basically confined to street people and don't realize the number of
families and mentally ill. We need the data to impress that upon
them.''

   A sphinx small enough to fit in the palm

ago, one of a bounty of clues that may link two ancient
civilizations, experts said Sunday.
   The sphinx, only 1{ inches tall, was among 420 trinkets found
dangling from a necklace found at the burial site, which dates back
to 200 B.C. to 200 A.D., Abdel-Aziz Soweileh, Bahrain's antiquities
supervisor, was quoted as saying in the newspaper Akhbar Al-Khaleej.
   Also found was a scarab, a beetle-shaped insignia, and a perfume
vial. Analysis of a skeleton in the grave indicated it belonged to
a woman who was between the ages of 25 and 30 when she died.
   The newspaper quoted Soweileh as saying that the items may link
Bahrain's ancient Dilmun civilizations with Pharaonic Egypt. The
sphinx typically has the body of a lion and head of a man.

worth of stamps for $4 in the Baltimore, Washington and Richmond
areas.
   There are two catches: sales are limited to one per family per
store visit and the stamps come inside a booklet of price-off
coupons, which only adds to the bargain for coupon clippers.
   Both Safeway and the Postal Service expect to make money on the
project. The Postal Service sells the stamps to the stores at full
price. Safeway would benefit from sales generated by the coupons,
some of which are for Safeway products.
   Stamp-Ad, Inc., of Houston originated the idea. The company
sells the coupon ads to manufacturers. The advertising sales cover
both the cost of the booklet and the difference in the stamp price.
   Brad McClain, president of Stamp-Ad, said he got the idea by
wondering about more effective ways to get cents-off coupons into
the hands of consumers.
   ``My wife is an avid coupon user and every Sunday my living room
looked like a cyclone hit it because of clipping the newspaper
supplements,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Though the program is still in the testing stage, ``it's doing
quite well,'' McClain said.
   Besides the Washington area, Safeway has tested the cheap stamp
sales in Houston and Denver, said Safeway advertising manager Don
Zettle of Landover, Md.
   ``Does the postmaster general know about this?'' ask
lighthearted advertisements for the Washington-area sales.
   The answer is yes, and the U.S. Postal Service is delighted with
the idea.
   ``As far as I'm concerned they can give them away,'' said
Charles Hughes, retail sales manager for the Postal Service.
   ``For us, it's a very successful way of getting stamps into
hands of people,'' Hughes said.
   Folks who work a 10-or-12-hour day and stop by for a TV-dinner
and salad on their way home now can buy stamps, too, without having
to go to a post office, he said. Many supermarkets have long been
selling stamps, which they buy at full price, as a convenience to
customers, but this is the first time they have, in effect, gone on
sale, said Hughes.
   ``The real proof of the pudding to (the stores) won't be known
until people come back in and start redeeming the coupons,'' he
said.
   Hughes said there have been other proposals to combine stamps
and advertising, but they have not met with much success.
   Periodically people suggest selling the right to advertise right
on postage stamps themselves or gluing the stamps onto advertising
labels and then selling both at a price lower than the stamp,
Hughes said.
   A 1909 law prohibits the attaching of advertising to official
government material.
   Even without the law, stamp collectors would resist the idea of
ads on stamps, and the Postal Service doesn't want to be in the
position of deciding who can buy ads and who cannot, Hughes said.
   In the Safeway promotion, the stamps are in a separate folder
attached to the coupon booklet and can be pulled out for use
separately.

<HEAD>Bombs Injure 20 In Chittagong Marches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attackers hurled homemade bombs at
opposition party processions on the eve of a national holiday and
injured 20 people, police said Sunday.
   The injured included two policemen who were escorting the
marches in the port city of Chittagong around midnight Saturday.
   The attackers' identities were not known, police said when
contacted by telephone in Chittagong, 145 miles southeast of Dhaka.
   The marchers, from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the
pro-Moscow Communist Party of Bangladesh, were headed to the
Martyrs Monument to place wreaths as part of Sunday's nationwide
observance of Language Martyrs Day.
   The holiday commemorates the killing of six Dhaka University
students in 1952, when Bangladesh was part of Pakistan. The
students were shot to death by police during a demonstration
demanding that Bengali be made a state language.
   Bengali is the main language of Bangladesh, formerly called East
Pakistan. After the 1952 language campaign, Bengali was made an
official language of Pakisan, along with the Urdu of West Pakistan.
But the Urdu-speaking West continued to dominate the nation until
Bangladesh won independence in 1971.
   Language Martyrs Day was observed Sunday throughout Bangladesh,
including Dhaka, the capital, where opposition leaders Sheik Hasina
and Khaleda Zia placed wreaths at the Martyrs Monument outside
Dhaka University. There were no reports of trouble outside
Chittagong.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, a former army general who
writes poetry, planned to observe the day by reciting some of his
compositions to guests at his home.
   Hasina is leader of the Awami League and Mrs. Zia is head of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Both women are spearheading a
3-month-old opposition campaign for Ershad's resignation.
   The protests frequently have turned violent as the opposition
presses ahead with strikes and rallies aimed at forcing Ershad to
vacate the presidency, which he assumed after leading a bloodless
coup in 1982.

<HEAD>AMA Journal Heads to Court over Anonymous Mercy Killing Article</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's leading medical journals is
headed for court in what may be its most serious editorial
controversy _ the publication of an anonymous article by a doctor
who described committing a mercy killing.
   The Cook County state's attorney's office wants the name of the
doctor, but the Journal of the American Medical Association, citing
a state free-press law, says it will be in court Monday seeking to
quash the subpoena.
   Letters to the journal have been about evenly split on whether
JAMA should have printed the anonymous essay.
   It's not the first time in recent years the 105-year-old
journal, the official publication of the country's largest
organization of physicians, has found itself in a clash over its
contents.
   In 1984, a U.S. Army medical expert charged that AMA officials
killed a story he had submitted on smoking so they could win favor
with politicians in tobacco-growing states.
   Two years earlier, the journal was accused of publishing an
article on heart medicine to placate a major drug company that was
an advertiser.
   JAMA officials denied the charges in both cases.
   The latest case involves the broader issues of press freedom and
mercy killing.
   In the Jan. 8 essay, titled, ``It's Over, Debbie,'' a doctor
described injecting a lethal dose of morphine into a woman dying of
ovarian cancer. He wrote that he did not know the patient, but was
asked to check on her and moved by her plea of ``Let's get this
over with.''
   AMA officials said they did not verify the incident but believed
it was based on fact. They said the author had requested anonymity.
The essay did not indicate where the doctor lived or where the
incident occurred.
   Last week, the Cook County state's attorney's office served JAMA
with a subpoena ordering it to name the writer of the article.
   AMA attorney Kirk Johnson said the journal would not comply.
JAMA officials said their attorneys would file a motion Monday to
dismiss the subpoena.
   The magazine's editors invoked the Illinois Reporters' Privilege
Act, saying it protected information obtained by reporters in the
course of their work. That means a judge must decide whether the
release of the author's identity is essential to the public
interest.
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for
Freedom of the Press, believes JAMA shouldn't have to release the
doctor's name.
   ``Even assuming a criminal activity occurred _ which I'm not
saying it did _ what possible justification does Illinois have to
say it occurred in their state? JAMA gets articles from all over
the country,'' said Ms. Kirtley, whose Washington-based group
provides legal and research assistance for journalists.
   JAMA, which has a circulation of 600,000 worldwide, including
365,000 in the United States, is one of the nation's most widely
read medical journals.
   Though it is generally considered less prestigious than the
Boston-based New England Journal of Medicine, it has ``a high
impact in clinical practice,'' said Dr. Eugene Garfield, president
of the Institute for Scientific Information, based in Philadelphia.
   Dr. George Lundberg, editor in chief of JAMA, said Friday he
received unanimous support from the AMA board on his decision to
run the article.
   ``We believe that the great issues of the day in medicine should
be debated primarily on the pages of JAMA,'' he said.
   Lundberg, 54, has sole authority to approve JAMA articles for
publication. When he became editor in 1982, he said he intended to
handle controversial issues more aggressively and make doctors more
aware of patients as people.
   JAMA has received 90 to 100 letters in response to the anonymous
article, according to a spokesman for the AMA, who refused to give
his name.
   While some of the letters have voiced opposition to euthanasia,
the rest have addressed whether JAMA should have published the
article _ and are evenly divided on whether the journal should have
published the article, the spokesman said.
   Dr. Edward J. Huth, editor of the Philadelphia-based Annals of
Internal Medicine, noted JAMA's willingness to take on
controversial issues such as AIDS and artificial hearts.
   However, he said, ``From my own point of view, we would never
publish an anonymous piece in a scholarly journal.''

   Ed Kowas has a lot of friends in Mendocino,
even though he wasn't very honest with them during his more than
three years in town.
   They don't seem troubled that the local radio talk show host's
name is really Leon Edmond Kowalski, that he concealed his past, or
that he's under a federal indictment and plans to plead guilty to a
charge of income tax evasion.
   ``I don't think anybody's crazy about the IRS,'' snapped
supporter Paula Creasey of nearby Albion. ``I'm sympathetic toward
Ed; he's done a good job on his talk show.''
   Kowalski arrived in Mendocino, a coastal tourist center some 140
miles north of San Francisco, in November 1984 and took a variety
of jobs.
   By that time, the Internal Revenue Service had already been
investigating him for more than a year.
   He was intentionally vague about his past, and traveled by
bicycle because he was afraid to apply for a California driver's
license.
   ``We figured he was on the lam from something, but we thought
maybe it was a bad marriage,'' said Bruce Anderson,
editor-publisher of the Anderson Valley (Calif.) Advertiser and an
occasional guest on Kowalski's show.
   A federal grand jury in Grand Rapids, Mich., indicted him in
December 1986, and just over two weeks ago two IRS agents showed up
at radio station KMFB, where ``Ed Kowas'' was host of the daily
morning talk show ``On The Record,'' and arrested him.
   The station received more than 500 letters and calls of support.
A man from Michigan sent in a check for $25 to help defray legal
costs.
   KMFB president George Anderson put up $5,000 as surety on
$50,000 bail and pledged his $1,300-a-month employee ``100 percent
support from me; I will do whatever I can.''
   The good feelings aren't universal. A week after Kowalski's
arrest, a woman called him on the air, demanding he be held
accountable.
   He readily agreed, telling his audience he'll probably have to
go to jail for awhile, then spend the rest of his life repaying the
money he owes.
   ``I made a mistake and I'm ready to pay for it,'' Kowalski, 47,
said in a telephone interview.
   ``I plan on pleading guilty,'' he said. ``What I did was wrong.
I'm not going to try and weasel out. I hope that people will learn
from my mistake.''
   Last week, he agreed to plead guilty to one count in exchange
for permission to have his case adjudicated in San Francisco. He
could draw five years in jail and a $150,000 fine on charges he
failed to report about $75,000 in income on his 1981 and 1982
returns.
   Kowalski said he was undone because he took on too many burdens.
   ``For six years I was a deputy district attorney in St. Joe
County, Ind., prosecuting criminal cases, including felony jury
trials,'' he said. ``Then, I decided to make a major transition.''
   In 1972 and 1973, he said, it seemed that more and more criminal
defendants were turning out to be Vietnam veterans. ``It bothered
me, and I made a determination to use my skills on the opposite,
the defense side.''
   Kowalski moved to Lake County, Mich., where he went into general
practice. In January 1979 he was named a part-time probate-juvenile
judge, a post he held for four years. Since the job was only
part-time, he started representing farmers in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
cases.
   ``It was a very unprofitable situation representing the farmers,
because of their own insolvency,'' said Kowalski. He estimated he
was making about $100,000 a year at the time.
   In August 1983, said Kowalski, the IRS notified him he was under
investigation. By that time, he said, he had three children and was
divorced from his second wife.
   He said that when he left Michigan in 1984, the IRS ``had made
no seizures, had filed no charges, had made no type of lien against
me. There was no order that I shouldn't leave town. I left.''
   He claims he never knew he had been indicted and never realized
he was a fugitive, though he admits he had suspicion.
   ``I made an error,'' he said. ``I was totally wrong. I plan on
pleading guilty, paying any kind of penalty and advising others not
to make the same mistake.''

   Israeli soldiers shot three Palestinians to
death Sunday in the West Bank, the army said, and clashes broke out
in towns and villages throughout the occupied territories.
   A military spokesman said two people were killed in the town of
Nablus, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, and another person was killed
in Ramallah, 10 miles north of Jerusalem.
   A doctor at Al-Ittihad hospital identified the Nablus victims as
Ramez Abu Amara, 18, who was shot in the heart, and Ahmed Saler Abu
Saler, 50, shot in the head.
   The doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 17 other
people were being treated at the hospital for gunshot wounds.
   The third victim was identified by hospital sources in Ramallah
and by the Arab-run Palestine Press Service as Kamal Mohammed
Fares, 24. They said he was shot in the chest during a
demonstration at the Deir Ammar refugee camp and died in the
emergency room.
   Hospital sources said two people were being treated for gunshot
wounds.
   According to U.N. figures, 62 Arabs have been killed since
unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The figure
includes the death of a 12-year-old boy who died Saturday in the
Tulkarem refugee camp. The army is investigating the circumstances
of his death.
   A new leaflet was distributed throughout the occupied
territories, setting out a plan for Palestinian resistance to
coincide with this week's visit of Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.
   The leaflet, signed by the ``United National Leadership of the
Uprising,'' called for a series of strikes and demonstrations.
   ``Let us increase the occupation's political, moral and economic
losses and remember that the Vietnamese won their war against the
Americans not only with guns but also through the struggle of their
peasants,'' it said.
   In what has become a daily scenario, Arabs in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, seized by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war, threw
stones and bottles at soldiers, who retaliated with tear gas.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. aircraft carrier Coral Sea, along with the
Yorktown, a guided missile cruiser, and the destroyer Rickets,
dropped anchor in Haifa for what officials said was a regularly
scheduled visit, to last about a week.
   Asked if the visit was connected to Wednesday's kidnapping in
southern Lebanon of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a U.N.
observer, Rear Adm. John K. Redy said no, but added the force would
be ready to take any action.
   ``I'm aware of what's going on in south Lebanon,'' he said.
``Our mission is not connected to that. I will not comment on
operational matters, but the mission of the Sixth Fleet is to be
ready to meet any contingency or any eventuality.''
   A clandestine pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist group claims
to have abducted Higgins.
   Shultz is tentatively scheduled to arrive on Thursday for talks
on how to achieve a Middle East settlement.
   The leaflet's outline for ``national outrage in the face of the
Shultz visit'' calls for a day of solidarity Monday with those who
have died, been arrested or wounded in the unrest.
   A national hunger strike is set for Tuesday, general strikes for
Wednesday and Thursday, a day of demonstrations all over the
territories on Friday and a general defiance of curfews on Saturday.
   It was the eighth such leaflet published since the uprising
began.

   Cardinal Jaime Sin said Sunday that
vigilante groups should concentrate on helping the poor and leave
the 19-year-old battle against communist rebels to the military.
   Sin, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Manila, said it also was
important to distinguish between rebels who espouse communism and
those who fight because they are poor and jobless with no hope of
lawful endeavors.
   Those rebels ``must be reintegrated again into society,'' he
said in a pastoral letter read in churchs throughout the capital.
   ``For those who take the gun, who espouse violence, who seek to
overthrow the government, who act without any regard for the value
of human life, the military authorities would be in the best
position to prescribe and implement the correct strategy,'' Sin
said.
   ``We in the church will be there to support the government's
counter-insurgency efforts,'' he said. ``It is our duty to be
peacemakers and we will do everything we can to promote peace.''
   Sin previously had expressed support for the military-backed
vigilante groups. But he said Sunday that when he made his earlier
remarks, ``I was expressing my approval of their concern for the
welfare and suffering of the poor.''
   The military maintains the vigilantes are needed to supplement
the armed forces. Critics charge the vigilantes are little more
than armed thugs who are guilty of widespread human rights
violations.

<HEAD>Sir John Mills At 80: Tributes To A Trouper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir John Mills, the elegant British actor who won
an Oscar in 1970 for his role as a hunchback in ``Ryan's
Daughter,'' turns 80 Monday with tributes from fans and colleagues
in a country that takes its leading men seriously.
   The actor, whose career has spanned 55 years and more than 120
films and plays, is being feted with honorific articles and film
retrospectives.
   ``His great achievement has been to show the qualities of
English decency operating at every level of society,'' wrote
Jeffrey Richards in The Daily Telegraph in an appreciation entitled
``The English Everyman.''
   Sir Richard Attenborough, the Academy Award-winning director of
``Gandhi'' and a longtime friend and colleague, said Mills ``gave
film acting in England an integrity and a stature that nobody else
did precisely in that way.''
   In a TV program, ``John Mills: 80 Years On,'' aired Friday by
the British Broadcasting Corp., Attenborough said Mills possessed
``the image and the charisma of a major movie star who is
essentially an indigenous movie star. ... He belongs to his own
country and epitomizes his own country.''
   In the same program, Mills tells interviewer Christopher
Frayling of his particular affection for Britain.
   ``I'm mad about the country. I really like it. I've been all
over the world, everywhere, (but) ... I'm always absolutely
delighted to come home,'' said Mills, who was knighted by Queen
Elizabeth II in 1976.
   These are appropriate sentiments for an actor whose career
embraces such classic British films as ``In Which We Serve'' in
1942, Noel Coward and David Lean's stirring war movie; Lean's
``Great Expectations'' in 1946; Bryan Forbes' ``The Wrong Box'' in
1966; and Attenborough's own ``Oh, What A Lovely War'' in 1969.
   Many of the films are featured in a 10-week retrospective
beginning Sunday on BBC TV, and a 20-film series at the National
Film Theater that culminates Feb. 28 with a lecture by the actor.
   Despite his screen acclaim playing archetypically British
military servicemen alongside a variety of character parts, Mills
began his career as a theatrical song-and-dance man in the chorus
line of ``The Five O'Clock Girl'' at the London Hippodrome in 1929.
   By the early 1930s, he was appearing in Noel Coward's lavish
``Cavalcade'' and in his 1932 ``Words and Music.''
   His first screen role was as a hoofing midshipman opposite
Jessie Matthews in ``The Midshipmaid'' in 1932, but his first
significant part was in the World War I naval adventure movie,
``Brown On Resolution'' in 1935.
   The 1930s and '40s saw his burgeoning professional relationships
with Noel Coward and David Lean, as well as the beginning of his
friendship with Attenborough, his co-star in ``In Which They
Serve'' and his director on three different movies: ``Lovely War,''
``Young Winston,'' and ``Gandhi.''
   In 1941, Mills married the playwright and former actress Mary
Hayley Bell. They have three children, two of whom _ Hayley and
Juliet _ are noted actresses.
   ``They're both awfully good,'' Mills said.
   In 1970, the actor, known for his deftness with accents, won an
Oscar for best supporting actor playing the mute village idiot,
Michael, in ``Ryan's Daughter.''
   ``It was weird,'' he joked. ``I just thought I'd been wasting my
time for the past 55 years learning all these millions of lines,
and then getting an Oscar for not speaking.''
   In 1980, he wrote his autobiography, ``Up in the Clouds,
Gentlemen Please,'' and he has recently revived his stage career.
   Two years ago, Mills starred at the National Theater opposite
Rosemary Harris in Brian Clark's ``The Petition,'' which later
moved to London's commercial West End.
   Last April, he opened on Broadway in an all-star revival of
George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion,'' playing Doolittle, the dustman.
   But he said his grandchildren have their own favorite Mills role
_ his part with Madonna in last year's flop movie, ``Who's That
Girl?''
   ``(To them), that was the greatest thing I could possibly have
done,'' Mills said.

   Six medical relief workers from
Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands were abducted by a rebel group
in the Ethiopian province of Tigre, officials said Sunday.
   Kidnapped were two nuns and a doctor from Ireland and two
Belgian doctors and a Dutch nurse affiliated with the international
aid group Medicins Sans Frontieres-Belgium, said Reginald Moreels,
a spokesman for the medical group.
   He said the six were kidnapped Thursday from their base in Idaga
Hamous, about 340 miles north of the capital of Addis Ababa, by
members of the rebel Popular Front for the Liberation of the Tigre.
   Moreels said the six apparently were unharmed.
   No reason for the abduction was immediately known, but Moreels
said fighting in the northern province had been intense over the
last few weeks and the rebels might have taken the doctors to treat
their wounded. Similar abductions to treat wounded have happened in
the past.
   Secessionist rebels in Tigre have fought the government of Lt.
Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam for several years.
   The two Belgian doctors were identified as Germaine Hanquet and
Michel Moreau and the Dutch nurse as Roland Raaijmaekers.
   The three Irishwomen were identified by the aid organization
Concern in Dublin as Dr. Anne Broderick, Sister Jacinta O'Sullivan
and Sister Bernadette Mangan. Both are from the Order of the Little
Sisters of the Assumption.
   The medical team was working on medical and nutritional projects
in Idaga Hamous, which has a population of about 3,000.
   Medicins Sans Frontieres, which means ``doctors without
borders,'' has sent medical personnel to crisis areas around the
world.

<HEAD>Gore Has Two Weeks to Show He's A Real Contender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After sitting on the sidelines in Iowa and falling
short of his aim in New Hampshire, Albert Gore Jr. has two weeks to
show that he too is a real contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Gore, the Tennesse senator who has made much of his Southern
roots, long ago crafted a Southern strategy for winning the
Democratic presidential nomination that is 100 percent dependent on
achieving a breakthrough on one day.
   That day, March 8, looms large now that the race for the
nomination has moved to his turf. Twenty states hold Democratic
delegates contests then, including every state of the South save
one.
   Gore's strategy flies in the face of the conventional wisdom
that, as in the past, to win the nomination a candidate in either
party must first score a success in the earliest contests of Iowa
and New Hampshire.
   To disprove that thinking, Gore must mount in the two weeks
before Super Tuesday a campaign that appeals brodadly to Southern
white voters _ since Jesse Jackson figures to take most of the
black vote.
   And Gore must do so against the attention that naturally has
fallen on the Democratic race's two winners to date _ Richard
Gephardt, who won in Iowa, and Michael Dukakis, who won in New
Hampshire.
   It's no coincidence that those two rivals were the ones Gore
targeted with a flurry of barbed attacks as quickly as the first
Southern debate began in Dallas last Thursday.
   ``He's got to make something happen,'' said a rival strategist,
polltaker Ed Reilly of Gephardt's campaign.
   Gephardt was more blunt: ``He probably thinks I'm ahead in the
South and he's got to jump start his campaign to have a chance.''
   Gore and his strategists have long contended he already had ``a
ticket to Super Tuesday'' because Gore is from the South and
because he early on decided to forego Iowa's caucus system to
concentrate on the delegate-rich states that vote March 8. He has
sought endorsements from Democratic officials to demonstrate he is
the region's choice, and has positioned himself to the right of his
rivals on defense and foreign policy issues.
   ``We must do well on Super Tuesday _ there's no ifs, ands or
buts about it,'' Gore campaign manager Fred Martin said.
   Yet at the same time, Gephardt and Dukakis roll into the South
with the momentum their initial victories provide. Dukakis, the
governor of Massachusetts, has an organization in place in the
South that is well regarded, and Gephardt, a Missouri congressman,
has honed a populist, protectionist message that has played well
with blue-collar and conservative voters elsewhere and may do the
same with those voters in the South.
   And after this Tuesday, one or both may have more victories to
point to from the smaller contests in South Dakota and Minnesota.
   While Gore publicly was proclaiming all his bets were on the
South, there were indications his forces hoped their quiet campaign
in New Hampshire would allow him to slip into the pack of leaders
with a good showing. The Tennessee senator didn't spend the full
week before New Hampshire's primary last Tuesday in that state, as
did his rivals, but Gore devoted a significant amount of attention
and money to the state. ``They did it very quietly,'' New Hampshire
party chairman Joe Grandmaison said.
   Gore never predicted victory, but always said he had one aim:
``Do a good deal better than people are expecting.''
   He didn't. Gore finished fifth with 7 percent of the vote,
besting only former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who quickly dropped
out, and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who most Democratic
insiders think should too. Gore as much as acknowledged his failure
there when asked about Jackson, whom he trailed in New Hampshire.
   ``The truth of it is,'' Gore said, ``neither one of us did all
that well in New Hampshire.''
   Had he run a surprising third, Gore would have come to the South
having already demonstrated he can command votes and run
competitively outside his region.
   Because it requires campaigning in a large region in little
time, television will dominate in the Southern campaign. Gore
forces say they expect to spend at least $2 million to $3 million,
and Dukakis is well positioned to match or exceed that.
   While Gore has been working long and hard in the South, he was
doing it at a time when some political analysts believe few people
had begun focusing on the presidential campaign _ except perhaps
those who happen to live in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   ``We only started our TV ads a week ago, and all attention has
been on the early contests,'' Gore said.
   The early contests are over now, and Al Gore has two weeks to
light some fires.

<HEAD>Authors Urge American Jews To Condemn Israeli Policies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four prominent Israeli writers sharply
criticized American Jews for failing to speak out against Israeli
policies in the occupied territories and said their silence amounts
to support for the ``wrong side.''
   In a letter published Sunday in The New York Times, the Israelis
urged Jews in the United States to condemn the army crackdown on
Palestinian protesters in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``By their very silence, they (American Jews) are massively
intervening in Israeli politics and silently but effectively
supporting one side, the tragicially wrong side,'' A.B. Yehoshua,
Amos Oz, Amos Elon and Yehuda Amichai wrote. ``We implore them to
speak up.''
   Yehoshua told The Associated Press he hoped involvement of
American Jews would increase pressure on Washington to seek a
speedy settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``At least the U.S. administration, which is very influenced by
the Jewish position, will realize there is no unconditional support
for the hawkish position,'' Yehoshua said.
   Yehoshua is a writer of fiction with many best sellers,
including ``The Lover.'' Oz is a writer of fiction and essays whose
books include ``Here and There in the Land of Israel.''
   Amichai is a poet and Elon is a journalist who has written books
on Israel.
   Several prominent American Jews, including movie director Woody
Allen and Rabbi Alexander Schindler, leader of Jewish Reform
congregations, in the past few weeks have condemned army policies
in the occupied territories.
   But other American Jewish leaders have reiterated the
traditional position of non-interference in Israel's security
concerns.
   Yehoshua said such a position is no longer valid.
   ``Israelis are split into two camps,'' he said. ``There is a
combat between two ideologies. American Jews have to speak out.
They can't be indifferent to what is happening.''
   In their letter, the writers sharply criticized Israel's
policies during 20 years of occupation and the crackdown on
Palestinian protests that began Dec. 8.
   ``More than 20 years of short-sighted Israeli policies lie
battered in the rock-strewn streets of Gaza and the West Bank,''
they wrote. ``Shooting Palestinian demonstrators, expelling them or
breaking their bones will not make these `policies' more workable
or more just.
   ``There is no military solution. There is only a political
solution based ... on partitioning the country between the two
national movements that have fought over it so long,'' the letter
said.
   American Jews provide important financial support to Israel and
also lobby on behalf of the Jewish state in the United States.
Since 1975, American Jews have contributed $500 million a year to
Israel in private donations.
   About 6 million Jews live in the United States and form the
largest Jewish community in the world.

   Traffic has been banned from most streets
in the heart of Florence in an attempt to save art treasures and
humans from harmful exhaust.
   The ban began Saturday, but its test will come with the start of
the work week Monday.
   From 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., only buses, taxis, residents and
commercial traffic making deliveries will be allowed in the center
of the city.
   All traffic was banned in some spots. They include the squares
in front of two of Florence's most famous churches: Santa Croce,
whose dark interior shelters the tombs of Michelangelo, Machiavelli
and Galileo; and Santa Maria Novella.
   Traffic Commissioner Graziano Cioni told reporters Saturday that
Florence's heavy traffic had been linked to an increase in lung
cancer. The exhaust also eats away at churches and Renaissance
palaces, forcing costly restoration and sometimes irreparable
damage.

Legalization</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Employing upbeat songs and down-home
block parties, federal immigration authorities are launching a
show-biz campaign to combat disappointing results from their
9-month-old alien amnesty program.
   With the May 4 deadline fast approaching, some critics say it's
all too late. Nevertheless, radio shows, a parade float, street
parties, bumper stickers and billboards are all part of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service's package of ploys for
taking the message to eligible aliens.
   Art Zuniga, an INS official, even wrote a song _ ``Amnistia,''
Spanish for ``Amnesty.'' The INS has arranged for him to record it
this week and he will promote it at Spanish-language radio stations.
   ``It starts with, `Listen friends to the story I'm going to tell
you,''' Zuniga said. ``What comes to mind when I wrote this is that
in a sense it's a gift from this country to them.''
   The INS also plans to start putting fact sheets in tortilla
packages around the state, with the cooperation of several bakeries.
   Critics, though, wonder why the heavy promotion didn't start
sooner.
   ``I wish they'd done it a year ago when they needed to,'' said
Carter White, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
South Texas Project based in San Juan. ``I think it's obviously
designed to counter the growing sentiment that they need to extend
the deadline.''
   Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, most
eligible aliens were given one year, beginning last May 5, to apply
for legal U.S. residency if able to prove they have lived in this
country illegally since Jan. 1, 1982. Agricultural workers have
until Nov. 30 to apply.
   The INS had predicted about 2 million would apply for amnesty,
but as of last week the total was slightly more than 1.2 million
nationwide, according to the agency.
   In Texas, where up to 300,000 applicants were expected, 189,988
had applied by last week.
   Immigration officials are fighting a proposal in Congress that
would extend the deadline for a year.
   ``We've seen that the national campaign wasn't bringing in as
many people as we hoped it would, so we decided to start at the
grassroots level,'' said Virginia Kice, a former television news
reporter the INS hired last year to help promote the program in
South Texas. ``We need to try some more eye-catching things.''
   One of the latest promotional devices is a parade float the INS
built for the Washington's Birthday celebration in Laredo on
Saturday and other events in South Texas between now and the
deadline.
   The agency also has scheduled a series of live radio broadcasts
with Spanish-language stations at various legalization centers
around the state. Its most recent radio show, last Tuesday in
Arlington, drew a crowd of about 500, Ortiz said.
   Clara Escobedo de Martinez, at 98 the oldest to apply for
amnesty under the new law, has agreed to do a television commercial
for the INS.
   The agency also has rented billboards and lighted outdoor signs
and ordered bumper stickers bearing the bilingual slogan: ``Ahora
si, con Amnesty!'' (Amnesty Now!)
   On March 12, Boy Scouts will be distributing leaflets
door-to-door in the impoverished unincorporated rural areas of the
lower Rio Grande Valley known as ``colonias.'' At the same time, a
mobile sound truck will tour the colonias announcing the deadline.
   Carol Wolchok, director of the American Bar Association's
Immigration Law Implementation Project, said many eligible aliens
will not apply, either because they do not know about the program
or because they do not understand it.
   ``The publicity is important, and it should continue,'' she
said, ``but the program should be extended.''

<HEAD>News Magazine Banned For Waldheim Swastika Cartoon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent news magazine was banned
temporarily because it printed a cartoon depicting President Kurt
Waldheim of Austria with a Nazi swastika over his mouth, according
to a published report.
   The biweekly Duga was back on the newsstands Friday after a
four-day ban that followed publication of the cartoon, the daily
Politika Ekspres reported. The magazine was banned before it was
distributed and new editions contained an advertisement in place of
the cartoon.
   The Belgrade public prosecutor slapped the temporary ban on the
magazine because the cartoon ``offended a foreign head of state,''
Politika Ekspres said in its Saturday editions. Offending a foreign
head of state is illegal in Yugoslavia.
   Politika Ekspres reported that the public prosecutor acted only
after ``getting a signal'' from Yugoslavia's foreign ministry.
   In 1948, Yugoslavia placed Waldheim on a list of suspected war
criminals and applied for his extradition, but never pursued the
request.
   Criticism about Waldheim's World War II conduct surfaced during
his 1986 campaign for president. A report by a commission of
historians said this month that Waldheim, a German army lieutenant
who served in the Balkans, was in close proximity to Nazi
atrocities, was in a position to know about them and did nothing to
prevent them.
   Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing. The lingering controversy
has led to calls from former supporters that he resign as president.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty years ago this week, the
Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia sealed the fate of the last
land in eastern Europe to join the Soviet bloc.
   In well-organized maneuvers in five tumultuous days in February
1948, the Communists assumed control in a nation where they had
built up power steadiy since winning close to 40 percent of the
vote in national elections in 1946.
   Posters showing a triumphant Klement Gottwald, then the leader
of the Communist Party, now adorn public buildings all over
Czechoslovakia as authorities mark the anniversary with a
traditional Communist display of public pageantry.
   In Prague, party leaders will hold a ceremonial meeting on
Wednesday and preside Thursday over a mass rally in the historic
Old Town Square, scene of a triumphant speech by Gottwald four days
before he became head of the first all-Communist government on Feb.
25, 1948.
   In a land keenly aware of its turbulent history, the
celebrations fall in a year popularly known as ``the big eight''
for its plethora of significant anniversaries.
   In 1918, Czechoslovakia became an independent democracy. In
1938, it was occupied by the Nazis. In 1948, the Communists took
over and in 1968, Soviet-led Warsaw Pact tanks crushed a
Communist-led reform, which advocated changes similar to those now
occurring in the Soviet Union.
   Each of these events colors the mixed feelings of Czechoslovaks
old enough to recall the hectic days in 1948, a heady time for
young Communists getting their first taste of power.
   ``It was the lost revolution,'' sighed a longtime Communist,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A survivor of the purge of 500,000 party members that followed
the 1968 crackdown, the man recalled the enthusiasm, hard work and
honesty of party workers 40 years ago.
   Today, the Communists dominate public life. But new Communist
leader Milos Jakes finds himself calling for an end to widespread
corruption and must exhort workers to produce more under economic
reforms that so far are more word than deed.
   Czechoslovakia's economy, ranked tenth among industrialized
nations before World War II, is now badly in need of modernization
and expensive ecological controls to undo some of the environmental
damage wrought by rapid large-scale industrialization in the last
40 years.
   Jakes must try to mobilize the country's 15.5 million people to
boost growth and achieve declared goals of a vastly improved living
standard by the year 2000. But the current Communist leadership
seems unwilling to countenance the political and cultural
liberalization that could win widespread popular backing for their
program of change.
   In a Europe then overshadowed by the Cold War, the Communist
takeover in Czechoslovakia set the seal on Soviet domination of
Eastern Europe.
   Yugoslavia was to pull out of Moscow's orbit just four months
later, but remained Communist. Soviet-style communism held sway in
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland and Albania, which
did not break with Moscow until 1960, but also remained Communist.
   Hungary this week marks 40 years since its first cooperation and
friendship treaty with Moscow by hosting Soviet President Andrei
Gromyko.
   A senior Soviet leader may also attend this week's celebrations
in Czechoslovakia, whose complex relations with Moscow are marked
by events both before and after the 1948 takeover.
   Thousands of Czechoslovaks openly protested the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion and remain resentful of Moscow for ordering it. Yet many
are now enthused by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   A Prague man, who did not belong to the party, recalled
Czechoslovakia's enthusiasm with the Soviet Union in the 1930s,
when Russia's booming economic growth impressed many Czechoslovaks
who suffered under the Depression.
   In 1938, he said, faith in the West was shaken when Britain and
France, the models for Czechoslovakia's democrats, allowed Adolf
Hitler's armies to march into Prague on the pretext of reclaiming
the ethnically German Sudetenland.
   Fear of Germany took deep root, leading to popular support for
the Communist opposition to West Germany after World War II.
   The Communists, the only political party to keep an organization
going in the war, exploited such prewar sentiments after 1945 and
built on popular sympathy for the Soviet troops who liberated 90
percent of Czechoslovakia from the Nazis.
   By 1947, the Soviets wielded enough influence for Czechoslovakia
to reject U.S. economic aid under the Marshall Plan _ an act that
in Western eyes put the nation firmly into the Soviet bloc.
   Internally, the decisive moment came when non-Communist
ministers resigned from Czechoslovakia's government on Feb. 20,
1948. After five days of street rallies and political struggle, the
Communists emerged as the sole governing force and soon initiated a
Stalinist-style terror that silenced their opposition.

<TEXT>
   The future of the city's all-male clubs, the
prestigious gathering places for business and relaxation, is about
to be placed in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, until recently
a masculine sanctum itself.
   The high court will be asked Tuesday to decide whether the clubs
must admit women. Members say they are havens of tradition;
opponents say they are bastions of bigotry.
   ``For the old boys of the `Old Boys Network,' it is time to wake
up,'' said Marcella Maxwell, outgoing chairperson of the city's
Commission on Human Rights.
   Since 1986, the commission has charged four major clubs with
discriminating against women. The Union League Club and the New
York Athletic Club are awaiting hearings.
   The University Club has agreed to admit women. The Century
Association _ begun at a meeting of 19th-century intellectuals like
William Cullen Bryant and James Fenimore Cooper _ has said it will
comply if the Supreme Court upholds a local law requiring club
integration.
   At issue is a law which says clubs that have more than 400
members, serve meals and charge non-members who use their
facilities for business purposes cannot deny membership because of
sex, race, creed, color or national origin.
   The law was challenged by the New York State Club Association,
whose attorney, Alan Mansfield, refused to discuss the issue.
   In a Supreme Court brief, the city's corporation counsel says
the clubs in question ``provide entry into what is popularly known
as the Old Boy Network. The exclusion of women has greatly hampered
their ability to meet with other professionals and has limited the
opportunity for lateral mobility or upward advancement.''
   ``It is assumed that this is a very elitist and trivial issue
that only affects a very small number of women who have made it to
the top,'' said Lynn Hecht Schafran of the National Organization
for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   ``The fact is that people from middle management on up _ an
academic, a lawyer _ are constantly invited and instructed to
attend business functions at discriminatory clubs.''
   Two prominent all-women clubs, the Cosmopolitan and the Colony,
also might fall under the criteria of the law, said Schafran, but
the men's clubs are better known as settings for business deals.
   Schafran, who also is special counsel to the New York City
Commission on the Status of Women, guessed that about 25 clubs in
the city fall under the law's jurisdiction. Information on their
finances and membership would be needed to know for sure.
   To sidestep the law, a club could simply stop taking money from
non-members, said Schafran. Even so, women might be called upon to
do business with members there under embarrassing conditions.
   ``I have a legion of stories: women having to eat in a private
dining room while the men ate in the main dining room; being told
they can't walk on the stairs, can't come in the front door; there
are millions of variations on the theme,'' she said.
   Dan Perkes of Pelham, a member of the New York Athletic Club,
described it as ``a watering hole, a meeting place.'' Its grill is
open to men only.
   ``I've had business meetings there. If it involved a mixed
group, we took them to the 11th floor dining room. I've never seen
any overt fuss made of barring women,'' he said.
   ``The A.C. way is to keep a low profile,'' he added. ``As clubs
go, it's probably been far more liberal in its operations than
outfits like the University Club, those old-line luncheon clubs.''
   Women are banned from the Athletic Club's steam room and pool
because of male nudity. However, a pool at its Westchester County
facility is open to families.
   While the clubs also are banned from racial discrimination,
Sandler said the commission had received no formal complaints about
that type of bias.
   ``If a man belonged to club and invited a black colleague to
lunch and the colleague was told he couldn't sit in the lobby, the
place would go up in smoke,'' Schafran said.

<TEXT>
   Pianist Van Cliburn is slowly returning
to the public spotlight after breaking a long sabbatical with a
performance at the White House during the summit meeting in
December.
   That performance concluded with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
singing along as Cliburn played ``Moscow Nights.''
   President Reagan told the pianist to stay in touch, because ``I
might be able to get you some more bookings.''
   In January, Cliburn joined a stellar group of performers who
appeared before the Reagans at the inauguration of the Bob Hope
Cultural Center in Palm Springs. NBC will broadcast the performance
March 5.
   ``I suppose I was waiting for the right moment to come along.
The White House was it,'' Cliburn said in an interview published in
Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
   So far he has accepted only one other offer _ conductor Zubin
Mehta's invitation to accompany the New York Philharmonic on its
tour to the Soviet Union in May and June.
   Cliburn's big break came in Moscow 30 years ago, when he won the
Tchaikovsky International Competition at the age of 24.
   In 1978, Cliburn gave up a busy concert schedule, intending to
catch his breath for a year or so. The single year eventually
stretched to 10.
   ``To be honest, I never thought the `intermission' would go on
for 10 years. I guess it went on so long because I felt relaxed and
was having such a good time simply living,'' he said.

   Two Libyans carrying arms and explosives
were arrested trying to enter Senegal at the Dakar airport,
Communications Minister Djibo Ka said Sunday.
   Ka, the government spokesman, told reporters the two Libyans
were arrested Friday night on their arrival on a flight from
Cotonou, Benin, via Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
   He said another man he described as a Libyan agent carrying
false papers had been arrested two days earlier at Kadira on the
Senegal-Mali border, where he was trying to enter Senegal by train.
   Ka provided no details on the arms and explosives that were
seized. He said the investigation was still in progress, and he
said more information would be disclosed later this week.
   Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next Sunday
in Senegal, with President Abdel Diouf expected to win re-election

   Senegal, a nation of 6 million people at the western tip of
Africa, has close ties to France and generally conservative,
pro-Western policies.
   It broke diplomatic relations with Libya in 1980, accusing the
regime of Col. Moammar Gadhafi of trying to destabilize Senegal and
other west African nations. Relations later improved, and Gadhafi
visited Dakar in December 1985, but formal ties have not been
resumed.

   West Berlin police detained two Soviet military
officers on suspicion of spying and sent them back to communist
East Berlin, British military authorities said Sunday.
   Anderson Purdon, spokesman for British military authorities in
West Berlin, said the two ``were arrested Saturday by Berlin police
in the British sector, and British authorities were informed about
it.''
   ``We informed the Soviet Embassy on the other side (in East
Berlin), and they were asked to send someone'' to pick up the two
officers, he said.
   Purdon would not comment on the alleged espionage activities or
on why the officers weren't held by Western authorities to face
charges.

   The last reported AIDS patient in Nigeria
has died, a newspaper said Sunday.
   Mahammadu Debas, a 42-year-old tailor from Gambia, died Friday,
the Vanguard newspaper said. His death brought to 12 the number of
people who have died of acquired immune defiency syndrome in
Nigeria.
   The newspaper said Debas was the last known AIDS victim in the
country. Nigeria reported its first AIDS case only eight months ago.
   Debas' case became a controversy in Nigeria when he was forcibly
hospitalized by health authorities last August for five months.
Several doctors disputed the AIDS diagnosis.
   The man was released from a hospital last month at his own
request.
   AIDS damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring.

   William Rathje says archaeology is
merely digging for ancient garbage, and he's updated the field of
study by sifting through America's trash.
   ``For me, the past is yesterday, not 1,000 years ago. Garbage is
our past and garbage is our future,'' Rathje, a professor of
archaeology at the University of Arizona, said in an interview
Thursday. ``It is a material artifact of our culture.''
   Information gathered from garbage helps reveal social trends and
landfill hazards and augments commercial market research, said
Rathje, who grew up not far from this western Chicago-area
community.
   He and his students have picked through landfills here, in
Tucson, Ariz., and in the San Francisco area.
   Two things his digs in Tucson documented were a sharp increase
in condom use and a rise in the number of people cutting fat off
meat since health warnings about fatty meat were first published.
   Although the diggings here have not been fully analyzed, they do
show things such as newspapers making up 15 percent of the garbage
by weight, compared to 9 percent in Arizona and just 4 percent in
San Francisco.
   The work is not always unpleasant. Rathje has found a diamond
ring and about $15 a year in coins.
   But then there was the time he took his student crew to lunch at
a crowded Tucson eatery after a morning of digging through a
landfill.
   Within a half hour, the other customers had cleared out and the
manager told him and his students when they left: ``Don't hurry
back.''

   The object was to build a machine
that could put a postage stamp on an envelope, and the entry from
Theta Tau fraternity won handily _ taking 33 steps and involving
dolls, eggs and a mousetrap.
   The not-so-simple contraption was an entry in the 1988 Rube
Goldberg Machine Contest held Saturday at Purdue University.
   The annual competition, named for the cartoonist who specialized
in drawing outlandishly complicated machines to perform simple
tasks, drew six student teams.
   The machines had to successfully complete the task in under five
minutes, using at least 25 steps, said Mike Barrett of Highland, a
student organizer.
   The Theta Tau machine's 33 steps included a miniature mailman
that braved rain, snow and an attacking dog; fluid that was forced
from a jar and into a tube spelling out ``David Letterman;'' a doll
of Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight that was dunked
in a vat of green fluid; a sledge smashing an egg; a bubbling jar
of antacid, and marbles and a mouse trap.
   ``We started planning at the start of the semester, and spent
400-500 hours working on details of the project,'' said Steve
Zellers of Indianapolis, a senior in mechanical engineering and
spokesman for the winning team.
   For the device's grand finale, the envelope was shot into a
mailbox, which interrupted an electric eye and tripped circuits
that closed the mailbox door and flipped up a flag.

<HEAD>Tests Show Dumped Chemicals In River Samples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One or more industries apparently took
advantage of a major fuel spill last month to dump cancer-causing
industrial solvents into the Ohio River, water quality experts say.
   ``They dumped dirty solvents because getting rid of them is
expensive,'' said Edgar Berkey, executive vice president of the
University of Pittsburgh's Center for Hazardous Materials Research.
   ``What these misdirected and misguided industrial people dumped
are chemicals and materials far more harmful, far more biologically
active, than the diesel fuel,'' Berkey said.
   An estimated 730,000 gallons of diesel oil poured from a
ruptured Ashland Oil Inc. tank into the Monongahela River south of
Pittsburgh on Jan. 2, then flowed into the Ohio River. The fuel
threatened drinking supplies for residents in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana.
   Samples taken along a 15-mile stretch of the Ohio River between
Wheeling and Moundsville, W.Va., the week of Jan. 10 contained high
concentrations of chloroform, methylene chloride, and
1,1,1-trichloroethane, according to Peter Tennant, water quality
program manager for the Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission in
Cincinnati.
   Chloroform and methylene chloride are cancer-causing substances
and can accumulate in the bodies of fish and other marine life. The
third substance, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also is toxic.
   ``It's not unusual to see those chemicals in that part of the
river occasionally, but never at that high a concentration,''
Tennant told The Pittsburgh Press in an article published Sunday.
``Offhand, I'd estimate those concentrations at about 10 times more
than what we normally might see.''
   ``At the time of the spill, we were getting calls from lots of
industries up and down the river about where it was located,'' he
said. ``We thought they were worried about their (water) intakes.''
   At the levels found, chloroform and methylene chloride
significantly exceed the federal cancer risk level criteria for
rivers and streams, according to Tennant.
   Tennant said his commission has several aerial photographs taken
during the fuel spill that seem to show discharges from the Ohio
side of the river below Wheeling. The agency in the past has
investigated reports of pollutant discharges at that site.
   Tennant said the photographed discharges have not been
identified and do not seem to be coming from any building or
industrial facility. He declined to speculate about their origin,
except to say they could be intermittently flowing from a drainage
ditch or sewer.
   Tennat said it's ``very doubtful'' that those responsible for
discharging the chemicals will be identified.
   Tennant said his commission will begin making its data available
soon to a number of agencies and investigators. Among those
concerned is Berkey, who is directing an independent study of the
spill and its aftermath for Ashland.
   Gary Bryant, EPA's field office chief in Wheeling, said Ashland
officials asked for test samples to be taken as the spill moved
downriver to determine whether any other industry was adding to it.
   ``We were already doing testing of the spill to evaluate if
someone was adding any spice to it,'' Bryant said. ``In years past,
absolutely we would see such dumping during a spill where someone
would need to empty a bilge tank or whatever.''
   There are 83 industrial discharge points along the 87 miles of
the Ohio River from Pittsburgh to Wheeling, according to The Press.
Seventy of them are identified as containing low-level toxic
components.

<HEAD>Senate Tries Once Again to Limit Cost of Congressional Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats are trying once again to
resolve the biggest hangover issue from 1987 _ putting brakes on
the rising cost of congressional elections.
   Negotiations began last week with Republican opponents of the
Democratic campaign spending limit bill, which GOP senators were
able to derail last year with a gentlemanly filibuster.
   Headed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, the
Republicans talked away 22 days of floor time and won a record
seven votes to end the debate, with the Democrats falling five
votes short of the 60 needed to win the so-called cloture vote.
   The legislation, with 52 of the 100 senators as co-sponsors,
made its 1988 reappearance on the floor last week, generating still
more debate amid talk of compromise and warnings from Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Byrd, a principal supporter of the bill, said that unless
negotiators from both camps can work out a deal, he will get tough
and keep the Senate in session nights and weekends to break the
impasse.
   ``If there is going to be a filibuster this time, it is not
going to be a gentlemen's filibuster,'' Byrd said, referring to
last year's rather civilized daylight debate that never quite
reached the gloves-off stage.
   ``I don't want to see a filibuster, but if it comes to that I
suggest that senators cancel all evening engagements and be present
as long as the Senate is in session,'' he said. ``If it should
develop into a full-blown overtime filibuster, senators should
expect roll calls at any time.''
   Byrd's warnings were followed by both sides naming four members
each to attempt to negotiate differences in what Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., calls ``a power struggle between the two national parties
for control of the Senate.''
   Negotiators for the Democrats are Sens. David Boren of Okla.,
George Mitchell of Maine, Carl Levin of Michigan and James Exon of
Nebraska. The Republicans are Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,
Bob Packwood of Oregon, Ted Stevens of Alaska and Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota.
   They held their first meeting on Thursday without any tangible
result. An aide to one of the Democrats, speaking on condition of
anonymity, called it ``the Reykjavik of campaign finance reform,''
a reference to the unproductive U.S-Soviet summit of 1986.
   The negotiators are slated to meet again Monday, but the aide
said it appears one side or the other will have to make major
concessions to produce a compromise.
   The Democratic bill would set voluntary spending limits for
general elections to the Senate, ranging from $950,000 to $5.5
million, depending on a state's population. The average Senate
campaign cost $3 million in 1986, with the price soaring beyond $10
million in the big states.
   A candidate observing the limit would be able to get campaign
money from the Treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or if an
independent group spent large amounts of money against the
candidate.
   Republicans argue that because they generally are more
successful in raising campaign funds, limits would hurt them more
than Democrats, especially as they continue to try to further their
gains in the South.
   The GOP critics also argue that the bill would further tilt the
playing field against them because it would do nothing about an
area where Democrats generally are ahead.
   This is the so-called ``soft money,'' the term used to describe
the aid given candidates by groups like labor unions, often in the
form of manpower for phone banks and door-to-door canvassing.
   Democrats so far have made no overt move to limit soft money,
arguing that even if they agreed to tighten up on this form of
campaign resources, the Republicans would still insist on no
spending limits.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Senate 54-46. Two
Republicans are co-sponsoring the Democratic bill, Sens. Robert
Stafford of Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode Island. Sen. Nancy
Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., was the third Republican supporting
cloture last year. Alabama Democrats Howell Heflin and Richard
Shelby voted against cloture.
   The Republican caucus has made opposition to the bill a
hard-line party issue. To win the battle, Byrd's forces will have
to break through the GOP ranks, picking up the votes of a handful
of Republicans who are said to favor spending limits but who thus
far have remained loyal to Dole.
   Last week the burner was turned up under four of them: Sens.
William Roth of Delaware, William Cohen of Maine, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and Larry Pressler of South Dakota.
   They were the targets of full-page ads in newspapers back home
urging them to ``stop backing the filibuster that is protecting the
current corrupt campaign financing system.''
   The ads were purchased by Common Cause, the self-described
citizens lobby that is the most active organization pushing
Congress to change the campaign laws.
   The Senate is the main congressional battleground for campaign
finance legislation. The House has passed such bills in the past,
only to see them die in the Senate.
   House Democrats have drafted a campaign revision package for
House races but are sitting on it until the Senate approves
legislation.

<HEAD>Decree Encourages Soviets To Borrow And Build Their Own Homes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens will be allowed to take out large
bank loans to build private homes under a government decree
published Sunday that marks a major change in tackling the
tenacious housing problem.
   The decree published on the front page of the Communist Party
daily Pravda said the government hoped to ``activate the human
factor'' and get Soviets to build their own homes with the help of
government loans.
   It also calls on large industrial enterprises to take up a
bigger share of the burden in providing housing. It makes clear
that small groups of Soviets who want to produce building materials
or work as carpenters in their spare time are encouraged to do so.
   One in five Soviet families currently lives in what is referred
to as communal housing, which can be anything from a bunk in a
collective farm barracks to a couple of rooms in an urban apartment
shared with another family.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has followed in the footsteps
of his predecessors in promising a separate home or apartment for
every family, vowing to eradicate the housing shortage by the year
2000.
   But progress in putting up new apartment buildings has been
slow, much of the existing urban housing is in poor condition and
construction quality remains the subject of frequent citizen
complaints.
   Statistics published last month on the nation's economic
performance in 1987 claimed 13 million families had been given
improved housing. But the yearly statistical reports do not
indicate how many families are displaced by major renovation or
demolition projects under way in many cities.
   The Pravda decree announces that ``unjustified restrictions'' on
housing construction and purchase of building materials have been
removed, but did not say what the restrictions were.
   Private construction in the past has been discouraged as the
government attempted to cut down on pilferage of scarce building
materials from state enterprises, and also to prevent individuals
from building homes exceeding the unspoken limits of socialist
austerity.
   Two years ago, the ruling Politburo issued an order broadening
the availability of private gardening plots, but said the land
should not be used for building huge ``dachas,'' or country homes.
   Those regulations, which limited the gardening huts to
cabin-size, may have been among those scrapped in the government's
attempt to get homebuilding going wherever possible.
   State construction enterprises have endured a barrage of media
criticism over the years for failing to turn around the chronic
housing shortage that has troubled this nation since before the
1918 revolution. The state's slow pace in improving housing
conditions likely encouraged party and government officials to
revise the regulations that have held back private construction.
   The new decree orders officials to make building plots available
and appears to especially encourage construction in rural areas.
   Loans of up to 20,000 rubles _ about $33,000 at the official
exchange rate _can be taken out by those living in rural regions
and paid back over 50 years, Pravda said. The money borrowed by
city dwellers must be repaid within 25 years.
   Under the previous regulations governing private construction,
no more than $5,000 could be borrowed from state banks and had to
be repaid within a decade.
   The amount of interest to be charged on the larger loans was not
specified in the decree, but borrowing rates traditionally have
been between 1 percent and 3 percent a year.
   Monthly pay for a Soviet industrial worker averages $330.

<TEXT>
   A $30,000 polio immunization fund
created in 1963 by the Burlington County Medical Society has
finally been spent, after one last round of donations.
   The last $1,000 recently was donated to a worldwide polio fund
sponsored by Rotary International, said Dr. Harold R. Reeve,
president of the medical society.
   Reeve, a urologist, said the final donation was ``a fitting
conclusion'' to the fund. ``There just wasn't enough to perpetuate
it anymore,'' he said in an interview last week.
   Before vaccines eradicated it in this country, polio was a
deadly killer and crippler of children and young adults.
   When the first oral polio vaccine became available in Burlington
County in 1963, the medical society arranged a mass immunization on
two Sundays in December of that year at schools and churches.
   The charge, if people could afford it, was 25 cents. Otherwise
the vaccine was free.
   About 100,000 people were vaccinated and the effort raised about
$70,000, with about $40,000 going to pay for expenses.
   The medical society decided the remaining $30,000 should be used
for the benefit of the community, Reeve said.
   Over the years the fund paid for first-aid classes, blood banks,
anti-smoking campaigns, a pollution study, physical fitness
programs and other public health projects. It was there when a
scabies outbreak closed one of the county hospitals and when county
officials decided to open a county health department.
   By the beginning of 1988, the fund had dwindled.
   ``It was down to nothing,'' Reeve said. ``I think a few people
had to chip in just to bring it up to $1,000.''
   He said the $1,000 donation will immunize 8,000 children against
polio in Third World countries.
   ``The people of this community had contributed to the welfare of
this community and now it is helping the world community,'' Reeve
said.

<HEAD>Stronger Federal Role in Child Care Appears Inevitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The difficult task of finding good and
affordable child care is drawing attention from so many diverse
groups this election year that a stronger federal role in the
patchwork system appears inevitable.
   Both liberals and conservatives are trumpeting the need to
address what some call a national crisis, spurred by the soaring
number of working mothers.
   And in the last two weeks, both the National Association of
Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have cautiously
endorsed at least some form of federal involvement.
   ``The issue is certainly heating up,'' says Helen Blank,
director of child care for the Children's Defense Fund. ``We're
seeing more tragedies, more evidence of the system being fragile
because it's pushed too far. You push and you push and you push and
finally you start to fall over the edge.''
   The Children's Defense Fund was the moving force behind a $2.5
billion child care bill scheduled for hearings Thursday in the
House and the following Thursday in the Senate. Also under
discussion is a $375 million proposal sponsored by Republicans, who
have scheduled a news conference for Tuesday.
   The gulf between the two bills is wide, both in money and
philosophy. But proponents of the more ambitious plan say they are
heartened by the existence of the GOP bill, particularly because
its Senate sponsor _ Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah _ is among the
most conservative members of Congress.
   ``We have a tremendous amount of focus on child care and a
tremendous desire to do something. And when people want to do
something, there's usually room for agreement,'' Blank said.
   ``You always have an advantage in an election year,'' she added.
   The flurry of congressional activity follows several hearings
featuring the testimony not only of experts in child care and child
development but of people with first-hand exposure to the problem _
including a policewoman who found two children dead in a clothes
dryer. Their mother had tried and failed to find supervision for
them before she left for work.
   The $2.5 billion ``Act for Better Child Care Services,'' or ABC
bill, was introduced last year by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
and championed by the 122-member Alliance for Better Child Care.
   The money would be used to help states subsidize child care for
low- and moderate-income families, increase the number of child
care facilities and staff, and coordinate child care resources. The
bill also calls for federal health and safety standards for day
care centers and homes, and training standards for day care workers.
   The Hatch bill would give states $250 million for grants to
local governments, businesses and others to improve child care
services. The bill also would limit the liability of child care
providers, help states set up liability insurance pools, help home
providers make capital improvements and give tax credits to
employers with on-site child care.
   The National Association of Manufacturers last week adopted a
statement saying the federal government should ``encourage
affordable, quality child care through a bottom up approach and use
of incentives.'' The group said any legislation should allow
flexibility, address the liability problem and ``be guided by
fiscal realities.''
   The Chamber of Commerce board of directors, in a statement
approved Feb. 10, also endorsed a federal role providing incentives
and limiting liability. The government also should identify
programs and disseminate information, the chamber said, while
regulation should be carried out at the state or local level.
   ``All this points to a growing recognition that something has to
be done,'' Blank said of the Hatch bill and the two business
groups' statements. ``It just doesn't go far enough. ... We attack
the issue in a more systematic fashion. The private sector just
can't make day care on its own. We try to help the private sector
by creating a logical system in which they can invest.''
   Blank declined to discuss what kind of compromise might be
acceptable to the Children's Defense Fund except that it must do
more than the Hatch bill.
   ``It would be awful if we had some small child care bill that
didn't put us in the right direction,'' she said. ``It's very
important for the sake of children ... for us to really be cautious
and careful about what the federal government does after years of
inattention to child care.''

<HEAD>Sugar Industry's Ad Campaign Aimed At Sweetening Its Product's

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn sugar and artificial
sweeteners are gaining a bigger share of the market, so the cane
and beet sugar industry plans to fight back with a $4 million
television advertising campaign.
   ``We'll associate sugar with happy moments,'' said Tony
Contreras, vice president of marketing for the Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative in Belle Glade. ``It's a very positive, lifestyle-type
of campaign.''
   Following the lead of the beef, pork and poultry producers, the
sugar industry will try to increase consumption by focusing on the
``sweet, pure and natural'' aspects of sugar. The campaign starts
in March.
   Ads will be paid for by Florida's sugar cane growers and other
U.S. cane and beet growers, refiners and processors.
   ``The sugar market has dropped since the early 1970s. Actually
the market drop was caused by corn sweeteners,'' said Charlie
Shamel, president of The Sugar Association, a Washington, D.C.,
trade association.
   Manufacturers of soft drinks, canned fruit, table syrups and
other processed foods have turned to less expensive corn sweeteners
instead of cane or beet sugar.
   Meanwhile, total sugar consumption also is down. Per capita
sugar use could decline to 35 to 40 pounds by 1995 if the trend
continues, or less than half of what it was in the 1970s, Shamel
said.
   Unlike its magazing advertising last year which took a an
anti-aspartame tack, the Sugar Association TV drive will take a
pro-sugar approach. The campaign is geared toward giving viewers
``permission to eat sugar,'' Contreras said.
   ``We're not suggesting anyone pig out on sugar,'' said Shamel.
``But used in moderation, it tastes good and has a lot of benefits:
Adds texture in cakes, flavor to bland foods.''
   Past advertising by the sugar industry has been criticized for
its use of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration task force report
that the industry said confirms ``sugar is safe.''
   The 1986 FDA report found no direct link between sugar and major
diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, gallstones,
glucose intolerances or hyperactivity in children.
   A Washington, D.C., consumer group claims the sugar industry
manipulated the FDA report.
   ``The study was part of a series of studies on food additives,''
said Bruce Silverglade, legal affairs director for the Center for
Science in the Public Interest. ``Sugar was thrown in there along
with artificial sweeteners. It did not focus on the role sugar
plays in the diet.''
   The American Dental Association maintains that while sugar may
be a natural product, ``it causes tooth decay,'' said Rick Asa,
spokesman in Chicago for the ADA, which favors sugar substitutes.

<HEAD>Works of Purged Party Founder Published</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The collected writings of the Chinese Communist
Party's purged co-founder, Chen Duxiu, have been published for the
first time since 1922, an official report said Sunday.
   The publication, announced by the state-run Xinhua News Agency,
indicated that current party leaders are taking a more relaxed
attitude toward people who clashed with Mao Tse-tung during the
formative years of the Chinese Communist Party.
   Chen was the founder of the New Youth magazine that radicalized
many Chinese students in the 1910s and 1920s. He also was a leader
of the 1917 ``May Fourth Movement'' that opposed Japanese
expansionism and China's inability to fight it.
   He and Beijing University librarian Li Dazhao are regarded by
Western scholars as the Chinese Communist Party's founders. He
became the first party general secretary in 1921, but was ousted in
1927 after the failure of the party's policy of cooperating with
the non-Communist Nationalist Party of Chiang Kai-shek.
   Chen was strongly influenced by the Soviet-led Comintern, which
argued that China needed a democratic revolution before it could
proceed to a communist-style revolution.
   The Comintern, dominated by Soviet dictator Josef V. Stalin,
argued that China's middle class, represented by Chiang's
Nationalist party, would play a major role in the first revolution
and therefore deserved the help of all good communists.
   Chen supported that position and clashed with activists such as
Mao who believed that the party must split with the Nationalists,
establish its own roots among the workers and the peasants and work
directly for a communist revolution.
   Chen was purged from the party in 1929, partly at Mao's
instigation, and went down in Chinese history books as a ``right
opportunist,'' his role in the party's founding downplayed. He died
in 1942.
   Xinhua said the collection of 270 essays, letters and other
writings by Chen were republished by the People's Publishing House
in his native Anhui province in central China. It said the
collection first was published in Shanghai in 1922.
   Xinhua described the collection as ``invaluable to the study of
modern Chinese history and the history of the party in its early
stage.''
   During the last 12 years, Chinese authorities have moved away
from a blind allegiance to the ways and words of Mao, going so far
as to criticize his economic policies and blame him for the
excesses of the Cultural Revolution.

<HEAD>Northern Ireland Police Chief Criticizes Inquiry Into His Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Ireland's police chief
charged Sunday that British investigator mishandled an inquiry into
allegations his force had a ``shoot-to-kill'' policy.
   ``John Stalker was considered to be the most proficient
detective investigator in the United Kingdom,'' Sir John Hermon
said of the former deputy chief constable of Manchester, who
investigated Hermon's force.
   But he said, ``I believe there are many people who are more
mature and more experienced who could have done it.''
   Hermon was speaking on a British Broadcasting Corp. Northern
Ireland television program to be broadcast Monday night. A partial
transcript of the program was released Sunday.
   Stalker was sent to Northern Ireland to investigate the killing
of six unarmed Roman Catholics by police in three incidents in late
1982.
   The British government announced Jan. 25 that while evidence had
been uncovered of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, it
would not prosecute any Northern Ireland police officers implicated
by Stalker. It said prosecutions would hurt national security.
   The decision has put a strain on Anglo-Irish relations. Ireland
views the case as a test of Britain's resolve to reform Northern
Ireland's justice system and protested the decision not to
prosecute.
   Stalker has published a book alleging that his investigation was
systematically obstructed by senior officers, including Hermon. He
claimed he was removed from the inquiry before he could complete it
because his findings were likely to lead to murder charges against
police officers.
   Five of the shooting victims were acknowledged Irish guerrillas
fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland. The sixth
was a Roman Catholic teen-ager with no connections to the
guerrillas.
   Their deaths in police ambushes led to allegations that
anti-terrorist officers were operating a ``shoot-to-kill policy''
to wipe out guerrillas without having to go through normal judicial
procedures.
   Hermon distributed a statement to police officers throughout
Northern Ireland last week accusing Stalker of publishing
``untruths, distortions, and inaccuracies.''
   Stalker, who has retired from the force, said he stood by his
book.

<HEAD>Party Launches Campaign Without Waiting For Mitterrand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEVERS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just two months before the April 24
presidential election, the Socialist Party launched its campaign
Sunday under a large banner reading: ``Mitterrand Generation.''
   The only problem: President Francois Mitterrand has yet to
declare.
   Still, Mitterrand, who is a Socialist, is widely expected to run
for another seven-year term. The announcement will likely come in
mid-March.
   The official beginning of the Socialist campaign came before a
crowd of about 2,500 people in this city in central France, in a
region Mitterrand once represented in Parliament.
   Lionel Jospin, the party's first secretary, told the audience
that France was involved in ``an extraordinary campaign which we
are approaching in an unusual way, our candidate not being known,
the president being Socialist.''
   The slogan ``Mitterrand Generation'' has already appeared on
posters around France, which show a baby reaching up to the hand of
an unseen man. Party officials say the campaign could be adopted
either by Mitterrand as a candidate, or by his Socialist successor
if the president does not run.
   Opinion polls show Mitterrand in first place, with Premier
Jacques Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre, both
conservatives, fighting for second place.
   The top two candidates in the April 24 voting will face off in a
decisive second round May 8, unless one of them wins more than 50
percent of the vote in the first round.
   In a radio interview Sunday, a leader of the Union for French
Democracy, an alliance of parties supporting Barre, said his side
was ``campaigning against a phantom who is hiding behind the
draperies at the Elysee,'' the presidential palace.
   ``Mr. Mitterrand would like to be a candidate without putting
his name on the ballot,'' said Jean-Claude Gaudin, president of the
union's parliamentary group. ``It's ideal for someone who does not
have many things to say and does have many things to hide.''
   Other candidates include Jean-Marie Le Pen of the extreme right
National Front, Andre Lajoinie of the Communists and Pierre Juquin,
a dissident Communist. All are running far behind Mitterrand, Barre
and Chirac.
   One paper seemed to have the answer Sunday.
   ``Mitterrand Has Made His Decision,'' was the banner headline in
the Journal du Dimanche newspaper. The story, however, said it did
not know which decision the president had made.

<HEAD>Poll Indicates Bush's Texas Hold Strengthening, Democratic Race
Fluid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush has a wide lead in
Texas, but the Democratic race is still fluid and unsettled, a poll
suggests.
   The poll, directed by University of Houston political scientist
Richard Murray, indicates the March 8 Texas primary could prove to
be a tight race between Democrats Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, Jesse Jackson and
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore.
   The survey, commissioned by the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas
Morning News, suggested former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart and Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon were back in the pack. The two papers published the
results on Sunday.
   On the Republican side, the poll indicated the Republican race
to be much more settled, with Bush's victory in New Hampshire
consolidating his position in Texas, Murray said.
   In the poll, 736 voters were interviewed Feb. 17-18. The
interviewees were among 1,020 people first queried for an earlier
poll Jan. 3-12 about their preferences in the presidential
nominations races. The margin of error was 4 percentage points, the
newspapers said.
   Dukakis was the preferred candidate among 27 percent of
Democratic voters; 21 percent said they were unsure; 16 percent
favored Jesse Jackson; 15 percent favored Gephardt; 11 percent
favored Gore, with seven percent choosing Hart and two percent
favoring Simon.
   Among Republicans, 66 percent favored Bush; 12 percent backed
Kansas Sen. Bob Dole; 11 percent favored Pat Robertson, and 10
percent were unsure.

<HEAD>D'Amato Accuses Majority Leader of Rigging GOP Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato has charged that state Sen.
Warren Anderson rigged the Republican primary in New York State so
that Vice President George Bush would be the only candidate in some
districts.
   In a televised interview broadcast Sunday, D'Amato accused
Anderson, the state Senate majority leader, of disenfranchising
Republican voters.
   He said Anderson has refused to loosen a requirement that
Republican presidential candidates collect 1,250 signatures in each
of the state's 34 congressional districts.
   ``Warren Anderson devised a program and a plan that would
basically make it impossible for all but George Bush to field
slates throughout the state,'' said D'Amato, a Republican who
supports Sen. Bob Dole. ``This is not the Soviet Union, where you
run one slate and you say take it or leave it. This is America.''
   He said on WNBC's ``Newsmakers'' program that the requirement
favors Bush because he has a larger campaign organization than
Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp or Pat Robertson.
   A spokesman for Anderson, R-Binghampton, denied that the
majority leader had any intention of keeping legitimate candidates
off the ballot.
   ``Of course it's not true,'' said the spokesman, Charles Dumas.
``Everyone was given the same amount of time to collect petitions
and put their candidates on the ballot. Now if Mr. Dole's people
didn't do their job, that's their problem.''

<HEAD>U.S. Company To Put Project Aboard Soviet Space Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. aerospace consulting firm has signed a
multiyear agreement to put commercial scientific projects aboard
the Soviet space station in the first private American deal with
the Soviet space agency.
   Payload Systems Inc. of Wellsley, Mass., in an enterprise
approved by the Commerce Department, will grow protein crystals for
U.S. industry with the help of a Soviet cosmonaut who will be given
only minimal information about the projects, said Anthony Arrott,
company research and development director.
   Payload Systems received a two-year government license to
contract with the Soviets for protein crystallization production
experiments aboard the Soviet space station Mir, which is already
in orbit, Arrott said in a telephone interview Sunday.
   ``It's a multiflight, multiyear agreement beginning in 1989,''
he said, adding that part of the agreement includes non-disclosure
of the amount to be paid to the Soviets who reportedly have offered
to carry Western experiments for between $10,000 and $15,000 a
kilogram.
   Arrott said the agreement was signed with the Soviet Union's
agency for international trade agreements, Licensintorg. The
civilian space agency, Glavkosmos, oversees the space station.
   The agreement will help American industry keep up in the
production of protein crystals used to develop new drugs until the
United States gets long-term orbiting laboratories in the 1990s,
Arrott said.
   ``We want to keep American industry competitive over this time
period,'' he said.
   Payload Systems was founded in 1984 by Byron K. Lichtenberg of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to provide consultation
for companies that want to use the commercial potential of outer
space. In December 1983, Lichtenberg became the first non-astronaut
to fly aboard a U.S. space shuttle. He conducted protein
crystallization experiments that provided evidence that larger and
more regular crystals can be grown in a weightless environment,
Arrott said.
   He said crystals to be grown in the weightless environment
aboard the space station could be used by Payload Systems clients,
but company attorney Mark S. McConnell of Washington, D.C., said
crystals grown in the first flight would not be sold.
   ``They're just trying to see if it works for commercial
purposes,'' McConnell said. He said the Soviets' goal in accepting
the arrangment ``from what I could tell is to promote commercial
uses worldwide of their station.''
   ``To my knowledge, it is the first time that the U.S. government
has approved commercial activity in the Soviet space program,'' he
said, noting that the two countries have had
government-to-government programs in space.
   Since the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in January
1986, U.S. companies have had few alternatives for commercial space
projects. Some companies have used European satellites.
   Arrott said that even when the U.S. shuttle flights resume later
this year, they could not provide the weeks and months of
weightlessness needed to develop crystals commercially.
   U.S. officials have been concerned that private experiments
might transmit valuable technology to the Soviets, but McConnell
said steps are being taken to ensure against this.
   ``There will be extremely limited training given to the
cosmonauts. They will be doing no more than turning some dials on a
box, the contents of which they will not know about, and monitoring
environmental conditions in the space station,'' he said.
   President Reagan included in his budget released last week $1
billion toward construction of a U.S. space station by the
mid-1990s. A smaller space module is planned to be put into orbit
for commercial use earlier in the decade.

<HEAD>Cold In Northeast, Very Windy In Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Light snow fell only across parts of the Northeast on Sunday,
while high wind surged across the northern Plains.
   A large storm moving across central Canada generated strong wind
across northern sections of the nation east of the Rockies and was
expected to continue doing so for the next few days, especially
blasting the eastern slopes of the northern and central Rockies.
   Wind gusted to 68 mph at Havre, Mont., and caused some damage
Sunday morning, the National Weather Service said. Elsewhere in
Montana, gusts to 66 mph were reported at Livingston and to 56 mph
at Great Falls. In Wyoming, gusts were measured to 63 mph at Cody
and to 53 mph at Casper.
   The stiff wind stirred up snow already on the ground and blowing
snow cut visibility.
   A high wind watch was posted overnight and into Monday for
southeastern Wyoming and the foothills of northeastern Colorado.
   Scattered snow flurries fell from the eastern Great Lakes across
New York state to the mountains of northern New England, with some
accumulation in areas east of Lake Ontario.
   All of the Northeast was cold, with temperatures remaining below
freezing from the District of Columbia northward. Afternoon
temperatures were in the teens from eastern Ohio and most of
Pennsylvania across upstate New York to northern New England.
   Alpena, Mich., had a record low of 12 degrees below zero.
   Central and southern Florida turned cool and wet with
temperatures falling throughout the morning, into the 50s by
afternoon in southern Florida. Rain fell throughout much of the
peninsula during the morning but diminished by afternoon.
   The Pacific Northwest had patches of dense fog during the
morning and visibility at Portland, Ore., at 11 a.m. PST was down
to one-eighth of a mile.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees above zero at Massena, N.Y., to 80 at Palm Springs, Calif.
The early-morning low for the day was 17 below zero at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Monday, light snow or snow showers were forecast in northern
Maine and from western New York across northern Michigan, Minnesota
and North Dakota to Montana.
   Highs only in the teens or 20s were predicted in northern New
England; falling from the 30s to the 20s in most of Montana, North
Dakota and northern Minnesota; in the 30s from southern New England
to Pennsylvania and in the northern Great Lakes; in the 60s from
Florida to Mississippi; in the 60s or 70s from Louisiana to most of
Missouri and Kansas and from Oklahoma and northern Texas to much of
New Mexico, Arizona and California; in the 80s across the southern
half of Texas; and in the 40s or 50s elsewhere.

   A rash of railroad accidents last month should
show Congress that serious problems remain in the industry since
the worst wreck in Amtrak history 14 months ago, says Federal
Railroad Administrator John Riley.
   Equally troubling, Riley said, is that the federal government
has less power to curtail railroad accidents now than it did when
three Conrail locomotives slid through a warning signal and
collided with an Amtrak passenger train near Chase, Md., on Jan. 4,
1987. Sixteen people were killed.
   ``It's incredible to me that we're sitting here 14 months after
the Chase accident and not one shred of legislation introduced in
the wake of that accident has yet become law,'' Riley said during
an interview he requested to talk about safety concerns. ``As the
months pass, I see the opportunity slipping away from us,'' he said.
   Riley said he has seen ``a progressive deterioration of
discipline and commitment within the railroad workplace.''
   He cited a CSX Transportation Inc. brakeman who allegedly left a
train prior to a head-on collision in upstate New York last year,
and a conductor in Pennsylvania last month ``sitting in the second
vehicle with his back to the front of the train watching none of
the signals when an accident occurred.''
   Two were killed in the New York accident, while the Pennsylvania
crash helped make January a grim month for rail safety, Riley said.
   In Lewistown, Pa., federal officials said four crewmen died when
a Conrail coal train ignored three warning signals and, in fact,
sped up before slamming into another freight train.
   ``In the month of January alone, so far, with quite a few tests
outstanding, we've had four fatalities and more than a dozen
injuries in cases where we believe one or more employees will test
positive for drugs,'' he said.
   In another January accident, an Amtrak train hit a maintenance
vehicle and derailed, injuring 25 near Philadelphia. An Amtrak
control tower operator fled his post after the accident, and has
since resigned.
   Riley has been lobbying for measures before House-Senate
conference committees that would permit direct government sanctions
against railroad workers for safety violations, and authorize
random drug testing.
   Delays in enacting the sanctions measure is ``testimony to the
sheer political power of the labor organizations who oppose it,''
Riley said. The measure would permit the FRA to suspend the
operating privilege of railroad conductors or engineers.
   But Sens. James Exon, D-Neb., and John Danforth, R-Mo., said
through spokesmen that they were hopeful the legislation would soon
become law.
   Riley said that the recent accidents demonstrate that while
railroad equipment has gotten steadily better, there has not been a
corresponding improvement in employee performance to prevent
tragedies.
   While accidents have been cut 62 percent since 1980, Riley said
the percentage of accidents caused by equipment tampering,
substance abuse, or human error has risen from 26 percent to 37
percent.
   But instead of gaining more authority, he has seen his
jurisdiction narrowed by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which on Feb. 11 struck down the government's policy of requiring
railroad workers in major accidents to submit to drug or alcohol
tests.
   Roger Horn, father of one of the 16 victims of the Chase
accident, was with Riley when he found out about the court's
decision, which is being appealed.
   ``To him, it was more than a policy reversal,'' Riley said. ``It
was almost a statement that everything he'd suffered in the past
year has been in vain.''
   But the Railway Labor Executives' Association, an umbrella group
for 20 unions, said the court ruling affirmed its position against
testing without ``reasonable suspicion.''
   The association also opposes Riley's call for direct government
sanctions on rail workers.
   Ed Wytkind, spokesman for the executives' association, said
unions fear employees would be punished for accidents occurring in
complicated settings where management may be at least partly
responsible _ perhaps because it did not offer adequate training.
   ``The bottom line is that the FRA has been using the drug
testing issue and employees' liability as an excuse to skirt its
obligation to enforce existing statutes the way Congress
intended,'' Wytkind said.

   Israeli soldiers Sunday killed two Arabs in
clashes in the West Bank. Palestinian organizers called for stepped
up protests to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz this week.
   The army said soldiers shot and killed the Arabs in separate
confrontations in the West Bank city of Nablus and the Deir Ammar
refugee camp. One was killed after he stabbed a soldier, the army
said.
   Palestinian reports said 20 Arabs were wounded by army gunfire,
but the army confirmed only three of the shootings.
   The army initially reported a third Arab shot and killed in
Nablus but later retracted the statement. Nablus hospital officials
said the man, Ahmed Abu Salhiye, in his 50s, died of a heart attack
after being overcome by tear gas.
   The latest deaths brought the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis since the protests began Dec. 8 to 61, according to U.N.
figures.
   Officials in the Economy Ministry said the government has spent
$330 million to finance the crackdown on the protests. Israel's
1988 budget is $31 billion.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin rejected demands that he issue
specific guidelines to soldiers to curb the use of excessive force
against Palestinian protesters. Rabin said during a Cabinet meeting
such guidelines were useless because he could not anticipate all
situations soldiers might face.
   Rabin denied reports by The Sunday Times of London that he
commissioned two psychologists to report on the effects the army
crackdown in the occupied territories has on soldiers.
   ``I have not ordered any reports, and I didn't receive any,''
Rabin told Israel radio.
   Psychologists who compiled the report said brutal behavior among
troops has become widespread and that some officers are issuing
illegal commands, ordering random beatings.
   A leaflet distributed Sunday urged Palestinians to show
``national outrage in the face of the Shultz visit.'' The leaflet,
signed by the ``United National Leadership of the Uprising,''
called for a week of strikes and demonstrations.
   Shultz is tentatively scheduled to arrive Thursday, bringing
with him a plan he hopes will reignite the stalled peace process.
   The leaflet called for a day of solidarity Monday with those
killed, wounded or arrested in the disturbances, a national hunger
strike Tuesday, general strikes Wednesday and Thursday,
demonstrations Friday and a defiance of curfews Saturday.
   ``Let us increase the occupation's political, moral and economic
losses and remember that the Vietnamese won their war against the
Americans not only with guns but also through the struggle of their
peasants,'' the leaflet said.
   Shultz plans to use Jerusalem as his base for several days,
making short trips to Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
   The Americans also have discussed the Shultz visit with local
Palestinians, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Watt Cluvarius, a deputy to Assistant Secretary of State Richard
Murphy, met with a group of about 10 Palestinians from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to Arab and American

   The Palestine Liberation Organization on Friday ordered West
Bank and Gaza Palestinians not to talk with Shultz. But Dr. Yasser
Obeid, one of those who met with Cluvarius, said the participants
hoped PLO leader Yasser Arafat would change his mind.
   ``We hope that such a meeting will happen,'' Obeid said, adding
that Cluvarius explained details of the U.S. plan.
   The U.S. official said Saturday's meeting was part of regular
American contacts with Palestinians, and if some wanted to meet
Shultz he probably would accommodate them.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers shot and killed a
Palestinian after he stabbed a soldier, the army said. Doctors at
Ittihad Hospital identified the victim as Ramez Abu Amara, 18.
   The army said the soldier was injured, but did not elaborate.
   In the West Bank refugee camp Deir Ammar, soldiers fatally shot
a protester during clashes, the army said. Hospital officials
identified the victim as Kamal Mohammed Fares, 24, and said he was
shot in the chest.
   Nablus hospital officials said they treated 17 Arabs for gunshot
wounds, but the army said it could not confirm the reports. The
army said soldiers shot and wounded three Palestinians in clashes
in the Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis.
   Psychologist Charlie Greenbaum said the crackdown has damaged
the morale of soldiers who frequently are given what he called
illegal orders.
   ``The army is breaking the law and its own norms, commanders are
giving orders to smash property, break arms and legs and beat
people, and not just to disperse demonstrations,'' Greenbaum told
the Haaretz newspaper.
   Haaretz said Greenbaum and his colleague, Dan Bar On, served the
military establishment, but did mention whether their report was
commissioned by and delivered to the army.
   When contacted by The Associated Press, Greenbaum confirmed that
the Haaretz quotes were correct, but refused to answer questions.
   Greenbaum said the army must provide specific and legal
guidelines. ``If it doesn't do so, it places the officers and
soldiers in an impossible situation,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Three vessels of the U.S. Sixth Fleet arrived in Haifa for a
regularly scheduled visit to last about a week.
   Rear Admiral John K. Redy, commander of the three vessels, said
the visit was not connected to the kidnapping last week in Lebanon
of American Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins. But he said the force
would be ready to take action if necessary.

<HEAD>Authorities Find Body In Trailer, Relatives Say `God Dealing With
Him'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REFORM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities found a man's decomposed body at
a house occupied by children and other relatives, some of whom
claimed the deceased man was ``doing much better'' and would awaken
after his dealings with God.
   ``I understand they were seeing a voodoo man,'' Pickens County
Coroner Herbert Latham said of the deceased man and his relatives.
He said the man had been dead about three weeks when the body was
found.
   Pickens County Sheriff David Abston identified the dead man as
Jessie James Latham, 42, not related to the coroner. Abston said
Latham recently returned to Alabama from New York.
   L.C. Keasler, director of the Pickens County Department of Human
Resources, said agency workers went to the mobile home Feb. 14, but
were refused entrance. The agency workers returned Wednesday with
authorities and discovered the body.
   ``This was a weird case,'' the coroner said Sunday. He said that
when the body was located, the dead man's relatives ``tried to
convince me that he was still alive, that God was dealing with him,
that he was fine.''
   The coroner said the body ``was just dried up.'' He said an
autopsy was performed before the body was buried Saturday at a
local cemetery.
   The coroner said that although no foul play was suspected, he
was awaiting hospital records from New York before announcing the
cause of death. He said the deceased man was apparently aware he
was suffering from a fatal disease and was seeking help.
   The county workers had gone to the home in the first place
because an anonymous caller from New York had said he was sick and
that someone should see that he was taking his medication.
   Abston said that when Latham returned to Alabama from New York,
he was picked up at the Tuscaloosa Airport by his sister, Catherine
Latham, who took him to a motel in Reform. The two stayed there for
two weeks.
   Dilip Bhakta, the motel manager, said he never saw Latham, but
asked Latham's sister to leave the motel Feb. 2 ``because of the
smell.''
   ``She never would let anyone come in the room and would meet our
maids at the door to get materials,'' Bhakta said.
   Bhakta said the odor from the room ``was very strong _ very
offensive'' and that there were several complaints about it from
other guests.
   Ms. Latham said she took her brother on Jan. 22 to a man in Hale
County who advised that he drink goat milk with some pills he gave
him. She said she took her brother to the trailer residence on Feb.
2.
   The nine occupants of the trailer included two infants and
several teen-agers, the coroner said.
   Ms. Latham dismissed the claim that her brother was treated by a
``voodoo doctor.''
   Abston said the woman told him that her brother was alive when
he was moved and did not die until the day authorities found his
body in a bedroom of the trailer.
   ``He was pretty well decomposed at the time and the odor all
around the trailer was pretty strong,'' the sheriff said. ``Some of
the kids playing in the yard were wearing face masks, like in an
operating room.''
   Asked if there were any supernatural elements or voodoo involved
in the treatment, Ms. Latham told The Tuscaloosa News on Saturday:
``I don't like to use that word. I'm not working for the devil _ I
work for God.
   ``All I could do was minister to him. He's in God's hands now.''

   Four days after a ruptured pipeline spilled
a toxic chemical into the city's water supply, restaurants were
allowed to reopen Sunday morning.
   Local industries were expected to resume operations Sunday
night, Mayor Fred Singer said.
   An estimated 100,000 gallons of toluene leaked Wednesday from a
ruptured Sun Co. pipeline near Tiffin in northern Ohio, causing
5,000 evacuations and polluting the Sandusky River, which supplies
water for the city of Fremont.
   On Thursday, Singer declared a water emergency, ordering schools
and businesses to close.
   The city's 22,000 residents were asked to conserve water, since
the city could store only 4 million gallons in its storage tanks,
but additional water had to be trucked in Saturday.
   ``It's fixed,'' Singer said Sunday after officials set up a
process Saturday that removed the chemical from the water.
   Singer said the city began pumping limited amounts of water from
the Ballville Dam around 1 p.m. Saturday after a 13-hour-long
purification process convinced officials of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency and the city water department that the water was
safe to drink.
   Bud Davis, a spokesman for Sun Pipe Line, said cleanup crews
will remain in Fremont for several weeks to continue random testing
of the water, ground and air for toluene.
   The pipeline, one of hundreds of underground pipelines that
crisscross Ohio, carried toluene a Toledo refinery to another
refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa., where it is used as a gasoline octane
enhancer.

<HEAD>Shultz, Shevardnadze Claim Progress But Disagree on US Nuclear
Plans</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with reports on day's talks,
Shultz-Sakharov meeting. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze claimed ``good progress''
Sunday in daylong talks on arms control, human rights and regional
conflicts.
   But a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman sharply criticized the
U.S. nuclear rebuilding program in Western Europe.
   The spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, said the modernization program
in NATO countries clashed with the new U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap
intermediate-range missiles.
   Gerasimov said building new missiles with a range less than 315
miles was ``incompatible with the strengthening of European
security.''
   The U.S. State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman,
dissociated the U.S. government from the Soviet criticism.
   Otherwise, both sides gave extremely upbeat appraisals of the
Shultz-Shevardnadze talks, he said.
   ``They both agreed without any hesitation whatsoever that the
atmosphere was excellent throughout the day, that they were
businesslike, and they both agreed we made good progress across the
range of issues,'' Redman said.
   Shultz took an hour off to meet with noted Soviet dissident
Andrei D. Sakharov, who wished him well in pressing for human
rights reforms. Shultz called the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner
``an inspiration'' and a ``model and symbol'' to the world.
   They met in Sakharov's seventh-floor apartment. Sakharov said
serious Soviet reforms were under way but the country had not made
enough progress yet on human rights or on Afghanistan.
   He was sent into internal exile in Gorky for almost seven years
in 1980 for speaking out against the Soviet military intervention
in Afghanistan.
   The treaty to ban U.S. and Soviet missiles ranging from 315 to
3,125 miles was signed by President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev
at their summit meeting in December in Washington. The treaty is
now before the U.S. Senate and the Supreme Soviet for approval.
   Gerasimov said the Soviets were eager to see the treaty placed
in force and had begun withdrawing short-range missiles from East
Germany and Czechoslovakia. But he rejected assertions by U.S.
officials that the Soviets were holding back on a date for the next
summit meeting until the treaty was approved.
   ``We never stated directly that there is some sort of link,''
the Soviet spokesman said.
   Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to meet in Moscow but did not set a
date. Redman said the two sides were considering ``the general time
frame of mid-May or early June.''
   Redman said holding a summit did not depend on completing
another treaty to halve the superpowers' arsenals of long-range
bombers, land-based missiles and submarines.
   Negotiations in Geneva have slowed down over ways to verify the
cutbacks and over the U.S. program to develop an anti-missile
defense in space.
   Shultz discussed verification procedures with Shevardnadze. A
joint statement to be issued after talks Monday with Gorbachev.
Shevardnadze is expected to deal with the problem and also
compliance with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which the
Soviets say prohibits much of the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program.
   Earlier, at the opening of the talks, Shevardnadze staked out an
active role for the Soviet Union in the U.S. drive to set up
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   Shultz has questioned whether the Soviets are eligible, given
their record on human rights and lack of relations with Israel.
   But Shevardnadze said the Soviets intended to be more of a
factor.
   The issue of Soviet participation is one of the key items on
Shultz's agenda during his talks in Moscow.
   The Soviets broke relations with Israel after it defeated Egypt,
then a Soviet ally, in the 1967 Mideast war. However, a small group
of Soviet diplomats was sent to Israel last year to take care of
some consular matters.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel has resisted Soviet
participation in the search for a Middle East settlement. In
addition to not having relations with Israel, the Soviets generally
support Arab positions.
   The official Tass news agency issued a mostly favorable review
of the first day of talks between Shultz and Shevardnadze,
declaring that the officials sought ``first of all ways to utilize
the potential'' created at the Washington summit in December.
   Shultz also pledged the United States would not give up the
struggle for a better Kremlin record on human rights, including
emigration.
   ``We are never content until all these cases are resolved in the
proper way. No matter how discouraging it may sometimes seem, we
will never give up,'' the secretary said in brief remarks at the
home of consulate chief Max Robinson.
   Vera Zieman, the 11-year-old daughter of a Jewish couple that
has been refused permission to emigrate for more than 10 years,
gave Shultz a photo of herself with him at a previous meeting and
signed it, ``from a lifelong refusenik.''
   On another subject, a senior U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Shultz would seek Soviet support for
``an early vote'' in the U.N. Security Council to impose an
international weapons embargo against Iran.
   The Soviets joined with the United States last July in a
resolution that called for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. But
they have held back from enforcing the resolution with sanctions.

   Andrei D. Sakharov told U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz on Sunday the Soviet Union has not made enough
progress on human rights or Afghanistan to host a human rights
conference, but reforms are under way.
   Shultz visited the physicist and 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner
at his seventh-floor apartment on a busy Moscow street to
underscore the Reagan administration's concern about the Soviet
human rights record.
   But Sakharov, who spoke to reporters for about 10 minutes after
the 55-minute meeting, said Shultz also questioned him about arms
control and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   The Soviet Union wants to host an international conference on
human rights, but Western countries are resisting the idea because
of Soviet violations of human rights.
   ``As a precondition for such a conference, I see the liberation
of all prisoners of conscience, and the complete end of the war in
Afghanistan,'' said the 66-year-old Sakharov, who spoke to
reporters on the sidewalk outside his apartment building.
   Sakharov helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s
but increasingly turned his attention to human rights activities in
the 1960s and 1970s. He won the Nobel prize for that work, but was
exiled to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980 for speaking out
against the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in December
1979.
   Gorbachev said Feb. 8 that the Soviet Union could begin
withdrawing its soldiers from Afghanistan on May 15 if
U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva are successful.
   Sakharov, dressed in a parka and fur hat, told reporters that
his first meeting with Shultz was a ``great honor'' and provided
him with valuable information. He excused himself after a short
statement, saying he had just recovered from the flu and could not
stay outdoors longer.
   Shultz visited the apartment with Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne L. Ridgway, chief arms negotiator Max Kampelman, U.S.
Ambassador Jack Matlock and State Department spokesman Charles E.
Redman.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, served tea to the group in
Sakharov's living room. Matlock served as translator, the official
said.
   Asked by reporters about the meeting as he stepped into his car,
Shultz said it was an ``inspiration.'' He then left for talks with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, whom he met earlier
in the day.
   Sakharov said Shultz asked him what the Soviet Union must do to
comply with the 1975 Helsinki agreement's provisions on human
rights. Sakharov said it was ``very important'' for the Soviet
Union to change legislation ``which makes punishment for one's
convictions possible.''
   On arms control, Sakharov said he reminded Shultz that he stood
for ``maximum restraint'' on the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative,
or ``Star Wars'' program for a space-based shield against nuclear
attack.
   That issue is a stumbling block in talks that may lead to an
agreement to halve their arsensals of long-range nuclear weapons.
   He said he valued ``very highly'' the treaty eliminating
medium-and shorter-range nuclear missiles that Gorbachev and Reagan
signed in Washington Dec. 8.
   Sakharov told Shultz the Gorbachev's effort to restructure
Soviet society is a ``deep phenomenon'' and ``very serious,'' he
said.
   Sakharov has been less active in the dissident movement since
returning from exile in December 1986, but occasionally speaks out
on issues such as human rights, nuclear power and more openness in
Soviet history. He has returned to his work in the Soviet Academy
of Sciences.

<TEXT>
   A senior U.N. official said Sunday that
Palestinian unrest in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has
created a new urgency for Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
   ``What has been going on in the occupied territories has created
a new situation,'' said U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack
Goulding, who arrived in Cairo on the last leg of a regional tour.
   He told reporters in Amman, Jordan, earlier Sunday that the
protests, which began Dec. 8, underlined ``the pressing need for
progress towards an in-depth negiation for a just and lasting
settlement.
   ``And I think it has brought home to all concerned that everyone
has got to make a major effort,'' he added.
   Goulding's two-day visit in Egypt is his last stop on a tour
that took him to Tunisia, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. He visited
Israel last month.
   The U.N. envoy was scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid for talks on regional developments, Egypt's state-run
Middle East News Agency said.
   The official Jordanian News Agency said that Marwan Dudin,
acting foreign minister of the occupied territories, told Goulding
in Amman earlier in the day that Israeli forces had killed 108
Palestinians in the unrest, far more than the 61 deaths reported by
the United Nations.
   Dudin said Israeli forces had injured more than 3,000 Arabs.
   ``Mr. Dudin gave me a list of names and ages, locations and
dates, which I haven't had a chance to look at yet,'' Goulding
said. ``But we won't be carrying out a U.N. investigation as such.''
   Dudin's ministry is in charge of Jordanian affairs in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Egypt and Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Most of the estimated 900,000 Arabs on the West Bank and some of
the 600,000 in the Gaza Strip are citizens of Jordan.
   Goulding's visit comes a few days before U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz is scheduled to arrive in Israel. Shultz is
expected to discuss recent U.S. suggestions to grant limited
self-government to Palestinians in the occupied territories as a
step toward a final Arab-Israeli peace settlement.
   ``In some places, I encountered a sense of satisfaction that the
United States is becoming active again on this issue, and there is
obviously great interest in what Secretary Shultz is going to
say,'' Goulding said.
   But he added, ``I cannot claim to have encountered a great deal
of optimism.''

   A shot fired from an army
watchtower near the Irish border killed a young civilian Sunday,
according to a military statement that expressed regret at his
death.
   Witnesses said 23-year-old Aidan McAnespie was shot in the back
while walking to a regular weekly Gaelic football game in
Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, near the border with the Irish Republic.
   The Dublin government immediately requested details of the
shooting, which comes at a time when relations between Britain and
the Irish Republic have been severely strained.
   The Royal Ulster Constablulary said a soldier at the vehicle
checkpoint was in military custody and the shooting was under
investigation.
   An army statement said it ``deeply regrets'' the death, which it
said occurred when a weapon was fired from an observation tower at
the permanent military checkpoint near the village.
   McAnespie, who lived in Aughnacloy, was said to have worked at
Monaghan in the Irish Republic, according to Press Association, the
British domestic news agency.
   Relations between Britain and Ireland have been severely
strained recently after two British decisions concerning sectarian
warfare in the predominantly Protestant British province of
Northern Ireland.
   Britain's Court of Appeal upheld the convictions of six Irishmen
sentenced to life in prison for two Irish Republican Army bombings
that killed 21 people in 1974. The court rejected arguments that
new evidence undermined the confessions and forensic findings that
sent them to prison.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly
Roman Catholic.
   Britain also decided last month not to prosecute any Northern
Ireland police officers connected with the police shootings of
unarmed Roman Catholics in an alleged ``shoot-to-kill'' policy
against Irish nationalist guerrillas.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch says he is giving up his
campaign to boycott Manhattan movie theaters that charge $7
admission because moviegoers weren't going along.
   ``It's clear to me that moviegoers distressed with the higher
prices are nevertheless willing to pay them, having no alternative
other than to boycott, which they have not been doing,'' the mayor
said Sunday through his spokesman, Lee Jones. ``Boycotts without
mass support don't prevail.''
   The mayor's 46-day boycott targeted 44 theaters that had raised
admission prices from $6 to $7.
   Koch says that next weekend he'll probably see his first $7
movie since the boycott began, Jones said.
   Joanne Zyontz, leader of a group calling itself Boycott $7, said
her organization will continue its effort.
   ``We were happy to have the mayor's voice in our fight but we
will not drop the battle at this point,'' Ms. Zyontz said. ``If we
ignore the $7 ticket, next year it will be $10.''

   The CBS affiliate in the Washington area,
WUSA-TV, mistakenly began its ``Face The Nation'' broadcast Sunday
with last week's preview of the New Hampshire primary.
   Commentator Lesley Stahl started the show with, ``Welcome to
`Face The Nation,' this is Lesley Stahl in New Hampshire,'' and
spoke of what would happen in last Tuesday's primary.
   The error was not detected until more than five minutes into the
show.
   At that point, Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson
was talking about prophecies concerning the ``forces of evil'' in
the world and an embattled Israel. The tape was abruptly cut, and
the show picked up with Ms. Stahl in mid-sentence asking Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin about Israeli forces being out of
control in the West Bank.
   Diane Digit, WUSA publicity manager, said as soon as engineers
realized they were mistakenly running last week's show, they
switched to a tape containing the correct broadcast.
   CBS affiliate stations around the country tape the weekly show
from a feed transmitted by the network's New York office, she said.

<HEAD>No Florida Citrus Squeezing Through Roadblocks, Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Roadblocks used to bar Florida fruit because of a
feared citrus canker outbreak probably will be maintained to
discourage shipments, despite a threatened lawsuit, a Texas
official said Sunday.
   ``At this stage of the game, Florida hasn't attempted to send
any citrus fruit in by any of the roadblocks we've got out there
and we don't anticipate that they will,'' said Mike Moeller, deputy
Texas agriculture commissioner.
   A roadblock on Interstate 10 near Orange, Texas, was closed
Sunday because of the lack of activity.
   The state declared a 30-day emergency quarantine on Florida
citrus after the U.S. Department of Agriculture lifted a ban that
was leveled following a 1984 citrus canker outbreak in Florida.
   Texas citrus growers and agriculture officials barred the
Florida fruit from the state, saying the risk of canker, which
causes defoliation and mars fruit, still existed. Roadblocks were
set up along I-10 and Interstate 20, and officials vowed to destroy
any Florida fruit shipments.
   Florida citrus growers, meanwhile, have threatened a federal
lawsuit against the state.
   Moeller said he expects action on the suit will be delayed until
a hearing Thursday in McAllen.
   ``At that time Florida and the USDA will have an opportunity to
come in and attempt to document whether or not we've got a canker
problem,'' he said. ``We don't anticipate that Florida will attempt
to run the blockade anytime before that hearing.''

   A British school teacher has been

kidnapped as he was driving to Peshawar from the North Wazirestan

   Jeremy Moody, press attache at the British Embassy, confirmed
that Landlands had been kidnapped but had no details of the
abduction.
   ``Langlands is an old man and devoted his life to Pakistan. I'm
surprised he was kidnapped,'' Moody said.
   He said the embassy was doing everything possible to find out
what happened and secure his release.
   Abductions are common in the tribal regions.
   Langlands taught at Razmak College in Razmak and has been
headmaster there since 1978. He has also taught at Aitcheson
College in Lahore to the southeast.
   Press reports said Langlands' Pakistani assistant, Gul Khajan,
was also kidnapped, but was freed later.

<HEAD>Report Pan Am, British Caledonian Planes in Near Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pan American jet and a British Caledonian
aircraft, carrying a total of 222 people, nearly collided over the
southeast coast of England on Sunday, the British airline said.
   An air traffic controller was later suspended _ standard
procedure according to the Civil Aviation Authority, which said the
incident is under investigation.
   It is the second near-collision in southern England in two weeks
and the latest in a series of incidents this year that have raised
concern about safety among the controllers.
   British Caledonian said its BA 1-11, carrying 70 people, was
about 25 minutes out of London's Gatwick airport bound for
Amsterdam when its pilot saw the Pan Am Boeing 727 on ``a
converging course'' just below and slightly less than one mile
away, near Southend, Essex at 9 a.m.
   The American airliner with 152 people aboard was headed for
London's Heathrow airport from Oslo, Norway.
   ``As far as the B-Cal captain is concerned, he did not have to
make any alteration to course and had the other plane in sight at
all times,'' said a British airline spokesman, unidentified in
keeping with British practice.
   ``He noticed that although there was a potential conflict, the
Pan-Am aircraft changed its heading,'' the spokesman said.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the
American plane altered its course on instructions from air traffic
control after a potential disaster was realized.
   British Caledonian said its pilot filed an ``air miss'' report
and that the Pan Am pilot was also filing a report.
   Aviation authority officials said they did not know exactly how
far apart the two planes were.
   Aircraft are supposed to be three miles apart horizontally and
1,000 feet vertically.
   One air traffic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said it appeared the incident happened when one of the two planes
descended below its cleared altitude.
   ``We are not sure at this stage which one,'' the official said.
   An aviation authority spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British practice, said: ``Our preliminary findings indicate
that it was not a serious air miss, but it's difficult to say what
the separation was at the moment.''
   He said controllers were suspended until an investigation has
``ruled out any gross error by air traffic control.''
   Two weeks ago a British Airways Lockheed L1011 and a Balkan
Bulgarian Tu-54 with a total of about 500 people on board were
involved in a near-collision over the Kent coast.
   Two air traffic controllers were suspended and Transport
Secretary Paul Channon ordered a special inquiry into the
circumstances of that incident.

<HEAD>Peres Says He Wrote To Meese About Proposed Iraqi Pipeline Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
acknowledged Sunday that he wrote to Attorney General Edwin Meese
III in 1985 about a proposed Iraqi pipeline, but said the note only
indicated that he wanted to discuss the matter with Secretary of
State George Shultz.
   Peres, who was Israel's prime minister at the time, previously
has denied writing to Meese that he supported the $1 billion,
540-mile pipeline project, which was never built.
   Appearing Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
Peres said he had sent Meese a handwritten note regarding the
project during the summer of 1985.
   ``I was told about the idea of laying a pipeline from Iraq
through Jordan up to Elat, which will add, in my judgment, more
security to the whole region and that Israel could have enjoyed oil
for a lesser price,'' Peres said.
   ``Once I was told, I wrote to Meese and I said that if this is
the case, I would like to meet Secretary Shultz, a man for whom I
have the highest regard, in order to discuss it and talk it over.
That was the content of my letter,'' he said.
   Peres has said Meese sent him a handwritten letter in which the
attorney general directed him to deal with then-National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane instead of Shultz.
   The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month that Meese
told Peres to bypass Shultz because of a potential conflict of
interest. Shultz used to be an executive with Bechtel Corp., the
huge San Francisco construction firm which had submitted a bid to
build the pipeline.
   Independent counsel James McKay, who is conducting a criminal
probe of Meese, is investigating the attorney general's role in the
pipeline project.
   Meese has said his involvement in the project was ``entirely
lawful, proper and responsible.''
   At issue in particular is a 1985 memo sent by attorney E. Robert
Wallach to Meese describing the proposed project and mentioning
planned payoffs to the government of Israel and Peres' Labor Party
to ensure that Israel would not attack the pipeline.
   Wallach, a longtime friend of Meese, had been hired by Swiss
businessman Bruce Rappaport, who had been enlisted by Bechtel to
help with the project due to his close ties to Israeli government
officials.
   Federal law prohibits U.S. citizens from bribing foreign
officials and states that the attorney general may take legal
action to stop a violation if it appears that one is about to occur.
   Rappaport has said he did not intend to pay bribes and that the
payments would be standard business procedure and would come from
profits from the pipeline or discounts on the oil.
   Peres has denied repeatedly that anything of value was offered
or accepted by him or his Labor Party in connection with the
pipeline. He repeated that denial Sunday.
   Meese has said that he doesn't recall reading the portion of the
memo mentioning payments, but said, ``I do not believe that it
fairly implies that a violation of law was committed or
contemplated in connection with the pipeline.''

   A mine apparently left over from World
War II sank a French trawler in the English Channel on Sunday when
it exploded in the boat's fishing nets, but all four crew members
were rescued safely, officials said.
   An official at the CROSS-MA search and rescue headquarters in
Cherbourg, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the boat La
Minette hit the mine early Sunday morning about 30 miles north of
the Normandy coast.
   A nearby trawler rescued the crew members and brought them back
to Port-a-Bessin, their home port, 25 miles northwest of Caen.
   Another official at CROSS-MA said authorities believed the mine
was one of many remaining after the June 6, 1944 Allied assault on
German defenses in Normandy.
   The official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
fishing boats drag up World War II-vintage mines or shells about
once a month, but explosions are rare.

   President Corazon Aquino recalled
Sunday that when Ferdinand Marcos was preparing to go into exile,
she reluctantly allowed him to stay overnight at U.S.-run Clark Air
Base.
   But Mrs. Aquino said on her weekly radio show that she had
refused to let the ousted president go to his home province.
   Mrs. Aquino also said she had been told of the coup plot against
Marcos that led to the ``People Power'' revolution Feb. 22-25 1986
but she did not believe the planners would go through with it.
   Mrs. Aquino said Sunday night that the role of the U.S. Embassy
during Marcos' final hours as president was ``making arrangements
for Marcos to leave the country.''
   Marcos has claimed he was kidnapped by U.S. authorities and
tricked into boarding a plane, thinking he would be flown to Ilocos
Norte, his home province in the northern Philippines.
   But Mrs. Aquino said U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth called her
the evening of Feb. 25 to say the Marcoses would be flown to Clark.
   After the Marcoses reached the base, Bosworth called her again
and asked if they could stay overnight at the base and then fly to
Ilocos Norte for a rest, she said.
   ``I said no, he can rest in Clark, but he has to leave first
thing in the morning. And so that was the agreement, and that was
why Marcos and his family flew the next day to Honolulu,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino invited listeners to join a ``Chain for Peace''
during second anniversary celebrations Thursday along a road
dividing the two military camps where the revolt occurred.

   A brain-dead baby was taken off
life-support machines after no recipients could be found for his
organs, but another anencephalic baby remained on a respirator
Sunday, officials said.
   The boy known only as Baby John, born Tuesday and declared
brain-dead Thursday, had been kept alive in hopes that his organs
could be transplanted in a pioneering program established by Loma
Linda University Medical Center.
   The infant was removed from life-support Saturday after doctors
seeking a liver for four patients rejected his organ because it had
deteriorated over a 36-hour period. No candidate with the same
blood type was found for his heart, which stopped beating after he
was removed from a respirator.
   The deterioration of the liver affected all the baby's organs,
hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell said. ``When one organ begins
to fail, the other organs begin to fail.''
   Baby John was the controversial program's first U.S. baby.
Another couple had hoped to enroll their child in the program, but
the infant was stillborn on Dec. 22.
   Evelyn Keys, born Saturday with the same fatal birth defect in
San Antonio, Texas, was flown to Loma Linda and placed in the
transplant program for anencephalic infants _ babies born without
most of their brain.
   ``Baby Evelyn is resting comfortably this morning. She shows
some signs of brain stem deterioration but has not yet met all
criteria of total brain death,'' Ms. Rockwell said Sunday.
   Anencephalic babies live only briefly. Loma Linda wants to
establish a practice of sustaining such babies so the organs can be
used for transplants after brain death occurs.
   Baby Evelyn, the first child of Judy Keys, 22, and Airman Todd
Keys, 21, stationed at Lackland Air Force Base, was born with only
a brain stem.
   Sustaining anencephalic infants for use as organ donors has
raised an ethical debate, and Loma Linda is the first hospital in
the United States to develop a medical protocol allowing the
practice.
   Under Loma Linda's guidelines, approved Dec. 18, an anencephalic
baby will remain on a respirator no longer than a week.
   If the baby is declared brain dead during that time, he or she
becomes a potential donor. The rules require that two physicians
not associated with the potential transplant recipient agree on a
finding of brain death.
   After the week is up, the baby is removed from the respirator
and allowed to die naturally, whether brain death has been declared
by that time or not.
   Several thousand anencephalic babies are born in the United
States each year. Their brain stems sustain basic functions such as
breathing for a short time, but death occurs within hours or days
of birth.
   Ethical problems raised by the practice of sustaining
anencephalic babies include the questions of whether such infants
feel pain and whether it is ethical to prolong a life when it does
not benefit that patient.
   Last October, a brain-dead anencephalic girl was flown from
Canada to Loma Linda where her heart was successfully transplanted
into the chest of newborn Paul Holc.
   The medical center, a Seventh-day Adventist hospital, has
specialized in infant heart transplants. Thirteen babies under the
age of 4 months have received new hearts there. Nine have survived.
   The center, 65 miles east of Los Angeles, became well known in
1984 when Dr. Leonard Bailey unsuccessfully transplanted the heart
of a baboon into an infant called Baby Fae.

   A woman convicted of involuntary
manslaughter in the death of her baby on an airliner has been
paroled after serving 120 days of a five-year sentence.
   Julie Killeen, 22, of San Francisco pleaded guilty in October
and was sentenced by Platte County Circuit Judge John Yeaman.
   Yeaman placed Ms. Killeen on probation earlier this month, but
declined to say why. California authorities will supervise her
probation.
   Ms. Killeen's daughter was born June 30 in the lavatory of a
Miami-bound airliner during a 45-minute layover at Kansas City
International Airport, authorities said. The baby died of
suffocation.
   Ms. Killeen told police she dumped the baby's body in a trash
can after the plane arrived at Miami International Airport so that
her father wouldn't know she was pregnant. She also said she
thought the baby was stillborn.
   A maintenance worker found the infant girl's body in the Miami
airport trash can.

<TEXT>
   A communist-backed millionaire narrowly
defeated his veteran conservative opponent Sunday to become
president of Cyprus in his first political campaign.
   ``I see this as a victory for Cyprus,'' said George Vassiliou,
56. During his campaign he promised that as head of the Greek
Cypriot government he would push for reunification talks with the
Turkish side of the divided Mediterranean island.
   Vassiliou urged restraint by supporters, but isolated street
brawls broke out between his backers and those of conservative
Glafcos Clerides in Nicosia, the capital.
   Jubilant leftists set fire to Clerides posters and banners,
broke several shop windows and stoned cars outside a right-wing
club.
   In unofficial final returns Vassiliou garnered 51.63 percent of
the vote and Clerides 48.37 percent in the first closely contested
election since independence from Britain in 1960.
   Clerides, 68, and Vassiliou knocked out incumbent Spyros
Kyprianou in a first round of balloting in the Greek Cypriot sector
on Feb. 14.
   Vassiliou called off a pre-dawn election rally, telling The
Associated Press: ``There is no victor or vanquished. We should all
work together for the good of Cyprus.''
   He said he would make no immediate policy statements.
   Clerides told state-run television: ``The Cyprus people have
chosen Vassiliou as a new president. Despite the small difference,
there is no doubt he won the election.''
   More than 90 percent of the 363,000 voters turned out to vote in
the runoff. With 325,062 valid ballots counted from Sunday's
election, Vassiliou had 167,834 and Clerides 157,228.Voting was
compulsory for all those 21, and there were several thousand
ballots ruled invalid.
   Kyprianou, 55, had sought a third five-year term on a platform
of no negotiations with the Turkish side of the island unless
30,000 Turkish troops and 65,000 Turkish mainland settlers withdrew
from the Turkish-occupied north.
   Rauf Denktash, president of the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state
established in northern Cyprus in 1983, has offered to meet the new
president in preliminary negotiations aimed at breaking the
3-year-old deadlock in peace talks sponsored by the United Nations.
   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when the Turkish army
invaded the eastern Mediterranean island following a short-lived
coup by Greek Cypriot extremists favoring a union with Greece.
   Turkey seized the the northern third of the island and forced
about 180,000 Greek Cypriots to flee to the south. Turkish Cypriots
declared their own republic in 1983, but Turkey is the only country
to recognize it.
   The separation of the island has been the dominant issue in the
election. Clerides and Vassiliou both said they would hold talks
with the other side.
   Clerides, a veteran negotiator who has held inconclusive talks
with Denktash in the past, promised to form an all-party national
unity government to handle peace talks.
   Vassiliou also stressed unity, but rejected the coalition
proposal as unfeasible. He offered instead to appoint ministers of
``wide acceptance'' with no party affiliations.
   The new president will be sworn in next Sunday.
   After the first-round defeat of Kyprianou, the campaign
developed into a direct left-right battle between Vassiliou and
Clerides.
   Clerides charged that Vassiliou's independence was a sham, and
that his election would result in communist domination.
   To bolster his national unity plank, Clerides resigned as leader
of the pro-Western Democratic Rally party to run in the second
round as an independent.
   Vassiliou's camp charged Clerides of being a ``right-wing,
anti-labor reactionary.'' He was also accused of harboring fascist
elements involved in the 1974 coup, which briefly overthrew the
island's first president, the revered late Archbishop Makarios, and
sparked the Turkish invasion.
   The race was thrown open on Thursday when Kyprianou, the leader
of the centrist Democratic Party, told the 91,000 people who voted
for him, about 27.3 percent of the total, that they could choose
either Clerides or Vassiliou.
   Clerides topped the first round with 33.3 percent of the vote,
followed by Vassiliou with 30.1 percent.
   The Turkish Cypriot minority of 150,000, concentrated in the
north, votes separately for the leadership of its breakaway state
with its own constitution.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the U.S. Congress approves new
non-lethal aid for the Contra rebels it will be ``erasing the word
peace,'' President Daniel Ortega said Sunday.
   In a two-hour speech at the opening session of the National
Assembly, Ortega said the United States ``continues to propitiate
and finance the war against Nicaragua and despite the vote of
Congress against that aid, this chapter has not closed.''
   He said President Reagan will look for a way to obtain more
financing for the Contras by calling the assistance humanitarian
aid.
   ``If the North American Congress approves that type of
financing, it would be erasing the word peace that it wrote when it
voted against the funds, and would be putting (in) the word `war,'
'' he said in the speech, broadcast over a government national
radio network.
   ``That is the little game of Congress, a Congress where many
interests, particularly egotistical, are involved and which is
playing with life, hunger, security and the self-determination of
the Nicaraguan people,'' he said.
   Reagan lost his bid in a House vote Feb. 3 for a $36.2 million
aid package that included about $3.6 million for weapons and
ammunition, along with additional millions for military logistical
support for the rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government.
   Democrats prevailed in that vote, 219-211, after the party's
leadership promised wavering members that there would be a later
opportunity to vote on a package of Contra aid that included only
food, clothing, medicine and shelter.
   A group of Democrats, together with one or two Republicans who
voted against the president's proposal, have been meeting to draft
such an alternative.
   Ortega claimed in his speech that the U.S. Embassy in Managua is
financing opposition groups ``including the Communist Party.''
   Deputies from the Communist Party and two other opposition
parties did not attend the assembly session.
   Among the invited guests were Uruguayan Vice President Enrique
Ernesto Tarigo Vasquez and the Rev. Roy Bourgeois. The Roman
Catholic priest was sentenced to 10 months in jail for trespassing
during a demonstration at an Air Force base in Florida where
Nicaraguan rebels reportedly were being trained.
   In the speech, Ortega said 26,500 people have been killed since
the war began in 1981 and 23,882 others wounded. Other sources have
said unofficially in the past that more than 40,000 have died.
   The war, he said, has cost the country $3.6 billion.
   In 1987 alone, he said, damage to the economy from the war
totaled $376 million, more than the country's exports of $270
million.
   Despite the war, he said, the economy expanded at an
inflation-adjusted rate of 1.7 percent. It contracted 0.4 percent
in 1986.
   Ortega said consumer prices soared a whopping 1,347 percent last
year, compared to 657 percent in 1986.
   The government recently unveiled a new program to try to control
the runaway inflation rate, introducing a new cordoba currency,
boosting prices of basic goods, increasing salaries and cracking
down on speculators.
   Ortega also praised the strategic weapons agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``Those agreements tell us that if understanding is possible at
those levels, it may be easier for there to be understanding at
other levels, and particularly in places where there are conflicts
as in Nicaragua,'' he said.

   Two firefighters were suspended for
allegedly manhandling and threatening a fire official because of
the graduation of black and women rookies in the racially troubled
fire department.
   The Fire Commission on Saturday suspended Anthony Serpa, a
12-year veteran, for six days and Walter Glynn, an 18-year veteran,
for four days, as part of a plea bargain. Both will lose up to
$1,500 in pay, officials said.
   The two, who allegedly were drunk at the time of the incident
Nov. 10, also will be dispatched to a different station daily for
the next eight months as part of the agreement.
   The incident in a bar came at a time of department tensions
prompted by the hiring and recruitment of minorities and women.
Incidents such as the discovery of a swastika near the desk of two
minority firefighters led to a call for an FBI civil rights
investigation and the resignation of Chief Edward Phipps.
   The ``very heated confrontation'' occurred after more than a
dozen firefighters had been drinking following a station banquet,
said Capt. Michael McKinley, who led the department's investigation.
   Training division Chief Fred Postel and training Capts. Elmer
Ballard and Alberto da Cuhuna entered the bar. The men told Postel
that ``he was letting people by in training who weren't
qualified,'' McKinley said.
   ``Clearly, they were way out of bounds'' in the incident in
which they threatened Postel, poked him in the ribs, cursed and
manhandled him when he tried to leave, McKinley said.
   The department withdrew charges of violence, disobedience,
insubordination and acts detrimental to the fire department's
welfare, he said.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., seeking to come on strong in his native
South, renewed his attacks Sunday on Democratic presidential rivals
Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis. And Republican Bob Dole
ridiculed the vice president for pulling his campaign out of South
Dakota, demanding: ``Where's George Bush?''
   South Dakota and Minnesota _ with campaign contests set Tuesday
_ drew a cluster of GOP and Democratic contenders over the weekend.
   GOP presidential hopeful Pat Robertson combined politicking and
preaching Sunday at a church dedication in Spartanburg, S.C.. He
told 4,000 cheering supporters that the country must return to the
religious foundation ``upon which this country is laid.''
   ``The government does not give freedom. That comes from God,''
the former television evangelist said. ``We give the government
what freedom we want to, not the other way around.''
   Gephardt, who has made trade issues a campaign cornerstone, said
he was undaunted by word that his House colleagues were planning to
scuttle his trade amendment, which calls for sanctions against
countries that maintain large trade surpluses with the United
States.
   ``We're going to dump it because it's bad policy,'' Rep. Sam
Gibbons, D-Fla., a member of the House-Senate conference committee
working on a compromise trade bill. But the Missouri congressman,
in Watertown, S.D., vowed: ``I'm going to fight for my amendment.''
   Gore, who sat out the Iowa caucuses that Gephardt won and staged
only a limited effort in New Hampshire where Dukakis triumphed,
blasted the two in a television interview, continuing a round of
attacks he kicked off at a Dallas debate on Thursday.
   The Tennessee senator, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,''
defended his aggressive tactics by paraphrasing Harry Truman.
   ``I'm not giving them hell _ I'm just telling the truth and they
think it's hell,'' Gore said.
   Gore, who has been attacking Gephardt for reversing positions on
some issues, picked up the theme again Sunday.
   ``It's not a case of just having one or two or three issues
where he has changed 180 degrees. There is a long, long list of
issues. You can't tell whether the views he is enunciating today
are the ones he will have tomorrow,'' Gore said of the Missouri
congressman.
   He said Dukakis, as governor of Massachusetts, has not had ``a
single day's experience in foreign policy, which shows in some of
the statements he's made.''
   That drew a swift reaction from the Dukakis campaign. ``Al
Gore's never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building
an economy,'' said Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications director.
   Dukakis, who hopes to make the White House his home, attended a
black-tie dinner there Sunday night and was also to pay a visit
Monday, when he and other members of the National Governors'
Association meet with President Reagan.
   On his way into the White House, Dukakis quipped to reporters,
``I'm just looking the place over, that's all.'' Asked where he
hoped to be next year, Dukakis replied, ``I hope right here.'
   Gephardt, in South Dakota, was also anticipating taking up
residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. ``When I'm president, you're
going to have someone who understands the problems of South
Dakota,'' he said at a train depot in Aberdeen.
   Democrat Paul Simon, stung by a second-place finish in Iowa and
a third-place showing in New Hampshire, courted labor backing in
Lead, S.D. Later, at Mount Rushmore, he posed with the carved
visages of four presidents as a backdrop.
   ``There's one visible defect,'' he joked. ``Abraham Lincoln wore
bow ties all the time.'' Simon's bow ties are his trademark.
   South Dakota, which has a primary on Tuesday, and Minnesota,
which holds caucuses the same day, were fertile campaign ground on
Sunday.
   Hart, who garnered almost no support in Iowa and New Hampshire,
visited South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian reservation, where he and
his wife, Lee, joined in a friendship dance with Oglala Sioux
children. Hart told a crowd at a tribal building the United States
should honor treaty commitments to Indian tribes.
   A poll in Sunday's editions of the Minneapolis Star Tribune
suggested Dole was the favorite among Minnesota Republicans and
Dukakis among Democrats. But the newspaper said the poll was not
designed to be an indicator of the candidates' likely performance,
because it was not confined to likely caucus-goers.
   Dole campaigned Sunday in Wyoming, which holds caucuses March 5
_ three days before Super Tuesday, when 20 states, most of them in
the South, have primaries and caucuses.
   Bush, in the face of a strong Dole effort in South Dakota,
decided last week to withdraw from the state _ a fact the Kansas
senator made much of in a string of appearances on Sunday.
   ``George Bush's decision to turn his back on America's heartland
is the mark of a regional candidacy that cannot win,'' Dole said in
Casper, Wyo. ``Where is George Bush? He may run from the West and
the Midwest, but he can't hide in the South.''
   In other developments:
   _ A poll published in the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas
Morning News suggested the state's March 8 primary could prove to
be a tight race among Democrats. Dukakis drew the support of 27
percent; 21 percent were unsure; 16 percent favored Jesse Jackson,
15 percent backed Gephardt, 11 percent supported Gore, with seven
percent choosing Hart and 2 percent favoring Simon.
   Among Republicans, 66 percent favored Bush, while 12 percent
supported Dole; 11 percent favored Pat Robertson, and 10 percent
were unsure. In the poll, 736 voters were interviewed Feb. 17-18,
and the margin of error was 4 percentage points.
   _ Robertson, asked for comment on evangelist Jimmy Swaggart
stepping down pending an investigation of allegations of sexual
misconduct, said he was ``running so hard for president I really
haven't had a chance to think much about it.''
   _ Jackson, in Philadelphia, picked up the endorsement of Mayor
Wilson Goode and Rep. William Gray III and appealed for donations
to buy air time in the Super Tuesday states. ``We have a message,
but we need money to tell our story,'' he said.

<HEAD>Intruder Arrested In Buckingham Palace Mews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drunken youth penetrated security devices
designed to protect the royal family and was arrested about 200
yards from Buckingham Palace, Scotland Yard said early Monday.
   The Yard, headquarters of the metropolitan police, said the
incident occurred Sunday morning. It said no further action was
planned against the youth, who was released after being cautioned
for being drunk and disorderly.
   The Yard declined to give the youth's name, address or age. It
also would not detail how he got into the royal mews, which serves
as stable and garage for Queen Elizabeth II's 30 carriage horses,
coaches and cars.
   He was arrested in the mews, about 200 yards from the palace.
   The mews is normally entered from Buckingham Palace Road through
a huge pair of doors set in a high wall topped with spikes, barbed
wire, alarms and remote control cameras.
   The palace said the queen was not at Buckingham Palace at the
time of the intrusion.
   She was at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, where the
royal family often prefers to spend weekends.
   Security at 650-room Buckingham Palace and its 45 acres of
grounds was improved after an unemployed drifter, Michael Fagan,
climbed a drainpipe in 1982 to reach the queen's bedroom, sat on
her bed and spoke to her before he was nabbed.
   A jury found Fagan innocent of stealing a bottle of Californian
wine which he drank during a break-in at the palace earlier in
1982. He was never charged with breaking in to the palace because
it was regarded as trespassing, a civil offense, and the palace
wouldn't take him to court.

   The government will repay $500 million
in loans from the World Bank ahead of schedule, the Finance
Ministry said Monday.
   Officials said the ministry plans to pay back the loans within
the first half of this year, but has not set an exact date.
   The ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the decision was in response to the bank's request for an
early partial repayment. South Korea now owes the bank $3 billion
in loans.
   Buoyed by strong exports amd a surging current account surplus,
South Korea repaid about $9 billion in public and commercial loans
last year, reducing its total debts to $35.6 billion by the end of
the year.
   South Korea's current account surplus in 1987 more than doubled
to $9.78 billion from $4.61 billion a year ago.
   Current accounts measure trade in merchandise and services plus
some other international transactions.

   British actor Dudley Moore, who chased Bo

   They were married by a justice of the peace in a short ceremony

   Moore was due back in Los Angeles on Monday for rehearsals of
the operetta ``The Mikado'' with the Los Angeles Opera, Pitt said.
   ``The two hope to star in a film together in the future and are
looking for projects,'' Bloch said.
   Moore's previous wives were English actress Suzy Kendall, to
whom he was from 1968 to 1970; and American actress Tuesday Weld,
his wife from 1975 to 1980, with whom he had a son.

<TEXT>
   Members of the ruling Kenya African
National Union party test a controversial ballot-by-queueing system
Monday when, for the first time, they nominate candidates for
general elections.
   Under the new system, which the party introduced in 1986 to stop
corruption and give members a bigger voice, they will nominate an
estimated 750 candidates to contest March 21 general elections for
Parliament.
   Thousands of other candidates are standing for seats on urban,
rural and district councils.
   In previous elections, scheduled every five years, candidates
were nominated by three people _ the party chairman,
secretary-general and treasurer. President Daniel arap Moi also is
president of KANU.
   By law, Kenya is a one-party state and KANU must approve all
candidates. Some 4.3 million of the 20 million people are party
members eligible to queue during Monday's nominations.
   The secret ballot will be used at the general elections, in
which all citizens aged over 18 years and registered to vote can
take part. There are 5.5 million registered voters.
   Some voters will not have the opportunity. Candidates who win
more than 70 percent of votes at Monday's party nominations
automatically go to the 200-member Parliament.
   Church leaders, lawyers and a few politicians have criticized
the regulation and the new system, where voters must stand in a
line behind their candidate.
   Results of Monday's nominations will be published at the end of
February, when the party also is holding presidential nominations.
But nobody is expected to challenge Moi, who has ruled Kenya for 10
years since the death of its first president, Jomo Kenyatta.
   The nation became independent from Britain 25 years ago.

   The new owner of the New York Post spent Sunday
talking with advisers about how to improve the prospects for
survival of the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, his spokesman said.
   One Post employee called it ``the $22 million question'' _
whether multimillionaire businessman Peter Kalikow, aided by
financial concessions by the Post's unions, will be able to stem
the tabloid's flow of red ink.
   Equally intriguing was whether the real estate developer would
tone down a sometimes sensationalistic style of journalism that has
titillated, outraged, amused and generally entertained readers for
more than a decade.
   Kalikow will take over the Post for $37.6 million on March 7,
pending rank-and-file ratification of the concessions and
verification by his accountants of the details.
   The sale of the paper by owner Rupert Murdoch cleared its final
hurdle early Saturday when leaders of the newspaper's 10 unions
agreed to the $22 million in concessions to keep it alive. Union
members were expected to ratify the agreements this week.
   Now Kalikow has to do is figure out how to turn around one of
the biggest money losers in the newspaper business.
   The Post lost about $17 million before taxes last year, and
about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months.
   Its circulation has dropped from 700,000 to 500,000, partly
because of a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan New York.
   Kalikow spent the day talking to advisers about ways to improve
the Post's prospects, according to Howard J. Rubenstein, his
spokesman.
   The 45-year-old businessman, estimated to be worth about $500
million, has approved a $2 million promotional campaign for the
newspaper and is scheduling luncheon meetings with leading
advertisers and community and business leaders, Rubenstein said. He
also plans meetings with Mayor Edward I. Koch and Gov. Mario Cuomo
to discuss his plans for the Post.
   Despite Kalikow's many other business interests, ``He's going to
be a very active owner,'' Rubenstein said.
   Under his contract with Murdoch, Kalikow promised to operate the
paper for at least one year.
   Rubenstein said Kalikow was considering making the Post strictly
a morning paper, and denied that Kalikow was leaning toward an
afternoon-only paper with a smaller circulation and a higher price.
   Despite its down-scale reputation, a $1 million marketing study
commissioned by Kalikow ``shows the paper already appeals to a
fairly well-to-do audience,'' Rubenstein said.
   Kalikow is widely thought to want to back away from the paper's
emphasis on stories of sex, crime and scandal. The Post will remain
a tabloid, but ``there will be a change in format,'' Rubenstein
said. ``There'll be changes in headlines, in the front page, in the
emphasis of the paper.''
   But, Rubenstein added, the paper's new owner ``still wants it to
be feisty and provocative.''
   The specifics, he said, were being worked out by Kalikow and
Frank Devine, who is staying on as executive editor.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Allegheny International Inc.
insists the consumer products company will continue business as
usual even though it has filed for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy laws.
   The Pittsburgh-based company and some of its subsidiaries filed
for Chapter 11 reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Saturday.
   The company has total debts of around $845 million, while its
assets are estimated at $735 million.
   ``I'm confident AI will emerge a stronger and more viable
company,'' Allegheny International Chairman Oliver S. Travers said
in a statement.
   Included in the filing for reorganization and protection from
creditors are Allegheny International; Sunbeam Corp., its principal
subsidiary; Almet-Lawnlite Inc., Sunbeam's subsidiary; Sunbeam
Holdings Inc.; and Chemetron Corp.
   Allegheny International said a $175 million line of credit has
been arranged through two major New York banks.
   The credit line, the company said, provides enough cash to run
the companies during the reorganization.
   ``The reorganization will enable AI to operate with the
stability needed to continue the successful growth of its consumer
products operations and improve its complex capital structure,''
Travers said.
   ``Chapter 11 provides the means to implement corporate
restructuring and continue the company's profitable turnaround,''
said Travers, chairman since 1986.
   The action provides court authorization for the company to
continue normal operations, he said. ``It's business as usual at
our facilities.''
   Travers said Allegheny International sought court protection
because its complex capital structure and excessive debt could not
be refinanced and reorganized without court protection.
   Sunbeam and Almet-Lawlite are profitable, Travers said, and
wouldn't have had to file for protection if it weren't for
Allegheny International's complex financial situation.
   Consumer products manufactured by Sunbeam include small
household appliances, electric blankets and barbecue grills.
Almet-Lawnlite makes lawn and patio furniture.
   The bankruptcy filing does not affect Sunbeam Corp.'s consumer
products operations in Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and Peru,
according to the company. It also does not affect industrial and
high-technology companies that Allegheny International is in the
process of divesting.
   Since a change in Allegheny International's management in August
1986, the company said it has sold 19 subsidiaries. The company
said it also has reduced expenses and focused on its consumer
products operations.
   Last September, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
the company with failing to record and to disclose perks given to
former chairman Robert J. Buckley and other executives, including
the use of company-owned residences and aircraft.
   Allegheny International, prior to 1981, was known as Allegheny
Ludlum Industries. The company acquired Sunbeam Corp. that year for
$534 million.

   When you're in charge of handling $7 billion in
cash, sometimes a million or two can slip through the cracks, says
Ford Motor Co. money-manager Malcolm S. Macdonald.
   Macdonald, assistant treasurer for the world's No. 2 automaker,
says he flew into a panic once when $5 million couldn't be
accounted for.
   The trouble began when he asked a bank to send $5 million to the
Central Bank of Brazil. The bank sent the money to the Central Bank
of Bolivia instead.
   ``There was a period of time when I was concerned about my
career prospects,'' he said.
   Keeping track of the growing nest egg of one of the nation's
most profitable corporations can lead to a lot of anxiety,
Macdonald acknowledged.
   ``I wake up in the middle of the night sweating,'' he said.
   Macdonald watches over more than $7 billion of Ford's $10
billion-plus in cash and marketable securities.
   The money he watches is the money Ford keeps on hand to pay its
workers and its bills and to finance acquisitions. The rest of
Ford's liquid assets are handled by Ford of Europe.
   Ford, which earned an automotive industry record $4.6 billion in
1987, entrusts more than 20 percent of its total assets to
Macdonald, who invests cash while making sure there's enough on
hand to pay operating expenses.
   Macdonald and his 26-person staff have to be careful how they
invest the money, because the automaker must be able to get to it
at all times.
   ``All our investments must be liquid. If Mr. (Bruce) Blythe
calls us up one day and says `I need $1 billion on March 30 to
complete an acquisition,' we can't say `Gee, that's going to be
kind of tough. We bought these bonds, and we can't sell them
yet,''' Macdonald said.
   Blythe directs Ford's diversification planning.
   The guidelines that Macdonald and his staff follow in investing
Ford's cash allow them to buy only high-grade securities and
prohibit them from playing the stock market.
   ``On Oct. 19 we were very grateful for that policy. There is
plenty of risk in the car business without trying to get rich in
the securities business,'' Macdonald said.
   Ford tries to keep less than $10 million in its bank accounts
overnight because banks pay limited interest on corporate checking
accounts, he said. The biggest chunk of Ford's money goes into U.S.
Treasury bills and other government and corporate bonds.

   Talks between Pan Am Corp. and the 4,500-member
union representing reservation clerks broke off Sunday. The union
vowed to disrupt operations through ``guerrilla warfare'' but put
off any strike.
   Pan Am officials said airline service continued without
interruption even if there eventually is a walkout, and threatened
to discipline any workers disrupting service. But the federal
mediator involved in the negotiations said he was optimistic the
two sides would return to the bargaining table.
   ``We can strike any time we want,'' said William Genoese,
director of the Teamsters airline division. ``We're going to pick
our strategic time.''
   Asked when that might be, Genoese said, ``Today, tomorrow, next
week, next month ... When it hurts them the most.'' The union had
originally set a strike deadline for 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
   Genoese said reservation clerks and other Teamsters members
would attempt to disrupt Pan Am operations through ``guerrilla
warfare,'' starting immediately.
   ``There's going to be trouble on the job,'' he said. ``They're
not going to correct anybody's errors, they're not going to help
anybody, they're not going to do anything for anybody. ... There's
no more talks as far as we're concerned. We are at war with them,
complete warfare.''
   But a Pan Am spokesman, Jeff Kriendler, called Genoese ``the
jerk'' and his threat ``completely ridiculous.''
   ``Whereas the leadership may be at warfare with Pan Am, the rank
and file are completely loyal to the company,'' Kriendler said.
``It is not in their hearts to turn their backs on their
customers.''
   Any workers taking part in that warfare would face ``discipline
in the severest form,'' he added.
   Negotiations began late Saturday night at the request of a
federal mediator, and continued for six hours past the midnight
strike deadline. When talks broke off Sunday morning, Teamsters
leaders said that union members _ reservation clerks, customer
service agents and other clerical staff _ would continue to work.
   The talks resumed at 3 p.m. at Pan Am headquarters in Manhattan,
but recessed about a half-hour later when the company rejected the
mediator's call for arbitration, according to Genoese.
   The federal mediator involved in the negotiations, Walter C.
Wallace, said after the talks broke off that he had asked both
sides to re-evaluate their positions.
   The Federal Mediation Board ``will stay in touch with the
parties, and there will be a resumption of negotiations at an early
and appropriate time,'' Wallace said.
   ``I have been involved in negotiations where there have been
shootings and bombings ... and I am still involved in
negotiations'' with the antagonistic parties, he said.
   The labor dispute involves Pan Am's attempts to cut costs by $35
million through concessions by the Teamsters. The ailing airline
needs labor concessions totaling $540 million over the next three
years, company officials have said.
   Asked about the major points of contention, Pan Am spokesman
Jeff Kriendler said, ``Let's say that the company long ago
established a $35 million objective of achieving cost reductions.
What is negotiable is how we reach the $35 million figure.''
   The company does not view the amount itself as negotiable,
Kriendler said, but the union maintains that it is.
   The company has vowed to maintain operations with replacement
workers in the event of a strike. The Transport Workers Union voted
Friday not to support a Teamsters' strike, and pilots, flight
attendants and flight engineers were not expected to honor picket
lines.
   The Teamsters represent workers at airports in Boston, Detroit,
Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Honolulu,
Houston, Washington, New York and the Florida cities of Tampa,
Orlando and Miami. The vast majority of the workers are employed in
New York and Miami.

<HEAD>New UPI Management Team To Meet Monday With Guild Representatives</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `Efforts to ...' to ADD attempts to reach WNW
spokesman; SUBS 9th graf pvs, `A proxy ...' to conform; Also moved

   The new management team at United Press
International will meet on Monday with representatives of the Wire
Service Guild to discuss the change in leadership at the
money-losing news service.
   Dan Carmichael, a negotiator and guild spokesman, said Sunday
that UPI's new president, Paul Steinle, asked to meet with guild
officials about the transfer of control to World News Wire Group
Inc.
   The union ``wants to see UPI remain an integrated, quality,
competitive general international news service,'' Carmichael said
Sunday.
   Following the meeting, Dr. Earl W. Brian, 45, the chairman of
WNW, and Steinle plan to hold a news conference to discuss the
transition.
   Efforts to reach Brian and Steinle, who assumes direct
operational control of UPI, were unsuccessful Sunday. Telephone
numbers for the two were not available. Calls to the Washington
hotel where WNW spokesman Dwight Geduldig was staying were not
immediately returned.
   Mario Vazquez Rana, a Mexican publisher who paid $41 million to
acquire UPI from Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
June, announced Friday that he had sold control of the company's
stock to the WNW.
   Vazquez Rana granted WNW ``irrevocable proxy'' to operate UPI
for at least 10 years ``in exchange for present and future
financial considerations totaling more than $55 million,'' UPI said
in a statement.
   Under the arrangement, Vazquez Rana gave up all management and
financial obligation for UPI.
   A proxy represents a transfer of voting power represented by the
ownership shares, but not the shares themselves. No stock changed
hands, Geduldig said Saturday.
   Under an earlier agreement with the guild, Vazquez Rana cannot
sell his interest in UPI without first giving the union the right
of first refusal.
   The proxy arrangement enables WNW to take control of UPI without
buying it, but Brian said in an interview in Sunday's New York
Times that he intends to acquire the news agency and will meet with
the union to discuss how that might be done.
   Brian, who also is chairman of Financial News Network, the
24-hour cable television service, was an unsuccessful bidder for
UPI in 1985 and waged a vigorous legal challenge to Vazquez Rana's
efforts to acquire the company.
   Brian, a former surgeon, was California's health and welfare
secretary while President Reagan was governor of the state. He
created Biotech Capital Corp., which changed its name last year to
Infotechnology Inc.
   Brian declined to commit himself to preserving UPI as a general
news service. Union leaders have expressed concern it might be
turned into a specialized service, concentrating, for example, on
business news.
   ``I'm not going in with any commitment other than to turn this
business around,'' Brian told the Times.
   He added that Vazquez Rana's statement that UPI loses $1 million
a month may prove to be a conservative estimate.
