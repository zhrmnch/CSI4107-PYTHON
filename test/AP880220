   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will have
to overcome Yitzhak Shamir's growing opposition if he expects the
new U.S. peace proposals to get anywhere.
   The 72-year-old prime minister, a former underground fighter and
senior spymaster, has a reputation for being tough-minded. Aides
say he will not yield to the pressure of negative publicity or
diplomatic arm-twisting.
   Shamir has expressed serious reservations, and some annoyance,
about American ideas for reviving progress toward peace in the
Middle East. To clear the air in advance of the Shultz visit next
week, he sent emissaries to Washington to declare what he would and
would not accept.
   One envoy was Ehud Olmert, a senior figure in Shamir's
conservative Likud Bloc, who said he told Shultz the prime minister
would not agree to territorial compromise in advance of peace talks.
   ``Territory for peace is a non-starter,'' Olmert said in an
interview. ``We are ready to negotiate on the territorial issue,
but that doesn't mean we are ready to accept withdrawing from the
territories before negotiations.''
   Israel has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip since capturing
them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shultz suggested the land-for-peace formula in a speech to the
Council on Foreign Relations in Washington and it apparently upset
Shamir.
   ``The timing, manner and phrasing was inappropriate, inasmuch as
he wants to have the prime minister in the process,'' Olmert said,
adding that he believed the secretary of state realized his
``mistake.''
   Shultz's plan calls for:
   _ An international forum that would convene by April to launch
Arab-Israeli negotiations. The Soviets would likely play an equal
role with Washington.
   _ An interim solution for the West Bank and Gaza in the form of
self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians who live there.
Elections would be held by October to choose a self-governing body.
   _ Talks on the final status of the occupied lands to start by
December even without progress on autonomy.
   Shamir initially indicated flexibility, to encourage
negotiations, but the suggestion that he would agree to yield some
of the occupied land caused a storm of protest among Likud
hard-liners.
   Perhaps fearing concessions would be seen as giving in to Arab
rioters, Shamir has drawn back, with tougher rhetoric and warnings
between the lines that he will not accept pressure from the
Americans.
   He has been cool to Soviet involvement, requested a clearer
definition of the forum that would launch negotiations, and
expressed opposition to linking talks on a temporary solution in
the occupied territories with negotiations on a permanent
settlement.
   He argues that several years of experience with limited
self-rule is needed to build confidence for a stable solution.
   ``There is a need for a considerable period of practical
experience, of coexistence between us and the Palestinian Arab
authorities before the question of sovereignty can be approached,''
Shamir said in a speech this week.
   Shultz will begin a Middle East shuttle Thursday after a visit
to Moscow, using Jerusalem as a base and traveling to Jordan, Egypt
and possibly other Arab countries, Israeli officials said.
   His most intensive shuttle, however, may be between Shamir and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The two partners and rivals in
Israel's coalition government and who disagree sharply on strategy
for peace.
   ``They are miles apart,'' an official close to Peres said
privately. ``Shultz will try to bring them to together as he has in
the past.''
   Peres, leader of the center-left Labor Party, has endorsed
Jordan's proposal for an international conference, which Shamir
says would be biased against Israel. Labor accepts the
land-for-peace formula but the Likud fears giving up land would
make Israel vulnerable.
   Aides to both leaders say Shultz will concentrate on winning
Shamir's agreement, since Peres already has accepted the Shultz
plan. ``Shultz's major goal is to convince Shamir,'' one official
said.
   A senior aide to Shamir, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the prime minister views the Shultz visit ``with
caution'' but is ready to listen and give his position. ``Some of
his (Shultz's) ideas are okay and others are not,'' the aide said.

   The reputed leader of a Chicago-area group called
the Skinheads and five other alleged white supremacists were
indicted Friday for attacking a woman and drawing a swastika on her
wall with her blood.
   Authorities believe the defendants beat the 20-year-old woman,
with whom they were acquainted, because she had black friends,
state's attorney's spokeswoman Lisa Howard said.
   The group's leader, Clark Martell, 28, and the others were
charged with home invasion, robbery, theft and two counts of
aggravated battery, Ms. Howard said.
   Arrested with them Jan. 25 was an unidentified 16-year-old whose
indictment had been expected Friday but was delayed until later
this month because a special hearing must be held to charge him as
an adult, Ms. Howard said.
   The victim was not identified to protect her from members of the
white supremacist group, Ms. Howard said.
   The suspects are accused of pushing their way into the woman's
North Side apartment last April, forcing her to the floor and
repeatedly punching and kicking her.
   After her attackers sprayed a Mace-type chemical in her face,
the woman managed to break free and lock herself in the bathroom,
where she passed out, Ms. Howard said.
   The defendants allegedly ransacked her apartment, stole jewelry
and clothing and drew swastikas throughout her home, Ms. Howard
said.
   ``Most of the Nazi symbols were spray-painted or drawn with
markers, but one swastika on the woman's living room wall was drawn
with the victim's blood,'' Ms. Howard said.
   ``Prosecutors believe the attack was motivated by the
defendants' anger over the victim's friendship'' with blacks, Ms.
Howard said. The victim had formerly associated with the Skinheads,
she said.
   ``This type of crime, which is nothing more than vicious race
hatred, will not be tolerated in Cook County, just as it cannot be
tolerated anywhere in our society,'' State's Attorney Richard M.
Daley said in a statement.
   ``These defendants will be prosecuted to fullest extent of the
law, as will anyone who dares to commit such a cowardly crime,'' he
said.
   The home invasion charge, which is the most serious, has a
maximum prison sentence of 30 years and a minimum of six years
without probation, Ms. Howard said. The robbery charge can bring as
much as seven years in prison and the theft and battery charges can
bring as much as five-year terms each, she said.
   The others indicted were identified as Morgan Kipp, 18, her
brother Sean Kipp, 20, Cassandra Clark, 20, Tracy Zajdel, 20, and
Kevin Jamison, 26. They are scheduled to be arraigned March 11
before Chief Criminal Court Judge Richard Fitzgerald. All except
Martell are free on $50,000 bond.
   The state's attorney's office will seek to try the juvenile as
an adult.
   Martell is scheduled to appear in court twice on charges
stemming from separate racial attacks before the hearing on the
latest indictments.
   Skinheads is a name some white supremacists across the nation
have given themselves, in accordance with their practice of shaving
their heads. But some people enjoy the music and fashion of the
Skinheads without sharing their racist sentiments, said Terry
Levin, a spokesman for the state's attorney's office.

   Spanish women will be able to enlist in the
armed forces under a decree that takes effect next week, but they
won't be eligible for combat or military academies.
   Women will be allowed to serve in 24 noncombatant units in the
armed forces and paramilitary Civil Guards, government spokesman
Javier Solana told reporters Friday after the weekly Cabinet
meeting.
   The Cabinet had just approved a decree providing for volunteer
female military service in keeping with an article in the
Constitution that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.
   Women can sign up for military service after publication Tuesday
of the decree in the Official State Bulletin, but they will not be
eligible for admittance to the country's three military academies.
   All Spanish males over the age of 18 are required to serve one
year in the military.

<HEAD>Panama Indicates Interest in Deal on Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama, apparently seeking a way out of a
legal and diplomatic predicament with the United States, made
discreet inquiries about U.S. willingness to drop federal charges
against military strong man Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
administration officials say.
   The State Department confirmed Friday that Panamanian
authorities had asked about that possibility and that Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams raised the matter with the
Justice Department.
   After being told that dropping the charges was ``technically
possible,'' Abrams relayed that message Wednesday to Panamanian
President Eric Arturo Delvalle during an unannounced meeting in
Miami.
   But during their discussion, Abrams ``made no deal, offered no
deal and was not in a position to offer a deal,'' State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Redman added that the indictments against Noriega are
``obviously based on strong evidence, and we have every intention
on carrying through with them.''
   The Panamanian Embassy had no comment on the Miami meeting,
saying only that Delvalle had gone to Miami for medical treatment.
   Redman denied an account in The New York Times that said Abrams
told Delvalle the indictment might be dropped if Noriega withdrew
from politics and went into exile. The Times cited as its sources
U.S. officials and congressional staff members it did not name.
   The Panamanian inquiry was made as a political crisis grew in
Panama, brought on in part by Noriega's legal problems.
   Indictments handed down in Florida two weeks ago portrayed
Noriega as a key member of an international drug trafficking
conspiracy.
   Among other activities, he was accused of providing protection
and other government services to international drug smugglers who
shipped cocaine and marijuana to the United States through Panama.
   U.S.-Panamanian agreements do not provide for his extradition,
making it virtually impossible for Noriega to be brought to trial.
   At the same time, the Reagan administration is deeply concerned
about Panama's political stability and has been encouraging Noriega
and his military allies to withdraw from politics.
   The administration believes that the security of the Panama
Canal is best assured through elected civilian rule. Delvalle is
widely viewed as a figurehead president who bows to Noriega's
wishes.
   The Times account said that under the formula Abrams discussed,
Noriega could move to any country he wished without having to
concern himself with the possibility of extradition to the United
States.
   With Noriega living in exile, this scenario also could enhance
the possibility _ consistent with U.S. objectives _ of an evolution
to a civilian-led government in Panama.
   But Redman insisted that the administration has no interest in
any arrangement for Noriega to be exiled in exchange for a drop of
the charges.
   ``We all see the drug problem of tremendous importance in the
United States as well as throughout the hemisphere,'' Redman said,
reaffirming that the indictments will not be withdrawn.

<HEAD>Assistant U.S. Attorney Shunned When He Found Iran-Contra
Operation</HEAD>

   A federal prosecutor in Miami says he was
``treated like the enemy'' by U.S. diplomats and stymied by
superiors in the U.S. attorney's office after he discovered Oliver
North's Contra supply network.
   Jeffrey Feldman, an assistant U.S. attorney, says in a sworn
statement the U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica ``turned white'' after
learning what Feldman knew in the spring of 1986 _ eight months
before the Iran-Contra arms and money affair dominated the news.
   And Feldman described months of unsuccessful efforts to take the
investigation to the grand jury, with his boss telling him in
August 1986 that ``politics'' was responsible for the delay.
   Feldman, other prosecutors and an FBI agent unveiled the story
of the Miami investigation in sworn statements to the congressional
Iran-Contra committees. They were released this week by a Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee.
   Feldman admitted he should have ``been more aggressive'' in
pursuing the North network, ``because history has basically
spoken.''
   Feldman and two FBI agents went to Costa Rica on March 31, 1986,
to investigate an alleged murder plot against then-U.S. Ambassador
Lewis Tambs. The prosecutor said the plot proved to be bogus, but
he did obtain details about a private supply network for the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan
government.
   Feldman said he made the information into a chart with North's
name on the top. North, a National Security Council aide, directed
the secret operations to sell arms to Iran and aid the Contras
despite a law prohibiting such assistance.
   ``The ambassador turned white,'' Feldman said, describing Tambs
after he was shown the chart. Tambs was identified in the
Iran-Contra hearings as a key link in North's network.
   ``The only thing he said when I pulled out the chart was `Get
Fernandez in here.' The words are indelibly imprinted in my mind,''
Feldman said.
   Joe Fernandez, then CIA station chief in Costa Rica, ``knew he
was dealing with three people (Feldman and two FBI agents) who had
only seen the tip of an iceberg and was ... trying to rip the
credibility of the various people who were making the allegations
that we were exploring,'' Feldman said.
   Feldman said he and the FBI investigators with him in Costa Rica
``were being treated like the enemy'' for the rest of their stay.
He added, ``I felt perhaps we were being watched.''
   Throughout the spring and summer of 1986, Feldman asked his
boss, U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner in Miami, to allow the case to go
to a grand jury.
   But Feldman _ who at the time did not realize the full
significance of what he had discovered _ said he was stalled for
months by Kellner and other top assistants in the office.
   Kellner's assistants said the case wasn't far enough along to
move to the grand jury. And on Aug. 29, Feldman said Kellner told
him, ``politics are involved.''
   The secret sale of U.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of
profits to the Contras didn't dominate public attention until Nov.
25, 1986, after a Lebanese news magazine disclosed secret
negotiations over American hostages between the United States and
Iran.
   Kellner, in his deposition, acknowledged telling Feldman that
politics were causing a delay, but denied that he was referring to
the discovery of North's network.
   Instead, Kellner said he referred to allegations he received
from pro-Contra mercenaries that aides to Massachusetts Sen. John
Kerry were paying informants to lie.
   Kellner admitted he did not tell Feldman about these allegations
when he used the word ``politics'' _ but Kellner decided not to
give the case to the grand jury without first discussing these
allegations with the Justice Department.
   Feldman, who then was 29 years old, acknowledged in his
statement that he did not focus on North, who was directing the
Iran-Contra effort. Feldman said he thought the case was mainly
about paramilitary groups illegally aiding the Contras.
   ``For the most part, the case is about people in private
organizations, basically on their own, going out and recruiting
help for the (Contras) or putting their own little paramilitary
groups together,'' Feldman said.

<HEAD>Boost in Pork, Poultry Output Should Temper Retail Price Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail food prices will rise more slowly this
year than last year's 4.2 percent increase, mainly because of a
sharp increase in meat production, the Agriculture Department says.
   The forecast, however, is based on an expected jump in pork and
poultry production, which should more than offset a drop in beef
output in figuring retail food prices, according to a USDA report
issued this week.
   That does not necessarily mean any boon for consumers unwilling
to forgo beef in favor of pork and poultry. The National
Cattlemen's Association already is hailing a decline of 3 million
head in the U.S. herd as of Jan. 1 to 99 million as a ``bullish''
signal for increased beef prices.
   USDA's Economic Research Service says red meat production in
1987 totaled 38,449,000 pounds and poultry 19,765,000 pounds.
Consumption of red meat and poultry combined was 216.7 pounds per
capita last year.
   The forecast issued this week said red meat production this year
should reach 38,345,000 pounds and poultry 20,935,000. It estimated
per capita consumption at 221.9 pounds.
   Retail food prices last year were 333 percent of their 1967
level, according to the report. The report did not attempt to
estimate precisely how much they would climb over the year ahead
but merely said the increase would be less than that of 1987.
   The report also said hog profits fell sharply in the final
quarter of 1987 and probably will continue to drop this year. Net
returns could average only slightly above the break-even point, it
said.

   Overseas sale of U.S. wheat climbed sharply
last week, primarily because of Soviet, Chinese and Moroccan
purchases, the Agriculture Department says.
   Soybean and sorghum sales also climbed, but corn, barley and
cotton fell compared with the four-week average, the department
said.
   Wheat sales hit 1,178,100 metric tons. The Soviets purchased
308,500 tons, China 299,000 tons and Morocco 220,800 tons, the
department said.
   USDA said sales of sorghum totaled 347,100 tons, the most in the
current marketing year. The increase was attributed mainly to
purchases by Japan, Venezuela and Israel.
   Soybean sales of 589,500 tons were 56 percent over the previous
week's mark and 72 percent above the four-week average. Japan was
the main purchaser, followed by Romania, the Netherlands and Mexico.
   Corn sales fell to 777,400 tons, 14 percent below the previous
week and 44 percent lower than the four-week average, despite
substantial purchases by Japan and South Korea. Barley sales were
down, with Tunisia purchasing all of the 25,000 tons sold last week.
   According to the report, cotton sales totaled 55,700 bales, 13
percent below the previous week's mark and 50 percent off from the
four-week average.
   Rice sales of 23,900 tons were 56 percent above the previous
week but 46 percent below the four-week average. Trinidad, Canada
and Saudi Arabia were the main purchasers.
   Among other commodities, soybean cake and meal sales were up for
the week but still well short of the four-week average, while
soybean oil sales were down. Sales of hides and skins were lower
for the week but a shade above the four-week average.

   The nation's catfish farms processed a total
of 26 million pounds of fish in January, the Agriculture Department
says.
   That represents a 24 percent gain from January 1987, USDA says.
The average price was 68 cents a pound, up 8 cents from a year
earlier.
   Sales of catfish in the United States totaled 5,680 metric tons
in January, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says public
health officials agree that heterosexuals are at risk for
contracting AIDS, despite recent published accounts that give the
impression heterosexuals are relatively safe.
   Koop said Friday that several articles, including one in
Cosmopolitan magazine, wrongly led women and heterosexual men to
believe they are not at risk.
   ``The risk is real,'' Koop told the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on health. ``It is just not true that there is no
danger from normal vaginal intercourse. What is unknown is the
level of danger. There is always a danger whenever people engage in
casual sex outside the marriage relationship, even if their
promiscuity is heterosexual.''
   As of Feb. 15, there were 53,814 cases of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome reported to the federal Centers for Disease
Control. About 65 percent were in homosexual or bisexual males, and
17 percent were in intravenous drug abusers.
   While only 4 percent of current AIDS cases are reported among
heterosexuals, Koop said that proportion is expected to rise to 5
percent in the 1990s.
   Koop told the subcommittee that medical personnel generally have
responded well to the AIDS crisis. But he said there is a minority
of medical personnel who ``refuse not only to treat persons with
AIDS, but also turn away patients alleged to be from population
groups identified with those two high-risk behaviors: that is,
homosexual and bisexual males and intravenous drug abusers.''
   He characterized that behavior as ``unworthy of anyone in the
health or social service professions.''
   Those who turn away AIDS patients use the excuse that the
disease is fatal and contagious, Koop said. ``But the plain fact is
that the risk of contracting (AIDS) from an infected patient is
extremely small and nearly always preventable.''
   Of nearly 7 million health professionals in the country, Koop
said, fewer than a dozen became infected with the AIDS virus while
doing their jobs and, in most cases, that exposure could have been
prevented if the person had followed guidelines published five
years ago by the CDC.
   CDC director James Mason, another witness, said more than 15
million Americans are being tested anonymously each year for AIDS
through blood banks and the military and in 30 communities.
   He said more anonymous testing should be done to get a better
fix on the extent of AIDS infection in the United States, but he
rejected Rep. William Dannemeyer's idea that anyone coming in
contact with the health system be tested.
   Dannemeyer, R-Calif., has introduced legislation that would
require testing of hospital patients, clinic patients, marriage
license applicants and others. He also wants to require reporting
by name of any positive test results.
   Mason endorsed the general approach sponsored by subcommittee
chairman Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., which includes voluntary
testing, confidentiality and anti-discrimination protection for
those with the disease or virus.
   ``Where there's worry about confidentiality or discrimination,
there's a chilling effect,'' Mason said.

<HEAD>Kerry Suggests U.S. Military Intervention In Colombian Drug Wars</HEAD>

   American military intervention may be needed
in Colombia to halt the flow of narcotics to U.S. cities, Sen. John
F. Kerry says.
   ``We've gotten to the point where we have to be prepared to be
tough. We cannot be patsies about this stuff,'' the Massachusetts
Democrat said Friday. ``We ought to make it permanently hot for
them down there.''
   Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
narcotics and terrorism, said the United States should provide
Colombia with helicopters, communications equipment and other
military systems to combat the region's drug czars. He said an
estimated 80 percent of the narcotics entering the United States
come from Colombia.
   But the senator added that military assistance may not be enough
and that the administration should be willing to send troops to the
area, if necessary, to help Colombian agents.
   ``I'm willing, and I think we ought to consider, the use of our
Southern Command forces to assist in the interdiction effort on a
case-by-case basis. They ought to be able to do that because what
you have here is literally a paramilitary organization that you're
fighting against,'' Kerry told reporters.
   ``This is a very sophisticated effort we're working against, and
if it takes the visibility of our military force ... that's worth
it to me,'' he added.
   Last April, 14 U.S. military advisers were sent to Bolivia to
help train Bolivian anti-drug police.
   In July 1986, the United States sent 175 soldiers provide
logistical support for Bolivian anti-drug operations. That program
ended in November 1986.
   Meanwhile, Kerry released a letter to Sen. Lawton Chiles,
D-Fla., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, urging the
immediate transfer of $50 million from the Defense Department to
the Coast Guard, which is charged largely with battling drug
trafficking at sea.
   Kerry lambasted President Reagan for a series of Coast Guard
budget cuts.
   ``I'm tired of this phony war on drugs where they talk about it,
where they stand Nancy (Reagan) up at the State of the Union
message and try to pretend the war on drugs is rampaging across the
country, and meanwhile they cut the guts out of the law enforcement
effort. That type of hypocrisy has simply got to stop,'' Kerry said.
   He also called for a tightening of banking regulations for cash
transactions and increasing penalties for drug trafficking.

   President Reagan and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl are lauding a Western effort to build a common arms
control strategy so NATO can manage the Soviets with ``realism,
strength and alliance unity.''
   The two leaders ended talks at the White House on Friday with a
pledge to intensify the effort at a NATO summit March 2-3.
   ``What we need now is an overall concept covering the whole
field of disarmament, and there I do not see any difference between
us and the Americans,'' Kohl told reporters before heading back to
Bonn.
   ``We agreed that we must deal with the Soviet Union from a
position of realism, strength and alliance unity,''
   Since reaching agreement with the Soviets to eliminate
land-based nuclear missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,125
miles, the United States and its allies have been trying to set
goals for further talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
his aides.
   ``We want to get out of a situation where we merely react to
proposals which have been submitted by Gorbachev. We want to put
down proposals and let him react to them,'' Kohl said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who attended the White
House meeting, left later in the day for another round of
negotiations with the Soviets in Moscow. Kohl said Shultz pledged
to convey to the Soviets the West German concern about ethnic
Germans facing discrimination in Soviet bloc countries.
   NATO already has agreed on a first priority of a U.S.-Soviet
reduction in long-range missiles and bombers, while seeking cuts in
conventional and chemical weapons.
   ``We were in agreement that all these disarmament questions and
issues as well as the necessary measures to preserve our common
security should be combined in form and overall concept for our
alliance,'' Kohl said.
   Each of the 16 allies, depending on its politics and geography,
has different interests to advance, and one of the key differences
was reflected in comments after Kohl's meeting with Reagan.
   West Germany is particularly eager for negotiations to reduce
tactical nuclear weapons _ those with ranges below 300 miles _ and
wants those talks included in any conferences that deal with
conventional weapons. Kohl, whose country would be threatened by
such weapons if a war broke out in Europe, reiterated the desire
for quick and comprehensive talks on the short-range systems.
   The United States, which believes tactical nuclear weapons are
necessary to deter a conventional attack, wants to defer
negotiations to reduce the short-range systems. Indeed, it is
working on plans to modernize these weapons, with NATO approval.
   During Kohl's visit, the two sides sought to minimize the
importance of the disagreement. Kohl said he did not favor the
elimination of the tactical nuclear weapons: artillery shells and
short-range missiles.
   He does not seek a ``denuclearized zone, least of all in
Europe,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl was asked at the news conference about concerns that
modernization of short-range weapons would touch off protests like
those that rocked Europe in the early 1980s after NATO decided to
deploy intermediate-range weapons.
   ``I don't share that fear,'' Kohl said.
   In its efforts to play down the issue, the Reagan administration
noted during Kohl's visit that further study is needed before the
most powerful of the short-range systems _ a missile to replace the
75-mile-range Lance _ is deployed and it may not go into operation
before 1995.

<HEAD>Gingrich To Ask House Ethics Committee To Investigate Speaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, contending that published
reports have outlined ``clear violations of House rules'' by
Speaker Jim Wright, says he intends to ask the House ethics
committee next month to launch a formal investigation.
   Gingrich, R-Ga., told a news conference Friday that the House
needs to know the truth about the allegations of corruption that
have been leveled at Wright, D-Texas, in news accounts over the
past decade.
   ``We're going to have to at least at a minimum insist that we
find out what the truth is, and on March 3, I intend to create that
opportunity,'' Gingrich said.
   Wright's office did not return a telephone call Friday seeking
comment on Gingrich's plan to seek an ethics committee
investigation.
   Gingrich said two specific published reports about Wright
provide clear evidence that he violated House rules. One involved
Wright's failure since 1980 to file the required financial
disclosure reports for a company in which he is a partner.
   The other involved 55 percent royalties Wright received for a
book published by a friend whose printing company worked for
Wright's campaign committee. House rules prohibit members from
receiving royalties in excess of ``the usual and customary value
for such services,'' Gingrich said, and most authors receive
royalties of 6 percent to 8 percent.
   Gingrich said the ethics panel also should investigate Wright's
connection to Texas savings and loan association officials who are
under investigation by federal authorities.
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last month
accused Gingrich and a political action committee he heads of mail
fraud and asked the Postal Service to investigate. The DCCC said
the PAC collected more than $200,000 through mail solicitations of
contributions for conservative candidates, but provided only $3,000
to such candidates.
   Gingrich, who has denied the accusations, said Friday the DCCC
complaint was a ``smoke screen'' designed to discredit him
politically so he could not pursue the ethics complaints against
Wright.
   Under House rules, any member can ask the ethics panel to
investigate another member. The committee, composed of six
Democrats and six Republicans, can reject such a request only by a
majority vote.
   Gingrich said it would be ``inconceivable'' that the committee
would refuse to investigate the allegations. But if that happens,
he said he intends to force the issue on the House floor with a
series of privileged votes that could tie up House business.
   Gingrich tried unsuccessfully last year to persuade the House to
create an outside commission to investigate ethics complaints
against Wright and other Democratic leaders.
   He said he was announcing his intention to seek an investigation
of Wright now to give other House members time to familiarize
themselves with the long list of allegations.
   Gingrich has criticized the ethics committee in the past for its
lenient treatment of Democrats accused of wrongdoing. But he said
Friday he has more confidence in the panel after its recent votes
to reprimand one Democratic congressman and recommend the expulsion
of another.
   He said he believes the panel can conduct a fair investigation
of Wright if it will agree to hire an outside attorney acceptable
to both Republican and Democratic House leaders and to complete its
investigation before Congress adjourns for the year.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Keeps Glass Merger on Hold</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed merger between two of the nation's
largest manufacturers of glass containers remains on hold today in
the wake of a ruling by a federal appeals court.
   Late Friday afternoon, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an
administrative stay of a lower court decision that would have
cleared the way for the merger between Owens-Illinois Inc. and
Brockway Inc.
   Earlier in the day, the Federal Trade Commission had asked the
appeals court to extend until next Tuesday a restraining order
blocking the merger until the agency could decide whether to appeal
a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Hens Green.
   On Thursday, Green refused the FTC's request for a preliminary
injunction, ruling that the FTC had not proven the deal would harm
competition.
   FTC spokeswoman Susan Tichnor said the agency will have until
next Tuesday to file an appeal and that the court will issue a
decision sometime after Owens-Illinois files a response Wednesday.
   Attorneys for Owens-Illinois said there is no excuse for the
FTC's ``unusual filing'' Friday to keep the merger on hold until
the agency can decide whether to appeal.
   ``The FTC has been acutely aware since the beginning of this
case of the extreme time sensitivity surrounding the merger and, in
that regard, has had ample time to prepare for the possibility of a
decision adverse to it,'' said Paul Warnke, an attorney for
Owens-Illinois.
   Last September, the Toledo, Ohio-based Owens-Illinois proposed
to buy Brockway, of Jacksonville, Fla., for $750 million, or $60
per share.
   The merger would make the combined company the largest
manufacturer of glass containers in the industry. The nation's top
manufacturer is Anchor Glass Container Corp., which controls 23.7
percent of the market.
   The FTC has said the merger might violate federal antitrust laws
by substantially reducing competition in the glass container
industry and creating conditions for price discrimination. It wants
to halt the merger until it can conduct an administrative review of
the proposal.
   But Green accepted the argument advanced by the two
manufacturers that competition from the plastics and
metal-packaging industry will hold down prices.

<TEXT>
   Peace talks between Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government and Contra rebels are right back where they
began _ mired in a dispute over what comes first, democracy or a
truce.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Nicaraguan Roman Catholic
Church leader who has been mediating the negotiations, abruptly
suspended the latest round of talks Friday, indirectly blaming the
Sandinistas for their failure.
   Obando y Bravo said he was disappointed that both sides had not
accepted, at least in principle, a proposal he put forth Thursday
in an attempt to break a deadlock that arose in the first hours of
the talks.
   That impasse stemmed from what the cardinal said was the
inability of the two sides to agree on whether they should
negotiate a cease-fire to obtain democracy, or negotiate democracy
to obtain a cease-fire.
   More than 40,000 people have been killed since November 1981,
when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista government.
   The cardinal's plan called on the Contras to accept a truce in
exchange for four major concessions by the government. They were
concessions the Contras have long sought, and they quickly accepted
the proposal in principle.
   But Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister,
said the cardinal suspended the talks in mid-afternoon Friday
before he could deliver his government's formal, written response,
which also conditionally accepted the plan.
   The confusion apparently arose because President Daniel Ortega
initially instructed his negotiators to reject Obando y Bravo's
proposal as unsuitable for discussion at talks the Sandinista
leader felt should be aimed solely at the mechanics of achieving a
cease-fire.
   The government apparently changed its mind later and authorized
Tinoco to accept conditionally the cardinal's plan. By then, Obando
y Bravo had suspended the negotiations without setting a time or
place for a new round of talks.
   Contra negotiators announced their tentative acceptance of
Obando y Bravo's proposal at a news conference Thursday night.
Shortly afterward, Tinoco told reporters the plan was ``interesting
and constructive,'' but needed clarification.
   Paul Reichler, a Washington, D.C., attorney advising the
Sandinistas, said Ortega advised the government negotiators during
a telephone conference later Thursday evening to reject Obando y
Bravo's proposal.
   Reichler quoted Ortega as saying that if Obando y Bravo felt the
issues he raised in his proposal were of vital importance to the
Nicaraguan people, the president would discuss them with the
cardinal personally.
   But Reichler said Ortega's initial reaction was that he would
not discuss political issues at the bargaining table with the
Contras _ a position the Nicaraguan leader has long held.
   Obando y Bravo's plan called for the Contras to move into
unspecified ``enclaves or zones'' with their arms and equipment
during a 30-day truce, during which talks would continue toward a
more lasting cease-fire.
   In exchange, the cardinal called on the Nicaraguan government to:
   _Grant a ``full, general'' amnesty to the several thousand
political prisoners in Nicaraguan jails, including members of the
National Guard of former dictator Gen. Anastasio Somoza, whom the
Sandinistas overthrew in 1979.
   _Permit ``unrestricted'' freedom of the press, a right now
granted only to a few mass media, including the opposition
newspaper La Prensa and Radio Catolica, the voice of the Catholic
Church.
   _``Reconsider'' mandatory military draft law, which has provoked
violent disturbances by youths and mothers of draft-age people in
several Nicaraguan cities.
   _Reopen a dialogue with its internal opposition, including 14
dissident political parties and a coalition of business, labor and
political groups known as the Democratic Coordinating Council.
Those talks broke down late last year.
   Tinoco's initial response and the government's later written
statement said the Obando y Bravo plan needed clarification on the
size and location of the cease-fire zones, when the truce would
start, how it would be verified and how the Contras would be
supplied during the cessation of hostilities.
   Reichler said Ortega suggested that Roger Fisher, a Harvard
professor who heads the Center for Conflict Resolution in Boston,
draw up a new cease-fire proposal, drawing on plans already
submitted by both sides.
   But in announcing suspension of the talks, Obando y Bravo issued
a communique rejecting Fisher's participation in the negotiations.
The communique said such work was the proper task of each side's
technical advisers.

   A European Ariane rocket will launch an American
and a French satellite into orbit next month from the program's
French Guiana space center, the commercial arm of the European
Space Agency announced.
   The March 11 launch from the South American base is to be
Ariane's 21st and the first of eight planned for this year.
   It is to lift the American Spacenet 3-R satellite and the French
Telecom 1C into orbit, Arianespace said in its announcement Friday.
   The 20th Ariane shot on Nov. 20 placed the West German satellite
TV-SAT1 into orbit. The launch was flawless, but one of the
satellite's solar panels failed to deploy and it has not been able
to carry out its function of direct television broadcasts.
   The U.S. space shuttle program was suspended after the January
1986 Challenger disaster, making the Ariane program the West's only
regular vehicle for the lucrative satellite-launching market.

<TEXT>
   Siberia is the stroke capital of the world, and
heavy drinking and cold weather could be partly to blame,
researchers say.
   Soviet stroke data, gathered as part of a World Health
Organization program, were released for the first time Friday at a
stroke conference sponsored by the American Heart Association.
   ``We were surprised,'' said Dr. Kjell Asplund. ``We thought that
China and Japan would be the higest.''
   The study showed that Canada and Denmark are the safest places
to live, at least as far as stroke is concerned, although the
stroke rate is low throughout most of North America, southern
Europe and Australia.
   Asplund, a researcher at Umea University in Umea, Sweden, said
the data suggest that strokes must have several causes. While
racial differences may play a role, they don't explain all of the
variations in the risk of stroke around the world.
   The study found that in Siberia, the stroke rate was 119 for
every 100,000 men and 107 for every 100,000 women. These figures
were the highest in the world and significantly ahead of China, the
country with the second highest stroke rate.
   Strokes are also common in Japan, but data collected there were
so sparse they were not included in the analysis.
   Strokes among men are least common in Canada, where they strike
21 in 100,000. In women they are least frequent in Denmark, where
they occur in 8 in 100,000.
   Asked why strokes are so common in Siberia, Asplund said, ``At
this point, we can only guess. We know that alcohol consumption is
very high. High alcohol use among men is associated with a high
risk for stroke. I also suspect that there are some climate factors
involved.''
   Although there are exceptions, such as Canada, he said it
appears that strokes are more common in cold climates than in
milder places. He noted that people are more likely to suffer
strokes in northern Sweden than in southern Sweden and in Scotland
than in England.
   Some experts suspect that Asians are more likely to suffer
strokes, at least in part, because of racial differences. However,
Asplund said that most people in Siberia moved there from European
parts of the Soviet Union.
   ``It's not only a racial thing,'' he said. ``It must have other
determinants as well. The goal of this study is to find the
determinants of the huge variations in stroke around the world.''
   He said the researchers will be trying to learn why the stroke
rate is falling rapidly in the United States, while it is stable or
increasing in many other countries.
   The study found that in most places, strokes are more common in
men than in women. The only exceptions to this were Sweden, Canada
and Israel, where strokes are slightly more common among women.
   The 10-year project, called Monitoring of Trends and
Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease, or MONICA, is being
conducted in 26 countries and will conclude in 1994.

   Contra rebels claim they downed a
Soviet-made Sandinista air force helicopter in eastern Nicaragua
with a U.S.-made Redeye missile this week.
   The rebels, in a statement released in San Jose Friday, said
they used the heat-seeking anti-aircraft weapon last Sunday to
shoot down the MI-17 helicopter in Chontales province.
   In the Nicaraguan capital of Managua, a Defense Ministry
spokesman denied the rebel claim, saying mechanical failure caused
the crash. The spokesman demanded anonymity.
   The Defense Ministry had reported on Monday that seven people
were killed in the crash, which occurred near the village of Santo
Tomas, about 120 miles east of Managua. The Contras claimed 15
people.
   Sandinista authorities said the helicopter was carrying new
currency to the region to be exchanged for old bills. The Contra
statement said the rebels recovered 10 million new cordobas in the
crash.
   The Contras say they downed 26 helicopters with Redeye missiles
last year. Foreign military observers put the number at a dozen.
The Sandinistas admitted to six.

<TEXT>
   Mexico and Panama should not be penalized by the
United States despite their failure to take adequate steps to
control drug trafficking, according to a draft State Department
report.
   The New York Times, citing unidentified administration
officials, reported Saturday that the report, prepared by the
Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, said ``other national
interests'' warrant that the countries not be penalized.
   Under a 1986 law, the president certifies countries that are
``fully cooperating'' in cracking down on the drug trade. Those
that don't qualify lose military and economic aid, trade
preferences, loans and other economic advantages.
   The report charged that Panama and Mexico haven't made adequate
progress in combating the drug trade but said they should be
certified, the Times reported.
   Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and some
of his aides were indicted this month on drug and racketeering
charges.
   ``It's ridiculous and stupid, absolutely ludicrous, and sends
the wrong signals to both countries,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., said of the report's recommendation.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said, ``It is totally outrageous,
particularly in the case of Panama.''
   The report is provisional and subject to clearance by other
governmental agencies and regional assistant secretaries of state.
It would then be submitted to the secretary of state and the
president, who is to announce his decision March 1.
   The report also recommended decertification of Iran,
Afghanistan, Paraguay, Syria and Laos. It said Colombia, the
Bahamas and Bolivia should be certified.

<TEXT>
   Three hospitals turned down the liver
of a brain-dead baby whose body was being maintained on
life-support systems to preserve his organs for transplant,
officials said Friday.
   Baby John, who was born Tuesday with most of his brain missing,
a condition known as anencephaly, was pronounced brain dead
Thursday at Loma Linda University Medical Center.
   No other cases in which anencephalics have been kept on
life-support for organ transplant have been announced in the United
States, although Dr. Leonard Bailey, chief of Loma Linda's heart
transplant program, last year suggested there have been such
infants.
   Doctors plan to maintain the body on life support for up to
seven days in hope of finding recipients for its organs, hospital
spokeswoman Anita Rockwell said.
   One liver transplant candidate in Pittsburgh was not an
appropriate match and another in that city became infected,
delaying any transplant, Ms. Rockwell said.
   A medical center in Wisconsin also was unable to accept the
liver for another candidate because it had committed itself to do

<HEAD>Mexico Asks U.S. for Favorable Treatment for Banks Involved In
Debt Swap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

   Mexico has asked the United States to give
favorable treatment to banks that take part in the government's new
program to exchange part of its foreign debt for long-term bonds,
the Treasury Department said.
   Finance Secretary Gustavo Petricioli said in a statement that he
discussed the plan with U.S. officials during President Reagan's
recent meeting with President Miguel de la Madrid in Mazatlan,
Mexico.
   ``The Mexican delegation,'' the statement said, ``emphasized
that it is necessary that all parties involved continue working in
the search for deeper and more permanent solutions to the problem
of the foreign debt and financing.''
   It said Mexican officials acknowledged the U.S. help to Mexico
in restructuring foreign debt and in fashioning Mexico's new debt
exchange program. Mexico has a foreign debt of $105 billion, the
second highest in the developing world after Brazil.
   The new program involves exchanging some of the debt Mexico owes
foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds that will be
issued by the government.
   Mexico has set Feb. 26 as the date for an auction of the bonds.
   The bonds will be backed by $10 billion worth of special
securities to be issued this year by the U.S. government. Mexico is
expected to pay about $2 billion for the 20-year, U.S. zero-coupon
bonds, which pay no interest but are issued at a sharp discount of
their face value.
   The government statement said Petricioli asked U.S. officials at
the Mazatlan meeting ``that they give the most favorable treatment
possible to the banks that decide to participate in this
operation.''
   Some U.S. banks reportedly have expressed concern about taking
part in the program because they are unhappy that Mexico will
continue obtaining loans at 100 percent of their value while paying
back, through the bond program, its old loans at about half their
value.
   They also are reportedly reluctant to accept losses of 50
percent or so on the loans entered into years ago, and worry about
government regulations concerning accounting for the securities on
their books.
   Most of Mexico's about 600 creditor banks have authorized the
government to go ahead with the auction, which would apply to $51
billion of the foreign debt.
   Under the program, banks would exchange their old debt for the
new bonds, letting Mexico recover 52 cents or so for each dollar in
the secondary market. That means that Mexico could retire part of
its debt for half its face value.
   By reducing its debt, the government will also pare the amount
of interest it pays each year on the loans. Mexico has annual
interest charges of $8 billion to $9 billion.

   Heavy-metal rock group Motley Crue warned
fans not to imitate its show stunts after a 12-year-old boy set his
blue jeans on fire while trying to copy the group's ``human torch''
video act.
   Bryan Tucker, who had burns over 10 percent of his body, was
reported in good condition today at Memorial Hospital after he
poured rubbing alcohol on his jeans and torched them. He put the
flames out in a filled bathtub.
   ``Various of Motley Crue's show stunts require special
equipment, clothing and other materials ... and should not be
attempted at home,'' said the statement released Thursday by
management firm McGhee Entertainment Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Bryan's mother, Wendy Tucker, said he was in great pain but that
Motley Crue was not to blame for her son's experiment at their home
Wednesday.
   ``In my day, my mom would not let me watch Superman, because he
jumped out of buildings,'' she said. ``It's just a different time.''

   Singer Michael Jackson, rehearsing in
secret for a new national tour, gave a sneak preview to 420 school
children after viewing a rap video made in his honor by a
third-grade class.
   In their video, the third-graders at the Hallmark School rapped
that they and other Hallmark students ``don't have much money _ if
they could just see you, it would make their lives bright and
sunny.''
   The video was sent to Jackson at the Civic Center last week.
Teachers asked students to get permission slips signed by their
parents for a trip to the Civic Center but the youngsters weren't
told they were going to see Jackson until just before boarding
buses Thursday.
   ``It was good,'' said a smiling Kevin Morris, 6, before bein
spirited to the back of his bus by a woman who crisply said, ``We
can't talk to anybody.''
   Jackson ended nearly two weeks of secretive rehearsals Friday in
the Pensacola Civic Center for the tour scheduled to begin Tuesday
in Kansas City, Mo.

   Tom Selleck and two top executives from his
``Magnum P.I.'' television series are considering producing another
series in Hawaii that could make its debut this fall.
   Selleck, along with ``Magnum'' co-executive producer Charles
Floyd Johnson and head writer Chris Abbott formed their own
production company recently, and have been asked by Universal
Studios to think about producing a show here.
   Universal produces the 8-year-old ``Magnum P.I.'' series, which
is wrapping up its final season.
   Johnson said Selleck's participation in the new series would be
limited to off-camera work, but said ``Magnum'' co-star John
Hillerman, who plays stuffy major-domo Jonathan Higgins, might star
in the new show.
   Hillerman said the series would not be a Higgins spinoff.

   For the nine months ended Nov. 30, the company posted losses of
$36.2 million on revenues of $46 million.
   The most recent results included $27 million in writedowns on
four films that flopped at the box office _ ``Near Dark,''
``Weeds,'' ``Hiding Out'' and ``Date With an Angel'' _ and on a
fifth, ``Total Recall,'' on which work was suspended.
   Stephen Greenwald, the company's president, was elected to take
de Laurentiis' posts.

<HEAD>Group Linked to Unification Church Lobbies for North Pardon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide lobbying campaign seeking a
pardon for Lt. Col. Oliver North for his involvement in the
Iran-Contra affair has been launched by a conservative group that
is working with activists from the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church, The Washington Post reported Saturday.
   ``We think North is a hero and he ought to be treated as such,''
said Robert Grant, chairman of the lobbying group Christian Voice
and president of the new American Freedom Coalition.
   The coalition has extensive links to Moon's Unification Church
movement, according to the newspaper. It said Bo Hi Pak, Moon's top
deputy and president of The Washington Times, which is owned by
Moon, was instrumental in founding the group and Phillip Sanchez,
one of Pak's chief political aides and president of Causa USA, is a
member of the coalition's national policy board.
   Grant said Causa has given the coalition a network of activists
throughout the United States _ most of whom are Unification Church
members _ to help build local support.
   However, the coalition's literature never mentions the
Unification Church and Pak's name is not included on the group's
five-member board of directors, the Post said.
   The coalition, chaired by former Reps. Richard Ichord, D-Mo.,
and Bob Wilson, R-Calif., recently sent more than a million letters
asking recipients to sign a ``Pardon Colonel North'' petition to
President Reagan.
   North is a target of the Iran-Contra investigation being
conducted by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh but has not been
indicted.

   Michael Dukakis, trying to add some
Midwestern momentum to his win in New Hampshire, was pushed by
Democratic presidential rivals to defend his economic policies and
complained during a debate that ``my name was taken in vain.''
   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, another Democratic front-runner,
also found himself in the cross fire Friday during the latest
debate of Democratic presidential candidates, as Jesse Jackson
asked if the Missouri congressman was ``proud of your vote for the
Reagan tax cut in 1981.''
   Gephardt and Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, were the
biggest targets in a debate that was freewheeling but less fiesty
than a jangling exchange among the candidates in Texas the day
before.
   The St. Paul debate came as the focus of the presidential
campaign shifted briefly away from the Super Tuesday battlefield
mainly in the South and returned to the Midwest, where Minnesota
and South Dakota hold contests on Tuesday.
   Though the delegates at stake from those two contests pale next
to those to be allocated in the South, the closely bunched
candidates are looking for a Midwestern edge to propel them toward
the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses.
   In the latest debates, the candidates tried to block Gephardt
and Dukakis from gaining more momentum. Gephardt was hit on trade
and taxes, while Dukakis was forced to defend his budget plans.
   Gephardt defended his overall tax voting record, saying most of
the tax cut derided by Jackson ``went to ordinary people.''
   ``That was the trigger of this whole deficit crisis,'' Jackson
countered.
   And Dukakis agreed: ``It wasn't just a bad vote as a matter of
tax policy, it was the worst trade bill ever passed.''
   The Minnesota debate drew five of the six Democratic contenders.
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was absent.
   Dukakis fired one of the most direct shots of the debate at
Gephardt's trade policies, warning that ``we've got to do more than
wave a fist at our foreign competitors.''
   But Gephardt queried: ``Why is everyone defending unfair trade
practices?''
   After the candidates' exchange was interrupted by a moderator,
Gephardt predicted ``we'll never finish on trade.''
   Dukakis complained that ``my name was taken in vain'' by Gary
Hart, who demanded to know why Dukakis had not followed his example
and released a budget proposal.
   ``The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is because
they don't want to tell the American people the facts,'' Hart said.
   ``I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced a
budget,'' retorted Dukakis.
   Turning to Sen. Paul Simon, Hart asked, ``Why don't you put your
budget out, Paul?''
   When a moderator interrupted the exchange with a joke about
``exchange your budgets tomorrow,'' Hart complained: ``I thought
that's what we were here to debate.''
   The candidates paid homage to former Vice President Walter F.
Mondale, one of the ceremonial sponsors of the debate, with
Gephardt saying that Mondale's call for a tax hike during his
failed 1984 Democratic presidential bid was ``to his everlasting
credit.''
   Jackson noted that this campaign is the first in 20 years that
Minnesotans don't have a favorite son candidate to vote for.
   ``Don't despair, let me be your favorite son,'' Jackson said.
   ``I want to be your other favorite son'' interjected Simon.
   Friday's debate was sponsored by a series of groups, including
the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch and radio and television
station WCCO in Minneapolis.

   Marcel Piattier cleared Omaha Beach of
German mines the day after the Allies stormed it on D-Day, and went
on to make a career out of defusing or detonating unexploded World
War II bombs.
   On Friday, The 66-year-old Piattier retired with a bang, safely
exploding a 300-pound English bomb found in January in this town
150 miles north of Paris.
   The live bomb couldn't be moved and was detonated near the
center of town, causing no damage.
   In his last year as head of the regional bomb and mine clearing
service, the man considered the dean of the 25 civil defense
explosive experts in France was kept busy.
   ``In the second half of 1987, we received 560 calls to
neutralize bombs found by individuals,'' Piattier said.
   He says his work in his later years was safer than it used to be.
   ``In 1945, we probed mine fields with bayonettes,'' he recalled.
``In two years, 27 French mine clearers died, and that's not
counting the German prisoners of war we used.''
   To determine if the bomb detonated Friday was still live,
Piattier used sophisticated X-ray equipment, similar to that used
at nuclear power plants, to see inside to the strike-pin.
   Normandy was the scene of the Allied invasion in 1944 and saw
intense fighting that left behind thousands of bombs and mines that
often turn up unexpectedly. In the past year, bombs have been found
by workers digging the English Channel tunnel and near a hospital
in Caen.
   The most dangerous explosives still scattered throughout the
verdant countryside are small anti-personnel bombs dropped in
bunches from German planes.
   ``A woman had her leg torn away in June and a child died in
September from these bombs,'' said Piattier, who added that he has
found ``several thousand'' bombs and mines in four decades of work.
   Piattier's first task was clearing the German mines from Omaha
Beach the day after U.S. forces landed on June 6, 1944.
   ``I was the first French soldier on the beach and even before
the second soldier arrived I had found hundreds and hundreds of
mines,'' he said.
   Piattier was lucky to reach retirement. In the past two years,
six of his colleagues have died in the line of duty, he said.
   ``My wife is happy. She thinks I'll be safe now at home, but I'm
not so sure,'' he said. ``I'd like to stay in contact with the
service and help out when I can.''

   ``Carrie,'' the $7 million Broadway-bound musical
based on the Stephen King novel, received tepid reviews following
its premiere at the Royal Shakespeare Theater in
Stratford-upon-Avon.
   Jack Tinker in the Daily Mail called the show, scheduled to open
April 27 at New York's Virginia Theater, ``an expensive mess.''
   But he praised 17-year-old newcomer Linzi Hateley as the
telekinetic Carrie of the title, a traumatized adolescent played by
Sissy Spacek in the 1976 film version of the book.
   ``I hope sincerely that Broadway takes Miss Hateley to its
heart. It can take the rest wherever it pleases,'' Tinker wrote of
Thursday's performance.
   Milton Shulman in The Standard thought the show, presented in
association with the Royal Shakespeare Company, lacked ``that
element of supernatural awe'' that made the movie memorable.
   He added: ``If `Carrie' has to be transformed into a musical,
(director) Terry Hands has probably done it as well as it can be
done. But one has to ask whether the idea and the production were
really necessary.''
   Originally mooted for Broadway several years back, the show is
now headed for New York in a cast made up equally of Britons and
Americans under a special arrangement with the actors' union,
Equity.
   The behind-the-scenes talent is of mixed nationality, as well.
Choreographer Debbie Allen, composer Michael Gore and lyricist Dean
Pitchford are all American. Director Hands and his design team _
Ralph Koltai and Alexander Reid _ are British.
   Michael Coveney in The Financial Times said the musical was
``enjoyable in a masochistic way,'' but lamented Hands'
participation in ``an utter cultural vacuum of dance studio
robotics with a hint of cultural and classical pretensions.''
   Coveney and the other critics all had kind words for Broadway
veteran Barbara Cook, who plays Carrie's mother Margaret, the
religious fanatic played on-screen by Piper Laurie.
   Coveney said the 60-year-old Miss Cook was ``superb,'' and
Tinker called her ``Broadway's reclaimed heroine.''
   Irving Wardle in The Times of London said the voices of Linzi
Hateley and Barbara Cook provided ``the most thrilling sounds of
the evening.''
   ``Carrie'' is the second mother-daughter musical to open
back-to-back locally. Wednesday night saw the London debut at the
Cambridge Theater of ``The Rink,'' the 1984 Broadway flop that
starred Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli.
   The London bow received mixed marks for the material _ a maudlin
reconciliation drama set in an abandoned roller skating rink _ but
praise for the two leads: Josephine Blake and Diane Langton.

<TEXT>
   President Spyros Kyprianou refused to
back either presidential candidate in Sunday's runoff elections
after he lost a bid for a third term, throwing wide open Cyprus'
most hotly contested vote.
   Kyprianou's centrist Democratic Party, Diko, said Friday that it
did not agree with the stands of either Glafcos Clerides, leader of
the right-wing Democratic Rally Party, or millionaire businessman
George Vassiliou, an independent backed by the powerful Communist
Party, Akel.
   That left Kyprianou's 91,000 supporters free to vote either way.
   Diko's surprise move came after days of backroom bargaining.
Rivals were eliminated in a first-round ballot last Sunday.
   Kyprianou's third-place showing last Sunday took him out of the
race.
   The small socialist party, Edek, announced it was putting the
9.4 percent of the vote it won Sunday behind Vassiliou in a leftist
alliance.
   On paper, that guarantees Vassiliou just under 40 percent of the
vote when this Mediterranean island's 363,000-strong Greek Cypriot
electorate votes. Vassilou gathered 30.11 percent of last Sunday's
vote.
   The conservative, pro-Western Clerides, 68, a veteran political
warhorse, topped Sunday's poll with 33.32 percent. But he will have
to secure at least two-thirds of the votes Kyprianou won to edge
ahead of Vassiliou this Sunday.
   The election has developed into a straight left-right battle.
For the first time in a Cypriot presidential contest since
independence from Britain in 1960, the outcome cannot be predicted.
   Political analysts believe the Diko vote will split roughly down
the middle, with just a slight swing toward Clerides. That may not
be enough to ensure him victory.
   The election has been dominated by the partition issue.
   Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in July
1974 after a short-lived coup by militant Greek Cypriot supporters
of union with Greece.
   The Turks overran the northern third of the island. The Turkish
Cypriot minority declared a breakaway republic in 1983.
   Clerides has pledged that if elected, he will form an all-party
government of national unity to revive deadlocked negotiations
between Cyprus' Greek and Turkish communities to reunite the island.
   Seeking to strengthen his national unity strategy, Clerides
announced in a television debate Thursday night that he was
resigning as leader of Democratic Rally to head into Sunday's
showdown poll as an independent.
   Vassiliou dismissed that as an electoral ploy and pointed out
that the other three parties have rejected Clerides' coalition
proposal as unfeasible.
   Clerides and Vassiliou, 56, earlier concentrated in knocking
Kyprianou out of the race and blocking his election for a third
five-year term. With Kyprianou out of the way, they are now
slamming each other.
   Clerides is accused of being a ``right-wing, anti-labor
reactionary'' who heads a party that harbors the extremists who
were behind the ill-starred 1974 coup that briefly ousted Cyprus'
first president, the late Archbishop Makarios.
   Clerides rejects the charge and accuses Vassiliou, a self-made
millionaire making his first foray into politics, of being a
communist pawn.
   Both men, however, support the unconditional resumption of
negotiations with the Turkish side.
   Kyprianou had insisted that talks should resume only after the
withdrawal of the 35,000 Turkish troops and 65,000 settlers shipped
to northern Cyprus from the Turkish mainland.
   Clerides and Vassiliou also demand a Turkish withdrawal, but do
not make this a precondition for talks that have been stalled for
the last three years.
   Taverns and most restaurants will remain closed from noon today
until noon Monday in compliance with a law banning sale of alcohol
at election time.

<TEXT>
   Senior conservatives are growing uneasy
about the People's Party backing President Kurt Waldheim, who for
the first time in an opinion poll did not muster the support of a
majority of Austrian voters.
   The daily Salzburger Nachrichten today published a survey
showing 45 percent of those who responded to the poll favored
Waldheim's resignation and 42 percent wanted him to stay.
   It said 31 percent of the respondents said they would vote for
Waldheim ``by all means'' if presidential elections were held,
while 42 percent replied they would ``by no means'' elect him.
   The newspaper said 522 people were polled on Feb. 18-19, but it
was not known how representative was the sample nor give the margin
of error.
   In previous polls, Waldheim always had obtained the support of a
majority of respondents.
   In an interview published in today's issue of the Vienna
conservative daily Die Presse, Helmut Kukacka, general secretary of
the People's Party, was quoted as saying that, for now at least,
the party would give Waldheim full backing.
   But Waldheim must work ``to reduce his credibility deficits by
an information strategy,'' the newspaper reported Kukacka as saying.
   Early this summer the party will decide whether it ``makes
sense'' to further stand by Waldheim or to ``signal a certain
distance,'' Kukacka said in the interview.
   Kukacka pledged his party would do everything to strengthen the
president's position, but noted Waldheim has a responsibility to
the People's Party and to Austria, ``so that all of us get out'' of
the crisis.
   Waldheim is not a member of the People's Party but received its
nomination in the June 8, 1986, presidential runoff, which he won
with almost 54 percent of the vote.
   In a late Friday night television interview, Kukacka confirmed
his comments published by Die Presse.
   ``The federal president has not yet sufficiently responded to
the contents of the report of the historians' commission, while, on
the other hand, a pressure of opinion, as it were ... was generated
in the whole world,'' he said on the television.
   The historians' report presented no clear evidence to back
allegations Waldheim was directly involved in war crimes when he
was a lieutenant with the German army in the occupied Balkans.
   But the report left open the question of whether he was guilty
of any crime. It said he was ``in close proximity'' to Nazi
atrocities, knew about them and did nothing to prevent them.
   The president must put forward all his arguments to restore his
credibility, said Kukacka.
   After a conservative national leadership caucus Thursday,
People's Party chairman Alois Mock, Waldheim's main defender, said
the president's decision to remain in office must be respected.
   The conservative daily Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten in
Friday editions said segments of the People's Party ``are crumbling
away'' over Waldheim.
   The Socialist Party, senior partner in the government coalition
with the conservatives, has refrained from openly calling on
Waldheim to step down. But party officials have made clear they see
his resignation as the best solution to the standoff.
   In an interview published in today's editions of the West German
conservative newspaper Die Welt, Waldheim said, ``(My) resignation
from the office would throw the country into chaos.''
   He said resigning would give the impression that ``not Austrian
voters but foreign media and groups decide who may be Austrian head
of state.''
   Mock, who is vice chancellor and foreign minister in the
coalition government, apparently is coming under increasing
pressure from Waldheim critics in his party.
   ``Mock is the keystone in this issue. He cannot move any more.
If he were gone it would be easier'' to resolve the controversy
over Waldheim, a high-ranking People's Party official told The
Associated Press after the party caucus.
   Meanwhile, public protests against Waldheim continued throughout
Austria. Those calling for his resignation Friday included actors
of a Vienna theater and civil servants in four ministries.
   Various petitions with signatures calling on Waldheim to quit
are circulating in Vienna and elsewhere, including two separate
lists of conservative and Socialist university professors.

   A small plane crashed in dense
fog and driving rain Friday night in a wooded area near Atlantic
City, killing at least six people, officials said. There were no
survivors.
   The twin-engine Piper Najavo en route from Norwood, Mass., to
Pomona went down about sometime after 10:10 p.m., when its radar
signal was lost, said Anthony Willett, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman.
   Willett said at least six people were killed. It was not
immediately known how many people were aboard the plane, which went
down about two miles from Atlantic City Airport, he said.
   ``I don't have a passenger manifest in front of me, so I can't
be sure,'' he said. ``It's pouring rain down here, the plane is in
the woods, it's just hard to be sure.''
   Willett said that the plane, 32 feet long with a 40-foot wing
span, is of a type commonly used by commuter airlines, but that the
aircraft may have been privately owned.
   The hour-long search for the wreckage was hampered by fog and
rain, he said.

<HEAD>Publisher Mario Vazquez Rana Sells His Control Of UPI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mario Vazquez Rana, the Mexican newspaper
publisher, has announced he has sold his control of United Press
International. He said the former president of Financial News
Network will take over direct operational control of the company.
   The transaction took the form of a sale by the Mexican media
executive of an ``irrevocable proxy'' of his stock ownership in UPI
to WNW Group Inc.
   UPI, in an announcement moved on its news wires Friday night,
said the transfer is effective immediately.
   The announcement said Vazquez Rana relinquished his control over
the news service in return for ``present and future financial
considerations totaling more than $55 million.''
   Vazquez Rana bought UPI for $41 million in June 1986, ending
bankruptcy court proceedings that began in April 1985, when the
news service filed for protection from creditors.
   The announcement did not identify the owners of WNW. UPI
spokesman Christopher Smith said he believed WNW Group Inc. is an
independent company with no connection to FNN but said he did not
really know anything about them at this point.
   An irrevocable proxy represents a transfer of voting power
represented by the ownership shares but not the shares themselves.
   Smith said that Vazquez Rana ``considers his task of investment
in UPI completed at this time.''
   Smith said additional details would be released at a news
conference, probably on Monday.
   The agreement under which Vazquez Rana acquired UPI after
creditors approved a reorganization plan limited his ability to
sell his interest in UPI without first giving an employees stock
ownership plan the right of first refusal during a 60-day period.
   The UPI announcement said that the new president of the news
service will be Paul Steinle, former president of Financial News
Network, a 24-hour cable TV distributor of business news. The
announcement said he would have ``total operational control of
day-to-day management.''
   The announcement identified the chairman of WNW Group Inc. as
Dr. Earl Brian, but provided no further identification.
   Vazquez Rana's statement said, ``This step was necessary because
I could not devote a sufficient amount of time to hands-on
management. I am pleased that in this agreement, we have assured
the continuation of a venerable world news gathering and
independent journalistic organization.''
   In addition to Steinle and Brian, the UPI announcement also
listed three directors of WNW Group Inc. They are J. Alexander
McMahon, chairman and professor of the Health Services
Administration Department at Duke University; James Thistle,
director of the school of journalism at the college of
communications at Boston University; and Erik Hendricks, executive
director of the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals and a former journalist.

<TEXT>
   Three hospitals have turned down the
liver of a brain-dead baby whose body was being maintained on
life-support machines today, and tests indicated the organ was
failing, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The 7-pound infant known as Baby John was born Tuesday with most
of its brain missing, and was pronounced dead two days later at
Loma Linda University Medical Center.
   The baby was the first brain-absent infant in the nation to be
placed on artificial life support to keep its organs healthy for
transplant, hospital officials said. Doctors had planned to
maintain the body for up to seven days, but a blood test Friday
``suggests that his liver is failing,'' hospital spokeswoman Anita
Rockwell said.
   One prospective candidate in Pittsburgh was not an appropriate
match and another in the same hospital became infected, delaying
any possible transplant, she said Friday.
   A medical center in Wisconsin also was unable to accept the
liver for another candidate because they were committed to another
transplant and could not do two in one day, Ms. Rockwell said.
   ``The doctors in Wisconsin have refused the liver pending
further studies,'' the spokeswoman said.
   UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles turned down the liver because
they feel it is not an ideal candidate for their recipient, Ms.
Rockwell said.
   Baby John was born with only a brain stem, a condition known as
anencephaly that usually is fatal within days of birth. An infant's
healthy organs can be transplanted only if organ damage is
prevented by maintaining the infant on life support from birth.
   Loma Linda is the nation's only medical center to experiment
with using anencephalics as organ donors.

   The Air Force, concerned that it's losing too
many pilots to higher-paying commercial airlines, is considering a
bonus program to encourage its aviators to stick with the military.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge said Friday that while
the details haven't been worked out, ``basically we would pay
pilots something on the order of $9,000 to $12,000 per year for
signing up for a period of time as bonuses to the basic pay that
they would have.''
   The $54 million bonus program is needed because stepped-up
hiring by commercial airlines has caused the re-enlistment rate for
military pilots to drop steadily, Aldridge said at a news
conference.
   Whatever the Air Force recommends still would have to be
approved by Congress.

   The government's latest aviation forecast
predicts that passenger travel via commuter aircraft will increase
sharply in the coming years, outpacing growth in travel on
commercial jetliners.
   In a forecast released Friday, the Federal Aviation
Administration said commuter planes are expected to carry 58
million people annually by 1999, up from 27 million people last
year.
   The number of people flying commercial jetliners is expected to
grow from about 445 million passengers in 1987 to nearly 765
million in 1999.
   The FAA forecast said air traffic controllers will be handling a

   The Justice Department says it won't join in

astronauts killed in the Challenger shuttle crash.
   The department, which negotiated settlements with four of the
seven families in December 1986, feels it would be unfair to
contribute to any settlements higher than those agreed to in 1986
and that the government has no legal liability in the accident,
department spokeswoman Amelia Brown said Friday.
   Last week, the father and brother of mission specialist Judith

Thiokol Inc. for payment of from $1.5 million to $2.5 million. The
Justice Department declined to participate in the negotiations

<HEAD>Pakistani Envoy Warns Of Afghan Bloodbath</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Soviet troops withdraw from Afghanistan before
there is an interim coalition government in place, rival Afghan
factions could become embroiled in unending civil strife,
Pakistan's acting foreign minister warned.
   ``In our opinion, the way things are being worked out by the
Soviets, it is going to lead to a bloodbath,'' the diplomat, Zain
Noorani, told a news conference in London Friday.
   He said hundreds of thousands of Afghans could be killed if a
political settlement does not precede a Soviet departure, and
called on the West to press Moscow for an agreement on an interim
government.
   President Mohammad Zia Ul-Haq's government in Islamabad wants a
transition government in Kabul, the Afghan capital, before it will
sign an agreement leading to Soviet withdrawal and the return home
of more than two million Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan.
   Noorani said that without an interim coalition government,
Islamabad believes the refugees will not return to Afghanistan.
   ``We anticipate that under such circumstances more refugees will
be coming into Pakistan from Afghanistan,'' he said.
   Noorani, who met with Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
earlier Friday, denied Pakistan was trying to sabotage the chances
of an agreement at talks in Geneva between Pakistan and Afghanistan
on how to end the conflict.
   He said Islamabad wants Soviet forces to leave, but also wants a
lasting settlement.
   Noorani said Afghan guerrilla leaders and refugee and emigre
representatives on Monday would propose what he called a detailed
framework of a coalition government.
   Earlier this month, Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered to begin
withdrawing the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan on
May 15 if Pakistan signs an accord at the next session of the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva that begin March 2.
   But Gorbachev also said the Soviets would not attempt to
influence the composition of the Kabul government after they leave.
   The Soviet leader said all Soviet forces could be withdrawn in
10 months if agreement is reached at Geneva. The Soviets later
accused Pakistan of trying to block chances of an agreement.
   Pakistan's stand has some backing in Washington and London, but
Western leaders have urged Islamabad not to go so far as to
jeopardize Gorbachev's withdrawal pledge.
   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and replaced
one pro-Soviet government in Kabul with another. The Soviet move
was condemned by the United States, Britain and other Western
governments.
   The Soviets and Afghan government soldiers have been fighting
Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow the Kabul government.
   The guerrilla groups maintain bases in Pakistan and have
received support from the United States, Iran and Pakistan.
   The British Foreign Office said in a statement Friday following
Noorani's meeting with Howe: ``There is a tremendous amount of
sympathy and concern for Pakistan. After eight years of occupation
(in Afghanistan), the Soviet withdrawal is bound to leave a
tremendous vacuum.''

<HEAD>Meese Lawyer Denies Benefit From Payment To Advisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A published report today says two men closely
linked with Attorney General Edwin Meese III received $150,000 from
a Swiss businessman pushing an Iraqi oil pipeline, but Meese's
lawyer says the attorney general didn't benefit in any way.
   The Washington Post reported that Bruce Rappaport of Geneva sent
the money in mid-1985 to Franklyn Chinn, Meese's former investment
adviser, and E. Bob Wallach, a close friend of Meese for more than
30 years.
   Sources familiar with the payment said Wallach said the money
represents his legal fee for his work on the pipeline proposal, the
newspaper said. That work included getting Meese's help in setting
up a meeting for Rappaport in June 1985 with then-national security
adviser Robert C. McFarlane, the Post said.
   The Post quoted one source as saying the money was ``sent to
Chinn for the benefit of Wallach.''
   Meese's attorney, James Rocap, said Friday he was aware of the
payment but that ``it has absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Meese.''
   ``None of it (the money) ever went to Mr. Meese,'' he said.
``None of it was ever used for the benefit of Mr. Meese.''
   The Post said the payment is not included on Wallach's 1985
income tax return and was not reported by him until May 1987, when
independent counsel James C. McKay expanded his investigation of
the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. to include Meese's dealings with
Wallach and Chinn.
   Wallach and Chinn and a third man were accused in a federal
indictment in New York in December of taking illegal payments from
Wedtech to influence Meese. McKay has been conducting a separate
investigation of Meese's dealings with the two men.
   Rappaport hired Wallach in 1985 to try to drum up U.S. support
for the proposed 540-mile pipeline through Jordan that would run
close to Israeli territory. The pipeline never was built.
   The San Francisco-based Bechtel Group, which was seeking to
build the project, had enlisted the Swiss businessman's help
because of his close ties to Israeli political figures. There had
been concern that Israel might attack the pipeline.

<HEAD>Shultz Says Soviets Must `Face Up' To Human Rights Promblems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
today said the Soviet Union must ``face up'' to its human rights
problems if it wants to participate in a Middle East peace
conference.
   Shultz specifically cited restrictions on emigration and
religious practices, as well as a lack of diplomatic relations with
Israel.
   ``So they have some work to do that will make their presence at
an international conference more acceptable from our standpoint and
Israel's standpoint,'' Shultz told reporters on his Air Force jet
flight from Washington.
   The Middle East is one of the topics on his agenda for the talks
Shultz is to hold in Moscow Sunday with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and on Monday with General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Shevardnadze.
   Shultz is scheduled to go to the Middle East next week to try to
set up negotiations between Israel and the Arabs. He seemed
doubtful that a peace conference would be the right framework.
   ``What is an international conference supposed to do if there is
one?'' Shultz said.
   But, he added, if the Soviets ``continue to advocate seriously
an international conference they have to face up to these problems
that are posed by their lack of diplomatic presence in one of the
key parties, and the immigration and other problems that I
mentioned.''
   Shultz said he would not seek Soviet backing for his efforts.
   ``We will talk around about the Middle East, but we are not
asking them for anything,'' he said. ``I think it will be more in
the nature of information sharing.''
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union was nearly 800 people a
month April through September of last year. It rose to over 900
monthly October through December. But in January, emigration dipped
to about 650 to 700, and is at about the same rate this month.
   Last year, applications were accepted from Jews who did not have
relatives in Israel, but on Jan. 1 the process was halted.
   The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel after the 1967
Mideast war, but sent a handful of diplomats to Tel Aviv last year.
   Shultz said the Soviets had imposed ``unwarranted'' restrictions
on emigration and on the practice of Judaism and other religions.
``So they have some work to do,'' he said.
   On another front, Shultz backed Pakistan's demand for a
coalition government in Afghanistan. He said it would make ``a
contribution'' to stability as Soviet troops withdrew from the
country.
   Shultz said the U.S.-backed Afghan rebels would propose ``new
ideas'' in Geneva when negotiations for a settlement resume March 2.
   The Soviets last week said Pakistan was obstructing an end to
the eight-year war in the country by insisting that a change of
government in Kabul precede the signing of a peace agreement.
   Some 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan supporting the
government in its war with the guerrillas. On Feb. 8 Gorbachev
offered to begin a withdrawal on May 15 if an agreement is reached,
and to carry it out over 10 months.
   The negotiations are being conducted by Pakistan and Afghanistan
under the auspices of the United Nations.
   The People's Democratic Party, which seized power in Kabul in
1978, has presented its proposal for a future government to U.N.
mediator Diego Cordovez. A U.S. official, who demanded anonymity,
said it called for a dominant role for the Kabul regime.
   Shultz said the United States would suspend its military aid to
the rebels provided the Soviets ``cease similar supplies to the
government forces.''
   ``There has to be a symmetry there,'' Shultz said.

Simon told the Minnehaha County Democratic Forum. The national

   National Republican Party Chairman
Frank Fahrenkopf says Nevada Republicans are ``a long way'' from
determining their delegates to the GOP convention despite a straw
poll in which Pat Robertson's backers claimed victory.
   Vice President George Bush led Nevada's GOP presidential straw
poll with 27 percent of the vote, but Robertson forces claimed
their candidate had won if undecided votes cast by Robertson
supporters were figured in.
   Robertson's 15 percent of the vote Thursday night placed him
behind Bush and Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole, who had 22 percent, and
ahead of Rep. Jack Kemp who got 13 percent. But the Robertson
campaign urged followers to cast undecided votes, so the total of
his support could have been higher than Bush's.
   Fahrenkopf, a Nevada native, said Friday the straw poll was
non-binding and ``we are a long way from determining who the
delegates are just at the state level. What happened in a straw
poll at the Nevada caucuses really doesn't mean a lot.''

   Republican Jack Kemp used a rare one-on-one confrontation with
GOP presidential rival George Bush to claim he is best qualified to
continue ``the Reagan revolution,'' while Democratic candidates
debated bitterly despite a plea to tone down their family feud.
   Relishing the limelight relinquished by Sen. Bob Dole and Pat
Robertson, who boycotted the GOP debate Friday night in Dallas,
Kemp assailed Bush's stance on a nuclear missile defense and called
the vice president's budget-balancing plan unworkable.
   The candidates in both parties kept up heavy-duty rhetorical
fire as they sought to gain momentum going into upcoming primaries
and caucuses, especially the Super Tuesday contests in 20 states on
March 8.
   While Bush suggested that Dole was ``angry and bitter'' over his
second-place finish in New Hampshire, the vice president's aides
acknowledged that he was withdrawing from competition in Tuesday's
South Dakota primary. Bush wants to devote more attention to the
southern and border states holding contests on Super Tuesday, they
said.
   Dole, meanwhile, appearing in Lexington, Ky., said he was not
shaken by his runner-up showing in New Hampshire and that he will
do well in South Dakota and Minnesota.
   ``We're ready for the next round in South Dakota and Minnesota
and we'll see who wins those two. We'll see who's dispirited
Wednesday morning next week,'' the Kansas senator said.
   In their second caustic debate in as many days, three Democratic
candidates played catch-the-leader in turning their criticism
toward front-runners Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt.
   Jesse Jackson drew hoots from the crowd in St. Paul, Minn., when
he asked Gephardt if he was ``proud of your vote for the Reagan tax
cut in 1981.'' The Missouri congressman defended his overall tax
voting record. Most of that tax cut ``went to ordinary people,'' he
said. Jackson retorted: ``That was the trigger of this whole
deficit crisis.''
   Dukakis, the winner of the New Hampshire primary this week, took
a direct shot at Gephardt's trade policies, warning during the
Friday debate that ``we've got to do more than wave a fist at our
foreign competitors.''
   ``Why is everyone defending unfair trade practices?'' Gephardt
said.
   Toward the end of a turbulent campaign week that saw the
withdrawals of Republicans Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Pete du Pont
and Democrat Bruce Babbitt, there were these other developments:
   _Democrat Paul Simon said in South Dakota that he would remain
in the presidential race, despite saying just days earlier he would
drop out if he didn't win in South Dakota or Minnesota's contests
next Tuesday.
   ``I'm in it until the finish line in Atlanta,'' he said,
contending he had received an ``outpouring of encouragement'' and
money since his disappointing third-place finish in New Hampshire.
   _Robertson, holding a rally with supporters at the same posh
Dallas hotel where Bush and his entourage had stayed, said he
backed out of the debate because he didn't get enough tickets for
his supporters, ``and I'd rather be with you here.''
   Because of the no-shows by Dole and Robertson, Kemp got a rare
opportunity to confront Bush, with wide television exposure and
without interference from others. He didn't flinch.
   ``I believe in the Reagan revolution and I want to carry it into
the 1990s,'' the New York congressman said in a point-blank
challenge to Bush's oft-stated campaign pitch that he is the
rightful heir to the Reagan legacy.
   In an exchange that provoked laughter, debate moderator Roger
Mudd asked if the Kemp and Bush appearance might suggest a GOP
ticket for 1988. Kemp responded, ``I don't think George Bush wants
to serve another eight years as vice president.''
   In the night's sharpest exchange, Kemp attacked Bush on nuclear
weapons, saying he would more quickly research, test and develop a
missile defense shield.
   Bush said it would be wrong to support ``premature
development,'' and Kemp asserted that they must ``stand up for
something'' beyond peace alone.
   ``I was in combat,'' Bush replied, referring to his record in
World War II experience. ``I don't think you know what it is until
you've seen your fellow men drop dead.''
   Kemp snapped back: ``I don't need a lecture.''
   The Democrats, during their St. Paul run-in, seemed oblivious to
party chairman Paul Kirk's exhortation that they cut down some of
the internecine warfare.
   In a ``Dear Candidate'' letter, Kirk said personal attacks among
the contenders ``do nothing to enhance the opportunity for a
Democratic victory in November.''
   But the candidates seemed unfazed by this.
   Dukakis complained that ``my name was taken in vain'' by Gary
Hart, who demanded to know why the Massachusetts governor had not
followed his example and released a budget proposal.
   ``The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is because
they don't want to tell the American people the facts,'' Hart said.
   ``I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced a
budget,'' retorted Dukakis.

   Agreement was reached Saturday on a $22 million
package of union concessions that will keep the New York Post
publishing and clears the way for owner Rupert Murdoch to sell the
paper.
   The agreement was reached at 1:50 a.m. after a final bargaining
session that began around 10 a.m. Friday.
   Murdoch had said the paper would close Friday unless the paper's
unions provided concessions he needed to sell the money-losing
paper to real estate developer Peter Kalikow.
   ``I want to say at this time that I wish Mr. Kalikow great,
successful publishing of the New York Post,'' Murdoch said in
announcing the agreement.
   ``He's a very ambitious man, as well as being a wealthy one. I
know that he is determined to make it successful,'' Murdoch said.
   ``He's getting the newspaper now in better shape, getting a
newspaper with a fine staff, wonderful executives, and I'm sure
that he needs nothing more than a new start under new leadership
and he goes ahead with that with my full blessing.''
   The agreement, slated to take effect March 7, is subject to the
auditing of the savings by Kalikow's company and fast ratification
by each of the 10 unions involved, officials said.
   The cost reductions amount to $10 million in the first year, $8
million in the second and $6 million in the third, with a $2
million across-the-board bonus for employees in the third year,
officials said.
   Murdoch had demanded concessions totaling $24 million over three
years to meet conditions of a deal to sell the Post for $37 million
to Kalikow.
   According to the agreement, the paper will save $22.5 million by
cutting 130 jobs, officials said. Murdoch contributed $3 million to
the package, raising the total beyond the $24 million mark and
allowing for the employees' raises, officials said.
   Union leader George McDonald thanked Murdoch for the $3 million
``to sweeten the pot.''
   Murdoch said the agreement resulted from good will on both sides.
   ``It has been a very difficult 12 days for all of us,'' he said.
   At the Post's offices, editors were preparing the Saturday
edition.
   Murdoch met earlier Friday with Kalikow, said union leader
George McDonald.
   The alternative was to fold the paper because of a federal
regulation barring Murdoch from owning a newspaper and TV station
in the same city. Murdoch owns WNYW in New York.
   On Friday morning, Murdoch had declared flatly that he would not
stop the clock to save the newspaper.
   On Wednesday, the unions put forward a proposal they said would
save $33 million, $9 million more than Murdoch demanded, and asked
that the extra money go into pay raises. On Thursday, management
knocked down $12 million of the package as non-negotiable under
terms of the deal with Kalikow.
   After 10 minutes with the negotiators at the Grand Hyatt Hotel
on Friday morning, Murdoch said the gap in the concessions package
amounted to $4 million over three years.
   The exact size of the gap was a major sticking point, along with
the union demand for raises for those workers who survived the cuts.
   Barry Lipton, president of The Newspaper Guild of New York, said
another problem was that management had increased the number of
jobs that would have to be pared. Initially the negotiators said
they were dealing with 116 reductions from a workforce of 1,200.
   While other union leaders went into small working groups to seek
a solution, the leader of the paper's drivers' union, Jerry Cronin,
said he was done talking unless he heard from management.
   If the Post went under, he said, ``it died at the hands of Mr.
Murdoch.''
   The union leaders consistently called on Kalikow to join the
talks, but he said the concessions had to be made with Murdoch for
the sale to go through.
   The contract with Kalikow gave Murdoch until Feb. 22 to
negotiate the union concessions.
   The Post, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton, faced financial
problems from its earliest years but held on as paper after paper
in the city merged and then eventually shut down.
   Murdoch bought the afternoon tabloid from Dorothy Schiff in 1976
for about $31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings
from Australia and England into the United States.
   Under Murdoch, the paper turned from liberal to conservative on
the editorial page and became splashy and racy. The early edition
of Friday carried the front-page headline: ``Only Hours to Live
...'' to promote a story about the release of photographs taken of
Jennifer Levin a short time before she was killed in Central Park.
   Murdoch says he has lost nearly $150 million in 11 years of
operating the Post. He said Friday that current losses were running
$100,000 a day.
   Murdoch chose to sell the Post following a congressional rider
engineered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., that blocked the Federal Communications
Commission from continuing to waive its rule barring ownership of
both a television station and a newspaper in the same city. Murdoch
owns WNYW-TV in New York.
   In Boston, where he faces the same situation, Murdoch has
indicated he'd sell his TV station and hold on to the Boston Herald.

<HEAD>Man Sets Himself Ablaze To Mourn Assassinated Actor and Film Star</HEAD>

   A 30-year-old Sinhalese man set
himself ablaze to mourn the assassination of a popular movie actor
and politician. Doctors said the man was in critical condition
today.
   Amarasinghe Jayasinghe doused himself with kerosene and set
himself ablaze about midnight Thursday where queues of people had
formed to file past the coffin bearing the body of Vijaya
Kumaranatunga.
   ``The poor quality of the kerosene and quick action by onlookers
kept him alive so far'' said a doctor in the burn unit of Colombo's
general hospital.
   Relatives said Jayasinghe was an ardent fan of Kumaranatunga,
who was killed at his suburban Colombo home Tuesday by two gunmen
police say they suspect belong to the extremist Sinhalese People's
Liberation Front.
   The front has vowed to kill anyone who, like Kumaranatunga,
supports an Indian-brokered peace accord that aims to end Tamil
rebels' four-year-old struggle for an indepedent homeland.
   The July accord would grant the Tamils some degree of autonomy
in northern and eastern provinces where they are most numerous.
   Kumaranatunga, who was 43, headed the opposition Sri Lanka
People's Party. He is to be cremated Sunday afternoon and police
said they expect huge crowds.
   People from all over the country are expected to attend the
cremation. Kumaranatunga starred in more than 100 films, and
theater owners say they will close their establishments Sunday out
of respect.
   Police say the People's Liberation Front has killed about 150
people who support the peace accord, including lawmakers, police
officers and Harsha Abeywardene, chairman of the governing United
National Party.
   The accord has also been rejected by the largest Tamil militia,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have refused to surrender
their weapons, as called for by its provisions.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, claim they are discriminated
against by the Sinhalese Buddhists, who make up 75 percent of the
island's 16 million people. Tamils comprise about 18 percent of the
population.
   India has sent nearly 50,000 troops to the neighboring island to
disarm the rebels, but fighting continues in the east.

   A commuter plane crashed in heavy fog
Friday night after takeoff from Raleigh-Durham Airport, and all 12
people aboard were feared dead, officials said.
   American Eagle Flight 378 was en route to Richmond, Va., with 10
passengers and two crew members when it went down in a wooded area
at 9:27 p.m. about a mile from the 10,000-foot runway, said airport
spokeswoman Teresa Damiano.
   ``I show them as fatal,'' said V.H. Steed, night duty officer
with the Federal Aviation Agency in Atlanta.
   Witnesses said they heard an explosion and saw a fireball before
the twin-engine plane with a seating capacity of 19 went down near
a small residential area, Ms. Damiano said. She said no homes were
hit.
   ``There are no anticipated survivors,'' she said. ``Indications
are that the plane is in several pieces. There was a small bit of
fire that was contained. There was no indication to the tower that
the plane was in any danger prior to takeoff.''
   Shortly after midnight, a woman was escorted into the terminal
sobbing and asking, ``What happened?''
   The woman, who declined to give her name, said her 13-year-old
son was on the flight. She said she had received no official word
on her son's fate.
   ``It sounded like a blast or something because they've been
blasting down on this road, putting in sewer lines, and that's the
way it sounded,'' said Mary H. Ward, who lives in a mobile home
three miles from the airport.
   ``It wasn't too awful loud. It was kind of muffled. I wondered
what it was, but there was nobody here but me so I didn't go out
and look around.''
   At Richmond International Airport, several people were waiting
for information on the crash and on arrangements for travel to
North Carolina, said a ground supervisor for American Airlines who
refused to give his name.
   ``They can't believe it happened,'' said the man. ``Some people
wish it was them.''
   Most of the passengers were from Richmond, and the crew was
based in Raleigh, he said.
   Investigators from the FAA and the National Transportation
Safety Board in Washington will arrive Saturday, Steed said.
   American Eagle, an affiliate of American Airlines, had recently
resumed flights from its base at Raleigh-Durham after filing for
bankruptcy reorganization Jan. 15.
   The airline abruptly ceased flights Jan. 14, leaving some
passengers stranded. In its bankruptcy filing, AVAir Inc., which
operates American Eagle, claimed $9.2 million in assets and $12
million in liabilities.

   The United States sent records to help Britain
investigate alleged links between Kurt Waldheim and six British
commandos who were executed in Nazi-occupied Greece, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said.
   She also said Britain had no suspicions about Waldheim's record
as an intelligence officer in the German army when he was elected
U.N. secretary-general in 1972.
   The prime minister made the comments Friday in written replies
to questions in the House of Commons.
   Allegations have been made that Waldheim, who held the U.N. job
10 years and now is president of Austria, committed war crimes
during his service in the Balkans. An international panel of
historians appointed by the Austrian government said it found no
proof, but left the question of guilt open.
   Waldheim, 69, has denied wrongdoing since the accusations began
during his presidential campaign two years ago, and has refused to
resign since the historians' report was made public last week.
   The arrival of the microfilmed German army war records from U.S.
military archives was the latest step in an attempt ordered by Mrs.
Thatcher to determine whether Waldheim interrogated the six
commandos.
   The men, a raiding party captured off the Greek island of
Alimina in April 1944, were handed over for interrogation to the
unit in which Waldheim served.
   They refused to talk and were executed by the Germans, a war
crime under the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war.
   ``I am informed that at the time of Dr. Waldheim's election as
U.N. secretary-general no doubts were raised about his wartime
record,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
   She was answering questions from lawmaker Robert Rhodes James,
who served on Waldheim's personal staff at the United Nations and
now is trying to prove him guilty of war crimes. The historians'
report said Waldheim was in ``close proximity'' to atrocities, must
have known of them and did nothing to stop them.
   British officials said the material sent from the United States
was a copy of the so-called Alimina file dealing with the capture
of the commandos.
   The original file was in a mass of German military documents
American forces captured at the end of the war in 1945. The
documents were kept in the United States until sent to West German
archives at Freiburg in the late 1960s.
   Historian Gerald Fleming says records of the vital second
interrogation of the commandos, including who conducted it, were
missing from the original file in Freiburg.
   Fleming was the British member of the international commission,
which reported finding the initial ``W'' in Waldheim's hand on an
earlier record of interviews with the six men, indicating he at
least had read it.
   The historians' report said Waldheim was well aware of Hitler's
orders to execute commandos.
   A note in English attached to the Alimina file said: ``Do not
film this sheet. Interrogations reports removed because of security
classification.'' It was not immediately clear whether the U.S.
microfilmed material was more complete than the original file.
   An inquiry in 1986, based on incomplete British files, did not
establish a link between Waldheim and the commandos.

<HEAD>Four Die In Fire, Bringing Fume Death Toll To 14 This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four men died today from inhaling toxic fumes
given off when plastic foam in a sofa caught fire during a minor
blaze at an apartment, London Fire Brigade reported.
   The four deaths bring to at least 14 the number of Britons
killed during fires by the thick black fumes given off by plastic
foam used as filling material in cheap furniture.
   The other 10 victims were children who died within the first 10
days of this year.
   Public concern and a long-running campaign by fire chiefs
against the filling prompted the government to announce last month
a ban on use of standard and high-resilience polyurethane foam in
new furniture. The ban would be put into effect starting February
1989.
   The time gap is to allow manufacturers to re-equip but the ban
does not cover existing foam-filled furniture, which will remain a
potential danger in many homes.
   The fire brigade said in a statement that a carelessly discarded
cigarette is thought to have started today's fire in an apartment
at Bethnal Green in east London.
   The fire itself took firefighters only 10 minutes to bring under
control. They found the bodies of two of the dead beside a locked
rear door in the apartment. The bodies of the other two victims
were found in a bathroom. They are thought to have taken refuge
there to escape the fumes.
   A fifth man, found in the same room as the sofa, also had
inhaled the fumes but survived. He was hospitalized.

<TEXT>
   TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who
accused ousted PTL leader Jim Bakker of sexual misconduct, is being
investigated by the Assemblies of God church amid reports of
similar allegations.
   The denomination's 13-member Executive Presbytery met with
Swaggart at its headquarters here for nearly 10 hours Thursday ``to
discuss matters that could affect his credentials with the
church,'' church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said Friday.
   Mrs. Turnage would not give details of the investigation, but
said it is a ``critical situation'' and that Swaggart is
cooperating. The Assemblies of God last year stripped Bakker of his
credentials.
   ABC's ``Nightline,'' citing sources it did not identify,
reported early today that church officials at the meeting were
shown photographs purported to show Swaggart and a known prostitute
going into and out of a motel room.
   One unidentified church official told ABC the photos were open
to interpretation.
   Swaggart did not deny to church officials that he had been with
a prostitute, ABC reported. ABC said New Orleans preacher Marvin
Gorman was believed to have provided the photos to church officials.
   The Assemblies of God defrocked Gorman in 1986 for ``immorality
and conduct unbecoming to a minister,'' an unidentified church
official told The Washington Post.
   CBS News reported Friday that the probe involved allegations of
sexual misconduct, and the Post quoted unidentified sources in
today's editions as saying the investigation involved charges of
adultery.
   The Assemblies of God did not comment on the nature of its
investigation. Swaggart spokeswoman Barbara Klein said late Friday:
``At this point, we don't have a statement.''
   Bakker, who was stripped of his credentials as a minister in the
church following allegations of homosexuality and an extramarital
sexual encounter in 1980 with Jessica Hahn, said Friday night that
the reports about Swaggart were ``most confusing and hurtful.''
   ``I'm shocked,'' he added. ``What we've gone through no one on
earth should have to go through.''
   Swaggart, 52, is president of a TV ministry worth an estimated
$140 million a year. It is based in Baton Rouge, La., and
broadcasts to 143 countries.
   Swaggart, interviewed at the Baton Rouge airport upon his return
from Springfield, was asked about the nature of the meeting with
church officials.
   ``You'll have to call them and ask them,'' he replied.
   When asked about the report of the pictures, he said, ``Call our
attorney if you like.''
   Last September, Gorman filed a $90 million suit accusing
Swaggart and others of plotting to ruin his TV ministry with false
reports of adulterous affairs. A judge dismissed the suit, saying
it was a religious dispute that didn't belong in court.
   Shortly afterward, Gorman's organization, Marvin Gorman
Ministries, filed for bankruptcy reorganization, claiming debts of
more than $2 million. He is pastor of the Metropolitan Christian
Life Church in Metairie, La., outside New Orleans.
   Calls to Gorman's church in New Orleans went unanswered, and
there is no telephone listing under Gorman's name there.
   Swaggart, a Pentecostal minister, has come under scrutiny
recently on several fronts.
   In June, a court battle over the tax-exempt status of a Texas
radio station belonging to the ministry forced the evangelical
empire to release details of its finances and led to allegations
Swaggart has kept contributions for his personal use.
   When Bakker stepped down from PTL last March, he accused a rival
group of trying to take over the $172 million TV ministry by
exposing his involvement in a sex-and-money scandal. Swaggart was
alleged to be a member of that rival group, but denied that
accusation. Bakker later retracted the charge.
   Swaggart, a high-school dropout, is the cousin of singer Jerry
Lee Lewis. He and his wife, Frances, have a son, Donnie. In
addition to the television ministry, Swaggart has put out more than
50 gospel albums and runs one of the largest non-profit mail order
merchandise businesses in the country.

<TEXT>
   Thai and Laotian officers today flew
over a disputed border area to arrange for the disengagement of
troops that had been locked in a bloody, 3{-month battle, a Thai
officer said.
   Since a truce began Friday, no fighting was reported in the area
where hundreds of soldiers on both sides had died since fighting
commenced in November around contested hills at the frontier.
   Members of the Laotian joint committee flew over the area in a
Soviet-made MI-8 helicopter while the Thais inspected it from a
U.S.-manufactured Huey said Thai army spokesman Col. Rithee
Rungkaputi.
   After the cease-fire began, two parallel rows of Thai and
Laotian flags were staked to mark a zone which troops are forbidden
to cross, said Thai Gen. Charuay Wongsayant.
   The fighting had been the bloodiest since communist forces
triumphed in Laos in 1975.
   Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth, the Thai army commander, said he
would fly to the Laotian capital of Vientiane Tuesday at the
invitation of Gen. Sisavat Keobounphan, the chief of the Laotian
army general staff.
   Sisavat was Chaovalit's counterpart at talks early last week in
Bangkok that produced the cease fire.
   Thai and Laotian military delegations agreed that their troops
should be separated by 2 miles within 48 hours of the start of the
truce.
   The affected area is between Thailand's northern province of
Phitsanulok and Laos' Sayaboury province, an area about 240 miles
north of Bangkok.

   Friends of a teen-ager accused of
hacking four family members to death with an ax tried to hand him
letters of support during his arraignment as people here struggled
for an explanation of the slayings.
   ``It would be so much easier for us if we could say the guy was
living on the edge, a criminal at heart,'' Rochester Lourdes High
School Principal Michael Leahy said Friday. ``But no, he's a very
regular kid. The allegations are beyond our comprehension.''
   David Brom, a 16-year-old Lourdes sophomore, was captured here
Friday and charged in the Thursday slayings of his parents and
younger brother and sister. Brom gave himself a punk haircut on the
day of the killings, said Olmsted County Sheriff Charles Von Wald.
   Killed were Bernard Brom, 41, an engineer at IBM's Rochester
plant; Paulette Brom, 41; Diane, 14; and Rick, 9, Von Wald said.
   The four were found in their night clothes in the family's home
in a Rochester suburb, all apparently struck at least once with an
ax, the sheriff said. A bloody, 28-inch ax was found in the
basement, the sheriff said.
   During Brom's arraignment Friday, about a dozen friends tried to
hand him letters of support, but were stopped by security guards.
   Friends and acquaintances wrote several dozen letters to be
delivered to him in the Olmsted County jail in Rochester, a city of
about 60,000 some 90 miles southeast of Minneapolis.
   ``We want him to know we support him and care about him,'' said
one classmate, who would not give her name.
   ``Anybody who judges Dave without knowing him is out of their
mind,'' said student Chris Bromelkamp. ``He may have done something
bad, but there's a lot of people he touched. In the morning, I
would come in in a bad mood, and there's Dave with a big smile and
a joke.''
   Some students told reporters that Brom had recently argued with
his father over a punk rock music tape the son brought home, and
said the teen-ager liked punk groups such as Suicidal Tendencies.
   Von Wald said Brom dyed and cut his hair in a spiked, punk
fashion Thursday, and that he had bought a wig and makeup in what
the sheriff speculated may have been an attempt to disguise himself.
   ``He listened to some pretty far-out music, but he wasn't a
satanist and wasn't a transvestite'' or a drug-user, Bromelkamp
said.
   Brom appeared calm Friday during his 15-minute arraignment on
four counts of first-degree murder and eight counts of
second-degree murder. The charges allege different degrees of
premeditation or intent.
   According to the complaint, one unidentified person indicated
that Brom on Wednesday said he was going to kill his parents that
night, and another person indicated that Brom told her over the
phone the next day that he had killed his parents.
   District Judge Gerard Ring ordered Brom examined by
court-appointed psychiatrists, said County Attorney Raymond
Schmitz. He was being held under a 24-hour watch at the county jail
pending a detention hearing next week, Schmitz said.
   Assistant county public defender Terry Walters, representing
Brom, said he will fight any efforts to have the youth tried as an
adult.
   The administration of the 415-student Roman Catholic school set
up a series of therapy sessions and a special Mass on Friday.
Dozens of students spent much of the day hugging, crying and
talking to friends and counselors.
   A funeral is planned Sunday at Pax Christi Catholic Church,
where the elder Broms were known as leaders and devout Christians.

   Sikh gunmen killed two people at a bus
stop outside Amritsar today, raising to 25 the number of people
slain in two days of bombings and shootings in Punjab state, police
and news reports said.
   The victims included 10 people shot to death then set ablaze in
a farmhouse and 10 others who died in apparently well-planned bomb
attacks in four cities in the northern state. More than 60 people
were wounded in the bombings.
   An unexploded bomb was found today in a fifth city, Batala, the
United News of India reported. It said the four-pound tin of
explosives was left in a store by a woman customer in the city 25
miles northeast of Amritsar.
   The news agency also said two men were shot to death this
afternoon at a bus stop on the edge of the Sikh holy city.
   The latest killings brought to nearly 250 the number of people
killed this year in Punjab in attacks blamed on Sikh militants, who
demand a separate nation for their minority religion.
   In the village of Sahsra, nine members of a farm family were
killed with automatic rifles and revolvers Friday night, along with
a man staying at the house, police said.
   Residents in the village 20 miles southeast of Amritsar said
about six Sikh gunmen stormed into the home of farmer Kewal Singh
while the family slept. The assailants set the bodies, the farmouse
and its furnishings ablaze, the villagers said.
   The victims included the farmer, his wife, two daughters, four
sons, a niece and a guest identified as Sukhdev Singh. Police said
earlier reports that 11 died apparently resulted from confusion.
   While Sikh militants frequently claim their Sikh victims are
police informers, neighbors insisted Kewal Singh was only a simple
villager.
   Gurcharan Singh, the village leader, said he was ``a poor farmer
and tongawalla,'' or wagon driver.
   UNI reported two other people were shot to death by Sikh
militants Friday at Bhuri Kalan near Amritsar and a man was killed
near Patiala, about 140 miles southeast of Amritsar.
   Friday's bomb attacks were in the cities of Amritsar, Patiala,
Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur and prompted police in New Delhi to issue
a ``red alert'' that the attacks might spread to the capital.
   Sikh extremists have been fighting for a separate state in
Punjab since 1982. Sikhs are a majority in Punjab but comprise only
2 percent of the nationwide population of 780 million, more than 80
percent of whom are Hindu.
   The Sikh faith has elements of both Hinduism and Islam and was
founded about 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to the two
warring religions.
   But the Sikhs' 10th and final prophet, Guru Gobind Singh,
declared Sikhism a warrior faith in which male adherents should all
carry knives and bear the name Singh, ``lion'' in Punjabi.

   Witnesses report seeing a fireball and
hearing an explosion before a commuter plane crashed on takeoff
from Raleigh-Durham Airport, killing all 12 people aboard in one of
three air tragedies.
   Near Atlantic City, N.J., at least six people were killed in a
plane crash Friday, authorities said, and three others died when a
plane slammed into a highway in El Paso, Texas.
   In North Carolina, American Eagle commuter flight 3378, a
twin-engine turboprop bound for Richmond, Va., crashed in heavy fog
at 9:27 p.m. Friday with 10 passengers and two crew members aboard,
airport spokeswoman Teresa Damiano said.
   ``The plane is in several pieces,'' Ms. Damiano said. ``There
was a small bit of fire that was contained. There was no indication
to the tower that the plane was in any danger prior to takeoff.''
   She said witnesses reported hearing an explosion and seeing a
fireball before the crash.
   ``It sounded like a blast or something,'' said Mary H. Ward, who
lives in a mobile home about three miles from the airport. ``It was
kind of muffled.''
   A team of investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration
and the National Transportation Safety Board flew to the scene,
said V.H. Steed, night duty officer for the FAA in Atlanta,
   The airplane was listed as a Swearingen SW-4 twin-engine
turboprop, Steed said.
   The fog was not believed to be a factor in the crash, said
Richard Wines, the airport tower controller.
   The victims' names were not immediately available. American
Eagle is a commuter carrier for American Airlines.
   In Hamilton Township, N.J., no one survived when a small
twin-engine plane crashed in dense fog and driving rain near
Atlantic City International Airport, officials said.
   Emergency crews were still on the scene early today, and few
details of the crash were available.
   FAA spokesman Anthony Willett said at least six people died when
the twin-engine Piper Navajo went down sometime after 10:10 p.m.,
when its radar signal was lost, but it was not known exactly how
many were aboard.
   Deep woods, fog and rain hampered investigative work, Willett
said.
   The plane was en route from Norwood, Mass., to the Atlantic City
airport at Pomona, Willett said. It was found at 11:11 p.m. about
two miles northwest of the airport.
   Willett said officials from the FAA and NTSB would be at the
scene today.
   He said the 32-foot-long plane is of the type commonly used by
commuter airlines, but that it mave have been privately owned.
   Earlier, a twin-engine plane skimmed over morning rush-hour
traffic and crashed on a freeway access road in El Paso, killing
all three people aboard and spewing flaming debris that destroyed
two parked cars, authorities said.
   ``It looked like it was going to attempt maybe to come onto the
freeway, but as soon as it got over the freeway, it just
nosedived,'' said Victor Armendariz, who was at a stop light.
   The Gulfstream Commander 680 went down in moderate snow and
light fog after takeoff from El Paso International Airport, NTSB
spokesman Tommy McFall said.
   The plane apparently developed landing-gear trouble and was
trying to return, McFall said.
   The victims' identities were not immediately released and the
plane's destination was not available.
   In Lake Charles, La., authorities attempted Friday to free a
downed plane from 10 feet of mud in a lake but failed when a
helicopter pulled the tail off as it tried to lift the wreckage.
   The plane was buried nose down in the shallow waters of Lake
Prien, where it went down Thursday. Officials said the wreckage was
buried so deep that there was no way to determine fatalities, but
it was believed two men were aboard.

<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A militia commander today said his forces
arrested several accomplices in the kidnapping of a U.S. Marine
officer who heads a United Nations observer team, but that the
mastermind had escaped.
   Daoud Daoud, the top military commander of the mainstream Shiite
Amal militia in south Lebanon, also that the kidnapping was
well-planned in advance but that a series of snags slowed down the
abductors' flight, giving Amal time to seal the area.
   He said he believes Lt. Col. William R. Higgins still is in
south Lebanon, although he was kidnapped Wednesday.
   ``We have arrested several accomplices, but the leader of the
kidnap operation has left the south,'' Daoud told The Associated
Press in an interview at his home in Bedias, seven miles northeast
of Tyre.
   ``We know them all by name now, and we believe (Lt.) Col.
Higgins is still in south Lebanon,'' he said.
   Amal militiamen and U.N. peacekeeping troops have sealed off a
300-square-mile area around Tyre, searching through cave-strewn
valleys and olive and citrus groves.
   Higgins, 43, heads a 76-man unarmed U.N. observer team that
monitors border violations of a 1949 armistice agreement between
Lebanon and Israel.
   The group is attached to the 5,800-member U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon, or UNIFIL, deployed in 1978 after an Israeli incursion
into south Lebanon.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth on Friday
claimed responsibility for Higgins' abduction, accusing him of
being a CIA spy. American and U.N. officials denied the charge.
   The Pentagon said Higgins, of Danville, Ky., had been a junior
military aide to former U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
but that his abduction did not pose a major security risk to the
United States.
   The first claim of responsibility for the kidnapping came
Thursday in a call from an anonymous man claiming to speak for a
previously unknown group, the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades.
   ``We believe Higgins is still in south Lebanon because the
accomplice who was assigned to transport him to Beirut after the
abduction is detained by us,'' Daoud said, refusing to identify any
of the suspects or their affiliations.
   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said many
of the 40 men detained have links to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, an umbrella organization for Shiite extremists.
   Hezbollah's Voice of Islam radio station, based in Baalbek, in
east Lebanon, claimed today that 150 Hezbollah members were rounded
up in house raids in the Tyre region.
   ``Amal's men have stormed Hezbollah's operations center in the
south, seized documents, equipment and cameras. They also raided
the house of Hezbollah's south Lebanon leader Abbas Musawi,'' the
radio said. It made no mention of Higgins.
   Daoud said Higgins' abduction was ``carefully thought out,
planned and staged.''
   He said among the detainees were those assigned to monitor
Higgins' movements, and ``they have confessed that they knew four
days in advance that he was coming to Tyre on Wednesday.''
   Higgins was driving from Tyre to UNIFIL headquarters in the
border town of Naqoura when gunmen in a brown Volvo car blocked the
highway and seized him.
   ``The kidnappers ran into a chain of snags after the abduction.
Their first car, the brown Volvo, got stuck in the mud. They made a
bulldozer driver push them out, but the exhaust was broken and they
had to move Higgins to a white Peugeot,'' Daoud said.
   ``This (second) car collided with a truck loaded with oranges
southeast of Tyre. The kidnappers then moved Higgins to a red
Mercedes and fled to their unknown hideout,'' Daoud added.
   ``These snags cost the kidnappers about 1{ hours, during which
we managed to seal off all exits from Tyre region south of the
Litani River,'' Daoud said.
   He said the mastermind had sent four other brown Volvo cars
speeding through several neighboring villages.
   ``He wanted to shake off any pursuers. However, the accidents
gave us the needed time to seal off the area,'' Daoud said.
   ``I am 60 percent certain that Higgins is still south of the
Litani. It is very difficult for them to smuggle him out on foot
through the valleys. Nevertheless, we're keeping this in mind,'' he
added.
   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel today said: ``We are maintaining
road checks and heavy emphasis on collection of information. We
believe he is probably still south of the Litani,'' Goksel said.
   In Washington, President Reagan said Thursday that the United
States will not withdraw Americans from the U.N. observer group,
despite the abduction. Fifteen other nations contribute to the unit.
   In its type-written Arabic statement, the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth said Higgins is ``one of the biggest spies
planting daily terror in our land.''
   The statement was delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut,
accompanied by photocopies of two identity cards of Higgins.
   The group, believed made up of Shiite zealots, previously has
claimed responsibility for hijackings, bombings and the abduction
of 12 Lebanese Jews. It has claimed to have killed eight of the
Jews kidnapped in 1984.

   The Soviets' top arms control official said his
country is counting on Secretary of State George P. Shultz to
arrive ready to explore new initiatives in U.S.-Soviet disarmament
talks.
   Viktor Karpov, a former arms negotiator who now heads the Soviet
Foreign Ministry's arms control department, said late Friday that
Shultz's visit, which begins Sunday, ``must set the pace for
further Soviet-U.S. dialogue.''
   During the U.S. official's three-day visit, he is scheduled to
talk with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top Soviet officials about
a proposed agreement to cut the superpowers' long-range nuclear
missiles by 50 percent.
   The talks follow the Dec. 8 signing of a treaty to ban
superpower medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan in Washington.
   In a special panel of the Supreme Soviet parliament earlier
Friday, two Red Army officials said that ratification of the Dec. 8
treaty could save the Soviet Union more than $80 million and would
free ``tens of thousands'' of soldiers from their present duties.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the military chief of staff, and
Maj. Gen. Vladimir I. Medvedev were among top officials who spoke
before the panel, which is considering ratification of the pact.
   Those who spoke at the hearing at the Kremlin endorsed the
treaty, but Akhromeyev said the Soviet military is worried about
NATO moves to compensate for the weapons slated for destruction by
the pact.
   ``The idea of compensation is wild,'' said the first deputy
foreign minister, Yuli M. Vorontsov. ``A doctor who operates on a
person to cure him of an ulcer does not then say, `What can I put
in to compensate for the ulcer?'''
   On Feb. 9, the foreign relations commissions of the two houses
of the Soviet legislature created a special 10-member subcommittee
to seek the opinion of experts and ordinary Soviet citizens about
the treaty.
   The treaty must be ratified by the Supreme Soviet's Presidium to
become law. But because it already has been approved by the ruling
Communist Party Politburo, passage is assured.
   Friday's two-hour hearing seemed designed to assuage the fears
of some Soviets that their leaders made too many concessions in the
treaty. A small group of foreign reporters was allowed to attend.
   ``Those against are few,'' said chairman Georgy M. Korniyenko,
summing up Soviet public opinion. ``Those who are against just
don't trust the imperialists ... but then there are not a few who
have concerns.''
   Under the pact, the Soviet Union must destroy 1,752 missiles,
compared with 859 for the United States.
   But Akhromeyev said that under the agreement, the Soviets will
eliminate 650 modern medium-range missiles, while the Americans
will destroy 689 new weapons, he said.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and other NATO officials
have said the West needs to modernize its battlefield nuclear
weapons or improve its conventional arms to make up for the banned
missiles.
   Akhromeyev said there was ``not a word'' in the INF treaty that
would bar such measures.
   Akromeyev said 3 percent to 4 percent of the ``tens of
thousands'' of military men to be released from their duty with the
missiles would be put on pension, but that younger men could
continue with their military careers.
   Medvedev told the panel that missiles and other Soviet military
equipment worth $33 million to $41.5 million would be destroyed
because of the treaty.
   He said the Soviet Union would save $83 million, and that
military equipment used for the missiles that does not have to be
destroyed is worth $250 million.
   The subcommittee adjourned without a date set for its next
session. The panel will report back to the Supreme Soviet's foreign
relations commissions, which must recommend whether the treaty
should be ratified.

   A strong earthquake rattled across
central and northern California early today, causing minor damage
in this agricultural town and shaking people awake over a wide
area, officials said. No injuries were reported.
   The quake measured 5.1 on the Richter scale, said Anthony Lomax,
spokesman for the seismology laboratory at the University of
California, Berkeley.
   He said the strong quake struck at 12:40 a.m. about seven miles
southeast of Hollister, a quake-prone city some 75 miles southeast
of San Francisco.
   In Hollister, the tremor knocked products off store shelves,
broke a glass door and set off burglar alarms across the city, said
Paul Penn, emergency services coordinator for San Benito County.
   But no injuries were reported, and power was not interrupted, he
said.
   ``San Benito County is known as one of the more seismically
active counties in the country, so you get used to it,'' Penn
added. ``The last major one was Superbowl Sunday 1986.''
   People living over a broad area reported feeling strong earth
movement, with jittery residents in Modesto, San Francisco, and
Monterey calling authorities for reassurance.
   ``I was standing in a sturdy old building when I felt the ground
begin to rumble, and lights began shaking,'' said Gordon Bock, a
Time magazine staff writer experiencing his first earthquake.
   ``I'm from New York. I've only read about these things,'' said
Bock, who was in Asilomar, near Monterey, when the temblor hit.
``My stomach is churning and my hands are still shaking.''

   The air force carried out a
revenge attack on two SWAPO guerrilla bases in Angola this morning,
retaliating for a bank bombing that killed 18 people in Namibia,
the defense force chief said.
   Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys said air force fighter aircraft
successfully carried out attacks on South-West African People's
Organization targets in Lubango and Ongiva in southern Angola.
   He said the attacks were in retaliation Friday's bombing of the
First National Bank in Oshakati, South-West Africa, where 18 people
were killed and 31 injured.
   Geldenhuys said SWAPO, which has been fighting for 22 years
against South African occupation of the territory, also known as
Namibia, was responsible for the lunch-hour bomb.
   A statement Friday from the SWAPO office in Luanda, Angola,
denied involvement in the bombing, and said it was part of a South
African propaganda campaign to ``smear the name of SWAPO.''
   The guerrillas fight in South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, from bases in southern Angola that periodically are raided
by the South African Defense Force.
   Eight Mirage fighters took part in the attack on two targets
near Lubango, 186 miles north of the Namibian-Angolan border; and
five Impala aircraft attacked targets at Ongiva, 26 miles north of
the border, the statement said.
   Geldenhuys said the Lubango targets were ``SWAPO's most
important training center in Angola, the Tobias Hainyeko Training
Center, and a terrorist holding area about 10 kms (6.2 miles) west
of there.''
   He said SWAPO guerrillas receive training in the handling of
explosives at the Tobias Hainyeko Center, which he said, ``can be
regarded as the breeding ground for terrorism against the
inhabitants of South-West Africa-Namibia.''
   SWAPO had launched a number of raids from Ongiva recently on
civilians in South-West Africa, the general said.
   ``By these attacks the security forces demonstrated their
willingness never to allow SWAPO terrorism to go unpunished,''
Geldenhuys said. ``Terrorists will be tracked down and destroyed.''
   Friday's bank blast was the deadliest in 22 years of war between
the black guerrillas and the minority white government of South
Africa.
   Among the dead in the blast in the far-northern town of Oshakati
were 10 women, three men and a child. All the victims were black,
except for one white woman who was identified today in a
pro-government newspaper as the wife of a member of a special
police unit.
   Four of the bodies were discovered in the rubble Friday night,
said The Citizen newspaper.
   Of the 31 people injured, 20 of them were black, said an army
spokesman, Cmdt. Lieb Bester.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast,
which destroyed the bank building. Five people were injured when an
explosion occurred in the street near the same bank a year ago.
   Chris Ball, managing director of the First National Bank, flew
to Windhoek to visit the scene Friday afternoon. He called the
bombing ``a barbarous and senseless attack on the community of
Oshakati, achieving nothing.''
   All those killed were civilians, Bester said. Most were believed
to be local government employees who had just been paid.
   A police inspector, Keirie Du Rand, said about 55 pounds of
plastic explosive was used in the blast, which occurred shortly
before 1 p.m. He said a fire raged for several hours after the
explosion, hampering police access to the scene.
   Oshakati is in north-central Namibia, about 25 miles south of
the Angolan border. It is home to the largest military base in the
region, a staging point for South Africa's current military
intervention in Angola's civil war.
   SWAPO has claimed responsibility for numerous previous bombings
in the territory, including a blast last month at a store at a
military base in Windhoek.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached To Keep Post Alive</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to fix spelling of ``Murdoch;'' SUBS 7th graf,
``Kalikow agreed ...,'' to restore dropped word `less.'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE ROTHENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The New York Post, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily, gained a new lease on life today with
approval by its unions of $22 million in concessions.
   Owner Rupert Murdoch had said unless he was given $24 million in
concessions he would close the paper. But he contributed $3 million
to the deal, calling it a farewell gift.
   The agreement clears the way for Murdock to complete a $37
million sale of the financially troubled tabloid, founded in 1801
by Alexander Hamilton, to real estate developer Peter Kalikow.
   The agreement was reached at 1:50 a.m. after nearly 16 hours of
bargaining.
   ``I want to say at this time that I wish Mr. Kalikow great,
successful publishing of the New York Post,'' Murdoch said in
announcing the agreement. ``I ... hate to leave it.''
   While Murdoch had said the paper would close unless he obtained
the concessions, he agreed to stop the clock as negotiations
continued past his 2 p.m. Friday deadline.
   Kalikow agreed to a package that would save $2 million less than
originally sought on condition the unions agreed to all other
terms, according to Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for both Kalikow
and Murdoch.
   Under the agreement, Kalikow would save $10 million in the first
year, $8 million in the second and $6 million in the third, minus a
$2 million bonus in the final year, said Theodore Kheel, an adviser
to the unions.
   In each of the three years, Kalikow saves $7.5 million through
employee buyouts and $2.5 million through employee pay cuts, Kheel
said. In all, 130 jobs from a work force of 1,200 will be
eliminated.
   However, in the first year employees will not lose anything
because Murdoch will give them $2.5 million to restore the pay
cuts, he added.
   In the second year, Kalikow is to restore $2 million of the pay
cuts and Murdoch make up the difference with $500,000. Kalikow
agreed to provide $4 million in raises and $2 million in bonuses in
the third year, Kheel said.
   ``I don't think there's any question that without Murdoch's
contribution of $3 million, the paper would have definitely shut
down,'' Kheel said.
   Kheel said Murdoch referred to the $3 million contribution as a
farewell gift.
   Union leader George McDonald thanked Murdoch for the $3 million.
   The unions achieved their goal ``to save our jobs for our people
and our families,'' said McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council, an umbrella group for Post unions.
   The agreement, to take effect March 7, is subject to
verification by Kalikow's auditors and union ratification, but
Murdoch said those were only formalities.
   Murdoch said of Kalikow: ``He's a very ambitious man, as well as
being a wealthy one. I know that he is determined to make it (the
newspaper) successful.''
   The Post faced financial problems from its earliest years but
held on as paper after paper in the city merged, then shut down.
   Murdoch bought the afternoon tabloid, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily, from Dorothy Schiff in 1976 for about
$31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings from
Australia and England into the United States.
   Under Murdoch, the paper turned from liberal to conservative on
the editorial page, became splashy and at times racy.
   His efforts failed to turn the paper around. Murdoch says he has
lost nearly $150 million in 11 years of operating the Post. He said
Friday that current losses were running $100,000 a day.
   Earlier this month, Murdoch announced he had reached agreement
to sell the Post to Kalikow.
   The sale was prompted by congressional action late last year
that blocked the Federal Communication Commission from granting him
another waiver to its rule against owning a newspaper and TV
station in the same market. Murdoch also owns WNYW-TV in New York.
   In Boston, where he faces the same situation, Murdoch has
indicated he'd sell his TV station and hold on to the Boston Herald.

   A moderately strong earthquake today shook the
mountains of the Soviet Central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan, but
no injuries or damage were reported, the official Soviet news
agency Tass said.
   The tremor occurred at 4:50 a.m. Moscow time (8:50 p.m. EST
Friday) and was centered 99 miles east of the republic's capital,
Dushanbe, Tass said.
   It said the Dushanbe seismic station measured the magnitude of
the earthquake at 5 on the Soviet scale. The Soviet scale measures
observable effects of an earthquake.
   Tadzhikistan, with an area of 55,240 square miles, is known for
farming and cattle ranching. Rich deposits of coal, lead and zinc
also are found in the republic, whose 1981 population was 3.4
million.
   It borders Afghanistan and China.

   One person was killed and 14 people were
taken to a hospital after a fire broke out today in two cars of an
Amtrak train near here, authorities said.
   The fire aboard the California Zephyr was reported around 3 a.m.
and was under control by 4:30 a.m., said Fire Chief Jim Mitera.
   It was unclear whether the fatality was a crew member or a
passenger, Mitera said. He said the injured apparently suffered
either smoke inhalation or burns.
   Passengers aboard the train saw thick smoke coming from the
train, according to passenger Vicki Miller of Omaha. The smoke
appeared to be coming from crew cars just in front of the passenger
sleeping cars, she said.
   Police reported two cars were burning, said Bryce Wellnitz, a
dispatcher with the Nebraska State Patrol in Lincoln.
   Amtrak crew members disconnected the two cars and the Zephyr,
which travels from Chicago to Oakland, Calif., continued on its
route.
   Investigators did not know where the fire started or what may
have caused it, Mitera said.
   The Red Cross set up a shelter in the Hastings city auditorium,
Wellnitz said. Hastings, a town of about 18,000, is in southeast
Nebraska.
   A call to Amtrak's office in Omaha reached an official who
refused to give his name or comment on the fire.

   Soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian
demonstrator today in the West Bank town of Ramallah during a march
on the municipal building, the Arab-run Palestine Press Service and
hospital sources said.
   A spokesman for the Israeli army could not immediately confirm
the death.
   The Palestinian news agency identified the victim as Abdullah
Atta Abdullah, 20, and said he was shot in the head.
   It said Abdullah was one of several hundred demonstrators
demanding the resignation of the municipal council of Ramallah,
which is 10 miles north of Jerusalem.
   Sources at a hospital at Ramallah, who spoke on condition they
not be identified, said Abdullah was shot in the forehead.
   The army command said Israeli troops clashed with 200 Moslem
worshipers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron in the occupied
West Bank.
   Moslems and Jews both believe the site is the burial place of
the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and three of their
four wives.
   Arabs spread prayer rugs on the floor and began to pray Friday
during Jewish services in a chamber normally used at different
hours as a place of worship by Jews and Arabs.
   The site attracts Jewish and Moslem religious fundamentalists
and has been a constant source of friction since Israel captured
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war.
   An army spokeswoman said soldiers ordered the Moslem worshipers
out of the hall and used force, but not gunfire or tear gas, to
evict them when they refused.
   The Arabs attacked the soldiers, the spokeswoman said on
condition of anonymity in keeping with army regulations.
   By U.N. count and not including today's reported death, 55 Arabs
have been killed by Israelis since protests began in the occupied
territories Dec. 8.
   In other developments on Friday:
   _Israeli soldiers tangled with Palestinian protesters in Nablus
and in the Gaza Strip, but no casualties were reported.
   _Military sources denied charges by Neil Kinnock, head of
Britain's Labor Party, that Israeli troops were using dumdum
bullets against Arab protesters. Dumdum bullets expand explosively
when they hit a target, causing greater damage.
   _Fayez Abu Rahmeh, one of six Palestinians reportedly favored to
meet U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Israel next week,
said he would cancel the meeting if ordered to do so by the
Palestinian Liberation Organization.
   In Nablus, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, hundreds of protesters
waved Palestinian flags, brandished photographs of PLO chief Yasser
Arafat, and chanted slogans.
   They moved toward Israeli troops at the exits of the old city,
throwing stones, bricks and bottles. Soldiers retaliated with tear
gas and chased youths through the streets.
   At Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, hundreds of people
demonstrated after prayers, carrying Palestinian flags and throwing
rocks.
   The army command denied Palestinian reports that soldiers used
tear gas and clubs to disperse the protesters at Jabaliya.
   In Gaza City, protesters threw stones and burned tires. Shati
refugee camp remained under curfew imposed by the army last week.
   Kinnock, in Israel on a visit, made the charge about dumdum
bullets at a news conference Friday. He said he saw X-rays of a
wound which ``showed shattering of the bone and flesh consistent
with the use of an explosive bullet.'' At another point he said the
injury was consistent with ``the wound inflicted by a dumdum
bullet.''
   The comment by Abu Rahmeh, a Palestinian leader from the Gaza
Strip, to The Associated Press came after the outlawed PLO issued a
statement Friday.
   The statement said the visit, and a new peace initiative
promoted by Shultz, were aimed ``at liquidating the Palestinian
cause and the heroic uprising'' in the occupied lands. It said no
Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories would meet Shultz
on his visit.
   Abu Rahmeh said: ``I must obey the (PLO) request, whatever it
is.''
   Earlier, he said he would urge Shultz ``to agree to the
convening of an international peace conference and help the parties
reach a settlement between themselves.''
   The PLO backs an international peace conference if it includes
an independent PLO delegation.
   Israel's two main parties, the right-wing Likud and centrist
Labor Party are split over the convening of a peace conference but
united in their refusal to negotiate with the PLO.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Attorney General Edwin Meese III
said Saturday that Meese received no money or benefit from a
reported $150,000 payment to two close Meese associates in
connection with promotion of an Iraqi pipeline project.
   The attorney, James Rocap, said he was aware of the payment but
that ``it has absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Meese.''
   Swiss businessman Bruce Rappaport sent the money in mid-1985 to
Franklyn Chinn, Meese's former investment adviser, and E. Bob
Wallach, a close friend of Meese for more than 30 years, according
to sources familiar with independent prosecutor James McKay's
investigation of Meese.
   Rappaport was enlisted by the San Francisco-based Bechtel Group,
which was seeking to build the project.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted Wallach
as saying the money from Rappaport represented his legal fee for
his work on the pipeline proposal, including getting Meese's help
to set up a meeting for Rappaport in June 1985 with then-national
security adviser Robert C. McFarlane.
   Rocap characterized as ``not a big deal'' the fact that Wallach
had been paid a fee through Rappaport and that the $150,000 had
been deposited in a trust account with Chinn.
   ``Ed Meese never got any money from the pipeline project or from
Bruce Rappaport. He never got any money from Bob Wallach with the
exception of a few lunches,'' said Rocap.
   The lawyer said that the only money Meese got through his
partnership with Chinn was the previously disclosed stock profits
that Chinn earned for the attorney general through various stock
trades.
   The Washington Post reported Saturday that the payment was not
included on Wallach's 1985 income tax return and was not reported
by him until May 1987, when McKay expanded his investigation of the
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. to include Meese's dealings with
Wallach and Chinn.
   A federal indictment in New York accused Wallach and Chinn and a
third man of taking illegal payments from Wedtech to influence
Meese.
   Rappaport hired Wallach in 1985 to try to drum up U.S. support
for the proposed 540-mile pipeline through Jordan that would run
close to Israeli territory. The pipeline never was built.

<HEAD>Reagan Urges Congress To Forget Election-Year Spending Pressure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan today asked Congress to ward
off election year pressure for increased spending and enact the
$1.1 trillion budget presented earlier in the week.
   ``If Congress upholds its commitments and stands firm against
pressures for increased spending _ pressures that reach a peak
during election years _ solid results will be forthcoming,'' Reagan
said in his weekly radio speech.
   ``If our proposed budget is enacted, deficit spending will have
dropped from $221 billion in fiscal year 1986 to $130 billion in
fiscal year 1989,'' the president said.
   He said consultations between Congress and the White House
before the budget submission _ which both branches have hailed as a
method of avoiding budget fights as in previous years _
demonstrates ``responsible leadership expected by the electorate.''
   Reagan said the budget will ``keep the lid'' on spending, while
recognizing that some increases are needed to avoid jeopardizing
national security.
   He repeated his criticism of last year's budget process, saying
late amendments to the spending bill required him to sign a package
without the review it should have been granted, or face shutdown of
the federal government.
   With the new budget, he said, ``we have an opportunity to put
our fiscal house in order.''
   Reagan also repeated his assertion that his administration has
presided over the biggest economic expansion since World War II and
once again hailed his administration's record on employment.

   William Paley, the 86-year-old founder and
chairman of CBS Inc., remained in critical condition Saturday after
undergoing emergency gall bladder surgery more than a week ago.
   A spokeswoman for New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said
that Paley was in critical but stable condition.
   On Friday, another spokeswoman, Diana Goldin, said Paley was
``off the respirator and recuperating well from emergency abdominal
surgery performed 10 days ago, but is being treated for
pre-existing pulmonary and renal conditions aggravated by this
recent illness.''
   The hospital said that Paley was receiving kidney dialysis.
   He had been in critical condition since undergoing surgery on
Feb. 11.
   Paley bought a fledling radio station in 1928 and built it into
the Columbia Broadcasting System. In 1983, he stepped down as
chairman, but made a comeback in 1986 with Loew's Corp.'s chairman
Lawrence Tisch after he became disenchanted with company policies.

   Police across the country detained at
least seven top opposition activists in an apparent effort to
prevent a weekend Solidarity meeting from convening, opposition
spokesmen said today.
   Among those reported held were two prominent figures in the
outlawed trade union federation who were removed by officers from a
car also carrying Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa.
   Walesa, interviewed by telephone from his home in Gdansk, said
union spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz and Gdansk regional Solidarity
leader Bogdan Lis were taken from his car shortly after noon, but
he was left alone.
   ``We have reforms by (means of) arresting,'' Walesa said
sarcastically. ``This is something well known to communist
authorities.''
   Also reported held was Zbigniew Bujak, Warsaw-region Solidarity
leader who was the union's underground chief after the imposition
of martial law in December 1981.
   He was detained at the Warsaw train station before he could
board a train to Gdansk to attend a meeting of the Solidarity
National Executive Commission, said the Rev. Henryk Jankowski, an
adviser to Walesa.
   Jankowski initially reported that Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron
was detained at the same time. But Warsaw opposition spokesmen said
later that Jankowski was mistaken and Kuron had not been held.
   Solidarity regional leaders from Krakow, Lublin, Bydgoszcz and
Wroclaw also were reported detained.
   Commission meetings are not announced in advance, and neither
Walesa nor Jankowski would not state the reason for the meeting in
the Baltic port.
   However Solidarity, which has remained active despite its being
banned in 1982, is known to be evaluating its strategy in the face
of steep price increases imposed Feb. 1.
   The increases have caused widespread discontent, but no major
unrest. Past price increases have triggered violence as well as the
strikes that spawned Solidarity in August 1980.
   Jankowski, who spoke by telephone from Gdansk, said 19 people
were detained nationwide, but there were contradictory reports from
other opposition sources.
   A spokesman in the government press office, Zbigniew
Augustynowicz, said he had no immediate comment on the reports but
would look into them.
   Authorities in Poland often use brief detentions to block
illegal meetings. Since a 1986 amnesty, no one has been held more
than 48 hours solely on political charges.
   Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, a regional leader of Solidarity in the
southwestern city of Wroclaw, was detained Friday evening by a
group of uniformed and plainclothes police, said his wife, Krystyna.
   Police later telephoned their home and said without explanation
that Frasyniuk was being held for 48 hours, she said.
   It was not known if Frasyniuk, who is also a member of
Solidarity's executive commission, had planned to attend the
meeting in Gdansk. However, he was to attend a meeting Sunday of a
banned farmers' group, Rural Solidarity, in southeastern Poland.
   Another executive commission member, Stanislaw Weglarz, was
detained Friday in his home city of Lublin, in eastern Poland, said
opposition spokesman Janusz Winiarski.
   Stefan Jurczak, an executive commission member from near Krakow,
also was detained Friday, another opposition source said.
   Briefly detained was Janusz Stepniak, from near Lublin, a leader
of Rural Solidarity, said Winiarski, who said Stepniak was warned
against attending the Rural Solidarity meeting in Rzeszow.
   The Provisional National Council of Rural Solidarity, an
farmers' union modeled on the Soviet bloc's first and only
independent labor federation, has called a national meeting of
farmers to mark the seventh anniversary of the 1981
Rzeszow-Ustrzyki agreements.
   In those accords, the government officially recognized Rural
Solidarity.
   After the imposition of martial law, Rural Solidarity was
banned, although some members have continued their activities.

   A regional ice cream company has won a
trademark victory over giant McDonald's Corp., which claimed a
frozen milkshake called ``Quick Thaw McStraw'' was too much like
its own trademarks.
   ``It's not often that the little guy wins over a Fortune 500
company,'' said Dennis Roney, president and chief executive officer
of Oberweis Dairy Inc., parent company of Roney Ice Cream Co.
   Roney announced Friday that it has won a five-year trademark
dispute with McDonald's.
   The Roney company, which makes ice cream and ice milk in this
Chicago suburb, filed in December 1983 for a trademark registration
for ``Quick Thaw McStraw.''
   The name was a variation on Hannah-Barbera Productions' Quick
Draw McGraw, and the Hollywood animator gave the company permission
to use the name, with limitations, Roney said.
   McDonald's opposed the registration, arguing that consumers
would be confused by the use of McStraw when it had so many
trademarks using `Mc' or `Mac', Roney said. McDonald's, based in
suburban Oak Brook, also argued that the Roney frozen shake was
similar to its own products.
   The Department of Commerce's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board
ruled in favor of the ice cream maker.
   McDonald's spokesman Chuck Rubner said the comnpany may appeal.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio broadcast:
   My fellow Americans, this week I transmitted to Congress our
proposed budget for 1989. This budget fulfills the second year
obligations of a bipartisan agreement I hammered out last November
with the leaders of Congress.
   We then, after arduous negotiations, agreed on a plan to reduce
federal deficit spending by over $75 billion in two years. If
Congress upholds its commitments and stands firm against pressures
for increased spending _ pressures that reached a peak during
election years _ solid results will be forthcoming, and progress
has already been made.
   If our proposed budget is enacted, deficit spending will have
dropped from $221 billion in Fiscal Year 1986 to $130 billion in
Fiscal Year 1989. As a proportion of gross national product, it
will have been cut by more than half since 1983.
   The legislative and executive branches, by living up to our
commitments of last November, are demonstrating the kind of
responsible leadership expected by the electorate. The budget we've
transmitted is true to that spirit.
   It reduces the level of deficit spending, while at the same
time, holds the line against any general tax increase. It remains
firm in our commitments to essential domestic programs. It also
includes funding for the minimum defense program needed to keep our
country safe and necessary to honor our commitments to our friends
and allies.
   Anything less would not only jeopardize our national security,
but also dim prospects for further negotiated agreements with our
adversaries.
   We've proposed a trim budget that keeps the lid on spending, and
yet still recognizes that some increases are justified. For
example, we're actually calling for Congress to spend substantially
more on education, combating AIDS, the war against drugs, and
improving air safety, while keeping discretionary domestic spending
within predetermined limits.
   The long-term solution to the plague of deficit spending,
however, is not prudence this year or next. What's needed is reform
that will bring discipline and accountability to the budget process.
   Exemplifying the shortcomings, last year the federal budget was
slapped together into a single behemoth bill and delivered to me
hours before the federal government was due to run out of money. I
was faced with the decision to either sign without time for careful
consideration or see the federal government shut down.
   I pledged during the State of the Union, after plopping down 43
pounds of paper sent to me by Congress, that I would never sign
another catchall continuing resolution. I'm pleased that at least
34 Senators and a good number of Congressmen, including many in the
leadership, have indicated that they, too, do not want a repeat of
last year's budget mayhem.
   Make no mistake, we have the opportunity to put our fiscal house
in order and to reform the budget process. We've proven time and
again that by working together, partisanship can be put aside and
progress can be made when the national interest is at stake.
   It took co-operation from both sides of the aisle. For example,
to put in place an economic recovery program that has given this
country the longest peacetime expansion in history, inflation and
interest rates have been kept down. Family income is up. And we
created over 15 million new jobs since the recovery began. Being
mindful of the suffering that comes with unemployment, that last
figure is a matter of particular pride for me. And as our economy
is grown, unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since 1979.
But that statement doesn't come near to describing the success
we've enjoyed.
   Today, more people have jobs and a higher percentage of our work
force is employed than ever before. Since the recovery began, we've
created more new jobs than in all of Western Europe and Japan
combined. And even the meaning of unemployment figures is sometimes
not fully understood.
   Our 7 million unemployed citizens are often thought of as people
who have lost their jobs, as they're sometimes described in the
media. In fact, less than half of the unemployed are job losers.
Fifty-five percent are new entrants, mainly young people looking
for their first jobs, re-entrants _ individuals who left the work
force, perhaps to raise a family and are now seeking to get back in
_ or job-leavers who've voluntarily left their jobs to change
locations or occupations.
   We, of course, need to remain concerned about each and every
citizen who is seeking work, and should not be satisfied until
everyone who wants a job _ a good job _ has one.
   One person enduring the pressures and frustrations of
unemployment is too many. That is why responsible federal spending
and taxing policies _ policies that foster growth and expand
opportunities for all our citizens _ are so important. That is what
the budget that I have just sent to Congress is all about.
   Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.

   Most people in the first coach car of an
Amtrak train were trying to sleep in the wee hours of Saturday
morning when the California Zephyr pulled into the small station
here to pick up passengers.
   The quiet was shattered by the sound of sirens, but no one knew

   There were no crew members in sight. One woman in our group,
which was headed for a ski trip in Winter Park, Colo., went to
investigate. She returned to tell us calmly that there was a fire
in a nearby car.
   It didn't sound serious, and jokes were tossed around while
passengers in the car began to stir.
   We remained in the car, wondering if it was safe, reassuring
each other that we would be warned of trouble.
   Minutes later, a woman crew member ran through the coach, her
face blackened with soot. She dashed outside and then returned,
saying she'd barely escaped from the crew car where the fire
apparently began.
   Chattering with cold, she said she had no shoes and that her
feet were cold. Outside it was about 31 degrees.
   The woman left, but returned quickly to ask passengers for
blankets. Her voice was panicky as she told us people outside the
train needed them.
   I glanced out the window and saw smoke billowing from the crew
car two cars ahead. Soon the faint smell of smoke drifted into our
car and we decided it was time to get out.
   As we left the train, it became apparent that the fire was
serious. Some crew members, blankets drapped over their shoulders,
appeared dazed. One man sat bent over on the steps leading to the
upper deck of our coach car. Others were visibly shaken.
   Outside was a maze of fire trucks, hoses and rescue vehicles.
Firefighters on ladders attempted to cut into the crew car's
windows with power tools.
   Emergency personnel and volunteers carried stretchers to
ambulances. An Amtrak employee yelled to firefighters that he
thought there were still people inside the car.
   Soon, more people were helped from the car. Many were dressed in
bedclothes, and some men were bare-chested.
   By the time a spokesman announced that the train would proceed
without the crew car and sleeper car, our group of six had decided
to bail out of our weekend trip. We hitched a ride across town in
the back of an ambulance, with another vehicle toting our gear.
   We turned our hopes from fresh powder to finding a rental car;
after we got the last one in town, my companions headed back home.
   One person was dead, others were hurt. My traveling companions
kept asking, ``Why weren't we told whether we were in danger or
were safe?''

<HEAD>Arizona's Acting Governor Says She's Learning the Ropes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting Gov. Rose Mofford is getting high
marks in her role as temporary chief executive from many
legislators but not from the man she replaced, impeached Gov. Evan
Mecham.
   Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat and Arizona's longtime secretary of
state, became acting governor Feb. 5 when Mecham, a Republican, was
impeached by the House. She moved into the governor's office and
will remain acting governor until the Senate reaches a verdict.
   ``My lifestyle has changed,'' Mrs. Mofford, 65, told a group of
mayors Friday, saying she's switched her bedtime reading to
subjects like the state budget or Arizona's Medicaid alternative
program.
   When Mecham was impeached he was considered legally ``disabled''
and Mrs. Mofford assumed all of his gubernatorial powers, including
the right to sign bills and hire or fire state employees.
   Mrs. Mofford brought in her own volunteer staff and replaced one
state agency head _ Department of Administration Director Max
Hawkins, who drafted Mecham into the 1986 gubernatorial race and
was widely blamed for many of Mecham's problems. She also accepted
the resignation of Mecham's controversial Washington lobbyist, Fred
Craft.
   That angered Mecham, who has moved his own staff to an office
building in suburban Glendale. In a letter to Mrs. Mofford last
week, he complained that she was ``turning a temporary acting
governorship into a complete disruption and replacement of my
administration.''
   ``May I ask you to recognize that I have only been accused and
not convicted of any act,'' Mecham said, adding that he expects to
be cleared and return to the governorship.
   Mrs. Mofford replied to Mecham, ``I am responsible for acting as
the chief executive of this state ... I did not ask for this job,
but I intend to discharge it to the best of my ability during these
difficult times.''
   Lawmakers say they generally are pleased with the work of Mrs.
Mofford, who many had hoped would act mainly as caretaker.
   ``Mrs. Mofford addresses problems in a calm, deliberate
manner,'' said Rep. Jim Skelly, a conservative Republican who
headed the House select committee on Mecham's impeachment. ``That's
a change. She's not going off half-cocked.''
   ``Haven't you noticed? There's a different air in state
government,'' said Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a
Democrat. ``People aren't looking for the next bomb to drop.''
   Mecham faces a Feb. 29 impeachment trial on allegations that he
concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, misused $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership, and
that he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat
by a state official.
   He is also scheduled for a March 9 criminal trial on six felony
counts in connection with the $350,000 loan.
   If Mecham is convicted in court or by the Senate, Mrs. Mofford
becomes governor in her own right.
   However, that would raise a new series of questions if it
occurred before the May 17 recall election. Attorney General Bob
Corbin has issued a non-binding opinion saying that if Mecham
resigns or is removed before the recall, Mrs. Mofford would be
subject to removal from office in the recall vote.
   Rep. Gary Giordano, a Republican who opposed Mecham's
impeachment, said he realized Mrs. Mofford was entitled to her own
staff, but added, ``I don't think she had a particular mandate to
bring in the Babbitt administration.''
   Many of Mrs. Mofford's volunteer aides had worked for former
Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat.
   But House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, a Democrat, said he
believes Mrs. Mofford is handling the job wisely.
   ``It's ticklish and it's difficult and it's like no other chief
executive in this state has ever found themselves in,'' Hamilton
said.
   Mrs. Mofford pleased Democrats and angered some Republicans when
she said one of her top priorities would be to seek creation of a
Martin Luther King state holiday. Mecham created a storm of
controversy in January 1986 when he canceled a holiday for state
workers on grounds it was illegally declared by Babbitt through
executive order.
   Otherwise, there has been little controversy over her policies,
including her statement that a tax increase probably would be
needed to balance Arizona's budget.
   ``I don't know all the problems that are facing us,'' Mrs.
Mofford acknowledged Friday. ``I know that there are criticisms out
there, but I don't think that that will be the last time that I
will ever be criticized.''

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek Cypriots vote Sunday in the second
and decisive round of the most heated presidential election since
Cyprus won independence from Britain 28 years ago.
   The outcome is wide open in the race between veteran right-wing
leader Glafcos Clerides and political newcomer George Vassiliou.
   The candidates, left in the race after they took the top two
spots in the first round of voting last Sunday, held their final
mass rallies in Nicosia Friday night and fired verbal broadsides at
each other.
   Clerides, 68, topped last Sunday's poll with 33.32 percent of
the vote by the 363,000-strong electorate. Vassiliou, 56, a
millionaire businessman backed by the powerful Communist Party,
Akel, polled 30.11 percent.
   On paper, Vassiliou goes into Sunday's showdown ballot in the
strongest position after the small socialist party, which polled
9.4 percent, announced it will back him.
   But Sunday's ballot was thrown wide open after President Spyros
Kyprianou, eliminated in the first-round vote, refused to back
either of the frontrunners.
   Kyprianou, leader of the centrist Democratic Party, Diko, was
seeking a third five-year term. He took 27.29 percent last Sunday.
   He told the 91,000 Greek Cypriots who voted for him that they
can back anyone they want.
   Tens of thousands of flag-waving Greek Cypriots, many bused in
from other areas, attended Friday's rallies, held within 500 yards
of each other in central Nicosia, jamming streets for hours.
   Both candidates stressed that Sunday's poll will be the most
crucial since the island became independent in 1960.
   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when the Turkish army
invaded to seized the northern third of the island, forcing about
180,000 Greek Cypriots to flee to the south.
   Turkish Cypriots declared their own republic in the north in
1983. Turkey is the only country to recognize it.
   The partition of the island, and stalled efforts to reunite the
rival communities, has been the dominant issue in the election.
Bread and butter issues have taken a back seat.
   Clerides and Vassiliou have taken a more conciliatory attitude
toward reviving negotiations than Kyprianou, a hardliner who has
been widely blamed for blocking U.N. efforts to establish a
federation.
   Kyprianou said he would resume negotiations with the Turkish
side when it withdrew its 35,000 troops from northern Cyprus along
with the 65,000 settlers Turkey shipped from the mainland.
   Clerides and Vassiliou have said they are willing to resume
talks without such preconditions.
   The Turks invaded, ostensibly to protect the Turkish Cypriot
minority, after militant Greek Cypriots staged a short-lived coup
seeking to unite the island with Greece.
   That coup forced the president at the time, Archbishop Makarios,
to flee the country. Clerides, who was then president of
Parliament, stood in until Makarios returned in December 1974.
   Clerides has sought to attract wide support by pledging to form
an all-party government of national unity to enter into talks with
the Turkish Cypriots.
   To strengthen his strategy, Clerides announced during a
televised debate Thursday night that he was resigning as leader of
his Democratic Rally Party to go into Sunday's ballot as an
independent.
   Vassiliou rejected that as an electoral ploy, pointing out that
the other three parties have rejected Clerides's coalition proposal
as unworkable.
   The two frontrunners, who had concentrated on knocking Kyprianou
out in the first round, have spent the last week slamming each
other.
   Vassiliou accuses Clerides of harboring the extremists involved
in the 1974 coup and of being a ``right-wing, anti-labor
reactionary.''
   The conservative leader has rejected the charges and accuses
Vassiliou of being a communist pawn.

<BYLINE>Community-Based AIDS Drug Tests Get Support From Presidential
Commission
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People with AIDS who have begun their own trials
of experimental AIDS drugs found support for their efforts Saturday
from members of the President's AIDS commission.
   ``The most exciting aspect of this project is that it originates
from the AIDS community, empowering ourselves to participate in the
research that may save our lives and dramatically expand the number
of patients who have access to experimental drugs,'' said Thomas
Hannon, administrative director of the Community Research
Initiative in New York.
   The project uses private physicians and their patients to test
ways of preventing development of full-blown acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, he said.
   While AIDS drug trials are usually done by government,
universities and drug companies, the community based project will
include areas of reseach that might otherwise be neglected, he said.
   Several members of the Presidential Commission on the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic voiced support for the project
after Hannon testified at a commission hearing.
   ``I think what you're doing is introducing an element of
competition into the realm of what to do abut the AIDS problem,''
said commission member John J. Creedon. ``I commend you. I say ,
`Right on.' ''
   But commission member Burton Lee, a physician at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said the project's
strategy of including intravenous drug abusers among test subjects
was ``a bad mistake.''
   ``They are unpredictable at almost the 100 percent level'' and
their inclusion will create ``completely flawed material'' in
research results, he said. Some researchers say that intravenous
drug users are poor research subjects because they often don't
follow instructions and don't appear for follow-up visits.
   Hannon disagreed, saying ``people with this disease have their
lives on the line and are willing to cooperate.''
   The project is sponsored by the People With AIDS Coalition, said
Hannon, who said he has AIDS.
   The project, approved by the New York State Department of Health
to sponsor treatment trials, already has five experiments under
way, he said. Most funding comes from the companies that make the
drugs involved, he said.
   Creedon, president and chief executive officer of Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co., suggested the project also apply to the
insurance industry for financial help.
   Studies must be approved by the organization's institutional
review board, which includes physicians, law professors, religious
leaders and people with AIDS.
   Another commission member, William Walsh, told Hannon to ``let
us know as specifically as you can what we can do to get more
support, more interest'' for such community-based programs.
   Commission member Beny Primm, executive director of the
Addiction Research and Treatment Corp. in Brooklyn, N.Y., offered
to supply ``responsible intravenous drug abusers who are in
treatment from my program any time you want.''
   Among the drugs being tested by the community project are
pentamidine, being studied in 200 people with AIDS for prevention
of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and erythropoietin for anemia
brought on by the AIDS drug AZT or the disease itself.
   Another study in seven people will see if a parasitic infection
called cryptosporidiosis can be treated with milk from cows that
were injected with the parasite. The idea is that the cows' immune
systems would create proteins called antibodies that would attack
the parasite, and that the antibodies would be in the milk.
   A $750,000 trial, about to begin with funding from Du Pont Co.,
will test a drug called Ampligen.
   With money raised from the community, Hannon testified, the
project is testing AL-721, an extract from eggs that Hannon said
thousands of people with AIDS are taking on their own. The project
is studying its potential for fighting the AIDS virus and boosting
the immune system, he said.

<HEAD>Leader of Terrorist Group, Four Others Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAYONNE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a French Basque terrorist
group and four members of his organization were arrested Saturday
after a shootout with police, authorities said.
   Philippe Bidart, leader of Iparretarrak, had been sought for
more than six years. The former schoolteacher was convicted twice
in absentia, once for the murder of two police officers, and is
suspected in two other slayings of policemen.
   Iparretarrak, which means ``Those of the North'' in the Basque
language, is fighting for independence for the Basque country in
southwestern France and northern Spain.
   It has been less active than the Spanish Basque terrorist
movement ETA but has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks.
   About 20 gendarmes _ members of a police force under direction
of the French army _ surrounded Bidart and his companions in a home
on the outskirts of Bayonne, the largest city in the French Basque
region.
   As they emerged about 1 a.m., they were confronted by the
gendarmes. Two of the Iparretarrak members, Joseph Etcheveste and
Pierre Aguerre, were wounded by gunfire and taken to the local
hospital for treatment. Etcheveste was described as Bidart's top
lieutenant.
   Bidart and the other two, Philippe Lascaray and Jean-Paul
Hiribaren, then surrendered.
   Defense Minister Andre Giraud sent a message of congratulations
to the Gendarmerie, saying the arrests were the result of a long
effort ``accomplished in particularly delicate and often dangerous
conditions.''
   Authorities said only one Iparretarrak member remained at large,
Lucienne, Fourcade, and they issued an appeal for her to surrender.
   ``No harm will be done to her. We known she never intended to
kill anyone,'' the Gendermerie in Bayonne said. ``She cannot stay
on the run by herself.''
   Bidart, 35, had been sought since Nov. 7, 1981, when he was
caught on camera during a bank robbery in Saint Paul les Dax, a
Basque country town.
   Bidart was convicted in absentia of murder in the March 19,
1982, slayings of two national policemen killed in St. Etienne de
Baigorry, his hometown. He received a life sentence in that case
and another life term for a conviction in absentia for the bank
robbery.
   Authorities say Bidart also is believed responsible for two
other attacks in which gendarmes died, one on Aug. 7, 1983, and the
other last August.
   During his six years in hiding, Bidart gave one press conference
in hiding and made one cassette recording played at the funeral of
an Iparretarrak member last June.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response,
delivered by House Budget Chairman William Gray of Pennsylvania, to
President Reagan's radio address on Saturday:
   Hello, this is Congressman Bill Gray, the chairman of the House
Budget Committee. Two days ago the President sent Congress his
budget request for fiscal year 1989. But this year something is
different. Everybody is shocked at the calm on Capitol Hill.
   People have gotten used to a set pattern: the budget comes up,
the battle lines are drawn, political bombs are dropped, the war
begins. This time people wonder why no bombs are being dropped.
What's different is the president's budget. The budget that arrived
on my desk on Thursday is more realistic than any of the other
seven the President has sent to Congress.
   In large measure, of course, this is due to the bipartisan
agreement between the administration and Congress at the budget
summit last fall. That agreement established specific limits for
the major areas of the budget, including defense spending and
domestic programs.
   It also committed us to an equally important objective: real,
permanent significant deficit reduction. The president's budget
appears to meet the summit guidelines, which is why we're not
seeing the kind of fireworks we've had in the past. Let's give
credit where it's due: in at least some areas the president has
recognized that Congress' priorities are also the priorities of the
American people.
   Instead of trying to cut aid to education by 28 percent, as he
did last year, the president is proposing a four percent increase
from the current funding level. Instead of trying to cut back on
the war on drugs, the president would increase spending by 13
percent. And to deal with AIDS, one of our most important health
problems, the president is asking for a 40 percent increase in
funds for AIDS research and education.
   But in other areas, this budget is out of line with America's
needs and America's values. For example, the president's budget
would spend more for homes in space than for the homeless here on
earth. In fact, funding for the proposed space station would be
almost $1 billion, but funding for the needs of the homeless would
be only $219 million, far less than the amount authorized by
Congress.
   The President and his representatives have indicated that this
year they want to avoid confrontational politics and acrimonious
exchanges, the kinds of things that in previous years led to budget
stalemate and huge deficits. Well, we can all agree with that. The
success of the budget summit and the prospect of continued
administration involvement will, I believe, demonstrate that
nothing is wrong with the budget process, nothing that can't be
fixed by cooperation and compromise on priorities and policies.
   We proved that the process wasn't the problem when, in seven to
eight weeks, with cooperation and compromise, we designed and
implemented a two-year budget agreement. The spirit and willingness
to compromise are the oil that makes the budget process work. We
know that the economy has improved recently. Inflation is down, and
unemployment, after rising to records in the long recession, is
back down to its 1979 level.
   But we Democrats are concerned about the future. We cannot rest
comfortably with economic gains built on a policy of borrow,
borrow, spend, spend. The deficit is a problem we cannot escape by
talking about process. Since 1980, our national debt has more than
doubled. By next January, it will be almost $2.8 trillion. That
works out to $11,400 for every man, woman and child in the United
States, and every year we have to pay the interest on that debt. We
have made major progress, but we still have a long way to go.
   If we maintain the bipartisan spirit that came out of the budget
summit, we can pass a budget that reduces the deficits and meets
the needs of this nation. And if we maintain the spirit of
conciliation that has been evidenced so far this year, we can make
the budget process work and build a brighter future for the next
generation, and an America with greater opportunity. This is
Congressman Bill Gray.

   President Reagan beseeched Congress Saturday
to ``stand firm'' against election year pressure for expensive
additions to his $1.1 trillion budget, but the chairman of the
House Budget Committee called for more money to help the homeless.
   Reagan, defending the spending package in his weekly radio
speech delivered from Camp David, Md., said deficit spending will
drop from $221 billion in fiscal year 1986 to $130 billion in the
1989 fiscal year, which his proposed new budget covers.
   ``If Congress upholds its commitments and stands firm against
pressures for increased spending _ pressures that reach a peak
during election years _ solid results will be forthcoming,'' the
president said.
   The new budget, sent to Capitol Hill Thursday, was written after
a series of consultations with Congress on deficit-reduction goals
and outlines of the amounts to be spent on broad categories.
   As a result, Reagan said, the legislative and executive branches
``are demonstrating the kind of responsible leadership expected by
the electorate.''
   The budget, the president said, ``remains firm in our
commitments to essential domestic programs. It also includes
funding for the minimum defense programs needed to keep our country
safe and necessary to honor our commitments to our friends and
allies.''
   He called it a ``trim budget'' that keeps the lid on spending,
while permitting increases for education, the battle against AIDS
and illegal drugs, and air safety programs.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House budget panel,
echoed the president's praise for the budget consultations and the
hikes for education, AIDS and narcotics programs.
   ``Let's give credit where its due,'' Gray said in the Democratic
response. ``In at least some areas, the president has recognized
that Congress' priorities are also the priorities of the American
people.''
   ``In other areas, this budget is out of line with America's
needs and America's values,'' Gray said.
   His only specific criticism of the package was a request for $1
billion to build a manned space station, compared with $219 million
for programs to help homeless people, ``far less than the amount
authorized by Congress.''
   The budget provides ``more for homes in space than for the
homeless on earth,'' Gray said.
   At the same time, he said, he expected differences to be worked
out through compromise and cooperation.
   ``This year something is different,'' Gray said. ``Everybody is
shocked at the calm on Capitol Hill. People have gotten used to a
set pattern: the budget comes up, the battle lines are drawn,
political bombs are dropped, the war begins.''
   This time, he said, ``people wonder why no bombs are being
dropped.''
   ``What's different is the president's budget,'' Gray continued.
``The budget that arrived on my desk on Thursday is more realistic
than any of the other seven the president has sent to Congress.''
   Reagan, in his radio address, repeated his criticism of last
year's budget process, saying late amendments to the spending bill
required him to sign a hastily assembled package without review, or
face the shutdown of the federal government.
   With the new budget, he said, ``we have an opportunity to put
our fiscal house in order.''
   Reagan also repeated his assertions that his administration has
presided over the biggest economic expansion since World War II,
and he once again hailed his administration's record on employment.

   The Soviets have become more open about
announcing their space failures, but failed to announce the
destruction of a spy satellite last month and gave out sparse
details about a rocket failure, space-watcher Jim Oberg said
Saturday.
   The official Tass news agency reported that the upper stage of
the Proton rocket booster failed on Wednesday and that on Thursday
``the Sputniks entered dense layers of the atmosphere and ceased
their existence.''
   According to U.S. Space Command, the largest chunk of debris
from the mission re-entered the earth's atmosphere Friday afternoon
between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and a smaller chunk fell earlier
near Australia.
   Besides the failure of the Proton, with three satellites aboard,
the Soviets lost another satellite, Cosmos 1,906, on Jan. 31. The
imaging satellite was launched on Dec. 26 and was ``blown up to
prevent the film and equipment from falling into the hands of
western intelligence agencies,'' Oberg said.
   Since Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in March
1985, Oberg said, the Soviets ``have certainly released new
material. But there remain severe limits. Military stuff is clearly
beyond the limit.''
   Still, Oberg said, Western technology can detect such events as
the Proton failure, and Western news reports can force further
disclosures from the Soviets.
   Penetrating the secretive Soviet space program is nothing new
for Oberg, who has published his findings in a new book called
``Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost.''
   Long before Gorbachev's moderate reforms led to greater
disclosure of problems in the Soviet Union, Oberg had pieced
together hair-raising tales of disasters that for decades went
unreported in the state-controlled media.
   Oberg has ``been working since childhood at this, watching their
space program, looking for chinks in their secrecy, and driving
through them.''
   Soviet secrecy can be dangerous, Oberg wrote in his book. On
Oct. 24, 1962, a Soviet space probe exploded into dozens of objects
during the Cuban missile crisis, the confrontation that brought the
superpowers their closest to nuclear war.
   Debris from the probe ``appeared without warning on American
attack-warning radars in Alaska,'' Oberg wrote. ``The Cuban missile
crisis was at its height, and for a few moments the unannounced and
unpredicted Soviet space failure looked like the long-feared
massive Soviet (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) attack.''
   The debris burned up as it entered the atmosphere. But, Oberg
said, the Soviets have never publicly acknowledged the event.
   Soviet media also have not reported on the most spectacular
``and probably the greatest disaster of the space age,'' the
``Nedelin catastrophe,'' which on about Oct. 24, 1960, killed
scores of Soviets including Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin, the commander
in chief of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces.
   The accident came three years after the Soviets launched the
first satellite, ``Sputnik.'' Operating in the strictest secrecy,
the Soviets launched two unmanned spacecraft on a probe to Mars,
but both fell back into the atmosphere and burned up because their
upper stages failed.
   A third booster was loaded with fuel, and the order was given to
launch. But the main rocket engine did not ignite. ``It just stood
there on the launch pad, bathed in searchlights and fuming with
clouds of supercold liquid oxygen,'' Oberg wrote.
   ``Nedelin made a fatal error and committed a gross violation of
elementary rocket safety standards,'' Oberg wrote. ``From the
launch bunker, where he had prepared to watch the expected success,
he ordered a team of engineers to inspect the rocket booster
immediately. ...''
   ``Since he was an experienced combat commander, he would not
send men into peril he himself avoided, so he walked out to the
base of the rocket while the inspection was being made.''
   Although the main rocket failed to ignite, the uppermost stage
continued to operate as though it were en route to Mars, and at the
time when it would have separated from the booster, fired its own
rockets.
   ``A million pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen flared up in a
pyre which must have been visible for hundreds of miles,'' Oberg
wrote.
   The Soviet press carried an official obituary of Nedelin several
days later, saying that he had ``died tragically in the line of
duty'' in a plane crash.
   Not a word has appeared since then in the official press,
although writings smuggled out of Russia or published by emgres
have described the incident, and Oberg pieced together the evidence.

   Riot squads Saturday hurled tear gas
at hundreds of anti-government demonstrators marching through a
fashionable downtown shopping district and calling for fairer
election rules.
   About 500 demonstrators took to the streets and clashed with
police after a large rally at a Roman Catholic cathedral. At least
two firebombs were thrown by demonstrators, who eventually were
scattered by tear gas.
   No arrests or injuries were reported.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the opposition Party for Peace for
Democracy, held an overnight sit-in with about 150 supporters at
the party headquarters to protest the government's stand on
election rules.
   The demonstrations were called to protest proposed changes in
rules for electing members of the National Assembly, the country's
parliament. Elections are to be held in April.
   The government is proposing that one to three representatives be
elected from each district, based on population. Kim's supporters
want the law to allow for one elected member from each district,
regardless of population.
   The protesters also demonstrated against the Dec. 16 election of
Roh Tae-woo of the governing Democratic Justice Party. The
opposition contends the elections were rigged. The new president is
to be inaugurated on Thursday.
   Rally participants shouted, ``Down with military dictatorship!''
and ``We oppose seizing power through fraudulent election!''
   Kim said electing one representative from each district would
ensure democratic representation.
   He also called on the rival opposition Reunification Democratic
Party to endorse his formula, but he charged that the party had
made a secret deal to support the government's election formula.
   The government has held separate talks with the rival opposition
groups on reforming rules for the National Assembly elections. The
Reunification Democratic Party favors a formula of electing more
than one representative from each district.
   Roh was catapulted to power after the two rival opposition
groups split a majority of the votes during the Dec. 16 election.

Treatment</HEAD>

   When an innocent bystander in an affluent Los
Angeles neighborhood was killed in the crossfire of a gang
gunbattle, local merchants asked for more police protection and
quickly got it.
   The swift action following the Jan. 30 incident sparked protest
from many blacks and Hispanics, who charged that similar requests
from poorer minority neighborhoods fall on deaf ears.
   A week after the shooting local minority leaders publicized a
new study to support claims that police react more slowly to
emergencies in less affluent areas. Police Chief Darryl Gates
released a letter Friday from the study's author saying his
findings had been misconstrued.
   The racial tug-of-war intensified last weekend when an off-duty
black police officer was arrested as he stood on a street corner in
an upscale neighborhood with six black youths. The officer said his
group was conducting an informal ``sting'' operation to investigate
alleged police harassment.
   ``None of those kids did anything except stand on that corner
and be black _ and that was enough,'' said Hawthorne Police Sgt.
Don Jackson. Police said Jackson's group was blocking the sidewalk.
   Gang violence fueled by drug trafficking has been a reality for
years in the city's predominantly black and Hispanic southside
neighborhoods. Drive-by shootings are commonplace, with innocent
bystanders being killed by errant or ricocheting bullets.
   In one recent incident, a 67-year-old woman was killed in a
drive-by shooting while she sat in a wheelchair in the doorway of
her southside home.
   There were more than 300 gang-related murders in Los Angeles
County in 1987. That figure may rise to 450 this year as gangs
battle for control of the lucrative crack cocaine market, said
Michael Genelin, head of the district attorney's gang division.
   ``And that's not the way it should be. We should be able to live
normally,'' said Barbara Thomas, spokeswoman for the South Central
Organizing Committee, a group that claims a membership of 78,000
black families.
   Gang violence has begun to move into more affluent, mainly white
areas, illustrated by the Jan. 30 shooting of 27-year-old Karen
Toshima, who was caught in gang crossfire. She was killed in
Westwood Village, a popular theater and restaurant district.
   When police stepped up patrols in the area, hundreds of
southside residents demonstrated at LAPD headquarters, charging
that officials ignored daily death tolls in their communities.
   Minority leaders publicized a just-released study ordered by the
Police Commission and prepared by the Public Administration Service
in Virginia. The study showed that police responded more slowly to
crimes in poor areas than in the more affluent Westside and San
Fernando Valley, the leaders said.
   The Police Department then released a letter from Peter Bellmio,
the principal author of the nearly 200-page report, that stated his
findings had been misinterpreted.
   The letter said the actual conclusion was that the Police
Department takes too long to respond to emergencies and does not
significantly respond more rapidly in any of the city's
geographical areas.
   Bellmio said he was under contract not to comment publically
until March 8, when he makes a formal report to the police
commission.
   The deployment controversy has fanned other racial issues, such
as the alleged harassment that prompted Jackson to conduct his own
``sting.''
   In an effort to prove that LAPD officers were mistreating
blacks, Jackson and six friends gathered on a busy street corner in
Westwood, while an associate secretly videotaped the scene.
Officers arrested Jackson on a misdemeanor charge and rounded up
and frisked the others.
   Police defended the arrest, saying Jackson's group was blocking
the sidewalk, refused to move when requested by officers and was
dressed in attire similar to gang members'. Jackson was released on
his own recognizance pending a court hearing.
   More criticism of the police came Monday when the Rev. William
Johnson, of Curry Christian Methodist Episcopal Temple, complained
that when officers do patrol black neighborhoods, they come ``ready
to do combat.''
   Mayor Tom Bradley, who is black, signed an ordinance Wednesday
that provided for the hiring of 150 more officers, increasing the
force to its largest strength ever, 7,500 officers.
   ``We're determined to return this city to a drug-free, gang-free
atmosphere,'' the mayor said.
   ``I've been telling the people of this city that we need
hundreds more police officers,'' said Gates, the police chief. ``We
should focus on getting rid of the problems, and not on the
complicated subject of deployment.''
   Some criminal experts say more officers won't make a difference
in poor, crime-infested areas.
   ``Historically, there's a resentment to an excessive show of
force,'' said Garrett Capune, professor of criminology at the
University of Southern California and California State University.
   ``It has a racist overtone, you know; there seems to be more
crime because there's more officers,'' he said. ``It becomes a sort
of self-fulfilling prophecy.''
   ``I don't know what these criminologists are all about,''
snapped City Councilman Nate Holden, who represents a mainly black
district. ``These guys can sit in some classroom and think what
it's supposed to be like. But they haven't seen the real world. I
resent them.
   ``Let them come into the black community and see what it's
like.''

   A top pingpong player went to Poland and took her
son away from her ex-husband, then hid from Polish authorities
until she could sneak the boy into Sweden, a newspaper said
Saturday.
   ``I have gone through hell, and the child has gone through
hell,'' Kaisa Karlsson said in a telephone interview with The
Denver Post from Stockholm, where she and her son Michael arrived
Friday.
   ``Probably this night I can sleep,'' said Karlsson's father,
Bohdan Dawidowicz, also a top table tennis player, from his home in
suburban Aurora.
   Karlsson, 26, has been fighting since 1983 to win custody of
Michael from her Polish ex-husband, who was initially given custody
in Colorado and Polish courts. She got the Colorado ruling
reversed, but the Polish ruling stood and she took matters into her
own hands a week ago Saturday.
   She said she took her son away during her regular visit with him
in Warsaw, then hid in a series of homes, working her way from the
Warsaw suburbs to the port city of Gdansk, the Post reported.
   There they boarded a ferry for Sweden late Thursday.
   Karlsson wouldn't say exactly how she got her son past Polish
police, who were looking for him.
   ``There are just too many people who could get in trouble,'' she
said.
   Karlsson and Dawidowicz's battles with the Polish government
began shortly after Dawidowicz decided to live in the United States
in 1971 in the middle of an international table tennis tour.
   Three years later, after going back to Poland, they won
permission for the whole family to come to the United States. She
won tournament after tournament representing U.S. teams, and in
1978 became a U.S. citizen.
   In 1981, she married Mitchell Gaca, another Polish immigrant.
Michael was born later that year. They were divorced in 1983, with
custody initially given to Gaca.
   Karlsson battled back, but her travels on the table tennis
circuit worked against her and in 1985 her ex-husband returned to
Poland with their son.
   The same year, Karlsson introduced new evidence in her case and
was awarded custody by an Aurora court, but it was too late.
   Karlsson and her father said they were disillusioned by the U.S.
government's hands-off approach.
   The State Department refused to intervene, saying Polish law
applied since Gaca had gotten a Polish court to award him custody.
   Donna Sherman, a spokeswoman for the consular division of the
U.S. State Department, said there is not much the government can do
once a child is in another country's jurisdiction.
   ``We cannot do anything that violates the laws of that
country,'' she said. ``We can arrange for meetings, to try and
arrange some kind of conciliation, but we can't force it. We can't
act as attorneys.''
   Karlsson, who has since married a Swedish businessman, hopes to
visit the United States this summer but says that in the meantime
she and Michael will relax in Sweden.
   ``He needs a little rest. I think he'll be sticking around the
house,'' she said.

<HEAD>Sikh Extremists Kill 10, Raising Death Toll To 32 In Two Days</HEAD>

   Sikh gunmen set off a new wave of
violence Saturday in Punjab state, killing 10 people and prompting
police in the Amritsar district and in New Dehli go on red alert.
   The attacks raised the death toll in violence blamed on the
separatist radicals to 32 since Friday. At least 60 others were
wounded.
   ``We are after the killers, the entire police force is on red
alert,'' said Amritsar district police superintendent Mohammed
Izhar Alam.
   Road blocks were set up Saturday throughout the farming state
bordering Pakistan, and Punjab's 35,000-member police force was
being aided by paramilitary troops in the search operations.
   In a related development, a Hindu angered by the spate of
killings entered a Sikh temple and set fire to Sikh holy book in
Wadala Kala, a village 26 miles south of Amritsar Saturday, police
said.
   ``We are worried, because this will give rise to tension,'' said
police officer Rajinder Singh.
   The man, identified as Atma Ram, was arrested. Singh said Ram's
younger brother had been slain by suspected Sikh radicals last
month.
   ``He was angry after he heard the news of the new killings. He
went inside a Gurdwara (Sikh shrine) and set fire to the holy
book,'' Singh said.
   Sikh militants have been fighting for a separate homeland in
Punjab since 1982. Sikhs are a majority in Punjab, but comprise
only 2 percent of India's 800 million people, more than 80 percent
of whom are Hindus.
   The radicals want an independent homeland because they say the
Hindus discriminate against them.
   At least 250 people have been killed in Sikh-related violence
this year. Last year more than 1,000 deaths were blamed on the
separatists.
   Among Saturday's victims were two Hindu farm laborers, a Hindu
trader and four Sikh farmers. The remaining three have yet to be
identified, police chief Alam said.
   One person wounded in a bomb blast Friday died of injuries
Saturday, hospital sources said.
   In the village of Sahsra, nine members of farm family were
killed with automatic rifles and revolvers Friday night, along with
a man staying at the house, Alam said.
   Residents in the village, about 18 miles southeast of Amritsar,
said about six Sikh gunmen stormed into the home while the family
slept.
   Earlier Friday, Sikh bomb attacks killed 11 people. The bomb
attacks were in the cities of Amritsar, Patiala, Gurdaspur and
Hoshiarpur. The bombings later prompted police in New Delhi to
issue a red alert because of fears that the attacks might spread to
the capital.
   On Saturday an unexploded bomb was found in a fifth city,
Batala, the United News of India reported. The agency said the
four-pound can of explosives was left in a store by a woman
customer in the city 25 miles northeast of Amritsar.
   Police in New Delhi advised residents not to pick up unknown
objects and report movement of new people in their neighborhood.
   The Sikh faith has elements of both Hinduism and Islam and was
founded about 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to the two
warring religions.
   But the Sikhs' 10th and last prophet, Guru Govind Singh,
declared Sikhism as a warrior faith in which the adherents should
all carry swords and the male should bear the name Singh, ``Lion''
in Punjabi.

   The 16-year-old accused of the ax
murders of four members of his family wrote poetry and was so
gentle ``he wouldn't step on a flower,'' friends say, but those
closest to him also saw a darker side.
   David Brom, who faces four charges of first-degree murder in the
slayings of his mother, father, sister and brother, had expressed
frustration and anger about his parents, and was drawn to
hard-core, punk-rock bands with songs of pain, insanity and death.
   ``I saw the school side of David. I think you're going to find
there were a lot of faces,'' said the Rev. Jack Krough, David's
teacher and the chaplain of Rochester Lourdes High School.
   A favorite of David's, according to one friend, is the group
``Suicidal Tendencies.'' A song on their latest album describes
``the maniac I'll meet. His love for me is like a father to a son.
And now the maniac and I are one.''
   The high school sophomore was arrested Friday after an all-night
manhunt in this city of 62,000 about 90 miles southeast of
Minneapolis.
   Friends, according to Krough, had heard David muse recently
about wanting to hurt his family. They regarded that as an
expression of typical teen-age alienation but never as a serious
plan, the priest said.
   To most, David had a quiet magnetism at school, Krough said. He
was an avid bicyclist but not a ``jock.'' And he wasn't active in
other extra-curricular activities at the 415-student parochial
school, principal Michael Leahy said.
   ``There was a group of students he was the center of,'' Krough
said. ``I guess you would tend to call him an artistic, poetic kind
of person, a deep-feeling person.''
   About David and his friends, Krough said, ``If there was ever a
group of adolescents that fit the image of sensitive teens, that
group would qualify.''
   Many of Brom's friends wrote letters to be delivered to the
Olmsted County Jail, and they defended him fiercely when questioned
by reporters.
   The punk appearance he adopted the day of the killings,
including shaving the sides of his head, dying his hair black and
spiking it on the back of his head, seemed out of character to some.
   ``He wouldn't step on a flower,'' said schoolmate Chris
Bromelkamp, whose locker is next to David's. ``He may have done
something wrong, but there's a lot of people he touched.''
   Authorities were far from understanding what may have triggered
the slayings, but Sheriff Charles Von Wald said one small piece
came out in interviews with David's friends. The teen-ager and his
father had an argument about a tape the boy had taken home, he said.
   Also unexplained was how a boy described as an almost frail 130
pounds could commit the slayings with a 28-inch ax without anyone
in the house escaping.
   Chief Deputy Sheriff Stan Anderson would not comment on other
details of the murders, such as where the weapon was obtained or
why the suspect stayed in Rochester after the killings.
   The victims were Bernard Brom, 41, Paulette, 40, Diane, 14, and
Rick, 11. The only family survivor other than David is his
19-year-old brother Joseph, who has his own apartment in Rochester.
   Rochester is dominated by the Mayo Clinic and an IBM plant where
the elder Brom worked.
   Mrs. Brom had recently quit her job at the church to spend more
time with her children, Leahy noted.
   David did not appear to possess his parents' devout religious
faith, Krough said. ``David was a searcher,'' he said.

   Roy Acuff, ``the king of country
music,'' celebrated his 50th anniversary on the Grand Ole Opry by
citing the fans of the long-running show.
   Acuff, 84, received a standing ovation Friday night when he
appeared on the stage to mark his golden anniversary on the live
program.
   ``This is a little special occasion for Roy Acuff,'' he told the
audience after singing his best-known song, ``The Wabash
Cannonball.''
   ``I'm proud to have lived to see this day,'' he said. ``You are
the ones who made Roy Acuff and the Grand Ole Opry. Have fun, I'm
going to.''
   Moments before, when the curtain went up and the crowd rose,
Acuff playfully told the audience, ``Sit down so I can sing.''
   He later sang his version of ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,'' a
song Willie Nelson also turned into a hit.
   ``That was written for me by Fred Rose many, many years ago,''
Acuff told the audience, which included representatives of Rotary
International from 22 countries. ``Then Willie Nelson brought it
back. He did a good job with it.''
   Acuff also saluted his dobro player, Bashful Brother Oswald, who
also was celebrating his 50th anniversary on the show.
   ``We haven't had a fight yet,'' Acuff said.
   Other Opry stars joined in honoring Acuff, a fiddler who came
out of the East Tennessee hills to become the Opry's first genuine
singing star.
   ``That's a long time, folks,'' singer Del Reeves said about the
50 years of performing. ``I hope he's here another 50.''
   Singer Porter Wagoner called Acuff ``one of the grandest men in
country music.'' Singer Connie Smith dedicated her song ``Once a
Day'' to him.
   Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter Cash, were to have
appeared on the show during a special segment honoring Acuff, but
canceled because both have the flu, Opry officials said.
   The pry bills itself as the longest running radio show still on
the air. It has never missed a broadcast since going on the air in
1925, meaning Acuff has been on the program for all but 13 years of
its existence.

   There are signs that child heart transplant
recipients develop atherosclerosis and also have a worse survival
rate than adults given new hearts, a transplant surgeon says.
   Dr. D. Glenn Pennington, chief of the cardiac replacement
service at St. Louis University Hospital in St. Louis, said he has
seen ``indications of development of atherosclerosis'' in child
transplant recipients, and ``it may become more of a trend.''
   Atherosclerosis is the thickening of the internal lining of the
blood vessels and the cause of coronary artery disease.
   As for survival rates, ``I think it is worse than adults,'' with
infection the leading cause of death among children, Pennington, a
specialist in the use of artificial devices and in pediatric
transplantation, said Friday at an international conference on
thoracic organ transplantion.
   He said children who have received transplants do not have worse
problems with organ rejection than adults. But he said there is an
increasing number of child transplants who need retransplantation
because of progressive failure of the organs they have been given.
   ``I don't know what that means, but my suspicion is that if we
transplant children in infancy we will probably have to
retransplant at some point again,'' Pennington said.
   There was encouraging news on transplants from a leader in
transplantation for extremely young infants, Dr. Leonard L. Bailey,
of Loma Linda University Medical Center in California, who said
some of his patients have exhibited an ``immune tolerance'' not
seen in adults.
   As a result, several of the young recipients need only extremely
small doses of the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine and may be
withdrawn entirely from all drug therapy.
   ``My guess is that a number of the babies will be able to grow
up without the need for immunosuppression,'' Bailey said.
   Cyclosporine is used in transplantation in combination with
other drugs to suppress the body's immune system and keep it from
turning against the donor heart.
   Bailey said he believes the optimal therapy is diagnosis ``of
heart disease in-utero, because that gives us a chance then from 35
weeks on to find a donor.''
   He said that in his program's experience, transplants after more
than the first few weeks of a child's life make for a ``much more
difficult post-operative management problems. ... Those who have
been transplanted in the first month of life have really been a
piece of cake.''
   Infants more than 3 to 3{ months old given transplants ``will
reject with considerable vigor,'' requiring aggressive
anti-rejection therapy, said Bailey, who has performed heart
transplants on the world's youngest infants, including a
four-hour-old Canadian boy last October.

   The surgeon who transplanted a baboon's
heart into an infant girl in 1984 says he's optimistic about the
continuing research toward eventual use of animal heart transplants
in humans.
   ``We're still really working vigorously in that area from all
points of view, goats and sheep and primates,'' Dr. Leonard L.
Bailey said at a three-day international conference on thoracic
organ transplantation that concluded Saturday.
   Researchers have turned to exploring the use of non-human organs
for transplantation on either a temporary or possibly permanent
basis, in part because of the lack of sufficient organ donors.
   In a controversial procedure in October 1984, Bailey and his
staff at Loma Linda University Medical Center transplanted the
heart of a baboon into a 12-day-old girl known as Baby Fae.
   The child, born with a fatal heart defect, survived for 20 days
before her body's immune system rejected the foreign-tissue
transplant, or xenograft.
   Rejection has been a major obstacle in xenografts.
   Another problem area has been the ethical question of using a
primate heart in humans, said Dr. Bartley P. Griffith, of the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Griffith, thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon at one of the
nation's busiest transplant centers, said chimpanzees ``are almost
too close'' to humans in terms of behavior and would raise a moral
dilemma.
   ``Nobody is talking about using chimpanzees, and yet they in
fact are the most size-appropriate probably to use,'' he said.
   Griffith added that baboons' hearts are small for human use and
might eventually be used more appropriately as auxiliary hearts.
   Bailey said the testing that has been conducted at the Loma
Linda, Calif., facility has involved a series of experiments,
testing the ``xenograft bridge to allograft theory, and it's
working out very well.'' An allograft is a same-species organ
transplant.
   The testing, he said, includes using xenografts of green monkey
hearts into baboons in temporary bridge-to-transplant situations.
   ``We still very firmly believe that a well-selected primate
heart from a baboon will be virtually as good'' as a human
allograft ``that may have no tissue match whatsoever and bear very
little resemblance and genetic makeup'' to the original _ even as a
permanent graft, he said.

   American banker and philanthropist David
Rockefeller unveiled a private non-profit foundation Saturday that
he said will aid hard-pressed farmers in this communist country.
   Rockefeller met privately with Polish communist leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski before formally inaugurating the foundation,
which will raise pigs and export hams to the United States.
   ``It seems to me that what we all need to do is to find ways in
which despite the ideological differences, we can work together,''
Rockefeller said at a ceremony in Warsaw's Royal Castle.
   Organizers said the foundation brings Poland its first new
long-term Western credits since the 1981 martial law crackdown and
will serve as a model for Western institutions wishing to provide
financial assistance to the debt-stricken country.
   But the size of the credits, $2.4 million, is miniscule compared
to Poland's burgeoning foreign debt, now standing at $39.2 billion.
   The Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture is the
result of the personal interest of Rockefeller and the Rockefeller
Brothers' Fund, said Leon Irish, chairman of the foundation's
organizing committee.
   Its first project will be the development of swine production to
increase exports of premium Polish hams to the United States by 14
percent.
   The foundation will borrow money to import to Poland
high-protein feed concentrates from the United States for sale to
Polish farmers under a contract arrangement.
   The farmers will use the feed to raise swine more efficiently.
The swine will be sold to Polish meat processors in partnership
with the foundation.
   Hams resulting from the arrangement will be exported to the
United States, with a portion staying in Poland for domestic sale.
   Proceeds from the exports will repay foreign loans and be used
for other foundation projects, Irish said.
   Unlike other East bloc nations where cooperative farming
predominates, private farmers control 75 percent of the farmland in
Poland and produce 80 percent of the crop.
   The foundation is to be governed by a council with 60 percent
U.S. and Western European membership and 40 percent private Polish
membership.

   Two city ambulance workers face disciplinary
charges because they waited for their sandwiches in a delicatessen
before responding to a report of a heart attack victim 1{ blocks
away, officials said Saturday.
   The man died in the incident Wednesday in the Bronx.
   The Emergency Medical Service said its investigation had
substantiated allegations of delay. Both crew members had been
reassigned to clerical duties and faced disciplinary charges, it
said.
   EMS director James Kerr said it was impossible to know whether
the delay, which he said amounted to 5 minutes, had cost the
stricken man his life. But he said EMS policy requires ambulance
crews to respond immediately.
   The crew had just ordered sandwiches to go when a man ran in
into the deli at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday and said someone had suffered
a heart attack in the Church of the Mediator, Kerr said.
   Instead of leaving at once, the investigation showed, the pair
waited for their sandwiches, Kerr said. He declined to identify the
crew or discuss possible penalties.

   South African fighter planes
flew revenge raids on guerrilla bases in Angola at dawn Saturday, a
day after a bomb killed 18 people in a Namibian bank.
   Angolan authorities said several civilians were killed.
   More than a dozen Mirage and Impala aircraft attacked three
bases of the South-West African Peoples Organization in southern
Angola, the Defense Force chief, Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, said in a
statement.
   He said the attacks avenged the bombing Friday of the First
National Bank in Oshakati, South-West Africa, where 18 people were
killed and 31 injured. Most of the dead were black government
employees cashing their weekly paychecks.
   Geldenhuys accused SWAPO of the bank bombing. The guerrilla
group has been fighting for 22 years against South Africa's
occupation of South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   On Friday, SWAPO denied involvement in the bank blast, the
deadliest in Namibia in two decades. It has claimed responsibility
for other bombings in Namibia.
   SWAPO officials in London declined to comment on Saturday's raid.
   Later Saturday, Angola's defense ministry said the air assault
on Lubango and Onjiva left several civilians dead.
   A statement reported by the official Angolan news agency ANGOP
said the exact number of victims had not yet been determined,
according to a report monitored in Lisbon.
   The ANGOP report made no mention of SWAPO or Geldenhuys'
announcement.
   On Friday, South African Defense Minister Magnus Malan and
Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha warned neighboring states
that South African troops would undertake unannounced ``hot
pursuit'' raids across borders to fight guerrilla groups.
   ``We have repeatedly invited them (neighboring states) to talk
with us to sort our problems in peace. Now they have demonstrated
they are not interested,'' Botha said, reacting to news of the
Namibian bombing. ``As far as I'm concerned there is no more talk
of a regional conference _ not from our side. We're no longer
interested in the neighboring states.''
   Geldenhuys said eight Mirage fighters took part in the attack on
two targets near Lubango, about 190 miles north of the
Namibian-Angolan border; and five Impala aircraft attacked targets
at Ongiva, about 25 miles north of the border.
   Geldenhuys said all the South African aircraft returned safely,
but gave no estimate of casualties inflicted.
   He said the Lubango targets were ``SWAPO's most important
training center in Angola, the Tobias Hainyeko Training Center, and
a terrorist holding area about 10 kms (6.2 miles) west of there.''
   An Air Force source told The Associated Press that the jets that
attacked Lubango were probably Mirage F1-As, a French-designed
fighter-bomber capable of carrying about 14,000 pounds of bombs.
   The Impalas are a South African version of an Italian Aermacchi
light attack craft. They can carry Sidewinder air-to-air missiles
and are able to carry about 4,000 pounds of missiles or bombs.
   The general said SWAPO had launched a number of attacks from
Ongiva on civilians in South-West Africa.
   In 1971, the United Nations ruled that South Africa's occupation
of Namibia was illegal. But South Africa has defied the court and
continued its occupation.
   Only about 70,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people are white, and
the South African government has installed a multiracial
transitional administration to run the territory's affairs.
   SWAPO has refused to negotiate with the transitional government,
citing the U.N. resolution demanding free elections.
   South African and South-West African troops have been fighting
for about five months in Angola on behalf of the UNITA rebel
movement, which is battling the Marxist government in Luanda. South
African officials say they will not grant independence to Namibia
until the 40,000 Cuban troops supporting Angola's Marxist
government leave Africa.
   All of South Africa's black-ruled neighbors _ Swaziland,
Lesotho, Mozambique, Botswana and Angola _ have accused South
Africa of staging unannounced cross-border raids during the past 10
years, killing dozens of civilians as well as alleged guerrillas.
   South African officials have denied, refused to comment on, or
ridiculed most of the claims, although they did announce a raid
last year on Livingstone, Zambia.
   But military officials have acknowledged previous ``hot
pursuit'' operations against SWAPO in southern Angola.
   Botha and Malan presented their statement Friday as a new
get-tough policy against neighboring governments which, they say,
allow the anti-apartheid African National Congress, SWAPO and other
guerrilla organizations to stage attacks on South Africa from their
territories.
   By law and custom in South Africa, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   The organizer of a planned blood bank for
chaste donors says he hopes to expand into a national network of
Christian blood banks, a plan one physician called a dangerous
attempt to capitalize on fear of AIDS.
   Dr. Condon Hughes said he hopes to open LifeBlood, a Christian
blood bank that will not accept promiscuous donors, by early April.
Blood donors will be asked to sign a statement confirming they have
abstained from sex or been faithful to a spouse since 1977.
   The blood also will be tested for AIDS and other blood-borne
viruses, Hughes said.
   ``My intention is to inform heterosexuals that if they have more
than one faithful partner that they are at risk of developing a
deadly disease ... and to provide blood from people who do not fall
into that category,'' Hughes said.
   But Dr. Ronald Gilcher, of the Oklahoma Blood Institute, said
Hughes inaccurately implies that LifeBlood's supply will be safer
than other blood banks.
   And U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Susan Cruzan
noted that the FDA's list of risk categories does not include
promiscuous heterosexuals.
   ``What we see this doing is undermining the donor base ...
confusing people, creating distrust and a lack of credibility,''
Gilcher said. ``We think that is a dangerous thing.''
   ``I commend what he's doing in the sense of trying to create a
safer blood supply because that's what we're all doing, but the
method by which Dr. Hughes is trying to do this I think is
unsound,'' Gilcher said. ``I think it's dangerous because it could
create a lack of availability of blood products.''
   Gilcher said existing blood banks already screen donors and test
donated blood.
   ``The blood supply is safe, but it's not 100 percent safe,''
Gilcher said. ``There is no such thing as a zero risk. The public
wants a zero risk, but it doesn't exist.''
   Gilcher said Hughes' exclusion of heterosexuals who have had
more than one partner since 1977 relies on the honesty of the donor
and the honesty of the donor's sexual partner. He said it also
dangerously limits the pool of potential donors.
   But Hughes said he thinks chaste and faithful donors can supply
the nation with blood.
   ``Five percent of the nation provides the blood for the entire
nation,'' Hughes said. ``I am confident that there is 5 percent of
the nation that is chaste. Our goal is to identify those
individuals and encourage them to give blood, take a stand for
morality and administer the love of Christ through blood
donations.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction
in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. One method
of transmission is through infected blood or blood products.
   The FDA requires all blood banks to provide potential donors
with information about AIDS and ask them to refrain from donating
if they fall into certain risk categories.
   ``The FDA constantly reviews categories,'' Cruzan said. ``The
category of promiscuous heterosexuals was discussed in 1986.
Epidemiologists concluded at that time that the heterosexual spread
of HIV (the AIDS virus) was not a significant reason to exclude
this category.''
   Hughes said he plans to sell blood on a first-come, first-served
basis regardless of religion or sexual activity. For a fee, donors
will be allowed to have their own blood frozen for their own use.
   ``The cost of the blood is going to be determined primarily by
the number of donors that we have. We hope it will be comparable to
the (non-profit) Oklahoma Blood Institute. We may be at a
disadvantage because we have to pay taxes,'' Hughes said.

   A motorist whose heart was apparently
bigger than his nose rescued an injured skunk Saturday but could
not find an animal hospital to help, police said.
   The man, whom police declined to identify, found the animal off
Interstate 393 and bundled it into his car. He first took the skunk
to the Fish and Game Department, but no one was there, so he went
to the police, said Lt. James Fletcher.
   ``We couldn't find an animal hospital who would do something
with an injured skunk,'' he said. The animal apparently had been
hit by a vehicle and was badly injured, so police put it out of its
misery, Fletcher said.
   As for the good Samaritan, Fletcher said, the smell ``didn't
seem to bother him. I was a little surprised.''

   A sit-in launched by 200 University of
Massachusetts students at the start of a snowy holiday weekend
seemed doomed by doubt and disarray, leaders of the little
rebellion by minorities recalled.
   ``You do not take a building on a night before a major snowstorm
that will close it anyway and which is going to be closed for an
entire holiday weekend,'' Michael Thelwell, a black professor, said
he warned the protesters at the start of the occupation.
   But by the end of the six-day occupation of New Africa House,
hundreds of white students had displayed their sympathy in rallies
and vigils, money and supplies had poured in from around the nation
and even the chancellor had expressed admiration for the
protesters, who won several concessions from the school.
   ``We weren't organized. All we had were these five little
demands,'' said Jo Ella Costello, a negotiator for the group. ``But
something had brought us all together. That was the fascinating
thing. By the third day, we knew it was working.''
   The takeover began Feb. 11 after students met with Chancellor
Joseph D. Duffey to discuss the demands. Troubled by recent acts of
racial violence on campus, the protesters insisted on the
disciplining of five white students accused of beating two blacks,
and they demanded a stop to the encroachment of other school
departments on New Africa House, a Third World center.
   Tension had festered since an October 1986 beating of a black
student by several whites following the Boston Red Sox loss to the
New York Mets in the final game of the World Series.
   The disorganized protesters refused to meet with Duffey the
morning after the takeover, but began forming committees to handle
finances, security, media questions and negotiations, and they
imposed strict procedures on meetings.
   The rules proved successful. ``We started voting on everything,'
Costello said. ``We even voted on which movies to watch.''
   Support began pouring in from the campus and beyond. The Black
Faculty Senate said members would risk arrest with the protesters
if the chancellor called in police to remove them from the
building, Costello said.
   The Massachusetts Teachers Association volunteered to strike in
the same event, she said. Some 500 white students staged a rally
outside the building to lend their support.
   Costello said she knew the protesters had won widespread support
when she went to a nearby dormitory for a shower: ``They said, `You
all from New Africa House?' I said, `Yeah. Anybody got any soap?'
They ran to get it. They'd give us deodorant, anything.''
   Costello was among four women and five men elected by the
protesters to negotiate with the chancellor.
   A meeting scheduled for Monday had to be postponed when Duffey
went to visit a brother who had undergone major surgery. The
protesters sent the chancellor a card and Duffey responded with a
basket of fruit.
   ``We had old-timers with us saying, `My god, I've been going to
sit-ins for 20 years and I've never seen anything like this,''
Costello said.
   Duffey and the students met Tuesday and talked for more than
four hours.
   But then the group that had been occupying the house was
suddenly outnumbered by minorities returning to the campus from the
holiday weekend.
   ``They were acting like we'd sold out,'' saidCostello.
   ``I was really hurt by all these people who hadn't been there
the whole time. I asked them, `Where were you?'''
   The newcomers left early Wednesday and the stalwart core voted
to accept Duffey's responses to their demands, which included
timetables for the hiring of minority faculty and a promise to
leave the New Africa House in the hands of the Third World
community.
   Costello said the agreement was a victory that will enhance the
school's image among whites and blacks.
   ``I think UMass will get the reputation of fighting racism,''
she said. ``This is terrific, what's happening here.''

   Relief services for about 260,000
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon will be cut to the minimum because
of the kidnapping of two Scandinavian employees of the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency, the agency said Saturday.
   ``There will be noticeable changes in UNRWA services and
activities because of security problems and the lack of freedom of
movement,'' said agency spokesman Niall Kiely.
   ``We feel agency staff, be they foreign nationals or locals, are
under threat to their physical safety.''
   UNRWA employees Jan Stening, 44 of Sweden, and William
Jorgensen, 58, of Norway, were kidnapped Feb. 5. UNRWA said
Palestinians, acting independently of guerrilla factions, kidnapped
the men for personal motives.
   Kiely said only four of the 14 international staff assigned to
Lebanon remained in west Beirut and ``they are very heavily
involved in the search for Stening and Jorgensen.''
   He said he was ``reasonably hopeful'' that the Scandinavians
would be released because ``there are no real setbacks'' in
negotiations. He did not elaborate.
   Kiely said UNRWA has canceled a repair program for Beirut's
war-ravaged Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh Palestinian refugee
camps ``because it can't be supervised.''
   About 2,200 local relief workers serve with UNRWA at field
centers in Lebanon.
   Kiely said another impact of the kidnappings in south Lebanon
was that all UNRWA transports between Beirut and the southern port
cities of Sidon and Tyre have been stopped both ways.
   He said agency operations such as schools ``have a certain
momentum, so for the moment many services will continue to run as
before.''

   The government in Estonia accused U.S. senators of
trying to ruin Soviet-American relations and scuttle nuclear
disarmament by encouraging nationalist demonstrations in the Baltic
republic, Tass said Saturday.
   The official Soviet news agency said the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet of Estonia issued a statement saying the senators
are ``taking part in a new propaganda farce. They advocate a
favorable attitude to anti-Soviet actions planned to be held in
Estonia by some groups.''
   ``Such steps can further only one political aim _ to hamper the
improvement of Soviet-American relations and to undermine the
nuclear disarmament process,'' Tass said.
   The statement was the latest manifestation of a dispute between
the government and nationalist activists, supported by Western
politicians, over the fate of the Baltic states.
   The states, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, were independent
until they were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. Some
residents believe their national identity and religious freedom are
suppressed under Soviet rule.
   Moscow-based dissidents said some Lithuanians demonstrated
Tuesday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the declaration of
independence from Soviet Russia months after the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917. Wednesday is Estonia's anniversary of
independence, and activists say they plan protests there also.
   This month, 32 U.S. senators wrote to Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev asking him not to interfere with demonstrations and
religious services in the Baltics. The senators urged Gorbachev
``not only to allow the Lithuanian and Estonian people to
peacefully honor their national independence days, but also to take
all necessary measures to guarantee that they do not become targets
of state-sponsored harassment.''
   Estonia's Presidium shot back that ``those who call into
question the choice made by Estonia in 1940, when it joined the
Union of Soviet Socialists Republics as a full-fledged member,
oppose the will of our people, the policy of perestroika, the
principles of humanism and the policy of peace.''
   Perestroika is the name of Gorbachev's wide-ranging program to
reform Soviet society.
   In a speech to the Communist Party Central Committee on
Thursday, Gorbachev acknowledged the nationalities problem remains
thorny. He said Soviets must respect the language and culture of
national groups but that nationalism aimed at ``self-isolation lead
only to a spiritual blind alley.''
   The Presidium statement also acknowledged the nationalities
problem, but said some people are taking advantage of the recent
Soviet campaign for openness ``as a means of kindling hostility
among the nationalities living on Estonian territory. This fully
applies to the groups that emerged in Estonia which try to put
Soviet Estonia and its history in a bad light.''
   Tass did not say when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of
Estonia, the republic's nominal parliament, issued the statement.
   Last August, thousands of people demonstrated in Estonia's
capital and those of the other Baltic states on the anniversary of
a secret agrement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union the led
to the Soviet takeover of the Baltic states in 1940.
   The U.S. government has never recognized the Soviet
incorporation of the Baltic states.
   In a related development, an Estonian political activist and his
family of six arrived in Sweden Saturday after being expelled from
the Soviet Union.
   About 30 exiles greeted Rein Metz, his wife and five small
children at the airport.
   Metz told Swedish television at Stockholm's Arlanda airport he
was the leader of a ``religious and political association.'' He
said he expected ``30-40'' more members of his congregation could
be forced to leave.
   ``I greet you in the name of Jesus,'' he told some 30 exiles at
the airport.
   Last weekend two converted Estonian Buddhists arrived in Sweden
after given the choice of going to jail or leave the country. One
of them, Eke-Part Nomm, 22, said he had probably been forced to
leave because he read an appeal to form an Estonian Independence
Party at a meeting in the city of Tartu on Feb. 2.

<TEXT>
   A leader of the congressional Iran-Contra
probe says he can't understand why Vice President George Bush
remains reluctant to discuss his role in the affair months after
President Reagan opened the administration's books.
   ``I don't know why he's been so hesitant to acknowledge that he
supported the president in it'' said Arthur Liman, chief Senate
counsel in the investigation. ``He was not a decisive factor.''
   Liman, 55, was on the Hawaiian island of Maui on Thursday
preparing to address Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Bar Council,
an association of judges. He made the comments in an interview with
The Maui News newspaper.
   ``The vice president now talks about the fact that his
conversations with the president were privileged and he can't
reveal them,'' Liman said. ``The reality of it is, the president
waived executive privilege. I saw memos, diaries, other documents
reflecting meetings attended by the vice president and the
president.
   ``There was never any document withheld on that ground, either
by the vice president or the president,'' Liman said. ``All of the
damaging evidence came as a result of the White House's production
of documents.''
   Liman said evidence presented to the congressional committees
shows the decision to sell arms to Iran was made by the president,
and the vice president supported him. Liman said if Bush had
opposed the plan, it wouldn't have made a difference.
   ``The president heard arguments on both sides and made his own
decision,'' Liman said.

   John Demjanjuk's yearlong Nazi war crimes trial
was supposed to serve as a vivid history lesson to young Israelis,
but it gave way to lengthy technical debates that some say
trivialized the horrors of the Holocaust.
   Demjanjuk, the second man to stand trial in Israel on Nazi war
crimes charges, became more human to many Israelis than Adolf
Eichmann, the first, because he learned some Hebrew and his family
attended nearly every session.
   He chatted with police guards, laughed good naturedly during
sessions and shouted the Hebrew greeting ``Shalom'' to bystanders
as he was led handcuffed to and from court.
   He even tried to shake hands with a death camp survivor, who
recoiled in horror and called Demjanjuk a murderer.
   But any sympathy Demjanjuk might have won was virtually undone
by a stumbling defense team that seemed to move two steps backward
for every step forward.
   For months before the trial ended last week, Israelis stood in
line to get a seat in the converted movie theater where five
Holocaust survivors recounted how a guard called ``Ivan the
Terrible'' mutilated Jews with sadistic pleasure before driving
them into gas chambers at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland.
   But interest waned and frustration mounted when the survivors'
emotional accounts of Nazi atrocities were replaced by a
time-consuming, often repetitive debate over the issue of
identification.
   Demjanjuk, 67, a retired Ohio autoworker, maintains he is not
Ivan but an innocent victim of mistaken identity.
   ``This trial truly displayed the banality of justice,'' Ephraim
Zuroff, a New York-born Israeli and Nazi hunter, said in an
interview. ``There's no question that people got frustrated by the
triviality and technicalities.''
   Hundreds of exhibits, even a paperclip, were submitted in an
effort to determine the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution
evidence, Demjanjuk's alleged Nazi identity card.
   Six prosecution experts testified the card was authentic and an
equal number of defense witnesses maintained it was forged.
   Demjanjuk contended the document was fabricated by the Soviet
Union to punish him for fighting in an anti-communist unit at the
end of World War II.
   For many Israelis, there was a difference between Eichmann, the
man who masterminded Adolf Hitler's final solution, and Ivan, who
carried them out. Eichmann was convicted and hanged in 1962.
   Unlike Eichmann, whom spectators glimpsed only as he was tried
behind a bullet-proof screen, Demjanjuk had a human dimension that
intensified the emotion of the trial.
   The Ukrainian-born defendant's wife, Vera, his three children
and 2-year-old grandson frequently watched the proceedings from
front row seats and their anguish was recorded in Israeli
newspapers and on television.
   ``Shame on you! You have no heart!'' Mrs. Demjanjuk screamed
tearfully at prosecutors when the trial ended Thursday and accused
them of lying and failing to give her husband a fair trial.
   The three-judge panel, which has retired to review more than
15,000 pages of testimony and some 500 exhibits, is expected to
issue a verdict in April.
   If convicted, Demjanjuk faces a maximum penalty of death. But it
is widely believed the sentence will not exceed life in prison.
   On Thursday, one member of the audience, Holocaust survivor
Mordechai Fuchs, 63, displayed the pain of dozens of Nazi victims
who attended the proceedings over the year.
   Waving a tattered photograph of his parents, three brothers and
a sister killed at Treblinka, he sobbed: ``The defense lawyers are
liars. ... Why does this have to be such a performance?''
   But many Israelis believe the attempt to probe into details
showed the trial was fair.
   ``It wasn't a quick open-and-shut case,'' said Toby Greenwald, a
Cleveland-born Israeli. ``No matter what the verdict, no one can
ever say there wasn't enough time spent on detail. That's
important, because people will ask whether Jewish judges can be
fair in a war crimes trial.''
   Some of his supporters, however, claimed Demjanjuk did not get a
fair hearing, partly because of his own faltering defense team and
the trial's publicity. Some witnesses watched others testify on
Israel television before they took the stand.
   Demjanjuk, frustrated by his defense, fired Mark O'Connor of
Buffalo, N.Y., his attorney of seven years, midway through the
proceedings.
   Several defense witnesses were discredited, including one who
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide
after her credentials were called into question.
   Some of the defense arguments seemed bizarre. Even Demjanjuk
squirmed uncomfortably in his seat when a defense expert claimed
the Soviet secret service used ``thought power'' to kill its
enemies and inflict disasters on the West.
   Demjanjuk's own contradictory version of his whereabouts during
World War II also appeared to hurt his case.
   ``Until the defense began its case, I was not convinced of
Demjanjuk's guilt,'' said Ehud Offer, a 31-year-old Israeli
sculptor. ``But the defense itself has erased the doubts.''

   Fire officials and University of Vermont
researchers Saturday picked through the rubble of a nationally
known laboratory for maple tree research destroyed by fire.
   The laboratory at the university-affiliated Proctor Maple
Research Farm was engulfed in flames Friday night in a fire of
undetermined origin, university officials said.
   Frederick Laing, an associate professor long involved in
research at the farm, said efforts in recent years had centered on
finding a cause for declines in maple syrup production in Vermont
and around the Northeast.
   Much of that research had been looking into whether acid
precipitation, atmospheric pollutants carried into the Northeast on
winds out of the Midwest, was to blame for recent maple production
declines.
   Laing said Saturday that it was now ``generally agreed that it
(acid rain) is one of the stresses'' causing the slump in maple
sugaring. ``There's still some difficulty in assessing just how
large a part it plays.''
   The fire, which Laing said destroyed between $200,000 and
$250,000 worth of equipment, comes with this year's maple sugar
season about a month away. It was unclear Saturday whether the lab
or some replacement facility could be geared up in time.
   Rayburn Levigne, a UVM assistant vice president for buildings
and facilities, said while the cause of the fire was unknown, it
was not believed to have been arson.

<HEAD>Deer Snub Tunnels Meant to Protect Them From Busy Highways</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Possibly spooked by light at the end of
the tunnel, deer have been shy about using four passageways
recently installed for them under a new Maryland interstate highway.
   The State Highway Administration built four corrugated steel
culverts under sections of Interstate 97 near Annapolis in hopes of
encouraging animals to cross under instead of over the roadway.
   Researchers at the University of Maryland's Appalachian
Environmental Laboratory in Frostburg are trying to find out if
animals are using the underpasses. So far they've found mink, mice,
muskrat and raccoon, but no deer have ventured through the dimly
lighted pathways.
   ``To us, the opening (at the other end) looks fairly large,''
said William R. Gates, a graduate assistant working on the project.
``But for deer, it's like going into a cave or tunnel and they
aren't used to going into enclosures.''
   Several other states have tried culverts, but little has been
done to document their use.
   The state and federal highway administrations are funding the
$210,000, five-year study in hopes of finding a way to reduce the
number of animals killed on American highways.
   According to the Federal Highway Administration, an estimated
200,000 deer die each year on U.S. roads. However, Doug Smith, an
FHA ecologist, said the number was a conservative estimate. More
than 25,000 are killed each year on roads in states with high deer
populations, such as Pennsylvania.
   The study also aims to learn more about what happens to a
wildlife area when it is bisected by a highway. The interstate cuts
through woods near Crownsville State Hospital.
   Researchers are observing tracks and using a wildlife
surveillance system to monitor animal activity in the culverts.
Movement at the tunnel openings trips sensors on video cameras,
which film the activity day or night.
   ``So far we had a deer enter the culvert and then come back
out,'' Gates said.
   Recent flooding inside the tunnels might have discouraged some
animals from using them, but Gates said he suspected the culverts
might not be large enough.
   Three of the culverts are 15 feet high, 21 feet wide and about
as long as a football field. The fourth is even longer, at more
than 500 feet. Perhaps the deer assume they cannot get through what
they perceive is a tiny opening at the other end, Gates said.
   ``The only evidence I have is that we have had several deer
approach the culverts, but they have not gone in,'' he said.
   If the culverts prove successful, they would be a cheaper than
bridges, which cost four to five times more to build and maintain,
said William L. Branch, environmental specialist with Maryland's
highway administration.

   The Japan Communist Party has accused communist
North Korea of bombing a South Korean airliner that vanished with
115 aboard off the coast of Burma last November.
   The party, in an official publication obtained Saturday by The
Associated Press, stressed that communism has nothing to do with
terrorism and that true communists should denounce such violence.
   ``We firmly believe that the north actually did it,'' wrote
party Central Committee Chairman Kenji Miyamoto in the publication.
   North Korea has denied any involvement in the jet's
disappearance, and accused Seoul of engineering the incident to
malign Pyongyang.
   The Korean Air Boeing 707, on its way from the Middle East to
Seoul, disappeared on Nov. 29.
   On Jan. 15, a woman said in a public confession in Seoul that
she was a North Korean agent and that she and a male North Korean
agent had planted a bomb on the aircraft during an earlier leg of
the plane's flight.
   The woman, identified as Kim Hyon Hui, 26, said Kim Jong Il, son
and heir apparent of North Korean President Kim Il Sung, had
ordered the sabotage because he wanted to disrupt the 1988 Summer
Olympics, to begin in Seoul Sept. 17.
   The North Korean pair, traveling on forged Japanese passports,
left the plane in Abu Dhabi, its last stop before it vanished, flew
to Bahrain and were stopped for questioning at Bahrain Airport on
Dec. 1. Both swallowed poison before being questioned. The man died
but the woman survived. She was extradited to Seoul on Dec. 15.
   Japanese communists have been at odds with North Korean
communist leaders since the early 1970s over ideological
differences, often denouncing the personality cult surrounding Kim
Il Sung and Jong Il.

   The people of Dixon are reading about life in
Dickson, Siberia, thanks to the efforts of Mayor James Dixon and
his Soviet counterpart.
   This week, Dixon received 100 copies of the Dickson newspaper
``Sovetsky Taimyr,'' printed in English. Ordinarily, the daily
newspaper is printed only in Russian.
   ``We want this issue to link us like a bridge over the cold
ocean that lies between us. We want you to see ... that not so many
things divide us after all,'' editor-in-chief Albion Brechalov
wrote in a front-page story.
   The friendship between the two cities began in January, when the
mayor of Dickson, Siberia, sent New Year's greetings to the people
of Dixon, Ill.
   Mayor Dixon replied, suggesting a citizen exchange visit, and he
announced earlier this month that he had been notified that
Dickson's mayor, an interpreter and a journalist will visit Dixon
for a week, though no date has been set.
   The Dickson newspaper tries to show everyday life in that
Siberian city, which is roughly a third the size of Dixon, a
community of 15,000 in north-central Illinois. On the front page of
the newspaper, dated November 1987, is a picture of three bundled
woman eating ice cream bars.
   Half of the newspaper contains carefully written letters from
citizens expressing friendship and a hope for world peace. Some
also expressed opposition to the policies of President Reagan, who
spent his boyhood and high school years in Dixon.
   Mayor Dixon says he is sending Dickson 19 large photographs,
taken by local amateurs, that show life in Dixon.

   The government is sending tortilla-grams to
remind illegal aliens that the deadline to apply for immigration
amnesty is less than three months away.
   ``We're trying anything we can think of to get people the
information,'' said Jane Friday, an Immigration and Naturalization
Service spokeswoman.
   The INS has printed 80,000 Spanish-language reminders on
4-by-6-inch pieces of paper, and next week plans to send them to
tortilla factories in Brownfield, Odessa and Lovington, N.M., where
they will be stuffed into packages.
   ``We have had lots of publicity in larger areas. The purpose of
this grass-roots publicity campaign is to get out the word in the
smaller areas,'' Ms. Friday said.
   The text of the inserts says: ``Act now. Take advantage of the
legalization program. Amnesty ends May 4, 1988. If you have lived
in the United States illegally since before Jan. 1, 1982, perhaps
you qualify. For peace of mind, legalize your status. For more
information, please contact your local legalization office.''
   The bakeries agreed to include the reminders in their tortilla
packages as a public service and at no charge to the government,
Ms. Friday said.
   The INS has been using more traditional outlets _ churches,
schools and public service broadcasts _ to remind people in
metropolitan areas that the government's amnesty offer expires May
4.

   Yuri and Tanya Zieman got bad news again last
week. Their latest application for an exit visa was turned down by
Soviet authorities.
   Vladimir Tufeld learned Friday that he, too, had once more been
refused.
   Their disappointment was aggravated by the timing, for the
latest rejection notices arrived on the eve of Secretary of State
George Shultz's visit to Moscow, an event many Jewish
``refuseniks'' had hoped would help get them out.
   In the past, the Soviets often have lowered emigration barriers
just before high-level U.S.-Soviet talks, but there is no
indication Shultz's scheduled arrival on Sunday has had much effect.
   ``People are pinning so many hopes on him that I'm afraid it's
going to be a very pathetic frustration for many,'' Mrs. Zieman
said. ``There is nothing to pin your hopes on now.''
   A senior Western diplomat who watches trends in Soviet
emigration and other human rights matters, said, ``What had been
some fairly steady but limited improvement (last year) may have
come to a halt.''
   As for freeing of political prisoners, ``the process has
stopped'' following the release last year of dozens of religious,
humans rights and nationalist activists, the diplomat said. He
spoke only on condition he not be identified.
   Observers say one possible reason the flow of Jewish emigrants
appears to have slowed from last year's unusually high levels is
that the issue is receiving less official and public attention now.
   Most of the best-known ``refuseniks'' have left in recent
months, said one diplomatic analyst, and although thousands of
would-be emigrants are left behind, they aren't as well organized
and don't have as effective a voice as some of the Jewish activists
who have recently been granted exit visas.
   The Ziemans first applied for permission to emigrate when their
daughter, Vera, was a baby. Vera is now 11 years old and has grown
up knowing she and her family could leave at any time. But while
they wait, they are outcasts.
   Yuri Zieman, 50, lost his job as a computer programmer in the
biomedical field as soon as he applied to leave and worked until
recently as a janitor. The family's plight has taken on a new
urgency since Yuri suffered a potentially deadly aneurysm in the
brain several weeks ago and doctors warned him not to risk the
delicate surgery to repair the afflicted artery unless he can reach
the West.
   Although Zieman says he never had access to state secrets, the
only reason he and his family have been given for the authorities'
refusal to permit them to leave is that theirs is a ``security''
case.
   Tufeld's wife, Isolda, was granted a three-month visa in
December to enable her to have surgery for a brain tumor. She
remains in Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Md.,
after undergoing three operations last month, her husband said
Saturday.
   Jewish emigration reached a peak of about 51,000 in 1979, but
dropped after that as U.S.-Soviet relations worsened. In 1986,
fewer than 1,000 were allowed to emigrate. The number rose above
8,000 last year for the first time since 1979 but appears to have
reached a plateau or declined since the U.S.-Soviet summit in
December in Washington.
   Some refuseniks blame Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
public annoyance at being questioned repeatedly on the subject.
Others fear the U.S. government has lost some of its persistence in
the drive to improve relations and reach a strategic nuclear
weapons accord with the Kremlin.
   In the meantime, new groups of Jews are forming to press their
exit demands.
   One, calling itself the New Wave, announced it will hold
demonstrations every week in downtown Moscow to protest the refusal
of Soviet authorities to recognize its members' eligibility for
visas because they acknowledge they don't have immediate relatives
abroad.
   Another group, called the Second Generation, consists of young
people whose parents have spent years trying unsuccessfully to
leave the country. The children, many now in their teens or 20s,
have grown up expecting that one day they would go to the West with
their parents but now find they are barred, just as their parents
were.

   Richard Gephardt's past has become his
present, dredged up endlessly by Democratic presidential rivals who
ask whether his evolution on issues from abortion to busing is a
troubling lack of conviction.
   The attacks on Gephardt and his record could seriously damage
the Missourian's candidacy if voters come to perceive the six-term
congressman as insincere in his beliefs, according to political
professionals.
   ``It's clearly everybody's best shot at Gephardt,'' says
Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin.
   ``What voters are really looking for is somebody who says what
he means and means what he says during the election year.''
   Gephardt has switched his positions on issues such as abortion
and school busing since arriving in the House in 1977 to represent
a blue-collar St. Louis district.
   Gephardt explains his changes as a natural evolution of his
views and says they are unrelated to the start of his national
campaign. But Gephardt's Democratic presidential rivals suggest
they are flip-flops of political convenience.
   ``What I try to do in approaching issues is to do it from a
practical point of view, to ask what will solve a particular
problem,'' Gephardt has said. ``I have strong beliefs about things
_ arms control, Central American policy, tax reform, trade, health
care, Social Security and what have you _ but I don't come to those
from an ideological viewpoint. I try to look at the facts of a
particular issue.''
   The attacks against Gephardt heated up last week during a
Democratic debate in Texas when Sen. Albert Gore Jr. mentioned
several of Gephardt's voting zig-zags and said, ``I'm going to lay
it on the line, Dick. The next president has to be someone who the
people will believe will stay with his convictions.''
   Sen. Paul Simon employed a similar attack strategy against
Gephardt's voting record in television commercials aired during the
New Hampshire primary campaign. The ads asked voters whether they
could trust a candidate like Gephardt who had changed his positions.
   A Newsweek magazine poll of 284 Democratic leaders and
politicians rated Gephardt last among the party's seven
presidential candidates. The poll, taken on Feb. 17-19 and
published this week, asked if the candidates have been ``generally
consistent in their stands on issues or not.''
   Fifty-eight percent said Gephardt had not been consitent, and 38
percent said he had, according to the Newsweek poll. By contrast,
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who was sixth, was rated as
inconsistent by 38 percent and consistent by 49 percent and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who was first, received an 86
percent consistent rating and 5 percent inconsistent.
   ``Gephardt has obviously been wounded by the way that Simon
basically drew out his record,'' says Robert Squier, a Democratic
political consultant.
   But Squier contends it will be more difficult and far more
expensive for candidates like Gore to launch a similar TV offensive
against Gephardt in the South because of the large number of states
participating in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8.
   ``I would guess that the Gephardt people feel like they have
been through a near miss,'' says Squier.
   Here are some of Gephardt's positions.
   _Abortion: Gephardt started his career in Congress backing
anti-abortion constitutional amendments but dropped his support in
1986, saying there was ``no clear agreement in the country'' on an
amendment and that was hurting the chances for resolving the
controversial issue. He says he continues to oppose federal
financing of abortions but has pledged not to veto congressional
appropriations of such money if elected president.
   _Busing: Gephardt sponsored a constitutional amendment in the
97th Congress to prohibit forced busing of school children for
desegregation, a position in line with the views of his mostly
white working-class district in south St. Louis. He says he no
longer supports such an amendment because ``It's a completely
different situation.''
   ``The Justice Department and the courts are doing something very
different which I think is working,'' says Gephardt. ``Today they
use magnet schools, voluntary plans and other methods of trying to
get schools integrated, and I think they're much more effective.''
   _Social Security: In 1985, Gephardt joined with conservative
southern Democrats in supporting a deficit-cutting package that
eliminated cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other
federal retirement benefits. The proposal was rejected in the
House. In his presidential campaign, Gephardt says Social Security
should be taken out of the budget so it does not become entangled
in deficit-reduction fights on Capitol Hill. He also says he would
no longer support a freeze on Social Security adjustments.
   _Defense: In 1981, Gephardt reversed his long-standing
opposition to the MX missile and B-1 bomber and voted for the
weapons systems sought by President Reagan. In later years, he
renewed his opposition. Gephardt says he was wrong in changing his
position and did so to give President Reagan a bargaining chip in
arms control talks with the Soviet Union.
   Gephardt supported former President Carter's proposal for a
neutron bomb and in 1982 backed a Reagan push for production of new
chemical weapons. As president, Gephardt says, he would press for a
ban on all nerve gas and chemical weapons. He also is supporting a
liberal Democratic proposal to ban nuclear tests.
   _Taxes: Gephardt, a critic of Reagan's economic policies,
supported the administration's income tax cut proposal in 1981. He
initially voted against the GOP plan because he supported a
Democratic alternative. However, he backed the tax cut measure on
final passage as did several other Democratic leaders, including
House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski. Gephardt has
defended his vote, saying: ``Once we lost, the question was clear _
were we for a tax cut for the middle class or were we not.''
   _Education: In 1981, Gephardt voted for a conservative
Republican proposal to bar the Justice Department from using
federal money to block prayer and meditation in public schools.
Gephardt says his vote is consistent with his current view that
``you could have voluntary, silent prayer'' in schools. Gephardt,
who campaigns on the need for educational improvements, opposed
establishing the Education Department. He also has abandoned his
past support of tuition tax credits.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas on Saturday
vowed to launch more attacks on U.S. military advisers stationed in
the country and claimed American personnel have become directly
involved in combat.
   Washington last year provided more than $600 million in aid to
the centrist government fighting an 8-year-old war against
Marxist-led insurgents. Most of the aid was military or war-related.
   Commander Roberto Roca, a member of the high command of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, said in an interview
with the rebel radio station that U.S. personnel are becoming
increasingly involved in combat and repression.
   He said that makes them more likely to suffer the consequences
of insurgent activity.
   Roca's statement, broadcast by the rebels' Radio Venceremos, did
not appear to be a blanket threat against all Americans in El
Salvador. He referred to the 55 military advisers here training
Salvadoran government troops and to what he said was a contingent
of ``about 40 (American) civilians advising and directing the
repression of the people's movement.''
   ``This kind of personnel is also part of the counterinsurgency
campaign and because of that it will find itself increasingly the
object of popular combat,'' said Roca.
   ``For us, the Americans have always been those responsible for
this war; they have always sustained the war against the Salvadoran
people,'' he said. ``Consequently, the personnel they have fighting
here is a military objective of our forces.''
   He claimed the U.S. military advisers stationed at the
headquarters of the 6th Infantry Brigade in Usulutan, 70 southeast
of the capital San Salvador, took part in combat there Wednesday.
   An estimated 600 guerrillas attacked the base and a nearby
cotton cooperative in the rebel's biggest assault in 10 months.
Eighteen people died in the fighting.
   Col. Inocente Montano, commander of the 6th brigade, said there
were four U.S. advisers at the base when the rebels attacked. He
said the compound was never penetrated and that the advisers were
never in danger. But he added that ``they were ready, in case of
incursion, to help repel the attack.''
   Regulations governing the conduct of U.S. advisers here prohibit
them from participation in combat except in self defense.
   ``To the degree that the war's operation theater is widened, the
American advisers, the American personnel in those places ... will
find themselves increasingly up against direct military
operations,'' said Roca. ``That is to say their (the American)
military personnel will be going home wounded, dead.''
   Sgt. Gregory Fronius, the only military adviser to die in combat
here, was killed in March of last year during a guerrilla attack on
an army base in the northern province of Chalatenango.
   The rebels assassinated a U.S. officer here in 1983 and killed
four U.S. Marine embassy guards, two American businessmen and seven
other people in a machine gun attack on a San Salvador cafe in 1985.

   The dean of Harvard College has warned students
that anyone involved in racial incidents faces expulsion and other
disciplinary measures, but says his comments are general and not
provoked by any particular incident.
   ``In dealing with situations where harassment, discrimination or
insensitivity come to light, the college is ready to respond firmly
and with appropriate actions,'' Dean Alfred Jewett said in an open
letter to the Harvard community.
   ``In cases where physical harassment of students by other
members of the community occurs, there is a general principle that
the harasser should be asked to leave the community,'' said the
letter, published Friday by the student newspaper, The Harvard
Crimson.
   The letter was issued a week after minority students at
University of Massachusetts in Amherst took over a campus building
to protest campus racism. The students left the building Wednesday
after meeting with the school chancellor.
   In a telephone interview, Jewett said the letter was issued to
lay down principles in the wake of deliberations with a committee
on racial relations that was set up last year.
   Harvard and the committee of students and faculty members
decided to ``come out with a series of messages that would alert
the community to problems that might exist and do exist in some
communities,'' Jewett said. ``Mine is the first statement.''
   Four white students were expelled for a year last fall after
frozen fruit was hurled at a black student, who later received
several racially derogatory telephone calls.
   Jewett said ``we have had no major things'' outside of that
incident. The decision to issue the open letter was made later, in
December, but its publication was postponed until after exams.
   The Crimson said questions of racism were raised earlier this
month after students alleged that a professor made unspecified
disparaging comments about blacks and Indians during a course
called ``The Peopling of America.''
   Harvard officials who asked to remain anonymous said they were
aware of the allegations but said no investigation would be made
unless a formal complaint was made.
   Harvard College, made up of Harvard University's undergraduate
institutions, has an enrollment of 6,400.

<HEAD>Center-Left Party Endorses Mitterrand For Re-Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The small Left Radical Movement party said Saturday
it was endorsing Socialist President Francois Mitterrand for
re-election, even though he hasn't declared himself a candidate.
   The center-left party, which has two members in the 577-seat
National Assembly, decided at its national convention to support
Mitterrand in the April 24 election, said party spokesman Emile
Zuccarelli.
   ``The possibility that Mr. Mitterrand will not be a candidate is
so unlikely that it wasn't even worth our considering,'' Zuccarelli
told reporters.
   The Socialists, by far the strongest leftist party, are waiting
for Mitterrand to announce his decision before making an
endorsement. He is expected to make his plans known in the middle
of March and is expected to be a candidate.
   Public opinion polls indicate Mitterrand has far more popular
support than the best-known declared candidates _ Premier Jacques
Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre. The two conservatives are
running neck-and-neck for second place.
   Other declared candidates include Jean-Marie Le Pen of the
extreme-right National Front, Andre Lajoinie of the Communists and
Pierre Juquin, a dissident Communist. None is given much chance of
making the runoff, which will be held May 8 between the top two
vote-getters unless one candidate wins more than 50 percent April
24.
   The Radical Movement was France's leading party before World War
II, with a progressive, anti-clerical program. It has gradually
lost strength, and it split in the 1970s into the Left Radicals and
the center-right Valoisian Radicals, who participate in Chirac's
coalition government.

<HEAD>Military Places Units On Full Alert Around Manila Following
Killings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military chief of staff put all
troops and police in the Manila area on full alert Saturday to
prevent disruption of second anniversary celebrations of President
Corazon Aquino's rise to power.
   Gen. Renato de Villa said he also placed the alert after the
killings of at least six people on Manila streets in the past two
weeks, the government-run Philippine News Agency reported.
   Authorities have blamed the ambushes and slayings on communist
guerillas.
   De Villa also ordered the arrest Saturday of a navy captain
linked to the 1986 murder of a leftist labor leader, but the
officer refused to leave his home, saying the arrest papers were
not in order.
   De Villa canceled all military leaves and ordered his troops to
intensify patrols and set up nighttime mobilecheckpoints, the
agency said.
   The celebrations next week mark the Feb. 26, 1986
civilian-military coup that placed Mrs. Aquino in power after
ousting President Ferdinand Marcos, who now lives in exile in
Hawaii.
   The military said earlier this month that it uncovered plans by
communist rebels to step up slayings in the Manila area this year.
More than 130 policemen and soldiers were killed in the capital
last year.
   Military field reports reaching Manila Saturday said at least
six communist New People's Army guerrillas were killed and one
soldier wounded in clashes Friday in Surigao del Norte and Bukidnon
provinces on the southern island of Mindanao.
   In Cebu City, 350 miles southeast of Manila, police said they
discovered Friday the bodies of five people who they believed were
executed by rebels on suspicion of being military informers.
   Navy Capt. Rex Robles meanwhile denied involvement in the
November 1986 murder of leftist labor leader Rolando Olalia and
refused to accompany arresting officers because they carried only a
photocopy of de Villa's arrest order, Robles' lawyer told reporters.
   In the order, de Villa said Robles was being arrested ``in
connection'' with the slaying of the charismatic chairman of the
May 1st Movement, one of the Philippines' largest labor federations.
   Attorney Armando Marcelo told reporters that Robles challenged
the government to present evidence of his involvement.
   The arresting officers left Robles' guarded home after he
refused to go with them, Marcelo said.

   Future peace talks between Nicaragua's
leftist government and its Contra rebels are likely to have a
political hue the Sandinistas never wanted.
   The government appeared to open the door to political
discussions with its armed opponents by belatedly agreeing in
principle last week to a proposal by the mediator of the
negotiations, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, head of the Roman
Catholic Church in Nicaragua.
   That proposal called on the Contras to accept a cease-fire in
exchange for four major concessions by the Sandinista government.
The concessions were something the Contras had been seeking, and
they were quick to accept the cardinal's plan.
   The government was called upon to grant unrestricted freedom of
the press and a total, unconditional amnesty for political
prisoners, renew a dialogue with its internal opposition and review
its universal military conscription law.
   Whether it was a tactical error or a considered response, the
Sandinistas delayed in taking a position that President Daniel
Ortega has long and strenuously opposed. On innumerable occasions
in the past, he has said he would never discuss political matters
with the Contras.
   ``We don't want to create the impression that we don't want a
cease-fire and are being intransigent,'' said Paul Reichler, a
Washington, D.C., attorney who advises the Sandinistas. ``At all
costs, we want the negotiations to go forward.''
   Reichler's comments came in a chat with reporters Friday after
Obando y Bravo abruptly suspended the latest round of peace talks a
day before they were supposed to end and obliquely blamed the
Sandinistas for the breakdown.
   Ortega said Saturday in Managua that the cardinal's proposal
``was not rejected'' by the Sandinistas and said his government
``is willing to continue the conversations.''
   But a clarification was needed on the withdrawal of the Contras
to enclaves during the truce, Ortega said at the close of a
government meeting.
   He repeated that his government is willing to apply an amnesty
once a cease-fire is in effect. Referring to the military draft, he
said ``it is logical that with the end of the war the military
service will not require the current volume (of soldiers).''
   Ortega told the meeting on new economic measures aimed at
fighting inflation that ``enemies of the revolution'' opposed the
measures. He said the right, the extreme left and the opposition
daily La Prensa should be careful not to stir up insurrection.
   The cardinal said after his return to Managua on Saturday that
with the suspension of talks, ``We have given time for reflection
since there is a lack of trust between the two sides.''
   Appearances are of vital importance to both sides, with neither
party wanting to be seen as the spoiler as long as there is any
remaining chance the U.S. Congress might approve additional
military aid for the Contras.
   In private talks with reporters, the Sandinistas made it clear
that they were initially surprised by the cardinal's five-point
proposal, then disappointed by his abrupt cancellation of the talks.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, said
Obando halted the negotiations Friday afternoon before he had a
chance to deliver the government's formal, written response to the
proposal the cardinal put forth Thursday.
   But Tinoco insisted that he had discussed the government's
position at length with the cardinal Friday morning and had not
been given any reason to believe that the cardinal was unwilling to
continue the negotiations.
   The cardinal ``did not tell us he disagreed'' with the
government's position, Reichler told reporters later.
   In its written response, the government declared its ``agreement
in principle'' with the cardinal's proposal, but carefully
conditioned its answers to his requests that it reconsider its
mandatory draft law and grant an unconditional amnesty to the
thousands of political prisoners in Nicaraguan jails.
   But before Nicaragua's formal response was delivered, Obando had
canceled the talks, saying he was disappointed that both sides had
not accepted his proposal, at least in principle. The remark was
clearly aimed at the Sandinistas.
   But late or not, the government's response clearly put such
political matters as press freedom and amnesty on the bargaining
table for further talks and, given the opening, the Contras are
likely to push for even greater concessions.
   The cardinal is expected to announce a time and place for a
third round of face-to-face negotiations sometime this week. The
first round of talks took place in San Jose, Costa Rica, in late
January, only a week before the House rejected President Reagan's
latest request for about $43 million in additional Contra aid.
   But the administration is considering a new bid for military aid
for the rebels, and as long as that possibility exists, both sides
will be playing their cards cautiously at the bargaining table.

   New York Post employees cheered and uncorked
champagne Saturday after news that owner Rupert Murdoch reached
agreement with 10 unions to save the nation's oldest continuously
published daily newspaper.
   ``It has been a nightmare, but thank God, we're still in
business,'' said Lenny Higgins, president of the Newspaper
Pressmen's Union.
   The deal will enable Murdoch to sell the Post to real estate
developer Peter Kalikow. It involves a $22 million cost-reduction
package that fell into place just before 2 a.m. when Murdoch said
he would provide $3 million to the unions to satisfy the terms of
his sale agreement.
   The unions had already agreed to concessions totaling $19
million and said they could not give any more.
   Cheers, deep sighs and the fizz of champagne filled the Post's
fourth-floor newsroom when the agreement was announced. Some
employees had worn black to mourn the paper's possible death.
   ``I feel great,'' said Jerry Cronin, head of the drivers' union.
``I feel we salvaged something that at five (minutes) of two
(o'clock) was gone.''
   Murdoch had set a 2 p.m. Friday deadline for closing the paper,
and extended it with time almost out.
   Kalikow will take over the Post for $37.6 million on March 7
pending rank-and-file ratification of the concessions and
verification by his accountants of the details.
   His spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said Kalikow was considering
editorial changes that could tone down the Post's brassy style and
was committed to keeping the paper operating.
   ``There will be some changes in the format and appearance of the
paper but he's not yet ready to discuss the changes in detail,''
Rubenstein said. Many of the expected changes come from suggestions
by Post employees.
   The new owner will meet with union leaders immediately to
discuss his plans, Rubenstein said.
   ``He wants to assure them he bought the paper so it could
continue being a powerful voice in New York City and that he did
not buy it for the real estate,'' Rubenstein said. ``He will try to
make it a very New York paper.
   ``It seems his whole life now is involved with the Post. He's
gone into it with great vigor.''
   Kalikow faces stiff problems in a highly competitive market. The
Daily News and New York Newsday are also fighting for tabloid
readers and The New York Times maintains a strong leadership in
advertising revenue.
   The Post was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton and other
investors and during its long history has come close to folding
several times. The latest threat came from a federal law that
forced Murdoch to sell the financially troubled tabloid because he
also owns a New York City television station, WNYW-TV.
   He had said the Post was losing $100,000 a day and that he had
lost $150 million since he bought it in 1976 for $31 million.
   After Saturday's agreement was announced, Murdoch said, ``I
would do it all again. I ... hate to leave it.''
   The $22 million package presented to Kalikow will eliminate 130
of the 1,012 union jobs at the Post, some immediately and some
later over the three-year life of the deal. The paper has about
1,200 employees.
   ``I don't think there's any question that without Murdoch's
contribution of $3 million, the paper would have definitely shut
down,'' lawyer and mediator Theodore Kheel said. ``I would give him
the lion's share of the credit.''
   The package to keep the Post afloat consists of $22 million in
lost jobs and pay cuts and $3 million from Murdoch's News America
Corp. to restore the pay cuts. Because of that contribution, no
paycheck will be smaller for the employees who remain.
   Kheel said Murdoch referred to the $3 million he put into the
settlement as his farewell gift to the Post and its employees.

   President Daniel Ortega said Saturday
that the right, the extreme left and the opposition newspaper La
Prensa should ``be careful, because they can in fact provoke an
insurrection that can destroy them.''
   Speaking at the closing of the leftist government's meeting on
new economic measures, Ortega said ``enemies of the revolution,''
including the political opposition, the U.S. government and La
Prensa, opposed new economic steps announced by his administration
the past week.
   He called La Prensa ``the daily of the CIA.''
   The opposition from both sides of the political spectrum and the
Superior Council of Private Enterprise, Ortega said, ``have said
that the time for an insurrection has come.''
   He said they should not ``be looking for five feet on the cat
because they may find them. They should be careful, because if they
put themselves on the side of the Contras and the aggressors they
are going to stir winds that can provoke tempests.''
   The Superior Council of Private Enterprise is the most important
private business organization in Nicaragua.
   Adding more teeth to the economic measures announced earlier,
Ortega announced one- to four-year prison sentences for
speculators. He said taxi drivers and others who work in
transportation would have their vehicles confiscated if they
charged more than the official prices.
   He also announced a 10 percent reduction in the national budget
and a tax exemption for 22,900 families whose housing loans were
forgiven by the government.
   The exact amount of the budget is not known and he did not
elaborate on where the cuts would be made.
   Those and other measures announced the past week are ``to give
the economy a push and fight inflation,'' he said.
   The Sandinista government on Monday created a new cordoba
currency worth 1,000 times as much as the old one and pegged it at
10 to the dollar.
   It also raised salaries to five times what they were in December
and authorized price increases of up to more than 50 percent on
some basic goods.
   Although the measures were designed to slow inflation, which was
1,500 percent for 1987, prices already were being hiked beyond the
new official levels.
   Ortega issued a decree that requires individuals and
corporations to report any foreign currency holdings of more than
$500.
   A stamped, signed copy of a report of the holdings to one of the
country's banks will be legal authorization for the owner to keep
the money, said the decree issued Friday. Reports must be filed
within 15 days but are not required if the funds are deposited in
state-owned banks.
   Failure to follow the rules will be considered a currency
violation, punishable by one to three years in prison under a 1981
law.
   Another decree authorizes the government's Central Bank to
investigate large deposits of old cordobas if there are suspected
of being linked to illegal activity.
   Groups from Sandinista Defense Committees, civilian neighborhood
organizations, accompanied by police, have raided storerooms of
alleged black market businesses and public markets to confiscate
goods and force vendors to sell at official prices.
   Ortega compared the economic measures to ``a strong medicine''
for a sick person.
   ``As long as the war doesn't end, we are going to try to have
the patient recover to better confront the aggressor,'' he said.
   The Contra rebels, which have been supported by the U.S.
government, have been fighting more than six years to overthrow the
Sandinistas.

   A woman pleaded innocent Saturday to a
charge that she killed one of her five former husbands, who died
two years ago of arsenic poisoning, but she remained in jail in
lieu of $200,000 bond, authorities said.
   Joan Hensley Davis, 54, was arrested Friday and charged with
first-degree murder in the 1986 death of James H. Hensley, said St.
Clair County State's Attorney John Baricevic.
   ``My client is in disbelief about the whole thing,'' attorney
Judy Cates said in a telephone interview.
   The southern Illinois woman, who now has a sixth husband, is
``not wealthy'' and was having trouble coming up with the bond,
Mrs. Cates said.
   Her husband ``is standing beside her,'' said Mrs. Cates, who did
not know his name.
   Ms. Davis was widowed by two of her husbands and was divorced
from the other three, Mrs. Cates said.
   Ms. Davis entered her innocent plea before Associate Judge
Robert Craig, who informed her she could face a minimum of 20 years
and a maximum of 40 years if convicted.
   Hensley, 62, of Shiloh, died March 8, 1986, at Memorial Hospital
in Belleville, and the initial autopsy showed he had died from
arsenic poisoning, said Illinois State Police Capt. Philip Kocis.
   ``It's unusual for a case to be charged two years after the
offense,'' Baricevic said. ``But we didn't feel we had enough
evidence to present to a jury until now.
   ``We had some problems, and all the questions about them will be
answered at the trial. We'd rather not discuss them until the
trial.''
   ``In an in-depth investigation like this, there are obviously no
witnesses to the crime. We have to rule out all accidental causes,
so it takes a long time,'' Kocis said.
   He said the death of the other man who died while being married
to Ms. Davis was not currently under investigation, but he refused
to say whether it had ever been investigated. He said he did not
know the man's name or when he died.
   ``The investigation is concentrated on (Hensley's) death at this
particular time,'' Kocis said.

   The parents of former PTL president Jim
Bakker have applied for unemployment benefits after being laid off
from their jobs as greeters at Heritage USA, PTL's religious theme
park.
   Raleigh Bakker, 81, and his wife, Furnia, 81, were laid off Jan.
29 from their $500-a-month jobs. They still live at the resort.
   ``It's pretty hard to take when you've been independent all your
life and then you have to go down for unemployment,'' Raleigh
Bakker said Friday.
   ``We love the Bakkers,'' PTL spokeswoman Linda Ivey said. ``We
hope they will continue to feel a part of the family. But there
have been numerous positions we have had to reduce.''
   The work force has fallen from 2,700 to 900 since 1985, she said.
   Jim Bakker resigned from PTL in March after admitting a sexual
encounter. A federal grand jury in Charlotte is investigating him
and his aides for possible mail, wire and tax fraud.
   At Heritage USA, Raleigh and Furnia Bakker spent mornings in the
PTL studio shaking hands with visitors, and afternoons at the
Heritage Grand Hotel.
   The elder Bakker gets $600 a month in Social Security and his
wife gets $300 a month. He said his house, valued at $125,500, is
paid for.
   ``We haven't been off that long, but we can't live this way
indefinitely,'' he said. He said he must pay taxes, plus home
insurance and upkeep.
   The Bakkers said they must seek jobs at least three times a week
to receive unemployment checks. Bakker plans to apply for PTL
openings _ at the hotel and at restaurants they frequent.

   A roofer who apparently was trying to break
into a bank by shimmying down an air vent was trapped upside-down
in the vent for five hours Saturday, police said.
   Raymond Mention of Bayshore suffered minor injuries to his right
arm and collar bone and bruises on his face, said Officer Thomas
Sorriano, a Suffolk County police spokesman.
   ``This is the first time in my life I've ever been so glad to
see a bunch of cops,'' Mention told his rescuers.
   Employees of the Long Island Savings Bank in Islip arrived at
work at 8:45 a.m. and heard a man calling for help, Sorriano said.
   When the officers reached the roof, they found a roofer's belt
and tools, the vent, and then discovered Mention's feet ``wiggling
up in the air,'' said Officer Mark Ryan.
   ``He told them he tried to get in feet first and when he
couldn't, he tried head first,'' Ryan said. ``He had nothing to
hold on to and fell in.''
   The officers kept Mention talking while they tried to get the
blood circulating in his legs and pry him from the curve in the
2-foot-by-2-foot vent where he had become lodged, he said.
   When he was finally freed, Mention asked for the time, was told
it was 9 a.m., and said he had been stuck for five hours, Ryan said.
   Mention was taken to Southside Hospital, where he was treated
and released into police custody. The roofer was charged with
criminal mischief; other charges were pending, said Sorriano.
Arraignment was scheduled for Sunday.

<HEAD>Journalist Mildred Seydell Dies At 98</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mildred Seydell, a globe-trotting journalist who
interviewed Benito Mussolini and covered the Scopes ``monkey
trial,'' died Saturday. She was 98.
   Ms. Seydell, a resident of the suburban Atlanta town of Roswell,
once said she ``much preferred to set the stage for adventure
rather than the table for dinner.'' Her work as a writer and
columnist for Hearst publications, including the now-defunct
Atlanta Georgian newspaper, took her around the world.
   She wrote ``Talks With Celebrities,'' including an interview
with the Italian dictator Mussolini, for Universal News Service and
27 Hearst papers. She also covered for Hearst the 1925 Tennessee
trial of John Scopes, a teacher indicted for illegally teaching the
theory of evolution.
   Ms. Seydell was a columnist for the Atlanta Georgian from 1926
to 1939, the year the paper closed.
   Born Mildred Woolley in Atlanta, she married Paul Seydel, a
chemist she met while studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, in 1910.
She added an ``l'' to Seydel and adopted the name for her writing.
   She is survived by two sons, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.

   Angola's UNITA rebels said Saturday they
killed 16 enemy soldiers in recent fighting and shot down a fighter
plane, killing a Cuban pilot.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
said in a statement distributed in Lisbon that guerrillas killed 14
Angolan soldiers and two Cubans in an attack Feb. 12 on two army
battalions close to the strategic southern town of Cuito Cuanavale.
   The rebels, supported by the United States and South Africa,
said guerrilla anti-aircraft guns shot down a Soviet-built MIG-23
fighter jet the same day, killing the Cuban pilot.
   UNITA also claimed rebels ambushed a train and destroyed the
locomotive during the first two weeks of February between the towns
of Catete and Botomona in central Luanda province.
   The guerrillas said they had also captured the town of Luquembo
and two army garrisons in cenetral Malange province.
   The statement gave rebel casualties in recent fighting as two
killed and nine wounded.
   UNITA has been fighting to force Angola's Soviet- and
Cuban-backed government to share power since 1975, when Angola
gained independence from Portugal.

   A flash rainstorm caused floods
and mudslides that left at least 70 people dead Saturday. As many
as 95 others were feared dead after an avalanche of mud and
boulders crashed into a nursing home.
   Firemen used surfboards and the navy used amphibious vehicles to
rescue people stranded by the storm, which began late Friday night
and left about 3,150 homeless.
   State Health director Jose Noronha said at least 70 died and 80
to 95 more were feared dead. The same number of victims was
reported by Civil Defense spokesman Bruno Avila, who said the death
toll could be even higher because of mudslides in poor shantytowns
that line mountainsides in this city of 5.6 million.
   The four-hour downpour dumped 4.88 inches on Rio and left many
streets under 5 feet of water.
   Mayor Roberto Saturnino Braga declared the city a disaster area,
called in all off-duty municipal doctors and canceled a
post-Carnival Parade of Champions scheduled for Saturday night.
   ``There is nothing to celebrate now. There is only sorrow,''
said Martinho da Vila, a popular samba composer who performed in
the famous Carnival festivities here a week ago.
   The Vila Isabel neighborhood, whose samba school won this year's
top Carnival prize and which celebrated Wednesday with an all-night
victory party, was one of the most rain-battered zones in the city.
   State troopers were sent out to prevent the looting of stores
and stop holdups of drivers whose cars had broken down in the high
water.
   Avila said most of the 70 deaths occurred in poor slum areas,
where housing is precarious and drains and sewers often nonexistent.
   James Lewis, a rescue work coordinator in the mayor's office,
said: ``We are accustomed to tragedies in our slums, but this was
too much. Something definitely must be done to protect slum people
from rainstorms.''
   A mudslide knocked down one three-story wing of the three-wing
Santa Genoveva Hospital, a Social Security nursing home in Santa
Teresa, a well-to-do mountainside neighborhood. There was little
hope that the estimated 80 to 95 elderly patients there would get
out alive.
   ``There is so much wood and concrete there we don't believe
anybody could survive,'' Avila said.
   At sundown the rescue efforts were called off for the day.
   ``It was awful. All my friends were dead in an instant,'' Maria
Teixeira, one of 350 patients evacuated from the two other wings of
the hospital, told a TV interviewer as she lay in a stretcher.
   Boulders and mud left by the storm held up rescuers for three
hours on their way to the nursing home.
   ``Old people were left standing in the rain and chill all that
time. I don't know how they endured it,'' Lewis said.
   The storm, accompanied by near nonstop thunder and lightning,
knocked out telephones and international communications and stopped
commuter trains.
   Even the fire department and Civil Defense were without phones
for a while and had to rely on radio to coordinate rescue work.
   Earlier this month, rain caused flooding and mudslides that
killed about 206 people and drove 13,000 from their homes in Rio de
Janeiro state. The hardest-hit spot then was Petropolis, a mountain
resort 40 miles north of the city of Rio.

<HEAD>Extradition Ordered for Captured IRA Activist; Haughey Welcomes
Limits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Irish Prime Minister welcoming
extradition limits with Britain, quotes, details, background.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SLIGO, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court Saturday ordered the extradition
of a prominent Irish Republican Army activist to Northern Ireland.
Prime Minister Charles Haughey, citing a separate case, welcomed
limits on extraditions to Britain.
   Owen Carron, 34, a former member of the British Parliament and a
leading member of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, had
been sought since he jumped bail on a weapons charge in Northern
Ireland two years ago.
   Police arrested him Friday night in the southwestern county of
Sligo, about 20 miles from the Northern Ireland border, after an
officer recognized him.
   The District Court in Sligo ordered Carron extradited to
British-ruled Northern Ireland but gave him 15 days to appeal the
order. The court ordered that he remain in custody pending appeal.
   In Dublin, Haughey said Saturday that a British court's refusal
to free six Irishmen accused of IRA bombings showed the need for
restrictions on the extradition of terrorist suspects to Britain.
   Dublin inserted new conditions Dec. 1 for extradition to
Britain. The measures include the requirements that British
authorities produce evidence on warrants in all extradition cases,
and that the Irish attorney general approve all extraditions.
   Britain has a ``historic inability ... to comprehend Irish
feelings and sensitivities,'' Haughey said in a speech to the
annual conference of the governing Fianna Fail party.
   Britain long has criticized the Irish Republic's reluctance to
extradite suspects sought for trial in connection with Irish
Republican Army actions. The IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
mainly Roman Catholic Ireland.
   Haughey said the need for restrictions was exemplified by the
case of six Irishmen sentenced to life in prison for IRA's bombings
of two Birmingham pubs in 1974 that killed 21 people.
   Britain's Court of Appeal upheld their convictions last month,
rejecting arguments that new evidence undermined the confessions
and forensic findings that sent them to prison.
   ``The wisdom of, and the necessity for, the effective safeguards
provided in our extradition legislation has been clearly
confirmed,'' Haughey said. ``These safeguards are now in place and
it is on the basis of these safeguards, or not at all, that
extradition will proceed.''
   Carron's case was not affected by the legislation because
warrants seeking his extradition were issued in November, before
introduction of the new regulations.
   Carron came to prominence in 1981 when he was the election
officer for Bobby Sands, who launched a seven-month IRA hunger
strike at Belfast's Maze Prison that year.
   Sands, who was elected to the British Parliament while behind
bars, and nine other IRA members starved themselves to death during
the protest over prison regulations. When Sands died, Carron won
his parliamentary seat.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
had been hunting Carron since he jumped bail in January 1986 on a
charge of possessing a soldier's rifle. He had been released on
bail to run as a Sinn Fein candidate in special elections to the
British Parliament.
   After being defeated in the election, Carron failed to report
back to jail.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Leaves Haiti</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An opposition leader who led two
unsuccessful invasions during the Duvalier family dictatorship left
the country Saturday after spending six months holed up in an
embassy, said Haiti Radio Inter.
   Bernard Sansaricq, who was granted political asylum by the
Argentine Embassy after the Haitian government accused him of
urging peasants to revolt, boarded an Eastern Airlines flight bound
for Miami at 5 p.m., the independent radio station said.
   Sansaricq, head of the National Peoples Party, was driven to the
airport in an Argentine Embassy limousine, accompanied by four
carloads of Haitian soldiers, the radio said.
   President Leslie Manigat, in an address on state television
Friday night, promised safe conduct ``for all of those in political
asylum.''
   Sansaricq, in his mid-40s, was the only person known to have
been in political asylum in Haiti.
   He was accused Aug. 3 last year of attempting to provoke a
revolution in Jeremie, his hometown, on the tip of Haiti's
southwestern peninsula. After a shootout with soldiers, he and
several supporters fled into the surrounding hills and disappeared
for three weeks.
   The military claimed he arrived with a group of armed men and
distributed weapons to peasants in the town.
   Sansaricq denied the charges. Sansaricq said in a radio address
from the Argentine Embassy on Aug. 25 that he had been armed only
with a revolver, for which he claimed to have a license.
   He said he went to Jeremie to attend a trial of people accused
of taking part in a massacre in 1964. Sansaricq said hundreds of
upper class mulatto families and suspected opponents of dictator
Francois Duvalier were massacred by soldiers and the Tontons
Macoutes, Duvalier's secret police.
   The government has never acknowledged the killings.
   Sansaricq, whose entire family was slain in the massacre, said
the army wanted to kill him since his testimony would have
implicated high ranking officers, including Defense Minister
Williams Regala, a reserve army brigidier general and former member
of the military-run junta.
   Sansaricq, who at one time owned a gas station in south Florida,
led foiled invasions in 1963 and 1982 during the 29-year
dictatorship of Francois Duvalier and his son, Jean Claude. He
lived in Miami from the early 1960s until 1986, when Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled into exile in France.
   The 1963 invasion occurred in Jeremie. He escaped, but 12
colleagues were captured and shot by a military firing squad. In
1982, he landed on the island of La Tortue on Haiti's northern
coast. Eight people died in the 1982 invasion and Sansaricq and
others were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.

   An earthquake rattled central Colombia
Saturday evening, sending people in Bogota's high-rise apartments
and office buildings fleeing into the streets.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries from hospitals, fire
stations and police stations, according to the Colombian radio
network RCN.
   The tremor measured 5 on the Richter scale and the epicenter was
in the Andes about 50 miles south of Bogota, said the Geophysical
Institute of the Andes, according to RCN.
   The earthquake at 5:52 p.m. lasted three seconds and slight
aftershocks were registered 12 minutes later, a spokesman for the
Bogota institute said in the RCN report.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage in the local area.

   A mob stoned one candidate's car, leaving
four injured, and at least one candidate was arrested for bad debts
as hundreds of political hopefuls registered for next month's
parliamentary elections.
   Daily Nation, an independent Nairobi newspaper, said supporters
of an opponent hurled stones Friday at the motorcade of Nahashon
Njuno, an assistant minister for tourism and wildlife in the
outgoing government.
   The attack took place at Kirinyaga, in central Kenya, where
Njuno was presenting papers qualifying him to stand in the March 21
elections.
   Njiru was among nearly 750 candidates who presented election
papers Friday at administration centers across the country.
   Candidates are contesting 188 Parliamentary seats. There are 202
seats in the Kenyan Parliament. Twelve members of Parliament are
nominated by the president.
   Kenya is a one-party state and all candidates must be approved
by President Daniel Arap Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union.
   In the western town of Nakuru, police arrested John Njenga
Mungai for failure to pay a $42 debt as he was about to present his
papers, according to another independent newspaper, The Standard.
   Mungai paid the money he owed the Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting for advertisements on state-owned television, the
newspaper said.
   The ruling Kenya African National Union disqualifies anyone
owing the government money from contesting.
   William Odongo Omamo, minister for research, science and
technology in the outgoing government, failed to get clearance to
run for election because officials said he had not paid a $1.1
million debt owed to the government.
   Daily Nation also reported that the High Court on Friday issued
a warrant for the arrest of candidate James Muriuki, a member of
Parliament in the 1970s, for not paying $4,640 in rent on a Nairobi
house as ordered by the court in 1983.
   Abisai Masinde, candidate for western Emuhaya constituency said
he nearly did not make it to present his election papers because he
was kidnapped.
   Masinde told The Standard, another independent newspaper, that
he was forced into the back seat of a car Thursday morning when he
was shopping at a market in western Kakamega.
   The kidnappers drove around with him until Friday afternoon,
when they released him without giving a reason for holding him,
Masinde said.

   Frigid air slid across the Great Lakes and into the Midwest on
Saturday and made temperatures fall rapidly, and rain fell over
sections of the Southeast, pushing some streams close to flood
stage.
   The temperature at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., crashed from a mild
30 degrees with light wind at around 5 a.m. to 16 degrees at 7 a.m.
EST, with strong northerly wind and half-mile visibility in blowing
snow. By 11 a.m., it was one degree above zero with a wind chill of
30 to 40 degrees below zero.
   By afternoon, snow and falling temperatures were common
throughout Michigan and snowdrifts blocked some highways on the
Upper Peninsula. The temperature at Lansing dropped 9 degrees in 15
minutes.
   The cold front moved through the Chicago area and roads were
iced by one to 4 inches of snow. Visibility dropped to around a
quarter of a mile in snow and blowing snow in northern Indiana.
   In the Southeast, rain was widespread from the eastern Carolinas
across southern Georgia and northern Florida to the southeast tip
of Louisiana. Cecil Field Naval Air Station at Jacksonville, Fla.,
measured 1.25 inches of rain in the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST.
   A flood warning was issued for the Satilla River in southeastern
Georgia and other rivers in northern Florida and southern Georgia
were swollen to near flood stage, with more rain expected, the
National Weather Service said.
   In Maine, moderate to heavy rain fell at Eastport while to the
north at Caribou it was cold enough for 3 inches of snow to fall in
the morning, bringing the city's total snow depth to 30 inches.
   Elsewhere, light snow fell across sections of the northern and
central Plains during the morning with an inch of snow at both
Grand Island, Neb., and Rapid City, S.D.
   High wind blew across parts of Colorado with gusts to 61 mph
recorded at Boulder. A high wind warning was issued for areas along
the eastern slopes of the Montana Rockies with gusts to 70 mph
possible.
   Florida also was a study in sharp temperature contrasts. At 2
p.m., Miami had a record 86 and Daytona Beach was a toasty 85, also
a record. But at the same time at Jacksonville, 90 miles north of
Daytona Beach, it was rainy and 57 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn., to 88 at Orlando, Fla. The
low for the day was 22 degrees below zero at Warroad.
   For Sunday, rain was forecast over much of Florida with
scattered thunderstorms in the southern part of the peninsula. Snow
showers were forecast in northern Maine. Snow or snow showers also
were forecast from northern West Virginia to western New York and
from Michigan across Wisconsin and Minnesota to eastern North
Dakota.
   Highs in the teens or 20s were predicted from northern New
England across the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley to the upper
Mississippi Valley; in the 30s or 40s from southern New England
across the mid-Atlantic states, the Carolinas, the Tennessee
Valley, the middle and lower Mississippi Valley and the Missouri
Valley to the eastern Dakotas; and over inland parts of the
Northwest; in the 70s in coastal and southern California, southern
Arizona and the southern tip of Texas; in the 70s to low 80s in
southern Florida; and in the 50s or 60s in most of the rest of the
nation.

   A black teen-ager sent to death row at age
15 was convicted Saturday of murder in a retrial brought after the
state Supreme Court overturned his original conviction by an
all-white jury. The prosecutor said he would not seek the death
penalty again.
   Ronald Ward, 18, showed no emotion and even smiled faintly at
the jurors as they filed out of the courtroom.
   The Crittenden County Circuit Court jury deliberated nearly 13
hours over two days before finding him guilty in the 1985 deaths of
three whites.
   Though he was convicted of capital murder, Prosecuting Attorney
Scott Hunter said he would not ask the jury to impose the death
penalty. As a result, Ward was automatically given life in prison
without parole, the only other possible sentence for capital felony
murder.
   ``The fact that he has been on death row for 2{ years was a
factor in the decision,'' Hunter said.
   He also said he considered the length of time the jury spent in
deliberations. ``I felt like I could not call upon this jury to do
more than they've done.''
   Ward's attorneys, Samuel Turner Jr. of West Memphis and Joseph
B. Brown Jr. of Memphis, Tenn., said a notice of appeal would be
filed immediately. The attorneys maintain that Ward was illegally
fingerprinted before his arrest.
   The state Supreme Court overturned the original conviction last
year, noting that an all-white jury convicted the 15-year-old black
boy of killing the three whites.
   The retrial jury had eight whites and four blacks.
   Ward was convicted of killing Lois Jarvis, 76; Audrey Townsend,
72; and a seventh-grade classmate of Ward's, 12-year-old Chris
Simmons, who was the grandnephew of the two women.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Boston University have asked a judge
to have Coretta Scott King release tapes of conversations between
her late husband, Martin Luther King Jr. and others, recorded
secretly by federal investigators.
   The motion, filed in Suffolk Superior Court on Friday, also asks
for correspondence between King and his colleagues.
   The action, which Mrs. King's attorneys charged was a form of
harassment, was the latest round in the legal fight between the
school and Mrs. King over an estimated 83,000 documents involving
her husband which are now held by BU.
   King, who had earned a graduate degree from the School of
Theology in 1955, donated the papers to the university in 1964.
   Mrs. King has filed suit, saying the documents should be in the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in
Atlanta, and contending the university had mishandled or lost some
of the papers.
   BU trustees decided unanimously to oppose the suit.
   Mrs. King's attorneys said they would oppose the request for
copies of the secretly recorded tapes.
   ``It seems they're inquiring into things, including Dr. King's
personal life and perhaps Mrs. King's, that have nothing to do with
this case,'' said Boston attorney James O'Brien, one of Mrs. King's
lawyers.
   ``We are going to object to the request for tapes,'' he said.
``I think it's harassment.''
   O'Brien and Rudolph Pierce, who also represents Mrs. King in the
suit, said they did not believe Mrs. King had copies of the tapes.
   ``I don't know at the moment if Mrs. King, or the estate, has
that information. I would doubt it,'' said Pierce.
   Published reports in the 1970s indicated that a package of the
tapes was sent anonymously to Mrs. King.
   Beginning in 1964, the FBI bugged hotel rooms where King was
staying. Tapes implicating King in alleged extramarital sexual
activity were made available to reporters, members of Congress and
then-President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1977, a federal judge ordered
the tapes sealed for 50 years.
   Melvin B. Miller, a BU trustee who law firm is handling the suit
for the university, said he believed Mrs. King had some of the
tapes.
   ``Of course she has some of them,'' he said.
   He refused to say why the university wanted copies of the tapes
for the lawsuit.
   ``We are entitled to seek documents we believe will be
admissible evidence in this case,'' Miller said. ``Whatever we ask
for we believe will further our position.''
   ``We could make an argument for its appropriatenesss in a court
of law,'' Miller said. ``If you think we're going to discuss the
strategy of our case in the press _ that's a bit much.''

   Japanese and U.S. officials failed to reach
agreement on opening some Japanese construction projects to
American firms, U.S. officials said Saturday.
   Japan recently offered to allow foreign participation in six
large public works projects, but U.S. officials said Saturday the
proposals were not enough. The officials held an unusual weekend
news conference at the U.S. Embassy, but spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Michael Farren, deputy undersecretary of commerce for
international trade, is heading the U.S. delegation.
   The six projects are expansion of the Tokyo International
Airport at Haneda, construction of a new airport in Hiroshima, a
bridge across the Akashi strait near Osaka, a highway along Ise
Bay, the development of a coastal area along the Tokyo Bay and work
at Osaka Port.
   ``A great many American firms have expressed tremendous interest
in gaining access to Japanese markets,'' said one official. ``But
the kind of things we called for in the way of construction
services on this list would only open door to a very narrow range
of American construction firms.
   ``We've come to a judgement that the list (of the six projects)
is not sufficient'' he said.
   The officials said the talks will probably continue in
Washington, where Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita met with U.S.
leaders on an official visit last month.
   Access to the Japanese construction market has been a major
trade issue in recent years between the two countries.
   Japanese companies won about $2.3 billion in contracts in the
United States in 1986, while U.S. firms did about $500 million in
business in Japan, according to construction officials.
   Japan has opened only two semi-public projects to U.S. builders
_ the Tokyo Bay bridge and the multi-billion dollar Kansai
International Airport project.
   The U.S. Congress last year passed legislation prohibiting
foreign companies from taking part in U.S. public works projects
for one year if their countries bar participation of U.S. firms in
their public works projects.

   World champion Garri Kasparov
lost Saturday in the quarterfinals of the world chess blitz
championship, but Soviet colleague Mikhail Tal won the sport's
richest tournament ever.
   ``I played badly as you saw,'' said Kasparov, 24, of the Soviet
Union. He spoke briefly to reporters after his morning loss to
Bulgarian Kirel Georgiev, 22.
   Tal, 51, who won his first major Soviet competition in 1957 and
the world championship in 1960, defeated Soviet Rafael Vaganian
3.5-0.5. Vaganian, 37, had defeated Georgiev in the semifinals.
   The blitz match is a fast-paced chess game in which each player
has only five minutes' playing time. The results do not count in
competition for the world chess title.
   In the six-game final, Tal stormed to a 3-0 lead before agreeing
to a draw in the fourth game to seize the title.
   Tal, ranked No. 6 in the world, told reporters that he never
expected to win and said ``my opponents played too hospitably.''
   ``It's the beginning of a second career for Tal,'' said American
grandmaster Larry Evans.
   In 1960, Tal, then 23, became the youngest world champion in
history until Kasparov gained the title in 1985 at age 22.
   But Tal lost his title in 1961 to Mikhail Botvinnik, another
Soviet.
   Kasparov's debacle began in the first of a four-game series
where he had a queen, a bishop and a king verses Goeirgive's lone
king, a position where many beginners would have little difficulty
in winning.
   But Kasparov, the tournament favorite, stunned the audience by
stalemating his opponent, ending the game in a draw.
   In the position, Georgiev's king could not move, but unlike a
checkmate, it was not attacked.
   As Kasparov made the hideous error, there were gasps from
spectators and he held his head in his hands.
   In the second game, Kasparov pressed too hard for victory,
blundered and lost.
   Their third encounter was drawn and Georgiev checkmated the
world champion in the fourth as Kasparov overreached, desperately
searching for a victory.
   The championship offered a total prize fund of 75,000 U.S.
dollars. Tal won $37,500 for four hours work, the highest prize
ever offered for a single chess tournament.
   On Friday, former world champion Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet
Union, ranked No. 2 in the world, was eliminated from the blitz
competition.
   The blitz championship ended the monthlong World Chess Festival
in the port city on Canada's east coast.

   The premiers of Romania and Bulgaria met
Saturday in Bulgaria to discuss ways of ending repeated chlorine
pollution along their border, the official Bulgarian news agency
BTA said.
   Premier Georgi Atanassov of Bulgaria and his Romanian
counterpart Constantin Dasalescu met in the northern Bulgarian town
of Rousse, the news agency said.
   There have been repeated reports in the official Bulgarian media
of dense clouds of chlorine gas from a chemical complex in Giurgiu
in southern Romania drifting over the Danube river to Rousse and
forcing residents to stay indoors.
   Chlorine is a greenish-yellow poisonous gas which has a
suffocating effect.
   Last year, Bulgaria and Romania set up a joint commission
charged with taking measures to end the repeated chlorine pollution
in the border area.
   The Warsaw Pact allies agreed to have teams of experts from both
countries measure air pollution in the two cities and determine its
sources, BTA said.
   Atanassov informed Dascalescu of measures taken by Bulgaria to
``decisively purify'' the air in Rousse and proposed an
intergovernmental convention for the protection of the environment
in the Danube region, BTA said.

   Passengers aboard Amtrak's California
Zephyr complained that they received no warnings or instructions
from crew members when a smoky fire caused by a defective heater in
a crew car killed one man early Saturday and injured 19 people.
   ``It's a miracle that there wasn't some kind of panic,'' said
Sara Bentley, of Fremont, Neb., a passenger in the first coach car
behind the passenger sleeper, which was coupled to the crew car.
   ``I think the worst thing was that they didn't let anyone in our
car know whether we were in danger. We couldn't find out if our car
was safe.''
   Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen said the fire aboard the 14-car
westbound train carrying 294 passengers and a crew of 18 was
reported about 3 a.m. as the train was pulling into Hastings for a
scheduled stop. Hastings Fire Chief Jim Mitera said the blaze was
under control about 90 minutes later.
   An electrical short in the wiring of the crew car heating unit
caused the fire, Deputy State Fire Marshal Chuck Hoffman said at an
afternoon news conference. He said the heater was in a storage area
under the crew sleeping quarters and that the short ignited the
car's wood floor.
   State Fire Marshal Wally Barnett said the wiring showed wear and
tear but did not say Amtrak was negligent.
   Adams County Attorney Gary Anderberg said an autopsy showed that
the Amtrak employee died of smoke inhalation.
   Amtrak investigators, who did not attend the news conference,
were on the scene by late Saturday morning.
   The crew car and the passenger sleeper were disconnected from
the Zephyr, which travels from Chicago to Salt Lake City, then
splits into sections that proceed to Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles
and Seattle, Jacobsen said from his office in Washington, D.C. The
rest of the train pulled out of Hastings about 9:30 a.m. after some
crew members were checked at the hospital and returned, he said.
   Robert Ballard, his wife, Helen, and 11-year-old grandson Robby
were in a deluxe sleeper en route to a Colorado ski trip. He said
they opened the compartment door and found the hallway filled with
smoke.
   ``We just woke up and smelled smoke,'' said Ballard, of Flint,
Mich.
   Mrs. Ballard, who suffers from asthma, was admitted to the
hospital for observation, her husband said.
   ``The thing I can't understand is we heard no smoke detectors
going off,'' Ballard said.
   Jacobsen said there are no smoke detectors on the train because
``no one has invented one that works reliably.'' Because smoke
detectors are so sensitive, the constant vibrations of trains would
set them off, he said.
   Jacobsen said he could recall only two train fires and that
because they are so rare there has not been a market for smoke
detectors designed for trains.
   Jacobsen said the rest of the train was not in any danger from
the fire, and that there is no fuel or propane in any of the
passenger cars.
   Bentley and another passenger, Mike Casuscelli, also of Fremont,
said no crew members told them to evacuate, but they and a number
of other passengers decided to leave the train after seeing fire
trucks arrive. Some crew members and passengers from the sleeping
cars milled around outside the train, many of the men shirtless or
wearing only long underwear.
   ``Normally, you don't want passengers to get off as long as the
rest of the train is not in danger,'' Jacobsen said. ``It is safer
to keep people on the train.''
   A female crew member ran through Bentley's car, asking
passengers for blankets for the injured. She said the woman's face
was covered with soot and she was shoeless.
   The crew car is designed for Amtrak service attendants who are
with the train from the beginning to the end of the trip. Jacobsen
said it was divided into two sections, one for baggage and one with
small bedrooms.
   The victim, identified as chef Cesar Arguelles, 70, of Chicago,
was one of seven crew members on the car, Jacobsen said.
   Nine crew members and three passengers remained Saturday evening
in Mary Lanning Hospital, where they were being treated for smoke
inhalation, Anderberg said. All were listed in satisfactory or good
condition.
   Three crew members, one passenger, two policemen and an
ambulance attendant were treated and released, Anderberg said.
   Hastings, a town of about 18,000, is in south-central Nebraska.

<HEAD>Gephardt Ads Draw Ire of Dukakis Supporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis Saturday accused Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt of
running a television advertisement that distorts the governor's
views on agriculture.
   The ad, which first aired across the state Friday night, said
Dukakis would not take a stand on a family farm bill sponsored by
Gephardt and ended with a barb at Dukakis' much-criticized
suggestion that Iowa farmers consider raising Belgian endive, a
salad green.
   At a news conference, Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Nichols, who supports Dukakis for the Democratic nomination for
president, said the governor's farm plan would work well for
Midwestern states.
   Although Dukakis praised Massachussetts farmers's efforts to
diversify by raising endive, he recognizes that nationally, ``we
need a fair price in the marketplace, and supply management,''
Nichols said.
   But after the news conference, Gephardt's South Dakota campaign
issued a statement contending Dukakis ``has repeatedly denounced
supply management for farmers.'' The statement included a Boston
Globe article quoting the governor as saying that controlling
production would be ``incredibly complicated and very
bureaucratic.''
   But, state Rep. Robert Duxbury of Wessington, a state
co-chairman for the Dukakis campaign, said,``Mike Dukakis has laid
out a very thoughtful agriculture policy for family farmers and
ranchers. He favors credit relief, supply management and fair
market prices for farmers.''
   State Sen. Roger McKellips of Alcester, another state
co-chairman, called the ads ``a new low in South Dakota
presidential politics'' and urged their removal.

   A brain-dead baby whose body was kept
alive in hopes of tranplanting his organs was removed from
life-support machines Saturday after no suitable recipient could be
found, officials said.
   Meanwhile, a child born Saturday with the same fatal defect in
San Antonio, Texas, was placed on a respirator and flown to
California to be enrolled in Loma Linda University Medical Center's
donor program.
   The babies were born without most of their brain and skull, a
fatal condition known as anencephaly.
   The child known as Baby John was born Tuesday and declared
brain-dead Thursday at Loma Linda. Officials had hoped to keep the
baby's body on life-support machines for up to seven days, hospital
spokeswoman Anita Rockwell said.
   By Saturday, Ms. Rockwell said, ``Physicians of four waiting
liver recipients of Baby John's same blood type refused the liver
because of its progressive deterioration over the past 36 hours.
   ``Despite a worldwide search, no infant of the same blood type
needing a heart has been found.
   ``Out of respect for the brain-dead infant and with the consent
of his mother, Dr. Joyce Peabody removed the artificial life
support from Baby John and his cardiac activity ceased at 2:15
p.m.''
   Anencephaly is fatal, usually within days after birth. An
infant's healthy organs can only be transplanted if organ damage is
prevented by maintaining the infant on life-support from birth.
   The first anencephalic child considered by Loma Linda hospital
for the pioneering procedure was the child of Brenda and Michael
Winner of Arcadia, Calif. But the baby was stillborn on Dec. 22.
   The use of such infants as organ donors has raised controversial
ethical issues, and Loma Linda is the first hospital in the United
States to develop a medical protocol allowing such transplants.
   The National Right to Life Committee has denounced the procedure
and complained that doctors have failed to do enough to ensure that
organs weren't removed from live children.
   One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4
received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year from a
donor child in Canada.
   If the Texas baby is declared dead within seven days, and one or
more of her organs successfully transplanted, it would be the first
time that the procedure has been tried using an anencephalic baby
born in the United States.
   The infant, 6-pound, 1-ounce Evelyn Keys was put on a chartered
plane in Texas en route to Loma Linda. She was born with only a
brain stem, said Robert McNaughton, Wilford Hall Medical Center
spokesman in San Antonio.
   Evelyn is the first child of Airman First Class Todd Keys, 21,
and his wife, Judy, 22.

<HEAD>Minnesota Poll Shows Dole Favored By Republicans, Dukakis by
Democrats</HEAD>

   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas was the favorite
among Minnesota Republicans while Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts was the leader among Democrats surveyed in the latest
Minnesota Poll.
   The poll results, published in the Sunday editions of the Star
Tribune, said Dole received support from 42 percent of the
Republicans surveyed while Vice President George Bush was favored
by 32 percent. Former television evangelist Pat Robertson was third
with 11 percent and U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York was favored by
5 percent. Ten percent gave other responses.
   Among Democrats, Dukakis was favored by 29 percent, followed by
U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri at 18 percent. Jesse Jackson
was third with 14 percent, followed by former Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart at 11 percent and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon with 9 percent.
Nineteen percent gave other responses.
   The poll of 800 adults randomly selected statewide from
households that have telephones was taken Feb. 10-14, or about 10
days before the state's precinct caucuses.
   The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, the
newspaper said.
   The newspaper said the poll makes no attempt to predict how
candidates will perform in the precinct caucuses because the survey
was not confined to those likely to attend precinct caucuses.
   A Simon statement issued by his Minnesota campaign office said,
``There's no way any poll can get a realistic picture of how
active, independent-minded (Democrats) will divide Tuesday night.''
   Simon finished second in the Iowa caucuses, which were won by
Gephardt, and came in third in the New Hampshire primary, where
Dukakis came in first and Gephardt was second.
   Dole won the Iowa caucuses while Robertson finished a surprising
second ahead of Bush, who bounced back to win the New Hampshire
primary over Dole. Kemp finished third in New Hampshire.
   The Minnesota Poll found that Dukakis and Gephardt are stronger
with middle-aged and older Minnesota adults, while Hart and Jackson
find more of their support with younger adults.

   Bruce Babbitt's last stop on his way home
from 18 months of campaigning for the Democratic presidential
nomination was to tell a cheering crowd at his national campaign
headquarters Saturday that it was good to be home.
   ``I got a call a week ago from a neighbor of mine who said,
`Bruce, you may be hot stuff out there in the rest of the United
States, running for president of the United States, debating on
television all the time, but you better get home because you're
fence is falling down and the dog is wreckin' my lawn,''' Babbitt
told about 1,000 of his supporters.
   Babbitt, the former governor of Arizona, officially dropped out
of the race Thursday after disappointing showings in the New
Hampshire primary and the Iowa Democratic caucuses.
   Babbitt said he and his wife, Hattie, were going to spend some
time getting reacquainted and re-establishing their roots in
Arizona.
   ``I want you to know one thing: wherever we go, our roots will
always be in Arizona, he said.''
   Babbitt said he would be jumping into the fray of the
gubernatorial recall election, but not as a candidate.
   ``I want to take the time in the next month or two to try and
get back into the swing of what it is that's going on here, to
rejoin our fight here in Arizona,'' he said.
   Babbitt, introduced to the crowd by acting Gov. Rose Mofford,
who has replaced impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, said, ``I'm going to
join you in whatever way I can to make sure the change is
permanent.''
   He said he has been asked about his future plans and that he
hasn't ruled out anything except running for governor of Arizona,
adding that there were plenty of good candidates.
   ``It's all of you that gave me this opportunity. It was a great
run. I hope that I come back having reflected the spirit of
Arizona, our traditions, honor, on all of us. I'm glad to be home.
Thanks very much,'' Babbitt said.
   Asked what he had learned from 18 months of campaigning, said:
``I think most of all, a tremendous sense of faith and confidence
in the future of America.
   ``It's an incredibly diverse country, full of people just
bursting with energy, with optimism, who are really thirsting for
some leadership.... 1988 is going to be important, because we will
have a transition, and we've somehow got to capture a spirit of
challenge, of truth-telling, of a kind of willingness to tell the
American people the truth and get this economy moving.''

<HEAD>Soviet Cosmonauts Will Carry U.S. Commercial Project Into Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet cosmonauts will carry a U.S. commercial
project into space for the first time in a deal approved by the
government, an attorney for the project said Saturday.
   Payload Systems Inc. of Wellsley, Mass., received a two-year
license from the Commerce Department earlier this month to contract
with the Soviet space agency to perform protein crystallization
experiments aboard the Soviet space station Mir, said Mark S.
McConnell, a Washington attorney who handled the company's
negotiations with the Commerce and Defense departments.
   The company, a consulting firm, was founded in 1984 by Byron K.
Lichtenberg of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology. He was
the first American non-astronaut to fly aboard the space shuttle in
December 1983.
   The experiment will use the weightlessness of space to grow
large, regular protein crystals, which are useful in the
development of new drugs, McConnell said Saturday evening.
   ``To my knowledge, it is the first time that the U.S. government
has approved commercial activity in the Soviet space program.
Certainly we've had joint missions, government-to-government,'' he
said.
   Since the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in January
1986, American companies have been left with few alternatives for
space projects.
   ``Even when the shuttle was flying it provided only a limited
amount of time in space. With the shuttle down, the only American
option is (a plane) flown in a parabolic flight path that gives
only a few minutes of weightlessness,'' McConnell said.
   U.S. officials were concerned about the possibility of
transferring sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, but
McConnell said, ``We created a situation that absolutely minimized
that.'' He said the Commerce Department issued the license after
getting from the Pentagon.
   ``There will be extremely limited training given to the
cosmonauts. They will be doing no more than turning some dials on a
box, the contents of which they will not know about, and monitoring
environmental conditions in the space station,'' he said.
   He said the Soviets were satisfied with the arrangement, adding,
``Their goal from what I could tell is to promote commercial uses
worldwide of their station.''
   The U.S. government has been reluctant to permit American
companies to hire the Soviets to launch satellites and McConnell
said the Soviets viewed the crystallization project as their best
shot at working with a U.S. firm.
   He said Payload Systems has reached an agreement in principle
with the Soviets, but still was negotiating over details.
   He said the company would not attempt to sell the crystals grown
in the first flight.
   ``They're just trying to see if it works for commercial
purposes,'' he said.
   According to The New York Times, which carried a story on the
project in Sunday's editions, the first flight will be sometime
next year.
   The newspaper said Payload Systems refused to discuss the terms
of the contract. It added, however, that the Soviets in the past
have offered to carry Western experiments for between $10,000 and
$15,000 a kilogram.
   Calls to company officials seeking comment were not immediately
returned Saturday night.
   President Reagan's budget, released Thursday, provides $1
billion to build a U.S. space station by the mid-1990s. Earlier
this month Reagan unveiled a national policy for commercial
activity in space. It provides for the government to lease space
aboard a space module that will be carried aloft by the space
shuttle and left in orbit.

   Figure skater Brian Boitano won the
United States' first gold medal of the Winter Olympics on Saturday,
beating Canadian world champion Brian Orser.
   Orser took the silver and Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union
was third for the bronze.
   Boitano's win gives the United States one gold; one silver, also
won Saturday; and one bronze as the Olympics ended its first week.
   Boitano, the 1986 world champion and a four-time American
titlist, took the long program with a sensational exhibition of
freestyle skating.
   The 24-year-old from Sunnyvale, Calif., who was fifth in the
1984 Olympics, depicted the various stages of a soldier's life to
music from the film ``Napoleon.''
   He successfully performed all eight triple jumps, including two
in combination, and drew a standing ovation from the sellout crowd
at the Olympic Saddledome.
   He also won over five of the nine judges, who gave him eight
marks of 5.9 and one perfect 6.0, from the Czechoslovakian judge
for artistic impression.
   Orser, 26, also came in second at the 1984 Winter Olympics in
Sarajevo, losing the gold to another American, Scott Hamilton.
   Earlier Saturday, speed skater Eric Flaim won the first silver
medal for the United States. Andre Hoffmann beat Flaim by .06
seconds, giving East Germany its second gold medal of the day and
leading another Soviet-bloc day at the Olympics.
   The only other U.S. medal was a bronze in pairs figure skating
won Tuesday night by Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.
   The Soviets now have 14 medals, including five golds; and East
Germany has 10, including six golds.

   Leftist guerrillas said Friday
they will shut down road and highway transport nationwide next week

   The 24-hour transport ban, set to begin at 12:01 a.m. Monday, is
the first scheduled by the rebels this year. The announcement, made
on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos, said the action was
part of the guerrilla campaign against legislative and municipal
elections scheduled for March 20.
   The traffic bans have been effective in the past, especially in
the war-torn east. Motorists stay off the roads, fearing reprisal
by the guerrillas.
   Also Friday, the armed forces said five guerrillas and two
soldiers died in combat near the town of La Laguna, 55 miles north
of the capital. Six government soldiers were wounded, they said.
   Radio Venceremos claimed guerrilla forces inflicted 23
casualties on government troops in Thursday's clash at La Laguna.
It did not distinguish between dead and wounded and did not report
rebel losses.
   In another attack, rebels assaulted the local Civil Defense
headquarters, the mayor's office and the telephone office in San
Jorge before dawn Friday, according to sources in the town 95 miles
southeast of San Salvador.
   The sources, reached by telephone, said five Civil Defense
militiamen were killed and two wounded. They had no information on
guerrilla casualties.
   The guerrillas caused extensive damage, according to the
sources, who spoke on condition of anoymity.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front have
pursued a steady campaign of economic sabotage as part of their
8-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government.
   In addition to the regular declaration of traffic bans, the
campaign includes the blowing up of utility poles, attacks on power
stations and raids on farms and warehouses containing coffee,
cotton and sugar _ the country's main export crops.
   There were seven guerrilla-imposed transport strikes last year.
Three violators of the strike were killed, about 30 were wounded
and 160 vehicles were destroyed or damaged.
   The insurgents on Wednesday carried out their biggest attack of
the year, assaulting the base of the 6th infantry brigade and a
cotton cooperative in Usulutan, 70 miles east of the capital.
   The rebel radio said the assault marked the beginning of a
campaign designated ``armed struggle is the alternative to the new
electoral farce.''
   Leftist parties have not participated in elections held during
the war, saying that their candidates' safety could not be
guaranteed.

   Thai and Laotian forces began a truce
in a disputed border area Friday, pulling back from the hilly
ground where hundreds of comrades had been killed since November,
Thai officers said.
   After the cease-fire began at 8 a.m., two parallel rows of Thai
and Laotian flags were planted to mark a zone two miles deep that
soldiers are forbidden to cross, said the army chief of staff, Gen.
Charuay Wongsayant.
   Military officials of both sides agreed to the cease-fire
Wednesday after two days of talks in Bangkok. The disputed area is
about 240 miles north of Bangkok between Thailand's northern
province of Phitsanulok and Sayaboury province in Laos.
   Col. Rithee Rungkaputi, chief of civilian affairs for the 3rd
Army Region, said a half-hour skirmish occurred on a contested hill
an hour before the truce began, with no casualties. He said it
there probably was a delay in commmunicating the cease-fire order.
   Rithee also reported a heavy artillery exchange and two ground
battles Wednesday and Thursday, while military teams from the two
countries were meeting in Bangkok.
   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand told reporters
Friday that Foreign Ministry officials had been sent to France
seeking help in resolving the problem. Both sides claim the area on
the basis of recognized maps and a 1907 French-Thai treaty.
   The official Laotian news agency KPL quoted Maj. Gen. Thonglay
Kommasith, deputy head of the army's general political department,
as saying the talks in Bangkok ``paved the way toward negotiations,
a diplomatic channel to solve the Lao-Thai border problem.''
   Thonglay participated in the Bangkok meeting. The dispatch said
he spoke at a news conference Thursday in Vientiane.
   The agreement calls for the governments to hold talks within 15
days after the truce begins to determine the frontier line.

<HEAD>Thatcher Announces Civil Service Restructuring Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has announced
plans to shift 70,000 of Britain's 580,000 civil servants out of
government ministries and into a dozen new agencies run by
private-industry-style executives.
   The new agencies will take over such duties as issuing passports
and drivers' licenses, forecasting the weather and printing
government documents.
   Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons Thursday that ``in
general'' the new agencies planned in the next 12 months will stay
part of the civil service, accountable to the government and
Parliament.
   But she indicated some may eventually become private companies,
saying: ``Insofar as they become totally outside the civil service
they will not, of course, be accountable'' to government scrutiny.
   She did not elaborate but said the 12 were ``the first suitable
candidates,'' indicating more changes are in the pipeline.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said the
plans herald the biggest civil service shake-up this century.
   The Daily Telegraph said the government aims to eventually
separate the civil servants responsible for carrying out executive
functions from the minority responsible for formulating policy.
   The possibility of some of the new agencies eventually being
turned into private companies drew criticism from the opposition
Labor Party.
   Some civil service trade unions also attacked the restructuring
plans, saying the changes could lead to a decline in pay and
working conditions for their members.
   The government has said its aim is increased efficiency. The 12
new agencies will take control of 12 services currently run by
central government departments. They include:
   _ Issuing passports, currently one of the jobs of the Home
Office.
   _ Running the government stationery office which prints
government documents. That is currently one of the jobs of the
office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson.
   _ Running the meteorological office, which provides weather
forecasts for the armed forces, television and radio, farmers and
other clients and is presently run by the Ministry of Defense.
   _ Managing the royal parks in and around London, now done by the
Department of the Environment.
   _ Issuing driving permits, one of the jobs of the Department of
Transport.
   The plans announced by Mrs. Thatcher follow a report by her
Efficiency Unit headed by Sir Robin Ibbs, an executive of the
industrial chemicals group Imperial Chemical Industries. It called
for agencies run by executives, not ministers, to take over the
day-to-day executive functions of government.
   Mrs. Thatcher came to power in 1979 pledged to cut back the
growth of big government. Her Conservative administration has
followed a program of selling off state-owned companies to private
owners.

   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner began
serving part of a sentence for tax evasion Friday by handing out
rolls at a soup kitchen.
   ``He's being introduced to everybody on a first-name basis,''
said Barbara Smith, spokeswoman for Camillus House, a shelter for
the needy.
   The 69-year-old Miami Beach tycoon, who declined requests for
interviews, was received ``in just the same way as any other person
who comes here to work as a volunteer, although I realize he's not
a volunteer,'' Ms. Smith said.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman last week sentenced Posner
to work 5,000 hours of community service over five years. He also
must pay $3 million to help the homeless and $4 million in back
taxes, penalties and interest.
   Posner had faced up to 40 years in prison after pleading no
contest last Sept. 29 to evading more than $1.2 million in federal
taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a Bible college
as a tax exemption.
   Posner, whose net worth was estimated at $240 million in 1984 by
Forbes magazine, will work one day a week for the next eight weeks
at the downtown shelter.
   Posner, accompanied by his attorney, Edward Bennett Williams,
began his five-hour shift by taking a tour of the shelter and
meeting other workers.
   He worked at an entrance gate, admitting people to the cafeteria
and making sure it did not exceed its capacity of about 100.
   When several news photographers tried to take his picture,
Posner went inside to serve rolls to people coming through the food
line, which serves 700 to 900 needy people each day.
   Several of the men who went through the food line said they knew
about Posner's background and found him to be friendly.
   ``He shook hands with me. He's a very nice guy,'' said Brote
Harris. ``I said, `Come on, papa, shake my hand. I'd like to shake
a millionaire's hand.'''
   Posner, wearing a white shirt and clear plastic gloves, chatted
with other workers as he handed out rolls. The meal also included
hot chicken, string beans and rice.

   Nicaragua proposed Friday that Canada
and five Western European countries take part in efforts to verify
compliance with a Central American peace plan.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto told a news conference that
foreign observers would form permanent mobile units in each of the
five countries covered by the peace plan.
   The mobile units, he said, would be in place for a year and be
allowed to make on-site inspections without prior notice to ensure
the countries were meeting terms of the agreement.
   D'Escoto suggested that representatives from Canada, Spain,
Italy, Sweden, Norway and West Germany be members of the
verification panel.
   The countries, he said, ``have shown their willingness to take
part in this type of activity in order to achieve and guarantee
peace in Central America.''
   The presidents of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras
and Guatemala signed the peace plan last Aug. 7.
   D'Escoto said he offered the proposal at a verification meeting
of the Central American foreign ministers Wednesday. The officials
met for 10 hours in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, but
failed to agree on ways to determine compliance with the peace plan.
   They called for further talks in Guatemala by March 15.
   The peace plan calls for cease-fire negotiations between
governments and insurgents in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua
as a first step toward democratic elections.
   It also calls for political amnesties and a ban on all outside
military assistance to rebel groups.

   A Kurdish inmate died Friday, 12 days
after he and 600 other prisoners began a hunger strike to protest
prison conditions, the independent Hurriyet news agency reported.
   It identified the inmate as Mehmet Emin Yavuz, who had been
sentenced to die for carrying out terrorist acts as a member of the
outlawed Kurdish Labor Party. His death sentence was awaiting
parliamentary approval.
   Yavuz died in a hospital in Diyarbakir military prison where he
was taken along with six other inmates after their health
deteriorated during the hunger strike that began Feb. 8, the agency
said.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency reported later Friday
that the Diyarbakir inmates stopped the hunger strike hours after
Yavuz' death.
   The government announced Thursday that it agreed to improve
prison conditions. However, the inmates and several relatives
continued the hunger strike Friday, contending that conditions
remained unchanged, Hurriyet said.
   Most of the inmates belong to the Kurdish Labor Party, which
seeks to set up an independent Marxist state in parts of
southeastern Turkey.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda denied in
a strongly worded protest note that Mexico allows its territory to
be used by leftist rebels to threaten the government of El Salvador.
   ``The government of Mexico in no case allows the use of Mexican
territory by the groups of the FMLN-FDR (Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front _ Democratic Revolutionary Front) to develop
activities that have repercussions and attempt against the
stability of the Salvadoran government,'' Sepulveda said in a note
to Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo Peralta of El Salvador.
   The note, released Thursday afternoon, was in response to a
protest note Acevedo Peralta sent to Mexico earlier in the week.
   The FMLN links five guerrilla groups that have been fighting El
Salvador's U.S.-supported government for the past eight years. The
FDR is its political ally.
   The groups' joint political-diplomatic commission maintains an
office in Mexico City, as does clandestine rebel Radio Venceremos.
   Sepulveda said the office is allowed because Mexican law
establishes ``protection for political exiles who enter national
territory and the constitution guarantees for all people who are in
the territory liberty of association, transit and expression of
ideas.''
   A Foreign Ministry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Sepulveda decided to make his response public because the
Salvadoran government released its note to the press. ``That goes
out of normal diplomatic channels,'' the source said.
   Relations between Mexico and El Salvador were tense in the early
years of the Salvadoran civil war, especially after then-President
Jose Lopez Portillo recognized the rebels as a legitimate political
force in a joint Mexican-French declaration in 1981.
   The friction has eased during the administration of President
Miguel de la Madrid, who succeeded Lopez Portillo in December 1982.
   Mexico helped form the Contadora group seeking peace for Central
America in January 1983, along with Panama, Colombia and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Hunger Striker, Two Other Defendants Acquitted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of four leaders of the extreme left group
Direct Action who have been refusing food for 81 days was acquitted
Friday night on charges of attempted murder.
   Nathalie Menigon and the other two defendants in the case, Regis
Schleicher and Jean-Francois Gailhac, were found innocent by the
special Assizes Court. The court, which has judges serving as the
jury, was established last year for terrorism cases.
   The three were accused in the January 1982 shooting of Alain
Carpentier, then a leader of a squatters movement in eastern Paris.
   Carpentier testified Friday that he did not know the three
defendants, and said police had tried to get him to say the Direct
Action members were his assailants.
   ``I don't understand what you want of them,'' Carpentier said.
``I'm the victim, and I can tell you they had nothing to do with
this affair.''
   Police investigators told the court they considered the
defendants suspects after questioning Carpentier's friends and
family.
   Prosecutor Daniel Barreyre said in his closing argument that the
shooting was part of Direct Action's effort to gain control of the
squatters movement. He asked for 15-year sentences for each of the
three defendants.
   Ms. Menigon and three other Direct Action leaders, Joelle
Aubron, Georges Cipriani and Jean-Marc Rouillan, have been on a
hunger strike since Dec. 1, demanding an end to their solitary
confinement. They are being fed intravenously against their will.
   All four were convicted Feb. 12 in a lower court of criminal
association and given 10-year sentences. Ms. Menigon was convicted
Wednesday, also in the special Assizes Court, of attempted murder
of two policemen.
   Authorities say all of Direct Action's leaders are now in prison.
   Several human rights groups have urged the government to meet
the hunger strikers' demands, but Justice Minister Albin Chalendon
said he will not yield to what he called blackmail.

<TEXT>
   The parents of Baby M have failed to reach
an out-of-court settlement on surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould's visitation rights, sending the matter back to
court, it was announced Friday.
   Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween on Friday set a hearing for
March 28 to determine the terms under which Mrs. Beth
Whitehead-Gould may visit the child she bore under a $10,000
contract and lost in the landmark court battle.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is allowed to visit the child for two hours
every Tuesday pending Sween's decision.
   The state Supreme Court on Feb. 3 banned surrogate motherhood
for pay, voided the $10,000 contract, and reinstated her right to
visit the baby, now legally called Melissa Stern.
   The court said a Superior Court judge must decide the conditions
for visitation if Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and the child's father,
William Stern, failed to reach an agreement.
   ``We did talk and it did not work. We cannot settle the case,''
said Gary N. Skoloff, an attorney for the Sterns. He declined to
disclose the positions of both sides.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Harold J. Cassidy, said in a
statement Friday night the Sterns had not negotiated with the
child's best interest in mind.
   ``It is in the best interest of Melissa that she have the
opportunity to know and love and respect her mother,'' he said.
``Until Mr. and Mrs. Stern learn to accept this simple fact, there
cannot be further discussions.''
   The Baby M case began when the Sterns signed a contract with
Mrs. Whitehead-Gould for her to be artificially inseminated with
Stern's sperm and bear them a child.
   After the child was born, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould decided she
couldn't give up the baby. The Sterns sued to get the child back.
   On March 31 Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow upheld the
contract, terminated Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's right to the baby,
awarded custody to the Sterns and let Stern's wife, Elizabeth,
adopt the baby.
   The Supreme Court, in its 7-0 ruling, overturned all but the
custody decision.

   A real estate magnate was sentenced to 15
years in prison Friday for sending his estranged wife a bomb in a
flower basket that injured her and a co-worker.
   Peter Pilaski, 54, received the same sentence given to his
homosexual lover, 28-year-old Shaun Small, who testified Pilaski
supervised the bomb's construction and had him deliver the device
in a bellhop's uniform.
   Pilaski was convicted in December of conspiracy, making and
possesing a bomb, and aiding and abetting in an explosion that
damaged federal property and caused personal injury.
   Melanie Pilaski, 42, and a co-worker were injured in when the
bomb, hidden in a basket of dried flowers, exploded at a U.S.
General Services Administration building.
   The German-born Pilaski, speaking in a heavy accent, maintained
his innocence and told U.S. District Judge Robert Schnacke the only
time he saw the bomb used in the 1986 attack was when the
government displayed a replica at his trial.
   ``I never wanted to hurt my wife. I still don't. ... I have a
lot of feeling for her. I still do,'' he said as his voice cracked
and tears filled his eyes.
   He said the prosecution drew a distorted picture of him ``as a
cold-blooded murderer.''
   Small had testified Pilaski suggested that he make the bomb and
gave him detailed instructions about its delivery to Mrs. Pilaski,
who had filed for divorce a month earlier after 20 years of
marriage.
   Small, who had donned a wig, heavy makeup and a uniform to
deliver the bouquet, was convicted of using a bomb to damage
federal property and cause personal injury.
   Defense attorney Paul Higaki Jr. said Pilaski will appeal.
   Pilaski could have received up to 45 years in prison and a $1
million fine. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Lyons had asked for a
20-year sentence, arguing Pilaski played a bigger role in the
bombing.
   Higaki said that parole authorities can review both men's
sentences and release them at any time, but that Pilaski might not
survive any substantial term because of health problems that
include a heart condition.
   Small had testified that Pilaski had become increasingly hostile
toward his wife's drug use and alcoholism, that he vowed that she
would regret her decision to seek a divorce and that he ordered
Small to assemble a bomb.
   Pilaski was an impoverished West German seaman in 1955 when he
immigrated to the United States, sponsored by Small's parents. He
made a fortune in real estate and hired Small, then a teen-ager, as
an apartment manager in 1976.
   Mrs. Pilaski testified that Pilaski and Small had been lovers
and went on regular cocaine binges, and that her husband's
relationship with Small contributed to the breakup of their
marriage.

   Several anti-government activists planning
to attend a weekend meeting of Rural Solidarity, the outlawed
farmers' union, were detained by police Friday, opposition
spokesmen said.
   The group, modeled after the outlawed Solidarity independent
trade union, is planning a meeting Sunday in the southeastern
Polish city of Rzeszow, said opposition spokesman Janusz Winiarski.
   Rural Solidarity leaders have called a national meeting to mark
the seventh anniversary of the Rzeszow-Ustrzyki agreements signed
in February 1981 in which the government officially recognized
Rural Solidarity.
   Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, a regional leader of Solidarity in the
southwest city of Wroclaw, was detained around 6 p.m. Friday by
uniformed and plainclothed police, said his wife Krystyna.
   Police later telephoned their home and said without explanation
that Frasyniuk was being detained for 48 hours, Mrs. Frasyniuk said.
   Another regional Solidarity leader, Stanislaw Weglorz, was
detained in his home city of Lublin, in eastern Poland, said
opposition spokesman Janusz Winiarski.
   Briefly detained was Janusz Stepniak, from near Lublin, a leader
of Rural Solidarity, said Winiarski.
   Stepniak was warned against attending the meeting.
   After the December 1981 imposition of martial law, Rural
Solidarity, like other opposition groups, was banned by the
government although some members have continued their activities.

<HEAD>World Bank Announces $75 Billion General Capital Incease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank, a major source of credit for
poor countries, late Friday announced a five-year general capital
increase.
   President Barber B. Conable said the capital increase of $74.8
billion will enable the bank to lend money to developing countries
at the rate of $20 billion a year by the early 1990s.
   The World Bank, owned by its 151 member countries, lent a record
$14.2 billion in the fiscal year ending last June.
   Agreement of the shareholding countries on the new capital opens
the way for ``stronger World Bank support for the developing
countries'' and demonstrates ``the confidence of our shareholder
governments in the Bank,'' said Conable.
   It was the bank's third general capital increase in its 44-year
history. Earlier general increases, in 1959 and 1980, approximately
doubled the authorized capital. The latest increase will raise the
bank's authorized capital to $171 billion.
   Each of the 151 member countries contributes capital in
proportion to its holding of shares, with the United States the
largest shareholder with about 20 percent.
   Only a small part of the capital is actually paid in cash.
Friday's announcement said this would be 3 percent, with the
remaining 97 percent to be on call if needed to secure World Bank
borrowings.
   The guarantees of participating governments enable the World
Bank to borrow money in private capital markets and to invest the
proceeds while waiting to disburse it to poor countries.
   Last September, the Bank sold a record $750 million offering of
10-year notes in the U.S. market at 9.91 percent after earlier
selling issues of World Bank dollar and yen bonds outside the
United States. It registered $1.1 billion profit in the year ending
last June 30.

Peruvian troops in the Andes and killed 10 soldiers and two
civilians, Defense Minister Enrique Lopez said Friday.
   The assault Thursday near a road construction site on the
outskirts of Huancavelica, a state capital 155 miles southeast of
Lima, was the most devastating in a wave of attacks by Shining Path
guerrillas this month.
   ``A group of army personnel were the object of a cowardly attack
by delinquent subversives,'' the Joint Military Command said. Lopez
and the joint command declined to elaborate on how the rebels
mounted the raid.
   Lopez said the troops were traveling in civilian vehicles from
Huancavelica to the road construction site to provide protection to
government workers.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path has been fighting for eight years
to topple the government and install a Marxist state.
   A year ago, the guerrillas exploded a mine near Huancavelica
that killed 10 soldiers and four civilians. One week ago, in a
nearly identical attack, rebels killed 10 soldiers and wounded 14.
   Since early February, leftist guerrillas have killed five
telephone company workers, bombed and derailed two ore trains and
bombed the office of Royal Dutch Shell and five other private
offices in Lima.
   Huancavelica, one of Peru's most impoverished and isolated
regions, is under a state of emergency to counter rising guerrilla
violence.
   The government says more than 10,000 people, including troops,
police, guerrillas and non-combatants, have died during the Shining
Path insurgency.

<HEAD>Experts Fail To Complete Protocol on Nitrogen Oxide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World experts ended a three-day meeting Friday
without completing a draft protocol on controlling nitrogen oxide
pollution, suspected of being a main factor in widespread forest
damage in Europe and North America.
   Environmentalist groups allowed to attend part of the
closed-door meeting expressed deep disappointment.
   ``We can only conclude that the international community is
prepared to condemn the environment to an acid future,'' said
Andrew Kerr, an observer for Greenpeace.
   The meeting of experts from 25 nations was sponsored by the U.N.
Economic Commission for Europe. Commission spokesman Hans Lassen
said it now was up to the governments to complete the protocol,
adding that it was still hoped the protocol could be signed before
the end of the year.
   Lassen said three major areas of disagreement remained,
requiring ``political decisions'':
   _When would a freeze on emissions take force and from what level
should they be reduced by a proposed 30 percent.
   _Would the United States be entitled to an ``emission credit'' _
meaning a reduction by less than 30 percent _ in view of efforts it
has already taken unilaterally to control pollution.
   _By what year should unleaded fuel be available in all countries
parties to the protocol.
   Acid rain begins with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
pollution from smelters, power plants and vehicle exhaust. It
travels long distances in the atmosphere and is transformed into
sulfuric and nitric acid before falling to the earth in rain or
snow.
   It raises the acidity of lakes and rivers, killing off fish, and
has been blamed by some environmentalists for stunting forest
growth.
   Sources close to the meeting said seven countries _ Canada, West
Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands
_ called for a freeze on nitrogen oxide emissions at the 1987 level
by 1990.
   The United States, Britain, France, Norway, Finland as well as
the Soviet Union and its allies reportedly favored a freeze by 1994
at the level of 1987 or later, with a reduction several years later.
   Canada strongly opposed the U.S. proposal for a credit clause in
the protocol, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Canada reportedly argued that the concept of using past actions to
control air pollution to permit future increases in national
emissions was contrary to the spirit of the agreement.
   Greenpeace has demanded a 75 percent cut in emissions throughout
Europe.
   Adam Markham, the observer for the World Wildlife Fund,
complained that the draft protocol that was emerging ``virtually
has no teeth.'' Markham said it was increasingly likely that a
group of countries, including West Germany, Switzerland and
Scandinavian countries, will seek a separate accord _ outside the
protocol _ that would call for speedier measures.

   A twin-engine plane skimmed over rush-hour
traffic Friday and crashed on a freeway access road, killing all
three people aboard and spewing flaming debris that destroyed two
parked cars, authorities said.
   ``It looked like it was going to attempt maybe to come onto the
freeway, but as soon as it got over the freeway, it just
nosedived,'' said Victor Armendariz, who was at a stop light.
``There's not much left. It's just charcoal.''
   The Gulfstream Commander 680 went down in moderate snow and
light fog after takeoff from El Paso International Airport shortly
before 9 a.m., National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Tommy
McFall said.
   ``From the eyewitnesses we talked to, (the plane) didn't have
any power on the way down. It was silent,'' said police Sgt. John
Loy.
   The victims' identities were not immediately released. The
plane's destination was not available.
   The plane apparently developed landing-gear trouble and was
trying to return to the airport when it crashed onto the Interstate
10 access road, McFall said. The cause of the crash was under
investigation.

<TEXT>
   The man known as the ``grand puppeteer'' for
his high-level personal connections dashed investigators' hopes
Friday that he would detail what he knew about the collapse of the
nation's largest private bank.
   Licio Gelli is accused in Italy of masterminding a group
involved in right-wing terrorism, subversion and spying. He was the
grandmaster of the P-2 (Propaganda Due) Masonic lodge, which
Italian officials linked to tax evasion, bribery, conspiracy to
topple the government and other spectacular crimes.
   But his extradition Wednesday from Switzerland came on grounds
he would only face charges of fraudulent bankruptcy in the 1982
collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.
   Gelli had written to magistrates in Milan and expressed his
willingness to discuss the collapse of the bank, but he refused to
talk to them when they visited him in jail in Parma Friday, said
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In 1981, Gelli fled Italy after police raided his office and
found a list of purported P-2 lodge members. The list included
Cabinet ministers, journalists, businessmen and generals. The
scandal toppled the government of Premier Arnaldo Forlani.
   Gelli was arrested in Switzerland in September 1982 when he
tried to withdraw funds from a frozen account at a Geneva bank. He
was sentenced to two months in jail for entering the country
illegally.
   In 1983, while awaiting extradition to Italy, Gelli escaped and
reportedly hid in South America for four years.
   He surrendered to Swiss authorities last September, reportedly
suffering from heart problems. He was convicted and sentenced to
two months in prison for paying a guard a $20,000 bribe to help him
escape.

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government council recommended Friday
that emergency rule be extended in nine provinces to help combat
Kurdish insurgents, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said.
   The emergency rule would include Turkey's largest city,
Istanbul, and the southeast provinces of Bingol, Diyarbakir,
Elazig, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Tunceli and Van, the news agency
said.
   The National Security Council, a powerful advisory body of
Cabinet members and top military commanders, announced its
recommendation after a meeting Friday, Anatolia said.
   Government troops and Kurdish guerrillas seeking autonomy have
fought since 1984. An estimated 10 million of Turkey's 52 million
people are ethnic Kurds and most live in the rugged terrain of east
and southeast Turkey.
   If the recommendation is approved by the one-house Parliament,
emergency rule in those provinces will be extended for four months
as of March 19, when a four-month period of emergency rule expires.
   Under emergency rule, civilian officials may impose curfews or
bar or censor a publication. It differs from martial law in that
emergency powers are assumed by civilian officials instead of
military commanders.

   The government raised gas prices
32 percent Friday in a new tax to help retirees, whose monthly
stipends have declined in value in the nation's economic crisis.
   President Raul Alfonsin and Congress proposed the gas tax last
month as a way to help finance a 40 percent increase in the monthly
pensions of retirees to 300 australs, or about $52.
   Economy Minister Juan V. Sourrouille said Friday inflation for
1988 was expected to exceed 100 percent. The inflation will come
despite the planned sale of some debt-ridden state companies and
programs to push export sales and increase income tax collections,
he said.
   Inflation stood at 175 percent last year, more than double the
82 percent rise in 1986. Blame was placed primarily on debilitating
strikes, low prices for exports and high losses from state-owned
companies.
   Last week, Argentina and the Scandanavian carrier SAS signed an
agreement in which SAS will buy 20 to 40 percent of state-owned
Aerolineas Argentinas, which is heavily in debt. Under the accord,
SAS has until May to determine its ownership share.

   A doctor and former hospital board chairman
was indicted Friday on charges he defrauded pharmaceutical
companies of nearly $2 million by falsifying test results on
experimental drugs.
   Dr. Robert A. Fogari, 46, of Saddle River, invented data and
patients, enrolled ineligible patients in the clinical studies and
failed to report adverse affects the drugs may have caused, federal
prosecutors said.
   The drugs tested were anti-inflammatory treatments for arthritis.
   One of the drugs was Feldene, a leading seller for the
pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which used Fogari's test results in
its advertising, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman.
   Fogari, who has a practice in Jersey City, also was charged with
obstruction of justice for allegedly inducing witnesses to lie to
investigators and a grand jury.
   He was accused of defrauding the companies, including Johnson &
Johnson, Pfizer, Upjohn and Warner-Lambert, from 1977 to 1985, when
the Food and Drug Administration barred him from performing trials.
   For part of that period, Fogari was chairman of the board of
managers of Jersey City Medical Center, where he was a board member
until last year. He also was chief of rheumatology at that hospital
and president of the medical staff at St. Francis Hospital in
Jersey City, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said.
   Pharmaceutical companies use doctors to perform clinical trials
and pay them on the basis of the number of patients and office
visits and the procedures performed.
   Fogari did not return a telephone call to his office. His
attorney, A. Patrick Nucciarone, said in a statement he is
convinced his client will be exonerated.
   Experimental drugs cannot be sold in the United States unless
approved by the FDA, which reviews clinical data provided by the
company before allowing their sale.
   Pharmaceutical companies provide the drugs free to physicians
conducting the clinical trials. The doctors in turn are required to
follow study guidelines, keep accurate records and provide them to
the FDA for review.

   Officials involved in a widely
publicized bribery and corruption case tried in Slovakia have been
expelled from the Communist Party, the ruling Politburo announced
Friday.
   An announcement by the state news agency CTK said the presidium
also chided legal and judicial organs in the republic of Slovakia
for a slow approach to the case, which was reported in the West and
in Czechoslovakia's state-run media.
   The trial focused on Stanislav Babinsky, former head of a
catering and supply enterprise in Dolni Kubin in western Slovakia.
He was sentenced last summer to 14{ years in jail on charges he
misappropriated $382,000 in state property.
   Babinsky and his associates were accused of paying bribes,
giving away art work and antique furniture and arranging sex
parties in order to attract development aid to Dolni Kubin, a
mountainous agricultural region near the Polish border.
   There were persistent but unconfirmed reports that high
government and party officials were involved in the scandal.
   Friday's statement from the Communist Party's ruling presidium,
or Politburo, said functionaries had been expelled from the party,
while other unspecified ``comrades were accused falsely'' in
connection with the case.
   ``Every inconsistency or regard for the position of individuals
or even attempts to shield functionaries or leading workers ...
create distrust in the party,'' the statement said.
   Communist Party leader Milos Jakes stressed when he took over
the party leadership from President Gustav Husak in December that
corruption in official ranks must be combated.

new president, Paul Steinle, 48, spent the day talking with UPI's
managers.
   Mario Vazquez Rana, a Mexican publisher who paid $41 million to
acquire UPI from Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
June 1986, announced Friday that he had transferred control of the
company's stock to the WNW Group.

   An extract of snake venom shows promise as a
treatment for stroke victims, according to researchers looking for
ways to dissolve blood clots before brain damage can occur.
   The treatment, called ancrod, is derived from the venom of the
Malayan pit viper. Doctors have given it to 10 patients, and
although the results are still preliminary, the therapy appears to
help.
   ``This is a drug that shows potential,'' said the study's
director, Dr. Charles P. Olinger, of the University of Cincinnati.

   Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's
first full week in a new judicial career may attract more public
scrutiny and speculation than did most of his 12 years as a federal
appellate judge.
   The ``fish bowl'' experience begins when the high court's newest
member joins his eight colleagues in taking the bench at 10 a.m.
EST Monday and starts hearing arguments in cases under study.
   What will be Kennedy's first question from the bench? Will he,
as Justice Antonin Scalia did two years ago, quickly establish
himself as an aggressive interrogator of lawyers appearing before
the court?

   The Soviets have become more open about
announcing their space failures, but failed to announce the
destruction of a spy satellite last month and gave out sparse
details about a rocket failure, space-watcher Jim Oberg said
Saturday.
   The official Tass news agency reported that the upper stage of
the Proton rocket booster failed on Wednesday and that on Thursday
``the Sputniks entered dense layers of the atmosphere and ceased
their existence.''
   According to U.S. Space Command, the largest chunk of debris
from the mission re-entered the earth's atmosphere Friday afternoon
between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and a smaller chunk fell earlier
near Australia.

<HEAD>President Defends Economic Policy; Stock Market Hits Six-Week High</HEAD>

   President Reagan contends in his annual economic report to
Congress that his tax and budget policies helped turn economic
despair into hope during his administration.
   The report issued Friday also downplayed problems associated
with the $2.4 trillion national debt and record trade imbalances
during the Reagan years.
   Separately, on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average
finished at a six-week high, rising 28.18 points to 2,014.59. The
widely-followed indicator had not closed at such heights since it
stood at 2,051.89 on Jan. 7.
   Market watchers attributed the rally to an increasingly
optimistic market outlook, due partly to signs of strength in the
manufacturing sector of the economy.
   In an eight-page introduction to this year's economic report,
President Reagan said the country was in much better shape than
when he took office seven years ago. The president said the
attitude toward the economy had shifted to hope from the despair
that prevailed in the early 1980s.
   ``The past five years of sustained and vigorous growth in
production, income and employment did not occur by accident,'' the
report stated. ``They were shaped by government policies explicitly
directed toward fostering the inherent dynamism of the private
sector.''
   During a separate press briefing, Beryl Sprinkel, the
president's chief economic adviser, said the United States had
produced 2{ times the number of jobs as the other top six
industrialized countries combined since the end of the 1981-82
recession.
   Addressing the nation's $400 billion foreign debt, Sprinkel
noted that the net payments to foreigners needed to service the
country's foreign debt represented just 0.1 percent of the $4.6
trillion U.S. economy.
   Sprinkel predicted an improving trade deficit would provide
about half of the country's overall economic growth this year,
which the administration is forecasting will slow to a 2.4 percent
from 3.8 percent in 1987.
   Sprinkel also said recent signs of economic slowdown did not
point to a recession in 1988. He said the recent string of three
consecutive declines in the Index of Leading Indicators signaled
slower economic growth in the first half of 1988 but not a
recession this year.
   Sprinkel discounted recent big declines in the key housing
construction sector during December and January, attributing them
to a too-restrictive monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve
in the months before the October stock market collapse.

<HEAD>Gillette To Resist Board Challenge By Coniston</HEAD>

   In facing a proxy fight over four seats on its
board of directors, Gillette Co. might also be facing a referendum
on its future as an independent company, analysts say.
   Gillette said Friday it would resist an attempt by Coniston
Partners to place four representatives on board seats up for
election at the company's annual meeting in April, including the
seat of chairman Colman M. Mockler Jr.
   Coniston, which holds a roughly 6 percent stake in the giant
personal products maker, is attempting to pressure Gillette into a
restructuring or merger that would boost its share price.
   Gillette rose 25 cents to $38.87{ a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday.
   Coniston pursued a similar strategy last year in leading the
successful campaign to break up Allegis Corp., leading analysts to
predict the battle over Gillette would be long and bitter.
   ``Coniston I don't think is going to go away any time soon,''
said Deepak Rap, who follows Gillette for the investment firm
Merrill Lynch & Co.
   Mockler, who also is Gillette's chief executive and president,
said Gillette would continue resisting Coniston in the belief that
the company would function best as an independent business.
   Gillette cited its 1987 financial results, which reflected a 12
percent rise in sales and a doubling of operating profit, indicated
that its business strategy was working.
   Andrew Shore, of the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said proxy fights were difficult to win, but in this case
Gillette management would have its hands full.
   The company has rebuffed several buyout offers from Revlon Group
Inc. dating back to 1986. The latest _ a $47-a-share, or $5.4
billion, offer _ was spurned late last year.
   In addition, a major restructuring that it undertook after
turning down a $4.12 billion Revlon buyout offer in November 1986
may not have boosted Gillette's share price enough to suit major
investors who remain wary about the strength of the stock market in
the wake of October's crash.
   Gillette's recent stock price in the high-$30 range is well
below the high-$40 to low-$50 range analysts estimate is the
company's acquisition value.
   ``It's really a referendum, like a vote for Coniston is a vote
for the sale of Gillette,'' said Shore. ``That's going to be very
difficult for shareholders to turn down.''
   Revlon must have Gillette's consent to launch a takeover of the
company under terms of a 10-year standstill agreement it signed in
November 1986, when Gillette bought out Revlon's nearly 14 percent
stake in the company after spurning the $4.12 billion offer.
   Nevertheless, Revlon chairman Ronald O. Perelman reportedly
remains interested in acquiring Gillette.
   Shore said that in addition to opposing Coniston's slate of
directors, Gillette could take other defensive measures including
the issuance of more stock, a leveraged buyout, a recapitalization
or a ``white knight'' merger with a friendly suitor.
   Even its candidates win election, Coniston would be unable to
take control of Gillette's board because only a third of the seats
are up for election in any year. But analysts say a Coniston
victory could pressure the board to consider a merger.
   Keith Gollust, a principal in the partnership, contended the
proxy fight was mandated by Gillette's takeover defenses, which
essentially gave its board unilateral power to accept or reject any
merger offers.
