   Egypt and Jordan said Monday the United
States should not advance interim solutions to the Palestinian
problem and urged that any U.S. peace plan aim for a final
settlement through an international conference.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Zaid Rifai
of Jordan separately outlined that position in remarks to
reporters. Rifai arrived in Cairo Monday for a one-day visit.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz will visit the Middle East
at the end of this month.
   Officials in Washington and Israel have said a new U.S. peace
plan was outlined to Arab and Israeli leaders by Richard Murphy,
the assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs.
   The Egyptian president visited Washington last month and held
talks in Cairo with Murphy last week. However, Mubarak said: ``The
Americans have not given us a specific (peace) plan.''
   ``But we have taken the position that any plan must clearly
include: first, an overall settlement of the problem and, second,
an international conference as a framework without any attempt to
outflank it.''
   For any peace plan to succeed, Mubarak said, it must envisage
``the final outcome, and we must stay away from any words or
provisions that were in the Camp David agreements because they are
outdated and finished.''
   He referred to an autonomy plan outlined in one of the
U.S.-mediated 1978 Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel. It
provided for an interim arrangement under which the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, captured by Israel in 1967,
would exercise self-rule for five years.
   The plan also provided that negotiations begin not later than
the third year of autonomy to consider the final status of the two
territories.
   Reports from Washington and Jerusalem last week said a two-stage
plan carried by Murphy suggested an accelerated version of the Camp
David formula.
   The reports said the plan proposed talks, to be held under
international sponsorship, on limited Palestinian self-rule as an
interim measure. Those talks would begin in April and negotiations
on the final status of the two territories would be held in
December, the reports said.
   After his 90-minute meeting with Mubarak, Rifai said that Jordan
opposed ``partial solutions or projects for self-rule'' in the West
Bank and Gaza. Jordan wants a final settlement through an
international conference, he added.
   The state-owned Middle East News Agency reported that Rifai
carried a message to Mubarak from King Hussein. Rifai did not
comment on any message.
   The Washington reports suggested that Shultz's tour will be to
sell the two-stage plan to Arab and Israeli leaders.
   Mubarak's remarks on Monday appeared to reflect serious
reservations about the reported plan.
   ``Shultz is coming and if he is bringing proposals to offer to
the parties concerned, I hope they will keep away from Camp David
and will cover a final solution,'' he said.
   He said an international conference ``would give all parties
confidence.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel opposes an international
conference, contending it would pressure Israel into making
territorial concessions.
   If a peace plan does not seek a final settlement through an
internatiuonal conference, Mubarak said, ``the consequences will
not be good.
   ``I do not wish for any initiative to fail. I wish for an
initiative that aims for a final solution establishing just peace
in the region.''
   Rifai reiterated Jordan's demand for a United Nations-sponsored
international conference with the participation of the Security
Council's five permanent members and all concerned parties,
including the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We are against any plan dealing with partial solutions or
projects for self-rule. We seek a final settlement ... Our
assessment of any initiative will depend on how close it comes to
the position I have stated.''
   Since Palestinian demonstrations against Israeli rule broke out
Dec. 8, more than 50 Arabs have died of Israeli gunfire.

   In Ottumwa, Iowa, Kathy Pietraszewski stood in the doorway at
the place where the Republican caucus was held last Monday night to
encourage shy voters to cross the threshhold for Pat Robertson.
   She was a soldier in Robertson's ``invisible army.''
   ``There were two of mine that couldn't come because they were
sick, but there were four who surprised me,'' says Mrs.
Pietraszewski, 35, mother of two. ``I knew them all as they came
in; I went out and personally met them so they wouldn't be afraid
to go to the caucus.''
   When the heads were counted, there were 64, and 43 of them gave
the nod to Robertson.
   Statewide, Robertson finished second, behind Bob Dole but ahead
of Vice President George Bush _ a shock to many, but not to some
Robertson people who like Mrs. Pietraszewski had been working for
their candidate for months. (``I told my family there will be lots
of other Christmases, but this one's different.'')
   The Robertson ground troops, new to politics and excited by
success, are starting to ask themselves if they have it within
their power to put their man in office.
   ``A lot of people have said, well, I agree with Pat Robertson's
stands, but I don't want to waste my vote,'' the Rev. Walter
Holder, pastor of the First Baptist Church told the Concord (N.H.)
Monitor. ``That was before Iowa. My impression is now he's a little
more electable. There may indeed be a groundswell.''
   The Rev. John Fortin of the Faith Christian Center in Bedford,
N.H., puts it this way: ``If Pat is God's man then somehow he's
going to get in there. But not without a lot of hard work and
prayer.''
   And the Rev. Ken Borchers, pastor of the United Methodist Church
in Ashland, tells of a lunch that a group of clergymen had with
Robertson. After getting to know him as a person, Borchers said,
``We all laid our hands on him and prayed for him. We prayed for
strength and guidance and prayed if it is God's will, that he be
elected.''
   Jeffrey K. Hadden, a University of Virginia sociologist and a
Robertson biographer, says Robertson came up with a masterstroke in
insisting that three million followers sign petitions before he
would decide to run. The tactic gave Robertson an army.
   ``He asked people to pledge that they'd work for him, pray for
him and give him money,'' says Hadden. ``Political historians may
view it as one of the most ingenious things a candidate ever did.''
   These days, Robertson soft pedals the church-based foundation of
his candidacy. He says he should be thought of as a television
network executive and the chancellor of a fully accredited graduate
university. To call him merely a TV evangelist, he protests ``is
bigotry and it's an insult. And it denigrates who I am and what I
am and I'm sick of it.''
   For all that, most of Robertson's followers come out of the
evangelical churches of America. They know him best as a man of God
_ and they speak of him, often, in language unblushingly tinged
with theology.
   ``I just believe Robertson is going to win,'' says Gloria
Widmann of Waterloo, Iowa. ``He operates in miraculous wonders in
terms of what the Bible says _ prophecy, healing, miracles. He
operates just like Jesus did and he loves just like Jesus did. And
we need a man of God in the office.''
   In Port Huron, Mich., Billye Knoik, who quit her job as a church
secretary to work for Robertson, scoffs at the term the press has
given Robertson's political flock.
   ``These are just your common, everyday folks from various and
sundry backgrounds and Pat is touching these people,'' she says.
Mrs. Knoik, mother of three grown children, got to know Robertson
from watching the 700 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Network.
   In New Hampshire, where on Tuesday Robertson faces his first
test in a primary, Mrs. Maria Farris, 37, of Londonderry, town
chairman and Robertson's local coordinator, says the conventional
wisdom _ that Robertson will have trouble in a primary election _
has missed the point.
   ``It's there,'' she says of a Robertson post-Iowa surge.
``There's a tremendous force that hasn't been really identified in
the normal political process.''
   Registration ended last weekend in New Hampshire and city and
town clerks say they were so busy for three weeks they didn't have
time to leave their offices and grab lunch.
   The lines were long. Nearly 1,000 people registered in
Manchester on a Saturday. Many are first-time voters. Many
registered undeclared, meaning they can vote Democrat or
Republican. Secretary of State William Gardner estimates the late
surge added 15,000 to 25,000 voters in a state where Ronald Reagan
won the primary in 1980 with 73,000 votes. Gardner can't guess how
many of the new registrants are Robertson supporters.
   The Rev. Keith Marsh, a pastor at the Dartmouth Area Christian
Fellowship in New Hamsphire, says in 1986 about 50,000 residents of
the state gave money to the Christian Broadcasting Network.
   After Iowa, all the candidates flew to New Hampshire, but
Robertson went to Minnesota, which holds caucuses Feb. 23 and where
a strong ``pro-life'' movement has ties to fundamentalist churches.
   Dole's Minnesota co-chairman, Carl Ludeman, says Jack Kemp is no
longer Dole's greatest threat. ``We feel that in Minnesota we have
only one competitor in grass roots organization, that's Pat
Robertson.''
   In Hawaii, where Robertson won overwhelmingly in the Feb. 4
Republican caucuses, GOP chairman Howard Chong credits a 60 percent
rise in party registration tp Robertson's appeal.
   Says Robertson co-chairman Gene Ward: ``We draw from mainstream
conservatives, evangelicals and those who know Pat from the 700
Club.''
   In Iowa, retiree Chuck Underwood of Des Moines, a lay pastor,
says Robertson's appeal politicized the non-political _ like
himself.
   ``I've got to get with it,'' Underwood tells a reporter. ``I've
got to get involved. I'm ashamed to say that's the first caucus I
ever attended.''
   Were Robertson people in Iowa told to be evasive to pollsters so
the Robertson strength would come as a surprise?
   No, Underwood says: ``People have a little bit of a problem with
the role of the media. They were tight-lipped on the thing.''
   Guy Rodgers of Shenandoah, Iowa, a Robertson activist who has
worked for a number of Christian causes: ``We had a lot of people
support Pat who we referred to as closet supporters. I saw that in
my own precinct. I saw people we hadn't identified, people we
didn't know. There were extra numbers here that we weren't aware
of.''
   The Rev. David Nelms, pastor a Des Moines Baptist Church, says
evangelical churches didn't outright support Robertson, but they
sure gave up preaching that politics is securlar business to be
shunned in favor of the Lord's work.
   ``For years, we heard Christians should stay out of politics,''
he says. ``Of late, our leaders have encouraged the opposite.''

<HEAD>Rule Barring Abortion Advice Dealt Blow By Federal Judge</HEAD>

   A federal judge Monday temporarily barred
enforcement of a new federal rule that prevents federally funded
family planning clinics from advising pregnant women on abortion.
The ruling applies to three organizations in Colorado and Utah that
brought suit.
   U.S. District Court Judge Zita L. Weinshienk granted the motion
by the three birth control services groups seeking a preliminary
injuction against the new rule scheduled to go into effect March 3.
   ``The order just says the government cannot put these
regulations into effect until we have a chance to hear it in a
final hearing,'' Weinshienk told The Associated Press.
   The judge said she expected new hearing dates to be set within a
week. She also said two other similar cases are before federal
judges in Boston and New York.
   Filing the suit against the government were Rocky Mountain
Planned Parenthood based in Denver, Planned Parenthood of Utah and
the Boulder Women's Health Clinic. The ruling temporarily barring
enforcement of the rule applies only to those three organizations,
Weinshienk said.
   The suit claims new federal ruling violates the Federal Title X
statute and the intent of Congress, censors free speech rights at
family planning clinics and violates the right of privacy of
clinics and their patients.
   The Department of Health and Human Services had ruled that
beginning March 3, family planning programs receiving federal funds
could not provide pregnant women with information on abortion or
refer them to other sources, even if they ask.
   Administration officials have said the rule is intended to make
sure federal funds are not used to promote abortion, even
indirectly.
   Weinshienk said she based her decision on many U.S. Supreme
Court rulings that said there could not be rules that ``dictated to
doctors what they say to patients, which is what the regulations
attempted to do.''
   ``Based on that finding, and the fact that all of these cases
indicated that such attempted regulation was unconstitutional, I
found irreparable injury. The last two prongs for such a
preliminary injunction are a balancing of harms to the plaintiff
and against harms to the defendant,'' the judge said.
   The order will be in writing and out by the end of the week, she
said.
   The judge said she made the ruling on a holiday, Presidents'
Day, because it was the only date when the two sides and she could
get together.
   ``The government wanted it heard as soon as possible. The
plaintiffs ... wanted it heard before the regs (regulations) went
into effect on March 3. I said fine, if you want to come in on a
holiday, I will too,'' Weinshienk said.

   When Pat Robertson's campaign bus pulls
into shopping malls, the driver turns on his tapes of John Philip
Sousa marches and passers-by strut on the sidewalks. Inside,
Robertson and his aides are busy passing out a different type of
cassette _ his positions on issues ranging from abortion to defense.
   Robertson's campaign for the Republican nomination for the
presidency is as much showmanship as it is politics. It's one of
the slickest shows in town now finishing its run in New Hampshire
and heading South next.
   At a major rally to fire up supporters, Randall Brooks, who
starred as Annie in the smash Broadway musical 10 years ago, sings
the hit song, ``Tomorrow.''
   And as the song goes, you can bet your bottom dollar that
Robertson is hoping the sun will come out tomorrow, er Tuesday, in
the form of a strong showing in the New Hampshrie primary.
   At a rally in Concord Saturday night, you'd have thought
Robertson had already won his party's nomination. It had all the
trappings, the straw hats and Robertson placards, of a nominating
convention.
   Eight hundred supporters clapped, stomped their feet and chanted:
   ``We want Pat! We want Pat!''
   ``Go, Pat, go! Go, Pat, go!''
   Then, of course, Robertson came out on stage and whipped the
crowd into a frenzy.
   ``When I look at your faces and see this enthusiasm, I believe
we are going to see victory in New Hampshire,'' he said. ``I'm
talking to people who love America. This state represents what's
good in America because it stands for faith in God. It stands for
strong family values. It stands for preservation of life for the
unborn.''
   And when you ask around in the malls and at the rallies about
Pat Robertson, his followers tell you he stands for all those
things. Simple as that, they say.
   Kelly Griswold, a mother of five children from Londonderry, sang
a couple of inspirational songs for Robertson.
   One of them was ``Can't We Be Friends.'' _ ``Can't we be
friends. Life's too short. Too soon it ends. And good friends are
so hard to find. Can't we be friends. Someone like you is one of a
kind.''
   The second one, ``Eagle Song,'' she wrote herself: ``An eagle
tucked with golden wings is flying on his way upward, heavenward
bound.''
   ``I feel that's what Pat's calling is,'' she said later.
``That's what I believe Pat is meant to do. He's my man.''
   Martha Greer drove 30 miles from Laconia to see Robertson this
night. She explained that she was an ``8_88.'' That means she found
eight more voters to support Robertson in '88.
   ``He's a solid man,'' she said. ``He stands for a lot of good
things. He stands on the Bible for one thing. He's a good Christian
man.''
   At the malls, Robertson works the crowds relentlessly. He's in
pizza parlors, bookstores and barber shops, smiling, shaking hands,
embracing voters.
   At a candy shop, he wishes voters a happy Valentine's Day, then
matter-of-factly says to them, ``I need some help on Tuesday.''

   Annie Sims, the preacher's wife, delivered the
prophecy at a noon prayer meeting late in December:
   ``The Lord said he was going to send a tornado, and many shall
die,'' she recalls, saying God spoke through her during the prayer
service. ``He was going to send his fury and vengeance on the
people.''
   So 17 faithful members of the Repairer of the Breach Church of
God in Christ gathered at their small westside church _ a converted
two-story frame house _ on Jan. 3 to await the wrath of God.
   The congregation has been waiting, faithfully, peacefully, ever
since.
   Any day now, any moment, members believe, God will send a
tornado spinning down from the heavens to smite the wicked and
spare the righteous. And spare their church.
   Their number includes a school teacher, a recent college
graduate, a college freshman, and a restaurant worker with a
management degree.
   They have sacrificed jobs and education, as well as the respect
of family and friends who question their sanity.
   The congregation has been challenged by the power of the state,
too.
   Five members have been removed under court order _ though two of
them have returned since undergoing forced psychiatric
examinations. Two children were taken from their mother and
returned to school, and a 51-year-old man was ordered to undergo
kidney dialysis treatment.
   But unlike a Mormon polygamist clan in Utah whose recent
resistance of police ended in a shootout that killed one officer,
these religious fundamentalists have quietly accepted the
intrusions.
   ``We're not against the court,'' says M.L. Sims, the church
elder and preacher, the husband of Annie. ``If God allows it to
happen, then that's it.''
   Sims, 36, says he's also lost the support of national church
headquarters in Memphis, Tenn., which ordered him to take down a
sign proclaiming affiliation. ``Until the Lord says to move it,
it's going to be up,'' he says.
   A woman who answered a call at the Memphis headquarters said no
one was available to discuss the matter.
   Despite the challenges from outsiders, Sims and the church
members welcome visitors and talk freely. All profess an
unshakeable belief in the tornado. None say they want to leave.
   The 39-year-old Mrs. Sims first prophesied the tornado would
strike Jan. 3, then Jan. 24. Both dates passed uneventfully. The
Simses now say God delayed the tornado to gain time to spread the
warning. No new date has been set.
   ``It'll be pretty soon,'' says Sims. ``It's nationally known
now.''
   No one's faith is shaken by the delay, or by meteorological
precedent.
   ``Tornadoes can occur anytime, but most of the tornadoes in this
area occur from March through June, and then again late in the
fall,'' said National Weather Service forecaster Larry Mowery, who
says he can't recall a midwinter tornado ever striking the area.
   Religion professor Patrick Olivelle, chairman of the department
at Indiana University, says apocalyptic visions are common
religious themes.
   ``Of course there are always reasons why the end never comes,''
he said. ``I always tell my students that religion is not logic,
and you cannot put logical questions to that.''
   One of those waiting in the church, David Freeman, a 24-year-old
graduate of Grinnell College with a major in Spanish, said,
``There's no doubt in my mind, or in anyone's mind that it's going
to come.''
   Freeman stopped showing up for his bank teller's job after Jan.
3, then called the bank to explain. ``They didn't really understand
it,'' he said. ``But after the tornado comes they'll understand,
and they'll congratulate us for standing up for the Lord.''
   The family of Ruschell Harris, a Gary school teacher, and her
16-year-old daughter, Jeanetta, won the court order compelling the
two to undergo psychiatric evaluation.
   ``Really, at the time, they felt I was so deeply under the
influence of pastor that we couldn't do our own thinking,'' she
said. ``If I believe something, and it's different from what you
believe, does that make me insane and you not?''
   Mrs. Harris said she and her daughter returned voluntarily to
the church after a psychiatrist found them competent.
   ``I'm 47 years old. I've been teaching for 20 years. I've taken
my daughter out of school,'' said Mrs. Harris indignantly. ``Do you
think I would be here if I didn't believe it?''
   Jeanetta says it doesn't matter she's missing out on school.
``It doesn't bother me because after the tornado, the school may
not be there.''
   A court gave custody of Patricia Sanders' two sons, Allen
Simmons, 13, and Charles Russell, 12, to a brother, who will return
them to school. Child welfare authorities took the children from
the church.
   ``I don't fight that. They're just doing their job,'' says Mrs.
Sanders. ``They don't understand, because this is spiritual.''
   The days are occupied with informal services, talking and just
waiting.
   ``Praise God, because this world is coming to an end, and we
want to be right,'' chanted Elder Sims during one service. ``People
say we're strange, they say we're crazy, that we're crackpots,'' he
intones, mopping sweat from his face with a towel thrown around his
beefy shoulders. ``But we're just doing what God says to do.''
   ``Better be so ready, you may not know the day,'' sings the
congregation, now a choir whose voice reverberates off bright
blue-painted plaster walls.
   There is no television or radio in the church, and no
newspapers. Adult members take turns preparing meals in the fully
equipped kitchen, and the teen-agers clean up. The Simses live
upstairs. At night, the others fold up the metal chairs and spread
out bedding.
   The cramped quarters are part of the sacrifice. ``We've all
sacrificed here,'' says 18-year-old Falease Lemon, who dropped out
of Indiana Univerity's Gary campus. ``God is going to pay us in
return.''
   Jacqueline Sims, the preacher's 18-year-old daughter, says the
waiting will be ended soon.
   ``We'll be out there after the tornado,'' she says. ``Then the
world will be a better place to live, with everybody doing God's
will.''

<TEXT>
   The French, known for fickleness in politics and
love, have become so enamored of President Francois Mitterrand that
they affectionately call him Uncle and his following often is
compared to a cult.
   With presidential elections less than three months away,
Mitterrand is a phantom candidate. He says he has not decided on
seeking re-election, but draws celebrities, scientists and ordinary
citizens onto his bandwagon in an effortless non-campaign.
   Politicians who have spoken with the 71-year-old Socialist say
he will declare his intentions in early March. The first-round vote
is set for April 24.
   Meanwhile, Mitterrand is called more and more by the nickname
Tonton, an affectionate term for uncle. He has become a sort of
political superstar, imperturbable and lovable in his presidential
grandeur.
   Lacking a declared rival in the Socialist opposition, Premier
Jacques Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre have a problem. The
two leading conservatives are reduced to shadow-boxing with the
avuncular Mitterrand image at the risk of looking like family
bullies.
   ``Francois Mitterrand would be well advised to give an answer
soon,'' Chirac said recently. ``A presidential election is an
important affair.''
   Barre has criticized ``the often abusive use of an image, that
of the nice old uncle. It's both charming and fuzzy. It's sweet
tonton.''
   Mitterrand's popularity has risen since his Socialist government
lost power to the Chirac conservatives in March 1986. He has led
opinion polls for months, but the phenomenon called
``Mitterrandolatry'' or ``Tontonmania'' is recent.
   With the Socialist Party not conducting an official campaign,
independent committees began springing up around the country,
gathering signatures and putting up Mitterrand posters.
   Groups of noted scientists, intellectuals, homosexuals and
others advertised their support.
   Actor Gerard Depardieu said he never votes, but he bought a
full-page newspaper ad declaring: ``Mitterrand or nothing.'' The
rock star Renaud sponsored a similar ad, urging the president to
``hang in there.''
   Dominique Jamet, editor of the right-wing newspaper Quotidien de
Paris, was among hundreds of people who signed an appeal saying,
``Don't Leave Us.'' He was fired immediately.
   Justice Minister Albin Chalandon compared the president's
relationship with the French to that of Marshal Philippe Petain,
head of the Vichy France government that collaborated with the
German occupation in World War II. Many of the French were
scandalized by the comparison.
   Chalandon called the situation ``irrational'' and said the
campaign climate risked becoming one of ``soft, vague demagogy.''
   Indeed, pro-Mitterrand letters being published speak of ``Dr.
Mitterrand,'' his ``intellectual firmness'' and his ``cultural
finesse.''
   A quarterly magazine named Influence quoted a former dancer at
the Crazy Horse nightclub as saying Mitterrand is not a sex symbol,
``but he is so soft, with such a watchful air, that it gives him in
my eyes great charm. Without mentioning his intelligence, which
seduces me completely.''
   Historian Jacques Julliard, who studies public opinion and
contemporary political culture, says ``Tontonmania'' is explainable.
   ``Always in France there is the role of the providential man,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   As a president sharing power with a conservative premier,
Mitterrand has a high profile without the blame for unpopular
government policies.
   ``He is a president who doesn't govern,'' Julliard said. ``When
he officially becomes a candidate, he'll start losing points.''
   One of many recent polls indicated 61 percent of French people
want Mitterrand as president, 48 percent prefer Barre and 40
percent favor Chirac.
   In early 1986, when a Socialist government still was in power,
Mitterrand's support was 39 percent.
   ``If Mitterrand is not officially a candidate, it is to make
himself desired,'' wrote Serge July, editor of the leftist
newspaper Liberation, reflecting the view that the president's
refusal to declare himself is a political tactic.
   Mitterrand has made few comments about ``Tontonmania,'' saying
only that he had no hand in the private efforts on his behalf. As
he put it in late December: ``It's very nice of them. They didn't
consult me and so I have neither to say go ahead nor to stop them.''

   Two decades ago, affordable housing and a
good highway system lured dozens of major companies to
Connecticut's suburbs of New York City. Today, highways are
clogged, $500,000 homes are considered pedestrian, and a corporate
exodus may be on the horizon.
   The waves of growth from New York's global market, which once
brought treasures to Connecticut's ``Gold Coast,'' now threaten to
erode some of its most precious economic gains.
   Over the past year, at least a half dozen big companies have
announced plans to close or relocate their Fairfield County
operations and many more are said to be considering such moves. A
recent survey of 300 local manufacturers found a third considering
partial or total relocations.
   The main gripe: The suburbs, which used to have the location
without the cost of the Big Apple, have grown so clogged with
people and cars that life here is no longer a bargain.
   ``Most people who make a move do a lot of looking and if they're
after big cost differences, there's no longer a big cost difference
between New York and Fairfield County,'' said Peter Helie, chief
operating officer of the William Pitt real estate company, which
has 16 offices in Connecticut.
   ``So, if they're looking for a lower-cost area, they're bound to
move off the East Coast.''
   Housing prices have soared so that many homes are out of the
reach of even some two-income families. In Greenwich, the average
price of a home has risen from $86,730 in 1970 to $706,150 last
year, said Stanley Klein, publisher of the Greenwich Record of Real
Estate Sales.
   He said the ``American Dream'' _ a four-bedroom home on one acre
of land in Greenwich _ costs a family about $540,000 today.
   Howard T. Owens, a state senator from Bridgeport and chairman of
the General Assembly's Transportation Committee, describes the
situation on Interstate 95 and the Merritt Parkway _ the region's
major highways _ as ``absolutely horrendous.''
   ``It's gridlock from 6:30 a.m. to after 8:30. A ride from
Bridgeport to Stamford that should take 25 minutes takes more than
one hour, and if every aspect of mass transportation was used by
the year 2000, we'd still have hopeless gridlock,'' Owens said.
   William S. Woodside, former chairman of Primerica Corp., said if
some of these trends aren't stemmed, Fairfield County could become
a pasture for top executives with little commerce because people
who work in the trades, restaurants and other businesses won't be
able to afford to live here.
   Woodside, who moved Primerica's headquarters to Greenwich in
1970 when it was American Can Co., is chairman of the Regional Plan
Association, an economic planning organization for the tri-state
region of Connecticut, New Jesey and New York.
   He said that when companies moved to Connecticut in the 1970s,
housing was affordable, land was plentiful and an ample labor pool
was available.
   ``The county has changed dramatically already,'' he said.
``Greenwich has closed schools in the last 10 years and they do
that because they no longer have enough kids to use the schools. No
young people can afford to live in these cities.''
   Evidence of a possible corporate exodus cropped up in 1987, when
at least six companies pulled out of the area:
   _Georgia-Pacific Corp. announced it would move most of its
regional operations from Darien to its corporate headquarters in
Atlanta. The Fortune 500 forest products company employed 320
people in Darien, making it the town's single largest employer.
   _Revere Copper and Brass Inc., which had moved from New York to
Stamford about two years ago, said it planned to relocate its
headquarters in the Midwest.
   _Penn Central Corp. said it would move its headquarters from
Greenwich to Cincinnati.
   _Stauffer Chemical Co. announced it would close its headquarters
in Westport. Its three main businesses were split up and the
headquarters are moving to Shelton, Conn., Wilmington, Del., and
Chicago.
   _Electrolux Inc. said it would shift its headquarters from
Stamford to Atlanta.
   _Iomega Corp. returned to Utah only a year after moving its
headquarters to Stamford.
   Most cited the need for ``consolidation'' as the reason for
leaving, but one knowledgeable observer said the high cost of
staying in the area was a contributing factor.
   ``Essentially those who can break away and have no need to be in
the command center of the global market are finding other locations
and being in a sense pushed out or at least costed out by those who
have to have that location,'' said John Keith, president of the
Regional Plan Association.
   A survey by the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry
Association, a coalition of business groups and the state, said
last year that twice as many manufacturers moved out of Fairfield
County as moved in during the past five years.
   Manufacturing generates $10 billion in revenues and provides 36
percent of the jobs in the county, said Al Petrikas, president of
the Wilton-based Vitta Corp. and chairman of the task force that
directed the survey.
   But John Mitovich, president and chief executive officer of
SACIA, said he doesn't believe ``the bloom is completely off the
rose'' in Fairfield County.
   ``When people look at the region and see some traffic patterns,
some people like to attribute the erosion (of businesses) to
traffic or cost, but that's not completely it. There's a range of
things happening,'' he said.
   Mitovich said some of the companies that moved to the region in
the 1970s are no longer here because they have been merged with
others or bought out.
   Corporate executives at companies that have not announced any
plans to move decline to discuss the possibility of relocating
because it worries their employees.
   But when Louis Harris and Associates, the survey research firm
in New York, asked chief executive officers to name the best major
metropolitan area in which to locate a business, none of the 403
executives ranked any Connecticut cities in the top tier. They said
Atlanta was the best location.
   ``Overall, the New York area, which includes Connecticut, does
get a pretty bad rap,'' said Merl Baker, executive vice president
of Louis Harris in New York.

   As six states and the District of Columbia
launch a new multistate Lotto game, Associated Press bureaus in 26
states checked on their states' experience with legal wagering.

   Twenty-six states are now wheedling extra dollars from their
taxpayers with lottery games, helping senior citizens in
Pennsylvania, schools in Ohio and economic development in Iowa and
Oregon.
   Total sales exceeded $12 billion last year. Eight states sell $1
billion or more in lottery tickets a year, keeping a third or more
of that amount to support state programs. Within the last year,
Florida, Kansas, Montana and South Dakota have joined the club, and
Wisconsin and Virginia will begin games this year.
   Though most states report rising income from wagering, some have
to hustle to keep bettors interested.
   Last week, Pennsylvania scrapped a lotto game that had sold $2.2
billion worth of tickets since 1982 and launched a ``Wild Card
Lotto'' game. Players in the old game picked six numbers out of 40,
but the new game has 48 choices.
   That changes the odds of winning from one in 1.9 million to one
in 6.1 million. That, in turn, increases the chances of creating
one of those humongous $30 million or $40 million jackpots that
inspire frantic ticket sales.
   ``We've had so many people who've won a million or more, it now
takes a pot of $10 million to generate the interest that $5 million
did once,'' says Laurie Kipp-Klecha, a spokeswoman for the lottery
in Michigan, where on Sunday officials said someone was holding a
$17 million ticket after the latest drawing.
   ``People like to spend a dollar to have a shot at the moon,''
said Kathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.
   That's also the theory behind the new six-state ``Lotto
America'' game, launched last week in Oregon, Iowa, Kansas,
Missouri, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
With more bettors to lose money, the game can offer bigger prizes _
a minimum of $2 million.
   ``Our motivation is to offer Oregonians a chance to play in
games they could play in one of the big states,'' said James Davey,
whose state lottery faces big-jackpot competition along the
California border.
   No one picked all seven numbers to win the jackpot in the first
Lotto America drawing held Saturday night. More than 2 million
tickets were sold, spokesman Brett Voorhees said in Des Moines,
Iowa.
   Colorado legislators, who have seen lottery sales slump from
$136.9 million in the first year, 1982-83, to as low as $105.3
million in fiscal 1985, are debating a big-jackpot lotto game this
year.
   Donald L. Bean, assistant director of the Ohio lottery, credits
the state's ``Super Lotto'' game with helping build ticket sales
from $100 million in the first year, 1974-75, to $1.07 billion last
year.
   There are seven other states in the billion-dollar club:
California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York
and Pennsylvania.
   New York has the most lucrative games, earning $666.8 million on
sales of $1.46 billion, a 45 percent profit, in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1987.
   New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania all extract more than 40
percent from their games as well.
   However, Missouri's 2-year-old lottery has run into problems
because the state constitutional amendment authorizing the games
requires that 45 percent of the proceeds go to the state and that
no more than 10 percent go to administration.
   An independent audit commissioned by the Legislature concluded
that the game would fail early in 1989 unless more money was
offered as prizes and more money was available for administration.
An amendment reflecting those recommendations will be on the
Missouri ballot later this year.
   The Missouri lottery earned $80 million last year, far less than
the $250 million a year some legislators had forecast.
   Even a successful operation such as the New York lottery
contributes only 2.5 percent of the state's general fund budget,
and there is no reason to believe that lotteries have been a
substitute for tax increases.
   New York's game began at the same time sales, personal income
and corporate taxes were rising in the free-spending years of Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller. Washington state's lottery came with a package
of tax increases in 1982, when the state was hard-pressed for cash.
   Dave Ellis, spokesman for the Massachusetts lottery, recalled
that the lottery was promoted in 1971 as a way of avoiding a sales
tax increase from 3 percent to 4 percent. In 1975, the sales tax
went up to 5 percent _ part of a program by newly elected Gov.
Michael Dukakis to eliminate a $600 million deficit.
   Pennsylvania's receipts are earmarked for senior citizen
programs such as tax subsidies and prescription drugs. Despite
projected growth of 11 percent next year, revenues were lagging
behind program requirements, and Gov. Robert P. Casey has
recommended returning some of the senior citizen programs to
general funding.
   Iowa decided not to depend on lottery profits for state
operations. Instead, ``Iowa Plan'' proceeds go into one-time
economic development programs such as grants to new or expanding
businesses.
   Oregon also directs its lottery profits _ $47.3 million last
year _ to economic development.
   Florida, which began its lottery last month, has a novel clause
making things more difficult for unscrupulous prize winners. It
provides for prizes to be awarded to dependents if the winner is a
child-support deadbeat. Already, $70,000 has been earmarked for
dependents.

   State lottery games have had few scandals, but inevitably
someone is tempted to try to shorten the odds.
   One of the more recent scandals was in New York, where four
workers in the lottery division's mailroom were caught intercepting
stubs in a ``second-chance'' and putting their own names on them.
The four were fired.
   In 1975, all 318 lottery workers in New York were laid off and
the games were suspended after it was discovered that tickets with
duplicate numbers had been printed for one drawing. The games
resumed the next year.
   The chairman of New Jersey's lottery commission was indicted in
1983 for submitting false letters to a state ethics committee. The
panel was investigating whether the chairman, Reese Palley, had a
business relationship with lottery contractors or potential
contractors.
   Palley pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge.
   In Ohio, a former official was convicted of mail fraud in 1980
along with an accomplice for rigging a game. He was found out when
lottery employees noticed that the official's fiancee had won
$21,000.
   Pennsylvania had a loaded ping-pong ball scandal in 1980. Eight
people were convicted of rigging a Daily Number drawing and winning
$3.5 million. Greed was their undoing _ investigators said heavy
betting by the conspirators gave the game away.
   Last month, Delaware's ``High Card'' game suffered an
embarrassing boo-boo when it was discovered that numbers could be
read on a scratch-card game without having to scratch. The cards
were withdrawn.

   There was no question the Danish
supertanker Kate Maersk had a gaping hole in its hull, that a
crewman was dead, that the burning and crippled ship needed to be
towed from the Persian Gulf.
   But the question that perplexed the gulf shipping community is
one that has become increasingly characteristic of the increasingly
confusing Iran-Iraq war: Which nation staged the attack?
   ``It's confusing, and it will grow more confusing,'' said a
Dubai-based shipping executive who spoke on condition of anonymity
according to company rules. ``Both sides are diversifying the style
of the attacks and the weapons they have been using.''
   Initially, the gulf shipping community almost unanimously
considered the tanker a victim of an Iranian raid on Thursday. It
was a logical target for Iran, which attacks neutral vessels in
retaliation for Iraq's attacks on Iranian tankers.
   It also left the sort of damage characteristic of Iranian
Silkworm missiles.
   But by Sunday, the prevailing opinion among shipping executives
was that the ship was the victim of an Iraqi raid _ the latest,
perhaps, in a series of errant Iraqi missile attacks.
   The executives said a key clue came on Friday, when an Iraqi jet
bomber, a Soviet-made Badger, fired two C-601 missiles within eight
miles of the destroyer USS Chandler, which was escorting a convoy
of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers. The Navy began escorting the
tankers last July to protect them from Iran, which considers Kuwait
an ally of Iraq in the seven-year Iran-Iraq war.
   The Iraqis weren't known previously to have had the C-601s, an
air-to-ground version of the anti-ship Silkworms favored by Iran.
Iraq normally uses French-built Exocet missiles.
   Such changing weaponry on both sides _ and the propensity for
mistaken targets _ is clouding the gulf picture. Iran, for example,
until lately has relied mainly on speedboats equipped with guns to
stage its attacks.
   But earlier this month, a U.S.-made Phantom jet of Iran's made a
sudden reapearance on the gulf, the first Iranian jet spotted in
the region in a year and a half.
   Shipping executives also believe Iranians now possesses
substantial numbers of U.S.-designed Mavericks, an air-to-surface
missile that can cause as much damage as the missiles used by Iraq.
   The Iranians also have equipped frigates with Italian-made
Seakiller missiles, which can cause more damage to a ship's hull
than cannon shells, rocket-propelled grenades or machine guns that
their speedboats normally use.
   And they have the Silkworms, deployed at the southern and
northern extremities of the gulf, but mobile and therefore
effective from any point along the 600-mile gulf coast.
   But mistaken targets are what U.S. officers said they fear most
in the gulf.
   Last May 17, an Iraqi missile strike killed 37 Americans aboard
the USS Stark, a frigate. Iraq said the attack was a mistake, and
the United States accepted its apology.
   On Feb. 7, U.S. military officers said the battle cruiser
Richmond K. Turner had a ``tense moment'' when the the firing and
subsequent explosion of what was believed to be an Iraqi missile
could be viewed from the ship.
   There have been other instances in which Iraqi missiles fired
from long range at a mere radar blip have wound up devastating
ships linked to their Arab allies, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Iraq also once blasted a fishing trawler.
   The Iranians aren't immune from mistakes. On Jan. 22, Iran
attacked the Norwegian-owned Havpil as it headed toward the Iranian
port of Bandar Abbas with a shipment of refined petroleum products
that were, in fact, for Iran.
   So with the weapons changing _ and not necessarily being pointed
in the right direction _ the gulf shipping community has now become
more cautious about determining who is shooting what, and why.
   ``We tend to immediately say it's an Iranian attack once a
victim of the tanker war is related to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or
when the location of the attack is away from the Iranian shipping
lanes, but we are growing more careful now,'' said the Dubai
executive.

   By ordinary Northern Ireland standards, the six
Roman Catholics killed by police near the end of 1982 would not
stand out among the 2,620 other people who have died during the
20-year conflict.
   But the six men were unarmed, and the murky circumstances of the
police ambushes in which they died have left an ugly mystery that
has resurfaced to batter Britain's reputation for justice and fair
play.
   Critics allege that the shootings, in three separate incidents
over a three-week period, were deliberate; that the policemen who
did it escaped punishment; and that a senior police officer sent in
to investigate was hounded out of uniform because he got too close
to the truth.
   The controversy was rekindled on Jan. 25 when the British
government, while denying that police mounted a ``shoot-to-kill
policy'' in Northern Ireland, admitted in a statement that there
had been a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
   This admission, coupled with a refusal on national security
grounds to prosecute the killers, has provoked outcry in Britain
and Ireland, and plunged relations between the two governments to
their lowest ebb in nearly six years.
   In February, the investigating officer, John Stalker, published
his book, ``Stalker,'' a portrayal of Northern Ireland as Britain's
unruly backyard, where the normal rules of policing and justice are
routinely flouted.
   Critics say the book reaffirms the belief that British rule in
Northern Ireland is unjust toward the Catholic minority, and there
are worries that the affair will set back recent progress toward
reconciliation, most notably the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement giving
Dublin a say in governing the province.
   On Nov. 11, 1982, three guerrilla suspects were shot dead by
police as they drove through County Armagh. A month later, two more
died in similar circumstances in the same area, notorious as a
hotbed of guerrilla activity.
   In between, a teen-ager with no guerrilla connections was killed
in a County Armagh hayshed that served as a guerrilla explosives
hideout, having apparently stumbled innocently into a police ambush.
   At first the police said all the deaths occurred in the normal
course of anti-terrorist warfare. But subsequent evidence suggested
the killings were deliberate and avoidable.
   Sir John Hermon, chief constable of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, ordered an inquiry, and in May 1984, Stalker, the
deputy chief constable of the Manchester police force, arrived from
the mainland with a six-man investigation team.
   In his book, the lean, bespectacled Englishman says he was put
on his guard from the outset when Hermon told him: ``Remember, Mr.
Stalker, you are in a jungle now.''
   Hermon has refused repeatedly to comment on Stalker's book.
   Stalker says he faced constant obstruction from a police force
that resented him as an intruder, and from Hermon who, Stalker
believes, was determined to protect his beleaguered force at any
cost.
   Nonetheless, after two years of investigation he felt he had
uncovered enough to suspect the killings were ``the act of a
Central American assassination squad _ truly of a police force out
of control.''
   Stalker writes that he had evidence that at least 11 officers
were involved in a conspiracy to pervert justice and commit perjury.
   Then, he says, ``the investigation came to an end for me like a
car hitting a brick wall.'' In May 1986 he was abruptly dumped from
the inquiry and suspended for ``disciplinary offenses.''
   The offenses concerned his use of police vehicles and his past
acquaintance with people who had minor police records. The panel
that sat in judgment threw out the charges and immediately
reinstated him.
   But he was not restored to the Northern Ireland inquiry. And he
does not believe the government's insistence that his suspension
had nothing to do with Northern Ireland.
   On March 13, 1987, just before his 48th birthday, Stalker quit
the force and began writing his book. Partially serialized in a
mass-circulation London newspaper, it has become an immediate best
seller.
   The respected Irish Times of Dublin calls it ``almost a morality
play. On the one side, the dark, violent and brutalized struggle
between a paramilitary police force and a ruthless guerrilla
organization. On the other, the honorable, relentless quest for
truth by the unarmed bobbies from Manchester.''
   Stalker's critics say he was naive to think he could march into
the middle of a terrorist war and apply his English standards.
Stalker responds: ``I'm a pragmatic, hard-nosed copper but I draw
the line at murder.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary has issued a statement reiterating
that no ``shoot-to-kill'' policy ever existed, and saying it had no
hand in Stalker's suspension.
   The statement denied Stalker's investigation was obstructed, and
said ``there are many other matters'' in his book and statements
``which the police do not accept as being accurate.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Stalker says he believes a high-level government decision was
taken to oust him, and he says he can understand why. He says he
recognizes that if his recommendations had been taken up, they
would have devastated the police force at a delicate juncture in
Northern Ireland politics.
   He believes that there was no ``formal, officially endorsed
shoot-to-kill policy,'' but that the constabulary, under constant
attack by guerrillas, was pervaded by ``a feeling of `let's do it
to them before they do it to us.'''
   He also agrees with the decision not to prosecute, saying too
much time has passed for a fair trial to be held.
   Stalker believes the problem lies in expecting policemen to be
soldiers.
   In Ireland, where Stalker has received a hero's welcome, he told
a TV interviewer: ``It was this hypocrisy that annoyed me. If
somebody had said to me, `Mr. Stalker, these are soldiers fighting
a war and this set of standards must apply,' then I could have
taken that into account.
   ``But they didn't. They said: `This investigation is to be done
in the same way as you would do in Birmingham or Liverpool,' and
that's what I did.''

   The government is going out of
its way to dampen expectations for rapid change, in contrast to
past years, when hints of political breakthroughs proved wrong.
   The pressures of unrest and sanctions are waning, white
officials say, and there is time to crack down on pockets of
opposition while trying to persuade blacks to accept less than
majority rule.
   In the week since the 1988 Parliament session opened, President
P.W. Botha and his Cabinet have sought to turn the spotlight away
from black grievances and focus it on a new economic program that
advocates a public-sector wage freeze and privatization of state
monopolies.
   During a string of speeches by Cabinet ministers, scant mention
was made of the persistent grass-roots struggle by blacks for
political rights.
   Instead, there were generalized endorsements of democracy
coupled with explanations that it could be extended to blacks only
in a slow, circumscribed manner that would leave whites with a
final say on national policy.
   ``Reform cannot take place at the same rate as one can brew
instant coffee,'' said Stoffel van der Merwe, a deputy minister
assigned by Botha to woo black leaders into negotiations. ``The
capacity for people to digest change is limited.''
   Compared with the hardline apartheid rhetoric of a decade ago,
the current talk of sharing power with blacks borders on the
revolutionary.
   But the government also has clarified its non-negotiable bottom
line _ continuation of segregated schools, hospitals and living
areas, and a political system in which whites could never be
dominated by blacks.
   The nation's blacks number 26 million and their population
growth rate is nearly triple that of the 5 million whites.
   ``The (political) model we will develop is not intended to seek
the approval of the outside world,'' said one government official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We can't have a political
dispensation based simply on majority rule.''
   Anti-apartheid activists already have dismissed as inadequate
one of the few pending pieces of reform legislation _ a proposal to
allow communities the option of integrating, subject to approval by
residents and the government.
   Most of the official talk about reform is now presented in terms
of the new economic program, which proponents say will free large
sums of capital for projects benefiting blacks.
   ``Reform Costs Money'' has become an unofficial government
slogan, with the implication that economic progress must precede a
major political shift.
   Botha, in full-page newspaper advertisements Sunday, called on
South Africans to ``tighten our belts'' to build the economic
foundation for social and political change.
   But Sampie Terreblanche, a leading economist who last year quit
Botha's National Party, suggested in a column in the nationally
circulated Sunday Times that the economy was being stressed ``to
detract attention from the tragic failure of the government's
political reform.''
   Extreme-right politicians have condemned the economic plan as a
disguised attempt to redistribute wealth from whites to blacks.
   The government's new approach contrasts with periods in the past
three years when at least some officials indicated dramatic
political moves were imminent.
   There were suggestions that Nelson Mandela, jailed leader of the
African National Congress, might be freed and that the government
might negotiate with the outlawed guerrilla movement.
   Particularly embarrassing was Botha's highly promoted 1985
speech in which he said South Africa was ``crossing the Rubicon''
away from apartheid, then disappointed people who expected
specific, momentous concessions.
   Now government officials believe the ANC's military strength is
waning and claim to have triumphed over the international sanctions
campaign.
   The white liberal opposition is in disarray and anti-government
unrest in black townships is down sharply after 20 months of
state-of-emergency detentions and security force patrols.
   There is breathing space, the government believes, to
concentrate on long-term plans and confront the challenge by the
extreme-right Conservative Party in three upcoming parliamentary
by-elections.
   Gerrit Viljoen, minister for black education and development,
told foreign journalists that the best way to counter the far-right
threat is to promote orderly, effective reform.
   But the government also is preparing an array of tough moves
against its political foes on the left _ moves which could boost
its standing on the right. The targets include:
   _ Militant black trade unions. Pending legislation would make it
harder for unions to stage legal strikes and easier for employers
to fire strikers.
   _ Universities. State subsidies are being sharply reduced this
year, and further cuts are threatened unless university officials
crack down on anti-government campus protests.
   _ The press. Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha defended
regulations that have subjected anti-government newspapers to
threat of closure, and he criticized mainstream English-language
papers for a ``venomous vendetta'' against his censorship rules.
   _ Anti-apartheid organizations. Officials indicate that
legislation is being drafted that would prohibit the receipt of
foreign funds by certain anti-government groups, a move that could
devastate those whose supporters within South Africa are mostly
poor.
   ``If one gets large amounts of money which is channeled from
overseas into the South African political process, then one gets
too many foreign shareholders,'' said van der Merwe. ``If people
want to be active on the South African political front, they must
do so with money they raise in South Africa.''

   Girls should be encouraged to exercise vigorously
enough to delay their puberty, because this may help protect them
from breast cancer and other diseases later in life, a researcher
says.
   Grade school girls who play strenuous sports often have their
first menstrual period, or menarche, later than usual. Even after
adolescence starts, they may miss periods if they work out
regularly.
   Although delayed or missing menstruation is often thought to be
abnormal, some experts now say that it is natural and even
desirable, because it may protect the body from the damaging
effects of sex hormones.
   American girls have been going through puberty at increasingly
early ages throughout this century.
   Dr. Rose E. Frisch of the Harvard School of Public Health said
Sunday that typically American girls now have their first period at
age 12{. But if they exercise in such vigorous sports as tennis,
running, basketball or soccer, their average age at menarche is
15{, the same as it was 100 years ago.
   And Frisch said a simple rule seems to apply: The more menstrual
cycles a woman has over her lifetime, the greater her chance of
breast cancer, the biggest cancer killer among U.S. women. So
anything that delays the start of menstruation should lower the
cancer risk.
   ``I suggest that regular exercise starting early in elementary
school would have a long-term spin-off in reduced risk of breast
cancer and, from our data, a reduced risk of diabetes and cancer of
the reproductive system,'' Frisch said.
   She and other experts who study the effects of exercise on
reproduction presented their work at a meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Recent federal statistics suggest that the risk of dying from
breast cancer may actually be increasing.
   Dr. Jack Fishman of Rockefeller University said breast cancer
may take 40 years to develop. ``What you do in puberty can be very
relevant to what happens in breast cancer after menopause,'' he
said.
   Frisch based her recommendation, in part, on a study she
conducted on 5,398 women who graduated from 10 U.S. colleges. She
found that those who had been athletic in college and high school
had only about half as much cancer of the breast and reproductive
system later in life as those didn't get regular exercise.
   Those who have delayed or irregular periods during their
teen-age years seem to suffer no long-term problems. Frisch's study
found that athletic women had just as many children as those who
were less active.
   Dr. Tenley E. Albright, a Boston surgeon who was an Olympic
skating champion, said coaches and parents often consider delayed
or missing periods to be a disorder, while young athletes often do
not.
   She said the condition should be thought of as an ``appropriate
adaptive response'' by the body, not a defect.
   The relationship between exercise and fertility is complex.
Experts believe that very lean and muscular women sometimes cannot
get pregnant because their bodies do not have enough fat to nourish
a growing fetus. They must slow down their exercise and put on some
weight to become fertile.
   Studies have also found that lean women make more of a
non-potent kind of estrogen than do fatter women. Estrogen is a key
sex hormone that is essential for fertility but also plays a role
in cancer of the breast and reproductive system.
   Experts suggest that even though lean women may be fertile, they
produce less active estrogen. And this may reduce the growth of
cells in their breast and reproductive tissues. When these cells
proliferate less, there is also less chance of a cell dividing
abnormally and starting a tumor.
   Some researchers also believe that among men, extreme exercise
can diminish the production of male sex hormones and might
interfere with sperm production. However, the effects of exercise
on male fertility appears to be much less dramatic in men than in
women.

   Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the Western
Hemisphere's longest-ruling head of state, won an eighth
consecutive term as president by a landslide Sunday. Opposition
leaders said the balloting was rigged.
   Interior Minister Sabino Montanaro, head of the ruling Colorado
Party, said the party's list of candidates led by the 75-year-old
president won 982,316, or 89 percent of the ballots counted.
   Stroessner has ruled the nation of 3.8 million people since
taking power in an army coup in 1954.
   The Radical Liberal Party, whose candidate was Sen. Luis Maria
Vega, received 78,141 votes, or 7 percent. The Liberal Party, led
by candidate Rep. Carlos Ferreira Ybarra, was third with 32,403
votes, or 3 percent.
   A total of 1,445,822 voters in this landlocked country were
registered to participate in Sunday's national elections to pick a
president, 36 Senators and 72 members of the House of Deputies.
   No one doubted that Stroessner would win. The overwhelming
majority of registered voters belong to his party and he won the
last elections in 1983 with 90.06 percent of the vote.
   Opposition leaders had urged voters to cast blank votes in
protest. Both Ybarra, 54, and Vega, 65, acknowledged beforehand
that they had no chance of winning.
   The Colorado Party said it was suspending its unofficial count
for the night. The official Central Electoral Board was expected to
release final vote tabulations Monday.
   Jorge Hicks, election overseer at a polling place in the
National University's law school in Asuncion, said voting was
peaceful.
   ``Everything went normally,'' Hicks said shortly before the
polls closed at 6 p.m., 11 hours after opening.
   Fifty official and unofficial observers from 12 countries
monitored the voting.
   A U.S. observer, Martin Andersen of the Washington-based
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, complained
to U.S. Ambassador Clyde Taylor that a car in which he and
opposition politicians were riding was stopped in Ypacarai, 15
miles east of Asuncion, by a group of men in plainclothes and
police uniforms.
   ``We were mistreated without provocation and treated in a
beastly fashion,'' said Andersen. He said the car's driver, Carlos
Romero Perreira, leader of a dissident faction of the governing
Colorado Party, was struck several times.
   Jo Marie Greisgaber, a U.S. consultant for the institute, said
she and a group of Uruguayan observers witnessed several election
violations in the Col. Oviedo area, including voting by underage
voters.
   ``We also were told the area cotton farmers had been advised
that cotton prices would not be increased if they did not vote or
that they would not be able to sell their crops,'' she said.
   In Col. Oviedo, farmer Froilan Miranda told The Associated Press
he was voting ``because we have a government that says you can't
work if you don't vote.''
   The small center-left Febrerista Revolutionary Party urged
voters to abstain or to cast blank ballots to protest what it said
would be a fraudulent election.
   The party winning the largest percentage of votes gets
two-thirds of the seats in Congress. The rest are divided according
to the percentage won by other parties.
   About 100 voters applauded when the president dropped his sealed
ballot in a wooden box at a polling station in Asuncion's
middle-class San Antonio neighborhood.
   He pointed to the box and said, ``This is democracy.''
   In Caaguazu, 110 miles east of Asuncion, about 100 people at a
Roman Catholic church chanted anti-government slogans and denounced
the detention of Domingo Laino, president of the Authentic Radical
Liberal Party.
   Laino, the country's leading opposition spokesman, was placed
under house arrest Thursday for 24 hours in Asuncion. Police
declined to comment.

<TEXT>
   A new CBS-TV series looking for laughs in two
languages will be the first prime-time network show produced with
both English and Spanish soundtracks, a production spokesman says.
   ``Trial and Error,'' the Columbia Television midseason
replacement sitcom about a Hispanic odd couple, is scheduled to
debut March 15 with a Spanish radio simulcast to the nation's six
top Hispanic markets.
   Columbia officials are contacting radio stations in target
cities and testing sound delivery, Columbia's Don DeMesquita said
Thursday. If it works, viewers in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Miami, Houston and San Antonio, Texas, will be able to listen in
English or Spanish.
   ``CBS will feed to its affiliates the episodes of `Trial and
Error.' They would feed the second language, Spanish, on an audio
channel,'' DeMesquita said. ``Then the local CBS affiliate would
feed the second audio channel to a participating radio station over
a telephone line.''
   ``Hispanic homes would be able to turn down the volume on their
TV and turn up the volume on the radio and watch the program in
Spanish,'' DeMesquita said.
   CBS has contracted for seven episodes of the program, which
stars Eddie Velez as a young lawyer and Paul Rodriguez as a T-shirt
vendor. While geared for a mainstream audience, the jokes and
dialogue were written with an awareness they would also air in
Spanish.
   The show revolves around Velez's position as the only Hispanic
lawyer in a prestigious Los Angeles law firm and Rodriguez's steady
wheeling and dealing to sell more shirts.
   The bilingual plans mark the first time an English-language
network program has been produced with a Spanish-speaking Hispanic
audience in mind, DeMesquita said.
   DeMesquita hopes CBS eventually sends the Spanish soundtrack to
all affiliates so stations elsewhere can arrange simulcasts. But
network officials want to see if the bilingual broadcasts work in
the test markets before making a broader commitment to Spanish.
   ``It's something the studio brought to us. It's an experiment,''
said CBS spokeswoman Ann Morfogen. ``One would have to see how it
works.''

   Mathematics, theoretical physics and oceanography
are among the fields in which American scientists are likely to
learn much from their Soviet colleagues during upcoming exchanges,
according to a delegation of Soviet scientists.
   The Soviet researchers were in Boston Sunday to describe current
Soviet research at the annual meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
   Seven administrators from the most prestigious Soviet science
institutes answered a wide range of questions from reporters in a
rare meeting with the press Saturday.
   The researchers seemed relaxed, and they answered questions
without hesitation, including difficult questions on Soviet
development of a Star Wars defense system.
   ``The Soviet Union does not intend to develop a system like the
United States is working on,'' said Andrey A. Kokoshin, deputy
director of the Institute for USA and Canada Studies.
   A few moments later, when another Soviet researcher demonstrated
a flashlight-sized laser pointer of the type used by speakers to
call attention to details on projected slides, Kokoshin elicited
laughter when he said, ``This is our SDI (Strategic Defense
Initiative).''
   Asked about development of chemical lasers, which might be used
in a missile defense system, Kokoshin said, ``They are not very
promising, I would say.''
   On Jan. 12, Frank Press of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
and Guriy Marchuk, president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
signed a five-year agreement providing for scientific exchanges and
cooperation.
   Under the terms of that agreement, joint scientific workshops
will be held during the next two years on such topics as vaccine
development, earthquake prediction, planetary science,
biotechnology and astrophysics.
   Konstantin V. Frolov, vice-president of the Academy of Sciences
of the U.S.S.R., said that mathematics, theoretical physics and
laser and semiconductor technology are some of the traditional
strongholds of Soviet science.
   ``The Soviet Union has developed a number of sophisticated
scientific instruments,'' he said, speaking through a translator.
   Computer software useful in oceanography has also been developed
in the Soviet Union, he said.
   In the upcoming scientific exchanges, he said, ``these are areas
where the Soviet side could bring something to the table.''
   He proposed that joint ventures be established to develop
computer manufacture. ``There was quite a gap in the introduction
of computers in the Soviet Union, particularly personal
computers,'' he said.
   Yuriy A. Ossipyan, director of the Institute for Solid State
Physics, said that Soviet scientists had developed a new
description of the interaction of materials in certain
high-temperature superconductors. He said that research on
superconductivity is being actively pursued at his institute and
elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
   In a presentation Sunday, Mikhail V. Ivanov, director of the
Institute for Microbiology, said that the Soviet union has built
industrial plants for the production of animal feed through yeast
fermentation.
   Bacteria are being used to leach metals from poor quality ores,
to decrease potentially dangerous levels of methane gas in coal
mines and to enhance oil recovery, Ivanov said.
   Albert Galeev of the Institute for Space Research described the
planned launch in July of a spacecraft to study the Martian moon
Phobos, which may be an asteroid that got trapped in orbit around
Mars.

   As a 52-year-old divorced farmer, Frank Cook
said he had little time left after caring for his cows, hogs, crops
and children to find a date.
   So he has become one of more than 600 farmers, agribusiness
workers or other people with rural backgrounds who look for friends
and lovers through Singles in Agriculture, a nearly 2-year-old
nonprofit group based in Wisconsin.
   ``Farm people are special people. They're busy and they don't
have time to go to things,'' Cook said in a telephone interview
Friday. ``It's hard to find someone when you're on the farm.''
   Cook, who runs a 1,000-acre dairy, hog, corn and soybean farm in
Baraboo, is vice president of Singles in Agriculture.
   The group, which has members in just about every state and
Canada, schedules outings such as a campout in Missouri or a boat
trip in the Wisconsin Dells and keeps a list of singles with rural
backgrounds.
   It does not emphasize making matches or pushing people to the
altar, but some of its members have married each other, said
Marcella Gahm, 49, the group's president.
   She met Marlyn Gahm, a 53-year-old beef cattle and grain farmer
from Pearl City, Ill., through the group, and they were married
last June.
   After the death of her first husband on the couple's
Staceyville, Iowa, farm in 1979, Mrs. Gahm said she was like many
farm widows who find themselves in a small, rural town without many
single people their age.
   Most of her friends were still married. They invited her to
dinner or dances but Mrs. Gahm said she felt like ``the odd one
out.''
   She helped start Singles in Agriculture when 23 farmers who had
written to one another through a farm magazine gathered in Peoria,
Ill., in June 1986.
   The group's members must be either be working in agriculture or
have farmed in the past or have grown up on a farm. It includes
farmers who lost their farms during tough financial times and now
have other jobs, as well as secretaries who grew up on farms, Mrs.
Gahm said.
   Besides the time constraints to dating, farmers need people who
understand rural life in order for a relationship to work, she said.
   ``I think the (agriculture) person needs someone who is more
willing to give than anyone can imagine,'' she said. ``You can have
a date all set and if something happens with the livestock or the
weather changes, you have to cancel it.''
   A forecast of rain may mean staying home to bale hay instead of
going to a movie, she said.
   The group's members range from the early 20s to 77, Mrs. Gahm
said. Most are from the Midwest _ Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa _ but there are members in
several other states, she said.
   Marilyn Roette, 50, of Chippewa Falls, said she believes it may
be more difficult for young people on the farm to meet other single
young people these days.
   ``Years back there were more country get-togethers. Now it's
rare,'' she said.
   ``The gals go in the big cities to work and they don't want to
come back to live and work on the farm,'' she said.
   ``Our main goal in setting this up,'' Mrs. Gahm said, ``is to
have people meet someone they have something in common with so that
when they're lonely they can pick up a phone and call or write a
letter.''

   A hand grenade exploded prematurely during
a U.S. Marine training exercise in France, killing one soldier and
injuring two others, a military spokesman said.
   Killed Saturday was Marine Lance Corp. Gustavo A. Rodriguez, 19,
of Buffalo Grove, Ill., said Capt. Mark Hughes, a spokesman for
Camp Lejeune. The two injured soldiers were First Lt. Kevin M.
Kirwin, 25, of Wilmington, Del., and Staff Sgt. Mark W. Ellars, 28,
of Painesville, Ohio, Hughes said.
   All three Marines were stationed at Camp Lejeune and were
training at Camp de la Courtine in France, he said.
   Kirwin was listed in good condition at a hospital in Ussel,
France, Hughes said, while Ellars was listed in stable condition at
a hospital in Clermont, France. He was expected to be transported
to a U.S. naval hospital in Naples, Italy, for further treatment,
Hughes said.
   The three men belonged to the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit,
formerly called the Amphibious Unit, Hughes said.
   The accident was under investigation, he said.

   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey, whose battle with
her waistline is waged on national television, admits she's
addicted to food.
   ``Eating is a drug for me,'' she said in an interview published
in the March issue of Ladies' Home Journal.
   ``It's what I do when I'm really happy, and it's what I do when
I'm tired. It's what I do when I'm not sure if I'm happy or tired.
It is a disease.''
   Her favorite food?
   ``Potatoes. Fried potatoes, baked potatoes, any kind of
potatoes,'' she said. ``I could go through my life and never eat a
sweet thing. It's mostly potatoes, pasta, breads, fried things, and
also that I just eat so much and add butter to everything.''
   She said she remembers thinner days.
   ``I still have my Calvin Klein size-10 jeans hanging in my
closet,'' she said. ``The last time I wore them was 1982, but I
still hold on to them, saying, `Well, one day. ...' But maybe
never. I don't think I'm ever going to have a size-10 behind
again.''

   Thousands of people flocked to a book-signing
appearance by Hollywood legend Bette Davis, who basked in the
attention by flashing her famous eyes and blowing kisses at
photographers.
   The autograph session Saturday at the B. Dalton Bookstore on
Hollywood Boulevard was for the paperback version of her
autobiography ``This 'n' That.'' The location was the former
Pickwick bookstore, a one-time hangout for Charlie Chaplin, Bing
Crosby and Charles Laughton.
   The 79-year-old actress, wearing an elegant black dress,
chain-smoked through a photo session and blew kisses at the
photographers.
   ``It is wonderful you all came,'' the two-time Oscar winner said
in a throaty voice. ``I thank all of you, very, very much.''
   The fans, many of whom brought flowers, stretched around the
block to see the star of ``Jezebel'' and ``Dangerous.''
   ``Miss Bette Davis is a Hollywood institution. She's a legend,''
said Michael Dreyer, 25, a data entry clerk from Sacramento who
waited for hours, then knelt as the actress signed his copy.
   ``I always wanted to meet her.'' said Steve Hutton, 30, a
Pasadena accounting clerk. ``I never thought it would happen.''

   Steel guitarist Leon McAuliffe hopes a
proposed state music hall of fame will immortalize all of
Oklahoma's big-time musicians, not just the ones who found fame and
fortune in Nashville.
   Since 1986, McAuliffe has donated $25,000 in equipment and
helped build a recording studio at Rogers State College's Hank
Thompson School of Country Music. Now he is behind a drive at the
school to establish a $10 million music learning and performing
arts building that would include the first Oklahoma Music Hall of
Fame.
   ``It's a dream maybe, but you don't get anywhere unless you
follow your dreams,'' said McAuliffe, who played guitar for the Bob
Wills western swing band from Tulsa.
   ``It will honor all superstar Oklahoma musicians, not just
country and western,'' he said.

   Theodor Geisel, Dr. Seuss to millions of
children of all ages for more than 50 years, spent his first
Carnival weekend here in a style befitting the monarch of a fantasy
world.
   He arrived from his home in San Diego on Friday and was to leave
Monday, which recently has been revived in New Orleans as Lundi
Gras _ Fat Monday or the day before Mardi Gras, Fat Tuesday.
   The spry 84-year-old author and his wife, Audrey, attended
Carnival balls, watched parades and at least once danced with a
costumed figure representing his famous ``Cat in the Hat.''
   Whisked from the airport in a silver limousine to the New
Orleans Museum of Art, he was treated to a coffee-and-chicory news
conference with reporters who had been raised on his works.
   One television reporter admitted idolizing him.
   ``Don't stop now,'' Geisel quipped.

   Many West Europeans feel the United States did
little to protect their interests at the summit last December, but
most believe America would keep its pledge to defend them,
according to a survey sponsored by the U.S. government.
   The survey, conducted for the U.S. Information Agency, also
found that most West Europeans support the treaty signed at the
Washington summit to remove American and Soviet medium-range
nuclear missiles from Europe.
   However, the agency did not repeat a question from a similar
poll reported last June, which yielded results embarrassing to the
Reagan administration. That poll showed that a huge majority of
West Europeans gave credit for the treaty to Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev rather than to President Reagan.
   The Senate has been conducting hearings leading up to a vote on
whether to ratify the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The new poll found overwhelming European support for the treaty,
ranging from 97 percent in West Germany to 78 percent in France,
with most registering ``strong support'' _ 65 percent in Britain,
79 percent in Italy, 76 percent in the Netherlands and 77 percent
in West Germany.
   Most of those polled believe that, if the treaty is ratified and
the missiles removed, the United States will remain ``committed to
the defense of Western Europe''and ``will do whatever is
necessary'' to defend their countries. Fifty-nine percent felt that
way in Britain, 61 percent in France, 67 percent in Italy, 57
percent in the Netherlands and 56 percent in West Germany. Belgians
were divided, 46 percent agreeing and 44 percent disagreeing.
   But many also said they believe the Reagan administration did
little to protect West European interests at the summit.
   Asked how well they thought their country's interests were
protected at the summer, 17 percent of the Belgians said they
thought they were protected ``a great deal'' or ``a fair amount,''
the response given by 16 percent in France, 28 percent in Germany,
40 percent in Italy, 34 percent in the Netherlands and 31 percent
in Britain.
   Those answering ``not very much'' or ``not at all'' were 68
percent in Belgium, 61 percent in France, 65 percent in Germany, 40
percent in Italy, 55 percent in the Netherlands and 56 percent in
Britain.
   A sizable minority of West Europeans polled believe the treaty
makes them more vulnerable to Soviet attack: 29 percent in Belgium,
26 percent in Britain, 33 percent in France, 24 percent in Italy,
34 percent in the Netherlands, and 16 percent in West Germany.
   Majorities or pluralities in all six countries said the Soviets
signed the treaty, in part, because NATO decided in 1979 to deploy
U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Europe to counter Soviet
SS-20's. Responding that way were 45 percent in Belgium, 51 percent
in Great Britain, 46 percent in France, 72 percent in Italy, 63
percent in the Netherlands and 50 percent in Germany.
   Similar percentages believe that NATO should halt the withdrawal
of the U.S. missiles if the Soviets are found to be cheating: 67
percent in Britain, 65 percent in France, 50 percent in Italy, 55
percent in the Netherlands and 59 percent in Germany. Belgians were
again divided, with 41 percent favoring a halt and 45 percent
continued withdrawal.
   Majorities ranging from 78 percent in France to 94 percent in
Italy described U.S.-Soviet relations as good or very good.
   The survey was based on telephone interviews with about 500
citizens in each of the countries Dec. 14-16, immediately after the
summit at which the INF pact was signed.
   The Associated Press obtained an agency report on the latest
survey last week. The agency analysis of the report did not provide
a breakdown of those answering all the questions, but instead drew
conclusions from the data and published some results.
   The U.S. Information Agency has polled West European public
opinion since shortly after World War II, and the results are
circulated to American officials in Washington and overseas to
guide them in relations with foreign nations.
   The agency tries to promote the image of the United States
abroad and advance U.S. views through programs such as the Voice of
America radio system and the Worldnet television satellite system.
   The margin of error for results of the December poll was plus or
minus 5 percentage points, Agency polls are conducted by
independent companies within each country.

<TEXT>
   George Bush and Jack Kemp, sitting pretty just
10 days ago as New Hampshire voters finally turned their attention
to presidential politics, are suddenly facing feast or famine in
the state's snow-packed primary. And they aren't alone.
   For Pete du Pont, Bruce Babbitt, Gary Hart and maybe even Paul
Simon, Tuesday's elections shape up as a do-or-die test of their
ability to stay alive in the 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``New Hampshire has within its grasp the power of life or death
over my candidacy,'' said Babbitt, who fashions himself the last
honest man among the dirty dozen who have outlasted Alexander Haig
on the campaign trail.
   The tension is highest among the Republicans, where the Reagan
revolution may ride on the coattails of Bush and Kemp in their race
against Bob Dole, Pat Robertson and Pete du Pont.
   For just as surely as 12-year-old Robyn Perry carried the torch
to begin the XV Winter Olympics, Bush and Kemp carry the torch for
the silent, retiring fellow who'll be sitting by the fire in Santa
Barbara.
   Vice President Bush, who held a huge lead in the New Hampshire
polls until he lost Iowa in such embarrassing fashion, wrapped
himself in the presidency throughout Sunday night's debate. At one
point he went so far as to defend the State Department _ the State
Department! _ to punctuate the extent to which he hopes voters will
put their trust in Reaganism.
   Bush must win _ that is, come in first _ Tuesday or hope Reagan
will drop his neutrality and ride to his rescue. It isn't as if
Bush hasn't got a chance. The weekend polls show him in a
first-place duel with Dole and he benefits from new, lower
expectations which have him fading away to his seaside home in
Kennebunkport, Me.
   Kemp, vowing to ``complete the Reagan revolution,'' worked over
the weekend to impress New Hampshire voters with his pledge not to
raise taxes, no matter what. At one point during the day he said,
``I am convinced that Sen. Dole has a secret plan to raise taxes on
the American people.''
   Kemp can kick around Bob Dole all he likes but the Dole-Bush
struggle is irrelevant, for now, to his bid for survival. He
enjoyed strong poll figures on Iowa eve, but his standing as
conservative challenger to the front-runners is now being blocked
by the emergence of Pat Robertson.
   Kemp said Sunday he'll beat Robertson because ``the people of
New Hampshire want a conservative who can reach out beyond just one
segment of the population and win.'' Forgotten for the moment is du
Pont, who hopes to sneak up on everyone Tuesday and live to fight
another day. So far he has amassed respect but not much support.
   If Bush beats Dole, or Kemp beats Robertson, the topsy turvy GOP
campaign will be topsy again. It's a little known secret, but the
other party, the Democrats, are also holding a presidential primary
Tuesday in New Hampshire.
   Michael Dukakis has to win big and he probably will, getting an
honorable boost as it occurs to people that he handled the
spotlight nicely and knows the issues better than his
Washington-based opponents like to let on.
   The Massachusetts governor already has set up shop in the South
and in Minnesota (caucuses a week from tomorrow) _ keenly aware
that the Massachusetts and Rhode Island primaries give him a
spearhead on Super Tuesday (20 states, March 8) that none of his
opponents can easily match.
   Richard Gephardt is slugging it out for second place with Simon.
It's remarkable that Simon is still in the hunt after half-a-dozen
or so lackluster debates, but he touches a tender nerve among party
liberals and Gephardt has had trouble answering some of Simon's
negative ads which imply he isn't trustworthy. If the Missouri
congressman becomes ensnarled in the inconsistencies of his voting
record, Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson will surely
keep chipping away as the voting shifts South.
   ``I hope to do much better than people expect on Tuesday,'' Gore
said during a strong anti-Gephardt performance over the weekend.
   Babbitt and Hart trailed the pack in Iowa last week and are
expected to spend their last dollar in futility. Babbitt has waged
a human-scale campaign of humor and candor. But as du Pont can tell
him, you can't spend respect _ the former Arizona governor is
running out of money.
   Hart is threatening to go the distance, no matter how pathetic
his results may be. But he already has an uncontrollable campaign
debt from 1984 and it's hard to see who'll extend him credit for
the 48 states to come.

<HEAD>Researchers Identify Gene Essential To Biological Clocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have identified a gene in fruit flies
that is essential to the working of the biological clock that
governs a wide range of bodily processes in humans and animals.
   The gene is associated with the generation or maintenance of the
daily, or circadian, rhythms that presumably evolved to help
animals and humans cope with night and day, said Michael Rosbash, a
biologist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. He spoke Sunday
at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   In addition to controlling the length, or period, of the daily
cycle, the gene _ called the period gene _ also governs minute-long
fluctuations in the courtship song of the fruit fly, Rosbash said.
   The gene is involved not only in the length of the rhythms but
also seems to carry instructions regarding such things as the
extent of activity during active periods of the cycle, Rosbash said.
   Circadian rhythms are a pervasive feature of human and animal
life. They govern fundamental measures such as body temperature and
hormonal secretions, and many other more subtle physical and mental
factors.
   Researchers do not yet know how the period gene works. That
question is being studied intensively by Rosbash and Jeffrey Hall
and their colleagues at Brandeis, and by Michael Young and
associates at Rockefeller University in New York City.
   Rosbash said the period gene presumably triggers the production
of a protein. That protein might be part of the clock mechanism,
something that researchers know nothing about.
   Or it could be the read-out of the clock, something like the
hands on a wristwatch, which give you the information that was
generated in the clock mechanism, Rosbash said.
   A third possibility is that the period gene protein somehow
controls the genes or proteins that form the clock mechanism,
turning them on or off, for example.
   The two research teams are now working intensively to isolate
the protein produced by the period gene and determine its function,
Rosbash said.
   Among the curious features of the gene that they have identified
is a string of 25 pairs of coding units in the gene's genetic
message, which encodes proteins.
   This feature is highly unusual, but it occurs in only one of
three species of fruit flies tested. And when it is removed, the
gene appears to function well without it. ``The perfect repeat of
25 pairs appears not to be necessary,'' Rosbash said.
   When the entire gene is removed from a fruit fly, the fly loses
its circadian rhythms, but it is otherwise perfectly normal, he
said.
   Certain mutants of the period gene give flies a circadian rhythm
shorter than 24 hours, Rosbash said. Those genes also reduce the
60-second cycling in the males fruit fly's courtship song, Rosbash
said.
   He has also found that the gene appears to be turned on in fruit
fly embryos and adults, but not in the larval or pupal stages in
the fly's life cycle that occur in between.

   Republican presidential candidates, their
prospects riding on the decision of New Hampshire primary voters,
head into a final day of campaigning after a debate in which the
also-rans pounced on the front-runner in an 11th-hour effort to
change the odds.
   ``Sign it,'' Pete du Pont said to Kansas Sen. Bob Dole as the
former Delaware governor thrust a no-tax pledge in his face at one
point in the Sunday night debate.
   ``I'd have to read it first,'' snapped Dole, reviving an old
dispute over the INF treaty with Vice President George Bush.
``Maybe George would sign it.''
   Bush was the target of jabs from Kemp and du Pont on arms
control and prospects for Soviet withdrawal of its troops from
Afghanistan.
   Taking advantage of their last opportunity to impress voters
before the polls open on Tuesday, the GOP contenders were spending
the day at coffee shops, shopping malls and service club meetings.
   The latest polls indicated a Bush-Dole fight for first place in
the Republican primary and du Pont, Rep. Jack Kemp and former
evangelist Pat Robertson fighting for third place.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Sunday night said Dole
had the support of 31 percent of likely Republican voters, while
Bush was backed by 28 percent. Kemp was the choice of 13 percent
and du Pont and Robertson of 11 percent each.
   A CBS News survey had it Dole, 31; Bush, 30; Kemp, 11; Robertson
and du Pont, 10 each.
   When Bush said he expected the Soviets to go forward with a
promised troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Kemp said heatedly,
``We have a State Department that has run amok on this issue.''
   ``Wait and see,'' said Bush. ``Don't fight progress when you see
it. Don't be afraid.''
   Bush tried to close out the argument, saying, ``I don't jump
away from the president when the going gets tough'' and then added,
``Give peace a chance'' which brought another outburst from Kemp.
   ``You should be embarrassed to use give peace a chance,'' he
said. ``We're the party of peace.''
   After the debate, Kemp appeared in the press room to say
Republicans should be saying ``give freedom a chance.''
   Kemp said the debate showed ``we're looking at the Old Guard of
the Republican Party versus the future of a party devoted to hope,
opportunity and freedom.''
   Du Pont also appeared in the press room to press his contention
that Dole would opt for a tax increase to deal with the budget
deficit.
   ``We gave Bob Dole a chance to take the tax pledge,'' he said.
   The vice president made it clear he wasn't giving up no matter
what happens on Tuesday. ``Here I stand warts and all,'' he said
recalling the words of Abraham Lincoln. He said he's not the best
of orators, but added, ``Don't take that for a lack of passion.''
   ``My work isn't done yet,'' he said.
   Robertson appeared to startle his fellow debaters when he said
the Soviets have placed missiles in Cuba. He said his source was
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``Somehow in all this brilliant negotiation which these
gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty.''
Robertson said. ``And it seems like to me nukes pointing at the
United States are more vital to our security than nukes pointing to
Europe.''
   After the debate, Marc Nuttle, Robertson's campaign manager,
said the candidate was referring to missile delivery systems, not
warheads. He said the information did not come directly from the
Foreign Relations committee ``but that's where some of the
information was compiled.''
   He refused to name the source of the information.
   On AIDS, Dole questioned the value of routine testing for the
disease.
   ``Let's say you test false positive and the word gets out you
have the AIDS virus and you don't have it,'' he said. ``We've got
people who are suffering. This is one issue we shouldn't
politicize.''
   Kemp immediately jumped in to say, ``We need routine testing.''

<TEXT>
   State and federal officials are fighting
efforts by Texas and California to keep out Florida citrus fruit
after the lifting of a federal ban imposed to keep a plant disease
from spreading to other states.
   The issue is canker, a bacterial disease with the potential to
seriously cripple an entire industry.
   Florida has been battling a mild form of nursery canker for
three years. Industry leaders and scientists recently succeeded in
convincing the U.S. Department of Agriculture it was not a threat
to fruit or trees in commercial groves. Officials had initially
feared the disease was the virulent Asiatic canker.
   After months of state and federal research and deliberation, the
USDA last week lifted its 3-year-old ban prohibiting shipments of
Florida fresh fruit to other citrus-growing states.
   Relaxation of the ban means the reopening of markets valued at
$25 million a year, said Richard Kinney, general manager of Florida
Citrus Packers Inc., a trade association in Lakeland.
   California, Texas and Arizona are the biggest producers outside
of Florida. But Louisiana, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands also are affected.
   Texas growers immediately imposed their own embargo to keep
Florida fruit out for at least 30 days while they seek to overturn
the federal order. The Texas Agriculture Department plans to turn
back any Florida fruit at state borders.
   ``Exporting Florida's misery to Texas is not going to be the
answer,'' said Jim Hightower, the Texas agriculture commissioner.
   California's reaction was more restrained. But there was talk of
legal action, and an official for California Citrus Mutual said the
USDA had not followed proper procedures for public hearings and
notification to the concerned states.
   ``Everyone must go through the legal hoops, and we're not sure
they jumped through all the hoops,'' said Cliff Holland, director
of the California trade association's grower services.
   The USDA pointed out that it had held hearings in the Los
Angeles area, in McAllen, Tex., and in Florida last October on its
proposal to lift the ban.
   Nancy Robinson, spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said she didn't believe the Texas
embargo would be legally enforceable since it would preempt a
federal order.
   Growers gearing up for a resumption of shipments are struggling
with a variety of federal rules designed to ensure that no
contaminated fruit leaves the state.
   Willard Roe, who has fruit packing houses in Winter Haven and
Haines City, expects to be one of the first to begin shipping
truckloads of Florida tangerines to California.
   But he and other shippers and growers have to undergo rigorous
inspections by federal agents. Inspectors walk the groves with
owners and obtain compliance agreements before fruit is certified
for shipment.
   Fruit can only be taken from inspected groves, and must be
treated with a bactericide and waxed to remove any surface
contamination. Growers have to attest that all harvesters and
shipping vehicles are free of canker.
   The rigid requirements mean it will be a week to 10 days before
shipments begin, said Bobby McKown, executive vice president of
Florida Citrus Mutual, which represents more than 12,000 growers.
   The joint state-federal canker eradication project burned some
20 million trees, mostly seedlings and nursery stock. Recent state
court rulings raised the prospect that the state may have to pay as
much as $200 million to nursery owners who received only $17.4
million as partial compensation for their trees.
   Scientists now say the nursery strain of canker primarily
produces mild spotting of fruit and leaves, adding that neither
affects the quality of the fruit or juice and canker does not harm
people.
   The Asiatic strain, which can weaken trees and cause fruit and
leaf damage, was discovered in 1986 in a small Gulf Coast area of
mature groves, which was immediately quarantined. A USDA order
prohibits shipment of fresh fruit from that region.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., spends his days
in solitude with his computer and his headset, working in a
``hideaway'' office where he feels like he's back in a DC-9 cockpit.
   Seventy-nine members of the Senate are assigned to the existing
79 Senate hideaways, little second offices where they are supposed
to be able to reflect, away from the relentless demands of their
time.
   But, unlike most senators, Humphrey has turned his public,
spacious office in the modern Hart office building over to his
staffers and turned his one-man Capitol hideaway into a full-time,
high-tech command center.
   There, he sits alone, communicating with his staff all day by
electronic message, convinced he is ``pushing ahead of Senate
inertia.''
   The circular room looks and feels like a cockpit, as Humphrey, a
former Allegheny Airlines pilot, punches up computer displays,
talks through his headset, and fiddles with the dials on his radio.
   Back at the Hart building, every staffer sits at a computer
terminal. There are no secretaries, no typewriters, and no paper
except for computer printouts. Soft computer beeps announce an
incoming message.
   The staff calls the office the ``3C'' center, military jargon
for command, control and communications.
   ``I love this stuff,'' Humphrey says, as he sits at the computer
controls. ``I find the detachment very useful. There isn't enough
time to think and read around this place.''
   Humphrey says there are parallels between his office and a
cockpit. ``I've got everything at my fingertips,'' he says. ``You
reach for dials in front of you, and reach things above your head.''
   When the television set and radio are off, ``there's only the
sound of rushing air from the air conditioner. That's similar to
the sound of a jet cockpit.''
   Humphrey boasts that his office is a wonderful time-saver,
calculating it takes nearly 15 minutes for a round-trip between the
Hart building and the Capitol for a vote. Now, he's only a minute
or two from the Senate chamber.
   The hideaway, Humphrey insists, is not a place where he hides
from his staff and constituents.
   Staffers ``see me when they need to see me,'' he says. Any
constituent desiring to see him is escorted to the hideaway.
   Darryl Fountain, the senator's former legal counsel who is now
in private practice, says the system fits Humphrey's personality as
``a very disciplined person.''
   ``Here's somebody who was an airline pilot who was elected to
his first office as a senator,'' Fountain says. ``He's not a
back-slapper. He's not a B.S. artist. Most of the other senators
had long years in public life. He does not have the typical
political personality that finds him operating surrounded by staff.
   ``He's a loner in the sense that he's somebody who has not been
compromised by Washington lifestyle, where you go to big
receptions, parties and black-tie dinners. He doesn't care about
his standing vis-a-vis the Senate club.''
   It's time for Humphrey to check his phone messages. ``Strongly
oppose Contras,'' one message says. ``Will names be turned over to
FBI?``
   Humphrey's staffers also have learned to make maximum use of the
computer, punching in ``fashion notes'' about each other's clothes,
``wheels up'' invitations for after-work drinks, and contributing
to an electronic suggestion box.
   ``Will the person who brings in sandwiches neatly wrapped in wax
paper please eat them,'' says one message. ``Today we had to
dispose of seven petrified sandwiches in seven individual greasy
brown lunch bags.''
   Although current Humphrey employees just chuckle when asked
about it, former staffer Fountain says when one staffer wanted to
razz another, he or she would send ``the electronic finger.''
   That was a computer drawing of a hand, with an obscene gesture.
It started out as a small hand. ``Some of us tried to outdo that
with bigger ones,'' Fountain recalls. ``No one ever sent it to the
senator.''
   ``We pride ourselves in taking technology to the limit,'' says
administrative assistant Frank Bray, who wouldn't talk about the
finger.
   Humphrey isn't all business, either. When he cleaned out items
from his home, he gave them away through the computer: a sofa,
calculators, tape recorders, and even old cars.
   ``It seems more unusual from the outside,'' says Paul Young, a
former special assistant now working for Rep. Jack Kemp's
presidential campaign. ``People have the perception he's sitting in
a black hole with no interaction with his people.''
   Humphrey looks at one of the monitors. It reminds him to take
his allergy shots and his vitamins.
   ``Do you want to talk to the staff about the system?'' Humphrey
asks at the end of the interview.
   A reporter agreed, and Humphrey tried to telephone his press
secretary. No answer.
   ``This is the problem when you rely on the phones,'' says
Humphrey, who quickly sent a computer message that brought a fast
response.

classes in futures and options trading this year in a government
experiment to see if profits on the commodities markets can reduce
farm subsidies.
   Congress ordered the test project for 40 counties as part of the
1985 farm bill in an effort to find an alternative to expensive
price supports.
   ``Many people are frustrated with the high cost of the current
program, farmers included,'' said Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a member
of the House Agriculture Committee.
   ``We need to have some sort of mechanism to help farmers,'' he
said. ``But I think it has to fundamentally change. If it does, it
will be good for the taxpayers, better for family-sized farmers and
a better system, generally, for our whole country.''
   A provision of the farm bill requires the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service to try to teach farmers how
to use the markets to hedge against risk and boost their income.
The agency is to report back to Congress on the results by December
1988.
   The goal is to reduce the amount farmers receive in federal
support by whatever they make through commodities trading, in
effect transferring part of their subsidy from the government to
the private sector, ASCS spokesman Ray Waggoner said recently.
   ``It could be the forerunner of a fancy new program, or it could
flop,'' Waggoner said. ``We don't know, and won't until it's
tested.''
   Farmers will be invited to take classes explaining how to buy
and sell their commodities _ wheat, feed grains, soybeans and
cotton _ and will receive counseling as they make pre-harvest
contracts to ensure a set price for the crops.
   ``If market prices go up, you benefit because you lost on the
futures but gained on your crop,'' he said. ``If market prices go
down, you make money on your contract.''
   Farmers have dabbled in commodities trading for years, but the
business is complex and the practice is far from widespread among
producers, said Larry Walker, director of analysis for the ASCS in
Washington.
   ``All farmers would be better off if they knew how to trade on
the futures and options markets,'' Walker said recently. ``Over
time, they can make more money if they understand it.
   ``But all of this I preface by saying you better know what
you're doing and don't try to get fancy unless you want to lose
your shirt.''
   To ease concerns about losses and encourage participation, he
said farmers enrolled in the pilot program will be guaranteed a net
return equal to the local loan rate for their crops.
   Details remain sketchy, but he said Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng is expected to announce final guidelines for the
program by March 15.
   An advisory committee selected 40 counties in 22 states for
participation, basing its recommendations in large part on requests
from farmers.
   ``It wasn't hard to pick 40,'' Walker said. ``It was hard to
decide which of the 3,000 counties were not included.''
   One of the requests came from Gary Whittaker, who raises corn,
soybeans and hogs on the farm his family has owned for 100 years
near Toulon in north-central Illinois.
   ``I've hedged some on the futures market, but the options I have
trouble with. That's why I'd like to do this and learn more,''
Whitaker said.
   ``If you're very acquainted with farming, you know it's just
like going to Las Vegas: I throw my money out every spring and hope
something comes up,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we can cut down our
risk a little bit by doing this.''
   Illinois, Iowa and Texas each ended up with four counties in the
project, while California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska and Ohio have two each.
   Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin each have one.

   Residents here speak with awe about the
changes facing this town, with its empty houses and idle plants,
when the Navy breaks ground this week for a $140 million home port
for the battleship Wisconsin.
   Naval Station Ingleside, won in a bidding competition among Gulf
Coast communities from Texas to Florida, is welcomed locally as a
boost for a region that has endured hard times in the oil and
shrimping industries.
   Still, in a town with 5,000 people and one traffic light, there
is a touch of fear in the voices of residents who know their lives
may be changed forever by the thousands of people and millions in
revenues the port is expected to attract by its scheduled
completion in 1991. Besides the Wisconsin, the port will be home to
the training carrier Lexington and three other ships.
   ``I don't know if you can prepare yourself for that kind of
change,'' said Del Lewis, manager of this town just north of Corpus
Christi. ``I don't know if you can visualize the change and looking
out and seeing the ships on the horizon.''
   Direct economic effects from the port will include a $155
million payroll for military personnel, $47 million in ship repair
and $100 million in local procurement by the Navy for the 482-acre
project, according to Navy estimates.
   In addition, local economies will enjoy an infusion of $300
million from a boom in real estate, services and other indirect
effects of the station, said Jimmy Lyles, president of the Corpus
Christi Chamber of Commerce.
   ``You'll have a good tax base, new housing, new shopping
centers,'' said Ms. Lewis. ``In the meantime, it's going to be you
pedal very fast and you don't fall over.''
   Local officials are concerned that the speed and breadth of the
project will overwhelm city services like water and sewage
treatment in a town with an annual budget of $2.5 million and 42
people on its payroll.
   Although real estate growth eventually will drive up the
property tax base and fill up vacancies resulting primarily from a
decline in oil-rig manufacturing, the town has to accommodate a
rapidly growing population before that money starts flowing in.
   ``I've been worried for quite a while,'' said Mayor Roy Culver.
``That doesn't mean we're going to throw up our hands and quit. I'm
concerned about expanding our police department. I'm concerned
about infrastructure extensions. I'm concerned about whether our
city hall is big enough.''
   The Navy, which chose the Ingleside site in part because of the
deep channel in its port area, estimates that the base will employ
4,665 military personnel and 574 civilians. An additional 3,200
off-base civilian jobs also are projected.
   At least 500 construction jobs at the naval station will be
created this year, reaching a peak of 1,000 in 1990, Lyles said.
   Overall, as many as 18,000 new people are projected to live in
the area after the base is fully operational in 1991, including
those involved in non-military businesses that will serve the new
military and civilian workforce and its dependents.
   Already two commercial developments totaling more than $150
million in value have begun in Ingleside.
   ``What it will do is take us off of being oil and gas
dependent,'' the mayor said. ``It's going to be a big boon to
Ingleside if it's handled properly.''
   One fear, however, is that the area will find itself filled with
more unemployed construction workers than there are jobs available.
Others worry that the area's tranquility will be destroyed, Culver
said.
   ``There are a lot of people in Ingleside who moved over here
because it's quiet, it's a bedroom community,'' he said. ``They're
worried about strip joints, you know. There's a lot of things that
come into people's minds when they think of a Navy town.''

   A new study from the World Bank says explosive
population growth in sub-Saharan Africa is putting tremendous
strains on primary schools that spend only $48 a year per pupil.
   The 39 countries in Africa face the need to expand schools that
can teach 51 million children to take care of nearly 91 million by
the year 2000.
   The resources available have been stretched thinner as the
population soared. Per pupil spending, after discounting for
inflation, fell from $67 a year in 1970 to $48 in 1983, the report
said. In many countries people's average incomes also are declining.
   In four countries _ Somalia, Togo, Mozambique and Angola _ the
number of youngsters registering for school actually went down even
as population figures raced ahead.
   Overall, one child in four in sub-Saharan Africa is not enrolled
in school at all, and the ranks are growing.
   In the United States, spending on elementary and secondary
schools averages more than $4,000 per pupil each year. The schools
spend almost as much on each student in two class days as these
African countries spend in an entire year.
   The bank is the biggest single source of aid to help Third World
countries raise their living standards. Its report says donors
should get together and help more.
   A child reaching school age in Somalia, at the northeastern tip
of the continent, had about one chance in six of finding a teacher
in 1983.
   The number of high school students there has risen, but in 1983
there were still only about 63,000 in a population of 5 or 6
million.
   The report says, ``Africa's explosive population growth greatly
increases the number of children seeking access to schools and
increases the number of potential illiterates.
   ``The stock of human capital in Africa will determine whether
Africans can harness the universal explosion of scientific and
technical knowledge for the region's benefit _ or whether Africa
will fall farther and farther behind the world's industrial
nations.''
   Peter R. Moock, who led the team that compiled the study, said
in an interview that Somalia is an extreme case. According to the
report, fewer than 12 percent of adult Somalis could read in 1983.
Primary school teachers were paid $985 a year. The government was
spending about 6 percent of its budget on education _ less than $21
million _ and that share had been dropping for years.
   By comparison, it spent $114 million for its military, a figure
that rose to $134 million in 1985.
   Across Africa, the number of students of all ages quintupled
between 1960 and 1983. The report said that in 19 of the 39
countries, the primary-school age population, six to 11, was
growing faster than the number of children entering school.
   In 13 countries _ including Nigeria, the most populous on the
continent _ a smaller proportion was enrolled in primary schools in
1983 than in 1980.
   ``In many respects, 1983 was the worst year of the economic
crisis, and it is possible that a number of educational indicators
have subsequently begun to improve,'' the report notes.
   It says improving education would pay off, even from a purely
material point of view.
   ``Farmers who have completed four years of education produce, on
average, about 8 percent more farm output than farmers who have not
gone to school,'' the report says.
   It quotes other studies as showing that babies are more likely
to survive if their mother has at least a few years of education.
Educated people are more likely to be mobile, moving from less
productive jobs to better ones and sending money back home when
they migrate. They are also likely to be healthier, and to live
longer.
   The report's recommendations include:
   _ More spending on education by African countries themselves,
with emphasis on books and materials, new methods such as radio
broadcasts and correspondence schools.
   _ Improvement of school principals, with more autonomy and
better achievement testing.
   _ More foreign aid, and better coordination, with a larger
proportion for primary schools, less for higher education and
overseas fellowships.

   A man who held police at a standoff for
hours by threatening to blow himself up in a lounge was charged
with possession of a hoax bomb and making terroristic threats,
authorities said.
   John James Allgood, 33, of Arlington, was jailed Sunday under
$3,000 bond, Tarrant County officials said.
   Police said the man surrendered four hours after he walked into
the Plaza Lounge before a Valentine's Day party Saturday night and
threatening to blow himself up. A fake explosive device was found
later, authorities said.
   Bartender Ina Silloway said the man ordered a 12-pack of beer to
go and then gave her a Valentine's card with a note saying he had
six sticks of dynamite strapped to him. The man indicated he wanted
police to kill him, she said.
   Lounge owner Iris Massey said Allgood was a regular customer who
had been upset over marital problems.

   The FBI's investigation of a group opposed to
Reagan administration policies in Central America focused in part
on fliers distributed at rallies and public speeches, even though
the activities are protected by the First Amendment.
   Newly released FBI documents show that agents reported back to
bureau headquarters on political literature and meetings by the
Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador.
   The 2,000 pages of bureau documents provide only a fragmentary
look at the FBI probe since many of the pages are substantially
blacked out or withheld entirely.
   But even FBI headquarters was disturbed at one point by the
direction the investigation was taking, warning offices to stay
away from reporting legitimate political statements and lobbying.
   The FBI investigation of CISPES never resulted in any charges
against the group or its members.
   One bureau document shows the FBI cited political literature to
cast suspicion on CISPES in connection with the still-unsolved
November 1983 bombing of the U.S. Capitol. The document notes that
it is ``interesting'' that a flier claiming responsibility for the
Capitol bombing ``was passed out along with the CISPES literature''
at a Nov. 12, 1983, rally.
   Another document indicates the FBI tried to find a connection
between CISPES and a May 1983 bombing at the Army National War
College in Washington. The document says that ``an unidentified
individual contacted a local radio station in Washington, D.C., a
few days after the bombing and advised that `we are in solidarity
with the people of El Salvador and Guatemala.' At the time of the
bombing, representatives of the Committee in Solidarity with the
People of El Salvador (CISPES) were meeting in Washington, D.C.''
   CISPES contends that the investigation amounted to political
harassment.
   In a telephone interview, Beth Perry, CISPES spokeswoman, called
suggestions that the group might have had a connection to the
bombings ``absolutely ridiculous.''
   She said some literature on the Capitol bombing was passed out
at a CISPES-sponsored demonstration, five days after the bombing,
but that the group had nothing to do with distributing that
material.
   Other FBI documents show the bureau monitored a radio show on
which a CISPES member appeared and tracked down people named in
newspaper articles.
   The files also show that the FBI switched from conducting an
investigation of alleged criminal investigations of domestic
security laws to an international terrorism investigation in 1983.
At the time of the switchover, then-FBI Director William Webster
was assuring the public and Congress that the FBI would require
more than political rhetoric before it began investigating domestic
political groups.
   Webster, now head of the CIA, has refused to comment on the
investigation, referring all questions back to the FBI.
   The international terrorism probe gave the FBI far more sweeping
authority to investigate U.S. citizens. But a proviso in the
attorney general's guidelines for such probes still states that
``no United States person may be considered a foreign power or an
agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of activities
protected by the First Amendment.''
   FBI headquarters in Washington apparently was concerned that the
field offices did not understand that they could be infringing on
First Amendment rights.
   In a memorandum to all field offices, dated July 26, 1984, the
FBI director writes, ``It is imperative that these investigations
are closely supervised and monitored to ensure our investigations
do not infringe upon the rights of these individuals or groups
protected by the Constitution.
   ``Some offices have reported information recently regarding
political statements and political lobbying by CISPES or CISPES
affiliates,'' the director continues. ``Supervisors ... must
carefully monitor this and related investigations and assess
operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate
direction, targeting and reporting.''
   Still, a month later, the Denver field office wrote that it
``concurs with New Orleans that in spite of attempts by the bureau
to clarify guidelines and goals for this investigation, the field
is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political
activity can be monitored.''
   Asked about the investigation, FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney
denied it was political, saying it ``had a narrow focus and was
limited to those leaders and key members of CISPES to ascertain if
they were involved in illegal support of the FMLN, a foreign
terrorist organization.''
   The FMLN is the Frente Farabundo Marti Para La Liberacion
Nacional, a resistance group fighting the U.S.-backed government of
El Salvador.

<TEXT>
   San Francisco's new mayor has spurned
the battleship USS Missouri, rekindling a rivalry among three ports
eager to be home to the ``Mighty Mo'' and its sailors _ and their
money.
   Despite interest from Long Beach, San Diego and Honolulu, the
Navy says it wants to stick with an earlier decision to base the
ship in San Francisco, where former Mayor Dianne Feinstein won a
Navy competition to host it by offering $5.5 million in port
improvements.
   However, Feinstein's successor, Art Agnos, made it part of his
election campaign to oppose the port funds on environmental and
other grounds, despite the estimated $100 million a year in
revenues the ship could bring.
   ``Evidently the people of San Francisco don't want it _ and
we've always wanted it,'' Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said last
week, when he joined local business leaders in launching a new
campaign to host the ship.
   For some, affection for the World War II-era behemoth, upon
whose decks the Japanese surrendered in World War II, isn't all
based on cold-blooded economics.
   ``It's a grand and glorious ship,'' said Morrie Dawkins, a
Bremerton, Wash., councilman who is trying to drum up support to
reclaim the ship for his city, where it was mothballed for 25 years
and attracted 300,000 annual visitors.
   The Missouri, one of four battleships recommissioned in recent
years, now operates out of the Long Beach Naval Station, though
it's officially based in San Francisco and awaiting completion of
port improvements there that were part the deal struck by Feinstein
with the Navy.
   Long Beach is already official home port for one of the other
newly active battleships, the USS New Jersey.
   Agnos, a liberal Democrat, hasn't formally conveyed his feelings
to the Navy, said his spokesman, Scott Shafer. However, the mayor
agrees with community activists who say the required dredging would
pose an environmental threat to San Francisco Bay and that
reactivating Navy facilities at Hunter's Point would force eviction
of artists and others who rent space there, Shafer said.
   ``He's been very consistent all along,'' Shafer said. ``He's
opposed it, and he'll continue to oppose it.''
   Agnos has pledged to veto the $5.5 million if the money is
approved by the city's Board of Supervisors, which endorsed the
plan last August and can override Agnos' veto. No date has been set
for final approval of the plan.
   A Navy spokesman in Washington, Lt. Kippy Burns, said earlier
this month that if San Francisco fails to provide the financial
support ``then that would obviously stop the Navy from going to
Hunter's Point.''
   The Missouri leads a battle group that includes four cruisers
and several frigates or destroyers, with a combined payroll of $60
million a year.
   Elsewere, U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents
the San Diego area, met Tuesday with Navy Secretary James Webb,
urging that the ship berth permanently in San Diego. An aide to
Hunter said the congressman is concerned about the economic impact
of threatened cuts in the fleet in that city.
   The case for Honolulu's Pearl Harbor was pressed by Gov. John
Waihee in a meeting with Webb last year, said Carolyn Tanaka,
spokeswoman for the Democratic governor.
   ``Even when the Navy decided to home-port the Missouri in San
Francisco, the state has kept a little bit of an ember burning,
telling them we're still interested,'' Ms. Tanaka said. ``I would
imagine that based on what's happened recently, the embers are
bigger now,'' she added.

   President Reagan's goal of free
trade throughout North America continues to elude him despite nine
meetings with Mexican presidents.
   Reagan announced his dream of a North American free trade area
embracing the United States, Canada and Mexico when he declared his
presidential candidacy for 1980.
   In the intervening years he has presided over an agreement with
Canada that would eliminate all tariffs and most other trade
barriers between the United States and its neighbor to the north by
1999.
   But after repeated meetings with Mexican presidents his dream of
extending such an agreement southward seems little closer to
realization than when he first outlined it.
   The trade pact signed last month by Reagan and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney faces opposition in both countries, and
Saturday's meeting with Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid in
Mazatlan produced scant movement in the trade area.
   As the two leaders, seated with their aides in cane-bottomed
chairs at a long dining table in a seaside hotel, rose to toast
each other, Reagan said their countries have taken steps toward ``a
special trade and investment relationship.''
   ``One day, I hope these steps will be seen as part of the
historic evolution toward free and unimpeded trade and investment
on this continent and in the Western Hemisphere,'' the president
said.
   ``There are, of course, obstacles to overcome,'' he added. Both
he and de la Madrid, who devoted little of his lengthy toast to the
trade issue, mentioned the problem of Mexico's massive debt to
commercial banks, estimated by U.S. officials at $105 billion.
   There are other obstacles. Mexico's economy is declining, 3.5
percent in 1986 and 1.5 percent in 1987 as measured by gross
national product, while the U.S. ecomomy is growing.
   Canadian critics of the trade agreement with the United States
argue that it could make Canada an economic and cultural dependent
of its neighbor to the south. Between Mexico and the United States,
the mismatch is far greater.
   ``We are not ready for free trade with Mexico. Mexico is not
ready,'' Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, told reporters aboard Air Force One as
Reagan flew to Mazatlan.
   There was some progress. U.S. and Canadian officials signed a
four-year agreement that permits a 6 percent annual increase in
quotas on textile and apparel imports from Mexico. In return,
Mexico agreed to broaden access to its markets for U.S. textiles
and apparel.
   Administration officials also had expected a telecommunications
agreement, covering mobile phone use along the border, to be
signed. A last-minute hitch developed, however, after Reagan
mentioned the planned signing in a pre-recorded version of his
weekly radio address.
   As the president flew north for three days of relaxation at his
ranch north of here, Secretary of State George P. Shultz told
reporters in Mazatlan that the telecommunications agreement was
``basically completed'' but had not been put into final written
form.
   The agreements follow a number of others between the two
countries.
   Mexico has drawn praise from the United States for lowering its
trade barriers, and the United States has responded by opening up
the U.S. market to Mexican leather goods and other products.
   De la Madrid has strongly pushed the market-opening moves as a
way to help mend the sickly Mexican economy and pull it out of its
lengthy crisis.
   As Abrams said, ``None of this is anything earth shaking, but it
is part of a larger process to keep the movement going in the
(direction of) ... freer and freer trade.''
   Reagan's meeting in Mazatlan was his sixth with de la Madrid. He
also met three times with the Mexican president's predecessor, Jose
Lopez de Portillo. Both presidents will leave office in a few
months and Reagan said this meeting, quite likely their last, would
help their successors to ``build on the foundation we've laid.''
   Abrams, however, conceded it was ``an open question'' whether
the foundation would enable the next U.S. and Mexican
administrations to realize Reagan's dream of a free trade agreement.

   They whetted their appetites with garlic
soup, munched on whole-baked garlic bulbs, savored the fresh garlic
sausage, and topped it off with ice cream flecked with minced
garlic.
   As far as revelers at a weekend Garlic Fest were concerned, the
menu was tastefully done.
   ``You all have such a nice aroma to you,'' restaurateur Mick
Noll told the crowd that gathered at his Covington Haus for closing
ceremonies Saturday night, highlighted by a fourth-annual Miss
Garlic competition.
   No one disagreed.
   ``I don't think I'd be able to live without garlic. I have it
for breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' said Eileen Knarr, 73, of
Latonia, who won the Miss Garlic crown.
   About 400 people attended the three-day festival at the
restaurant, directly across the Ohio River from Cincinnati. The
smell of garlic pervaded the eatery, gaining strength with every
garlic peeling contest held on the dance floor.
   They lined up for the peeling contests, wore headbands made of
garlic cloves, and downed dishes spiced with 160 pounds of garlic
imported from Gilroy, Calif., a garlic hot spot.
   Nine women competed for the Miss Garlic crown, which carries a
responsibility to try to improve the seasoning's reputation. Mrs.
Knarr expressed her devotion to the clove and her plans for
fulfilling her reign.
   ``I'll be on my toes,'' she said. ``If you eat a whole bunch of
garlic for a year, you've got to keep running.''
   That was enough for the judges, who compared notes on the
contestants while the festival's first Miss Garlic, Helen Lewin of
Fort Wright, sang a composition titled ``Me And My Garlic'' to the
tune of ``Me And My Shadow.''
   After an accordion fanfare, Mrs. Knarr was chosen the winner and
received the crown and sash from Patricia Gorrasi of Cincinnati,
the defending queen who was forced to sit out this year's pageant.
   Mrs. Gorrasi gave up her plans to try to retain the crown
because some of her family members sniffed at the title.
   ``My children said I was a source of embarrassment to them,''
she said.

   If Pete du Pont and Bruce Babbitt stumble in
this week's New Hampshire primary as badly as they did in Iowa,
future candidates may think twice before arguing for any changes in
the $260 billion Social Security program.
   Whatever the fate of their candidacies, it is almost certain
that Social Security will remain an issue in this campaign, just as
it has been in the last three national elections.
   What the surviving candidates are likely to be debating,
however, is not du Pont's idea for allowing young workers to open
tax-free retirement accounts or Babbitt's call for taxing all of
wealthy retirees' benefits, but who can offer the most ironclad
promise to keep those Social Security checks and cost-of-living
increases coming.
   Concern about Social Security ``is in the bone marrow of the
electorate,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
   Six years ago, when Social Security had barely enough money in
the till to pay benefits on time each month, senior citizens had
something to worry about.
   But after the bipartisan rescue plan of 1983, which increased
some taxes, froze benefits for six months and raised the retirement
age to 67 in the next century, the Social Security system began
rolling up big surpluses. The economic spurt after the 1982-83
recession and the sharp drop in unemployment hastened its recovery.
   Social Security's trust funds started this year with $67
billion. By next January, they will have grown to $104 billion.
They will swell to $400 billion by 1994 and $1 trillion-plus before
the turn of the century.
   Those big surpluses are the main reason the so-called notch
babies are mounting a widening campaign to have their benefits
raised closer to those born in 1916 and earlier. Congress made a
mistake in 1972 that gave the latter group more than they were
entitled to. The notch babies _ primarily the 7 million people born
between 1917 and 1921 _ contend they got cheated when Congress
rejiggerred the benefit formula in 1977.
   Several Democrats and Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., have promised to
look into the issue of equity for the notch babies, whose benefit
increases would cost tens of billions of dollars.
   Du Pont, the former Delaware governor who contends the system
will crash in the next century under the weight of the retired baby
boomers unless drastic changes are made, finished a distant fifth
in Iowa.
   Republican Pat Robertson, who like du Pont favors moves to
privitize Social Security, finished a strong second, but it was his
stand on moral issues, not pensions, that galvanized his Iowa
supporters.
   Kemp, the Republicans' most vigorous defender of the status quo
in Social Security, was fourth, but hoping to move up in New
Hampshire with his unbridled attacks on Sen. Bob Dole and Vice
President George Bush for supporting a freeze on Social Security in
1985.
   Dole tells voters everywhere he goes about his role on the
National Commission on Social Security Reform in 1983, when the
Kansas senator helped hammer out a last-minute compromise that put
Social Security back in the black.
   ``You don't have to worry about it being broke. You don't have
to worry about getting your checks. And there I made a
difference,'' says Dole, who also points out that Kemp voted
against the Social Security rescue plan. The New York congressman
says he didn't like its payroll tax increases.
   Du Pont has accused Kemp of repeatedly misrepresenting his plan
to allow workers to set up tax-free savings accounts if they
relinquish future Social Security benefits. Du Pont says Kemp's
attacks ``remind me of the demagoguery practices by the Democratic
Party in the 1982 elections.''
   Dole and other Republicans have said it was the Democrats'
pounding on senior citizens' fear of Social Security cuts or
freezes that cost the GOP control of the Senate in 1986.
   On the Democrats' side, Babbitt has called for ``a universal
needs test to discipline government programs,'' including Social
Security, and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax on
all their benefits instead of half.
   Gary Hart also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits.
   The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguard
Social Security and its COLAs. As Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri
put it, ``We're going to keep it away from the Republican budget
knives forever.''
   But Social Security's trust funds will always be tempting for
budget knives. They are expected to peak at $12 trillion _ $2.5
trillion in today's dollars _ around 2020, then be drawn down to
nothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers' retirement.
   Du Pont and Robertson have argued that even when the trust funds
are full, they will contain nothing but government IOU's. To pay
off those IOU's _ actually, interest-bearing Treasury bonds _ du
Pont says, ``we face a big tax increase.''
   When du Pont asked 80 people at a debate in Manchester, N.H.,
how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65,
three people raised their hands.
   More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubious
about their personal prospects for Social Security.
   But that sentiment has not translated into support for
politicians such as du Pont and Babbitt who suggest overhauling or
even tinkering with Social Security.
   Social Security will always be a political issue, simply because
it is such a massive part of what the government does, and the
single largest source of income for 35 percent of the elderly.
   Paul Maslin, Simon's pollster, said, ``The elites have attempted
to move the debate in a direction the voters don't want to move
yet.'' Young voters don't expect to get Social Security themselves,
Maslin said, but they do expect it to be there for their parents.
   ``For all of the provocation, the voters are still on the side
of protection,'' said Maslin. ``They understand that if the
government does not provide those benefits, they are going to have
to pay for their parents' retirement or health problems.''

   Senate leaders say they have assured the
European allies that the United States will not waver in its
commitment to NATO, regardless of who captures the White House this
year.
   That commitment includes the presence of U.S. troops in Europe
and a resolve to maintain a nuclear deterrent, despite hopes for
further progress in arms talks with the Soviets, the senators said.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd and three other senators
flew back to Andrews Air Force Base on Sunday following a nine-day,
five-nation trip through Europe, where they held talks with
government leaders, opposition figures and opinion makers.
   Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, said the allies unanimously
``expressed support for the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces)
treaty without amendments.''
   ``We left the message with these leaders that the United States
will continue fully to support NATO ... after the treaty is
approved. Those government leaders and the peoples of Europe wanted
to hear that reassurance,'' he said.
   ``There was an extraordinary amount of agreement among those
leaders and ourselves as to what the alliance should do in the
post-INF environment,'' Byrd said.
   ``Regardless of the various voices and noises and opinions that
come out of Washington during elections, the NATO alliance can
count on this country for stability and continued support,'' Byrd
said. ``We preached the message of cohesion and unity.''
   Byrd said the bumping of two U.S. Navy ships by two Soviet
warships in the Black Sea Friday was discouraging and ``feeds upon
and contributes to the kind of skepticism that we found among
European leaders'' about the Soviets.
   ``Here we're in this time of glasnost and detente and then all
of a sudden we have one of these unprovoked confrontations. ... ''
he said. ``Perhaps it serves a purpose in that it makes us stop,
look and listen and remember that caution is the watchword as we
proceed with our relations.''
   Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said, ``One of the things that we were most
suprised about is there was less disagreement than we were led to
believe before we went. We read these stories that there were
people proposing denuclearization of Europe ... We didn't find that
anywhere.''
   Boren said the NATO allies believe the Soviets have two aims: to
divide NATO and to ``try to avoid conventional arms reductions
where they have a clear superiority.''
   Byrd said, ``We're all agreed that there has to continue to be
the strategy of flexible response. A nuclear deterrent must be an
element of that strategy ... if it is to be credible.''
   Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, and John W. Warner, R-Va., the ranking
minority member of the Armed Services Committee, also flew back
Sunday. A fifth member of the delegation, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the
chairman of Armed Services, flew home earlier. The Senate leaders
visited Germany, England, France, Turkey and Italy.
   Among the leaders they met with were Helmut Kohl, the West
German chancellor; Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister;
Francois Mitterand, the president of France; Turgut Ozal, the prime
minister of Turkey, and Giovanni Goria, prime minister of Italy.

   Ann Pfoser Darby and Wayne Green are locked
in the least publicized, least competitive, least important race in
the New Hampshire presidential primary _ and if history is a
teacher, neither one will win.
   Darby and Green are running on the Republican ticket for vice
president. David Duke is unopposed on the Democratic side, but
that's no assurance of victory.
   In the past, the winner usually has been a write-in candidate
with a bit more name recognition _ George Bush in 1984, Spiro Agnew
in 1972, Richard Nixon in 1956 and 1964, Robert Kennedy in 1964,
Hubert Humphrey in 1968.
   And the winner gets nothing but a little publicity.
   Unlike the presidential race that influences delegates at the
national party conventions, the vice presidential race influences
no one.
   The vice presidential candidates for the Republican and
Democratic parties will be chosen, as usual, at the conventions by
the presidential nominees. However, some vice presidential
primaries have had a more lasting effect on the Republican and
Democratic tickets.
   In 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower was considering whether to
keep Nixon on the ticket, and he used the primary as a sounding
board. Nixon attracted 23,000 write-in votes, 20,000 more than the
runnerup, and stayed on the ticket.
   In 1972, there was some discontent with Spiro Agnew as Nixon's
running mate, but that was put to rest when Agnew drew 45,524
write-in votes _ the most ever.
   Darby, a high school teacher in New York City, paid the $1,000
filing fee to try to change all that. She wants the vice
presidential candidates independently elected by the people.
   ``It's something that always bugged me,'' Darby said in a
telephone interview. ``The idea came to me that I can bring the
issue to the people through the primaries. If I get a mandate in
New Hampshire, I'll take it to other states. If I don't get the
votes, it means they didn't like the idea.''
   Darby, 53, a former GOP district leader in New York and former
school board chairwoman, campaigns in New Hampshire on weekends and
expects to spend more than $5,000 to get her point across.
   Green, 65, is making his second run at the vice presidency. A
magazine publisher from Hancock, N.H., he freely acknowledges: ``Me
being vice president would be a disaster.''
   He ran in 1964 when he learned that no one had ever filed for
the job since the New Hampshire primary first included candidates
in 1952. Write-ins for vice president got all the votes from 1952
to 1960.
   Green's total campaign cost was $16 for bumper stickers, he
said. But he did get media coverage, and attracted 8,030 votes _
122 fewer than write-ins for Nixon and 1,600 more than write-ins
for Henry Cabot Lodge.
   ``This time I have a message,'' he said. Mainly, he wants to
improve education, raise productivity and cut military costs.
   Duke, 37, is a former Ku Klux Klan leader and founder of the
National Association for the Advancement of White People in
Metairie, La. Duke, who says he is an author, also filed for the
presidency.
   His coordinator, Ralph Forbes, said the vice presidential filing
was a last-minute decision and a mistake because Duke thought he
could win binding delegates.
   Duke wants to be president, and ``wants to have 2,000
delegates'' when the Democratic convention begins, Forbes said.
   Forbes said Duke believes the white middle class is no longer
represented properly, especially in the areas of housing and jobs.
   The three hope for enough publicity and votes to promote their
ideas.
   And in the words of Richard Upton, the man who introduced the
legislation establishing a New Hampshire candidates' primary in
1952: ``Maybe lightning would strike.''

<HEAD>Dollar Up Amid Hopes For Shrinking U.S. Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improved U.S. trade figures helped boost the dollar
and prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, reflecting hopes for
a shrinking U.S. trade deficit, traders said.
   The dollar closed at 131.00 yen, up 1.05 from Friday's close. It
opened at 131.40 yen and ranged between 130.95 yen and 131.60 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
24,207.47 points, up 225.53 points, or 0.9 percent, from Friday's
close of 23,981.94.
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were higher across the
board in response to the higher dollar and the lower U.S. trade
deficit during December, dealers said.
   An analyst for Goldman Sachs who asked that he not be identified
said profit-taking brought the dollar down from its higher opening
figure, but said buyers were still apparently pleased with the U.S.
trade figures.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said that in December, the U.S.
trade deficit fell to $12.2 billion, down from $13.2 billion in
November.
   Traders at the Tokyo Foreign Exchange said they believe the
dollar will stay firm for the time being.
   ``There is no factor weighing on the dollar right now except
commercial and profit-taking selling,'' an official of a Japanese
commercial bank said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Robertson Supporters to AIDS Victims: `It's Your Own Fault'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Republican presidential candidates sat
on a college stage debating the problem of AIDS, backers of
presidential candidate Pat Robertson were outside jeering at
victims of the deadly disease.
   ``It's your own fault,'' the roughly 25 students holding ``Youth
for Robertson'' signs chanted at nearly 70 members of a group
called ``Cure AIDS Now.''
   One Robertson supporter outside the St. Anselm College debate
hall said he heckled the AIDS victims and their friends because
``they don't live right.'' He refused to give his name.
   Michael Petrelis, an AIDS victim and coordinator of Cure AIDS
Now, derided the Roberston backers as ``real good Christians.''
   Several members of the AIDS advocacy group retaliated by yelling
and blowing whistles at the Robertson supporters.
   The verbal skirmish occurred in a parking lot near the debate
hall. The lot was filled with cheering supporters of Robertson,
Kansas Sen. Robert Dole and New York Rep. Jack Kemp, as well as the
AIDS group and a small group of opponents of the Seabrook nuclear
plant.
   Petrelis said his group encountered Robertson as he drove into
the parking lot for the debate, but drew no reaction from the
former television evangelist.
   The groups supporting the candidates dispersed as the debate
began and about 10 minutes later police escorted the AIDS group
from the St. Anselm campus.
   Earlier, a Cure AIDS Now rally in Manchester drew a brief
appearance from Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Paul Simon,
who said more educational efforts should be aimed at intravenous
drug users, a high-risk group for the disease.
   ``We accomplished what we wanted, which was to get one of the
candidates to say the A-word. Now we hope to press the candidates
harder on what they'll do about AIDS once the field is narrowed
down some,'' Petrelis said.

<TEXT>
   A businessman who wants to build a gambling
casino in an abandoned shipyard says the project would spur
economic recovery in this Rust Belt city, but opponents warn of the
specter of organized crime.
   ``I thought they were nuts. I said, `What? A casino?''' Mayor
Alex Olejko said of the less-than-scenic site, which is downstream
from a waste-water treatment plant and large piles of iron ore
pellets straddling the mouth of the Black River in this steelmaking
city.
   Even so, Alan Spitzer, who with his family runs 25 auto
dealerships in Ohio and Florida, envisions a 1,000-room hotel that
would create 5,000 jobs for Lorain, which is in a county that state
figures show has lost about 7,000 jobs since 1979.
   He says a year-round resort could draw tourists and
conventioneers to Lorain, about 30 miles west of Cleveland, and
visitors could go to nearby amusement parks, major league sporting
events and cultural events.
   ``We think the industrial backdrop actually enhances and adds
some ambiance,'' said Spitzer, who last month disclosed plans for
the $300 million vacation resort.
   Casino gambling is not legal in Ohio and Spitzer has enlisted
the help of state Rep. Joseph Koziura, a Lorain Democrat, to
sponsor legislation that would allow casino gambling in the city of
72,000 residents for a five-year trial period, if voters approved.
   From the high-rise hotel on the drawing boards, visitors would
have a backdoor view of downtown, peppered with vacant storefronts
or a large steel plant downstream.
   ``There are few places in the country that have so many
entertainment options in such a short distance and so accessible,''
Spitzer said.
   The only forms of gambling permitted in Ohio are charity bingo,
horse racing and the state-run lottery. Casino gambling is legal in
the United States only in Nevada and Atlantic City, N.J.
   William R. Eadington, a professor of economics at the University
of Nevada-Reno who studies casino gambling regulations, said he
doesn't view the grimy Lorain site as a problem.
   Eadington, a consultant for the project, said the location of a
casino is not that crucial because resorts tend to be
self-contained and visitors have little reason to leave.
   Reaction to the proposal has been mixed. Local officials quickly
embraced the project while others, including some ministers,
promptly condemned it. Others said they'd reserve judgment until
the Legislature acts.
   ``I really don't think the steelworkers will even think about
this until it gets off the ground. We don't believe in talk. Talk
is cheap,'' said Al Pena, president of United Steelworkers Local
1104, which has 2,700 members working at the USX Corp. plant in
Lorain.
   In an editorial, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer suggested
developers might not be able to prevent organized crime from
getting a foothold in the resort or service industries, despite
tight controls in the legislation.
   ``For their part, Ohioans have had their fill of corruption on
the part of public officials and agencies, of lax enforcement of
state regulations, of conflicts of interest and payoffs. Why, now,
should voters invite more of the same,'' the editorial said.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is
emerging as the early odds-on favorite to win the Democratic
party's presidential nomination among union political activists
gathered here for the AFL-CIO's annual winter meeting.
   But unlike 1984 and 1968, the last presidential elections when
labor united early behind a single candidate _ Walter Mondale and
Hubert Humprey, respectively _ there is no sense of urgency among
their leaders to attempt playing the role of kingmaker this year.
   ``Most of our folks are waiting to find out who the winner is
and then jump on board,'' said Sam Dawson, political director for
the 494,000-member United Steelworkers Union. ``The (AFL-CIO's
36-member policymaking) executive council is all over the lot; and
within every union, the rank-and-file is all over the lot.''
   Only if Dukakis had won the Iowa primary, where he had the
unqualified support of unionized public employees, could the
AFL-CIO have made an endorsement before the Democratic National
Convention next July in Atlanta, according to Dawson and several
other union activists here.
   Dukakis' third-place finish in Iowa behind Rep. Richard Gephardt
of Missouri and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois makes it all but
impossible for labor leaders to tell individual union members now
to disregard their advice through 1987 and to get to Atlanta as a
delegate any way they can and for whomever they please.
   ``I had hoped we could make an endorsement after Iowa and
(Tuesday's primary election in) New Hampshire, but now it would
take something cataclysmic for us to endorse,'' said Rachelle
Horowitz, political director for the American Federation of
Teachers.
   However, Ms. Horowitz, a Dukakis partisan and one of 42
automatic labor delegates to the convention as members of the
Democratic National Committee, is shedding no tears over the lack
of an early consensus.
   ``If we learned anything from the Mondale period when we needed
a winner after Reagan's union-busting, it's the danger of whipping
ourselves into such a frenzy that we can't see when a winner is not
there,'' she said. ``Up until and including election day I believed
Fritz Mondale could win.''
   While preferring any of the six Democrats in the race over any
Republican, unions continue to hedge their bets, dealing with
contenders in both parties.
   ``None of them has plucked my heart yet,'' said William Wynn,
president of the 1 million-member United Food and Commercial
Workers Union, the third largest in the AFL-CIO behind the newly
reunited Teamsters union at 1.6 million members and the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees at 1.1 million.
   A plurality of UFCW members appears to prefer Dukakis, said
Allen Zack, a spokesman for the union. But Jackson also
demonstrated strong support among largely white members of his
union in Iowa because of his appearance over the past two years on
picket lines in strikes at meatpacking plants in the state, Zack
said.
   AFSCME President Gerald McEntee _ while abiding by the letter of
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland's guidelines saying union
presidents should remain neutral until the federation itself makes
an endorsement _ leaves little doubt that Dukakis is the preferred
choice of his union's members.
   ``In some states like New York, we're running a two-candidate
strategy with Dukakis and Jesse Jackson,'' McEntee said. ``But the
vast majority of our people are for Dukakis.''
   That sentiment, while dominant, is not universal among other
leaders of the 91 unions belonging to AFL-CIO.
   The United Auto Workers is claiming the biggest role in Iowa by
helping Gephardt win a plurality of votes there because of his
advocacy of mandating tariffs on Japanese and Korean imports if
they do not open their markets to more U.S. goods.
   UAW leaders, however, acknowledge they are not putting all of
their eggs in Gephardt's basket because he is pushing their version
of restrictionist trade legislation.
   ``Gephardt might crash and burn,'' said Peter Laarman, a UAW
spokesman. ``We're playing by the AFL-CIO rules. Our issue is trade
and corporate accountability, but we have quite a few people, for
example, in Pennsylvania who are for Simon.''
   Simon also is the most popular Democratic candidate among
steelworkers in Pennyslvania and Ohio, the union's two biggest
membership states, according to Dawson. But Dawson and other union
activists also see Simon as an also-ran if he finishes behind
Dukakis and Gephardt in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
   ``I'm running as a Simon delegate in New York, if he's still
alive after New Hampsire,'' said Joyce Miller, a vice president of
the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and one of three
women on the AFL-CIO executive council.
   Meanwhile, nearly every union is treating black minister Jesse
Jackson with deference this year, in contrast to their view of him
as a spoiler who hurt their endorsement of Mondale in 1984.
   According to Ms. Horowitz, Jackson could easily win four states
_ Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia _ in the Super
Tuesday primary elections on March 8.
   ``Gephardt, Simon and Dukakis all have big support in the trade
union movement,'' she said. ``Only Al Gore (a Democratic senator
from Tennessee) is not slating our delegates.''

<HEAD>Nation's Oldest Fire Marshal Has No Plans To Retire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHESTER, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking back on a life that spans nearly a
century, James Grote has no trouble deciding what he cares about
most.
   ``The fire service is the closest to my heart outside of the
almighty God,'' says Grote, who at age 96 is the nation's oldest
fire marshal.
   Seventy-five years ago, Grote helped form the fire department
that protects this town of 3,200 residents on the lower Connecticut
River. He's been working to save lives and property here ever since.
   ``The fire service is something that I've given dedication,''
Grote said recently. ``I've been loyal. I've been faithful.''
   And he's been active.
   After the department was formed in 1912, he rose through the
ranks to become chief. He was named fire marshal 66 years ago.
   Although the appointment was for life, Grote has never taken the
job for granted. When the state mandated certification for fire
marshals in 1972, Grote _ then 80 _ undertook 12 weeks of training
to gain his state license.
   ``He still functions as he did when he was 60,'' says Chester
First Selectman Robert Blair.
   A photograph of Grote hangs in the Washington, D.C., office of
Robert B. Smith, executive secretary of the Fire Marshals
Association of North America.
   Grote is ``worthy of the recognition he's received,'' Smith says.
   Over the years, he has spoken frequently on fire safety before
the state legislature. He advocated building sprinkler systems to
legislators 50 years ago when the idea wasn't popular. Later, he
championed smoke detectors.
   Although he doesn't respond to every fire call these days, Grote
still drives to most department meetings. His bright red car is
mounted with red flashers, and his business card says ``The Chief.''
   Grote, who lives alone, concedes to making a few concessions to
age. His daughters prepare his meals, and he'll accept an
occasional ride to a firefighters' meeting. Two deputies often
assist him on safety inspections, where Grote admits he sometimes
plays the tough guy.
   ``If I come into your place of business, and you may have half a
dozen extinguishers, and I find one behind the door, I'll jump you
for all the good ones that are in sight,'' he said.
   ``It's not that you try to be mean about it but you see this is
an instrument that you might need,'' Grote says.
   The fire marshal, who retired as the town's postmaster in 1970,
has held every top office in every fire association in the state.
He's also served as president of fire chief associations in New
England and on the national level.
   Grote's home is a monument to his second career and first love.
His uniform, festooned with gold braids and stars, hangs where it
can be quickly brought out for display. Photographs, trophies and
plaques decorate the walls. Amid the memorabilia are birthday
greetings from Pope John Paul II and President Reagan.
   Grote says he'll give up his post _ when the time is right.
   ``Let me be my judge,'' he says. ``I know when to back way from
the table. I know when I've had enough of this, that and the
other.''

   Highlights from the presidential campaign
trial:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DEAD HEAT
   Polls showed Republicans BOB DOLE and GEORGE BUSH in a virtual
tie heading into Tuesday's first-in-the-nation presidential primary
in New Hampshire. A CBS survey issued Sunday had Dole at 31 percent
and Bush at 30 percent, while an ABC-Washington Post poll showed
Dole with 31 percent and Bush with 28. The gap in both cases was
within the polls' margins of error.
   
   DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, the clear Democratic front-runner in both
polls, concentrated on foreign policy issues and ignored
last-minute attacks by rivals. Dukakis said he would defend U.S.
allies in Central America but would not fund the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   
   LAST-MINUTE ATTACKS
   PAUL SIMON began television commercials attacking Dukakis as a
bureaucrat, while RICHARD GEPHARDT'S ads called Dukakis ``one of
the biggest tax-raisers in Massachusetts history.''
   
   NUKE CLAIM
   A Republican debate Sunday night was highlighted by PAT
ROBERTSON'S claim the Soviet Union secretly has placed nuclear
missiles in Cuba. A White House official promptly disputed
Robertson's assertion, and a Robertson aide said after the debate
that the candidate had meant missile-delivery systems, not
necessarily warheads.
   
   HECKLING AIDS VICTIMS:
   ``Youth for Robertson'' students jeered at AIDS victims outside
the debate hall, chanting ``It's your own fault.'' A coordinator
for the group ``Cure AIDS Now'' sarcastically described the
Robertson backers as ``real good Christians.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON toured on a 1930s train, drawing good crowds
despite 20-degree weather. ``I've stood with you. On Tuesday I want
you to stand with me,'' Jackson said from aboard his ``Rainbow
Express.''

<HEAD>Kohl Visit To Focus On Differences In Defense Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to
Washington on Wednesday for talks with U.S. officials that are
expected to focus on differences between the two countries on
several key security issues.
   During the three-day visit, Kohl is slated to meet with
President Reagan, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and leading
members of Congress.
   Kohl is expected to urge swift Senate ratification of the
superpower agreement eliminating land-based intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   Differences between the two nations center on modernizing NATO's
short-range nuclear weapons and eliminating chemical weapons.
   U.S. officials and other NATO countries have emphasized the need
for modernizing short-range nuclear missiles that will remain in
Europe after intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scrapped.
   But West German officials have said that upgrading of
short-range weapons systems should be linked to negotiations on
reducing the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional weapons in
Central Europe.
   Short-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons are primarily aimed
at targets on West German and East German territory.
   Kohl recently warned U.S. military planners against strategies
that would limit a nuclear war to German soil.
   ``A strategy aimed at limiting the deterrent of nuclear weapons
to Europe, or worse, to German soil is not acceptable to us,'' he
told a meeting of military experts Feb. 6.
   Kohl has urged that a higher priority be given to reducing the
number of short-range missiles, which have a range of less than 300
miles.
   The superpowers, however, have indicated that future arms
control talks will first concentrate on reducing strategic, or
long-range, nuclear weapons arsenals.
   West German government sources said Sunday that the main
sticking point in Kohl's talks with U.S. officials could be the
issue of chemical weapons.
   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who will
accompany the chancellor, are expected to press Reagan anew to work
toward a superpower agreement for the worldwide destruction of
chemical weapons.
   U.S. officials have said in recent months that such an agreement
may be difficult to reach because of problems of verification.
   West German leaders reject that argument, saying the
intermediate-range missile accord proves such problems can be
worked out.
   Kohl may also seek assurances that Washington will make good on
a pledge not to deploy a new generation of binary chemical weapons
in West Germany, government sources said.
   Under an agreement reached between Kohl and Reagan during the
economic summit in Tokyo in 1986, aging chemical weapons now
stationed in West Germany would not be replaced.
   Instead, the old weapons would be removed from West Germany and
the new systems held in readiness in the United States.
   There are indications, however, that the agreement may not be as
firm as West German officials had hoped.
   The news magazine Der Spiegel, in its latest edition, quoted
U.S. Geneva arms negotiator Max Friedersdorf as saying the
agreement might not extend beyond Reagan's term in office.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's chief commander in Europe, told a
West German newspaper on Saturday that he favored stationing the
new weapons in Europe ``where the troops are.''

   Presidential candidates making their southern
swing will address issues important to Texans, say organizers of
debates this week.
   The Texas Debates will be held Thursday and Friday at Southern
Methodist University, weeks away from the March 8 Super Tuesday
southern regional primary.
   The debates, coming on the heels of Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary, will draw national attention to the regional primary of 14
Southern and border states in which a third of both parties'
delegates will be picked.
   ``The Texas Debates offer a chance to focus more closely on the
remaining candidates and on the issues, especially the economic
ones that are critical today in the Southwest,'' said Burl Osborne,
president and editor of The Dallas Morning News.
   Sponsors include The News, KERA-TV, and Texas Monthly magazine.

<HEAD>Cartoonist Aims This Week's Barbs At Albert Gore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Junior's
quest for the Democratic presidential nomination comes under the
scrutiny of ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau this week.
   Beginning with Monday's strip, Trudeau takes a week-long look at
Gore's childhood, his Tennessee political career and his bid for
the White House.
   Gore told the Tennessean, Nashville's morning newspaper, that he
was a big Trudeau fan.
   ``He's such a great artist and satirist,'' Gore said. ``I think
it's a lot of fun to be in the strip.''
   In the strip, Gore is called ``Albert, prince of the Tennessee
Valley.''
   Another presidential candidate, Vice President George Bush, has
been savaged by Trudeau in an off-again, on-again series. In the
strips, Bush is usually invisible.

   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas is likely to win
the Republican nomination for president, according to former United
Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick.
   About 750 Republicans attended the state GOP's annual Lincoln
Day festivities in Kansas City over the weekend, where Kirkpatrick
was the keynote speaker.
   ``I don't have any crystal ball,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``I know
predictions are uncertain. If I had to choose, I would say it's
likely it would be Bob Dole. It can change. I think today, that's
the way it looks.''
   Much of the discussion centered on the chances of Dole and Vice
President George Bush, the top GOP presidential contenders.
   Unlike Lincoln Day weekends in past presidential election years,
there was a generally harmonious atmosphere among Republicans
although there was no consensus candidate.

<HEAD>Boston Newspaper Endorses Kemp in GOP Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Herald, calling Republican presidential
hopeful Jack Kemp ``a man of genuine vision,'' has endorsed the New
York congressman in his effort to win the GOP nomination.
   ``All the Republicans have much to recommend them,'' the Herald
said in its lead editorial Monday, one day before the New Hampshire
primary. ``But in terms of ideas, philosophy and potential for
presidential leadership, we are persuaded that Kemp would make a
better occupant of the White House than any of his rivals.''
   The editorial noted that Kemp was not the favorite in the
first-in-the nation presidential primary. Vice President George
Bush and Kansas Sen. Bob Dole are favored to finish higher in the
voting.
   ``Although it looks like the New Hampshire primary is a fight
between Bush and Dole for first place, we hope Kemp will do well
enough to stay in the race,'' the editorial said.
   Last week, the newspaper endorsed Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis in his race for the Democratic nomination.

<TEXT>
   Faced with a two-year population boom, family
planning authorities today said pressure will be increased on local
cadres to enforce China's one-child-per-family limit, which has
been widely defied.
   The authorities, while putting most of the blame for the birth
surge on a peak in the number of childbearing women, also
complained of a slackening off of birth control fervor in some
places.
   From now on, cadres ``who implement the family planning policies
well will get benefits, and those who do not do well will not get
benefits and will even be punished,'' Liang Jimin, director of the
State Family Planning Commission's general office, told a news
conference. He did not describe the punishments.
   He said the move was ordered by acting Premier Li Peng.
   It follows two years in which the number of births jumped
dramatically, in some places exceeding the planned level by 30
percent as more and more peasants have second and third children.
   The nationwide growth rate, which had been tamped down to 1.1
percent in 1985, hit 1.4 percent in 1986 and again last year,
bringing the population to 1.07 billion or nearly 1.5 million more
than planned.
   Liang said the main reason for the surge is an increase in the
number of women of childbearing age, themselves products of a baby
boom during the 1960s. He said the effects of this ``boom echo''
would peak this year and next.
   But his deputy, Shen Guoxiang, acknowledged that more than 30
percent of the births each year were not part of the state plan,
meaning the women defied regulations and married before the legal
age of 20 or had more than one child.
   Only members of minority groups, peasants in some very poor
areas and couples whose first child is handicapped are allowed to
have more than one child.
   Earlier marriages and big families have become increasingly
popular following the breakup of the communes in the early 1980s
and the reinstitution of family farming. Now that peasants can sell
a large part of their crops for their own profit, extra hands
translate into extra money.
   The peasants' new prosperity also means they can afford to pay
government fines for having second, which vary from place to place
but usually amount to 1,000 or more yuan per year for five years.
   The average peasant family earns 500 yuan ($135) per person per
year, but in good farming regions incomes of 10,000 yuan ($2,700)
are not uncommon.
   The state-run media have acknowleged that many peasants view
fines as an acceptable price for having the much-desired big family.
   Asked if the system encourged rich peasants to ``buy a second
child,'' Liang insisted, ``No, it's not like that. Our emphasis has
always been on publicity and education.'' He did not comment
further.
   In a front-page article last month, the state-run People's Daily
said the trend toward having more than one child had reached crisis
proportions, and warned that China might not be able to reach its
goal of limiting the population to 1.2 billion in the year 2000.
   Liang said the situation was ``acute'' and the task ahead
arduous, but he said the limit of 1.2 billion was still possible.
   He said new emphasis will be put on signing family planning
contracts with fixed birth targets. In some cases, women will be
asked to sign contracts with local organizations to have only one
child, a practice that has been used in the past.
   In other cases, he said, work units will sign the contracts.
Work units already play a significant role in urban areas in
enforcing the one-child policy, and in many cases suspend workers
for one or two years if they have a second child.
   Asked if placing greater responsibility on local cadres to
enforce the one-child limit could encourage coerced abortions, Shen
said: ``We are not going to take the number of abortions done as
one of the indicators'' of a cadre's success.
   China already has 50 abortions for every 100 live births. Liang
said this is because most women in the countryside use intrauterine
devices as birth control, and that these have a failure rate of
about 20 percent.

   Adolfo Calero, a leader of U.S.-backed

Panama or received funds from the Panamanian government.
   ``We never had anyone training in Panama,'' Calero said. ``I

   Calero's comments came in an interview over the weekend after
appealing to a convention of U.S. conservatives to send donations

testimony last week by a former top Panamanian intelligence
officer, Jose I. Blandon.
   Blandon told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that Panama
provided military training for the rebels after a 1985 request from
then-White House aide Oliver North. At the time, direct U.S.
assistance to the rebels was banned by law.

<HEAD>Funeral For Two Homeless Conducted At City Hall</HEAD>

   After battling with local officials for the
bodies of two people, advocates for the homeless conducted a
funeral service which included the plain, wooden caskets of a man
and woman on a downtown plaza across from city hall.
   Bundled against sub-freezing temperatures and a bitter wind,
about 40 activists prayed for a world where people ``do not die in
the cold'' and held a service over the weekend that city officials
dubbed ``tasteless'' after they lost the legal fight for custody of
the corpses.
   Mitch Snyder, leader of the Community for Creative Non-Violence,
said the public service, prior to cremation of the bodies, was
designed to call attention to the deaths of 10 homeless people this
winter on the streets of the capital. The city says 13 people have
died of hypothermia, seven of them homeless.

<HEAD>Pravda Proposes Making Leaders More Accountable Through Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To make government more accountable, top party
officials should be elected by all Communist Party members, more
than one candidate should run and the balloting should be secret, a
Pravda article proposed.
   Activists in the Ukraine made the suggestions, which appeared in
a front-page article in Sunday's editions of the party's main
newspaper, indicating the Communist leadership is seriously
considering them.
   The article said the issues will be formally taken up at the
19th All-Union Party Conference, a rare gathering of the nation's
Communists to be held June 28 in Moscow. Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
raised the same issues the article suggested and has said electoral
reform will be a key topic at the conference.
   At a plenary meeting of the party's Central Committee in January
1986, the Soviet leader brought up the idea of secret ballots and
discussed the possibility of giving party members a choice in
voting for top party officials.
   Gorbachev also criticized the current system for allowing
bureaucrats to remain in party posts for life _ regardless of their
productivity _ and discussed broadening the nomination procedure
for government elections.
   Some of the suggestions have been adopted experimentally.
   In what the government called democratization,
``multiple-candidate elections'' for local party posts were held in
several areas in June. All of the candidates had to be approved by
the Communist Party, the only party permitted to field candidates.
   In the June experiments, party members in one of every 25 voting
districts chose among more than one candidate for local governing
councils. Runoff elections had to be held in 59 of the Soviet
Union's 52,000 districts.
   Whether the experiment will be expanded is not clear, but the
continued media attention indicates the idea is still very much
alive. The party conference in June could set the stage for making
the system permanent and nationwide.
   Gorbachev has also brought a little democracy to the working
place. In June, the Soviet parliament, or Supreme Soviet, approved
competitive elections for managers of state enterprises. The idea
is to make them more accountable.
   In its report Sunday on a meeting of Kiev University Communists,
Pravda said there would be a diversity of views if more than one
candidate were to run for party first secretary.
   ``What will remain is a struggle of opinions, a debate, a search
for alternatives, variations and a choice of the best among them,''
Pravda said.
   Currently, only top party bodies elect the first secretary, and
any debate about whom to choose is held behind closed doors. The
first secretary is the top party official. The post exists at the
city, regional and republic level.
   Pravda also suggested that all Communists take part in the
voting, not just members of party committees, and that the
balloting be conducted secretly.
   These electoral changes, the newspaper said, would help make top
party officials more accountable to the people, and eliminate the
``cult of personality'' that surrounds them.
   Another Soviet newspaper, Socialisticheskaya Industriya, on
Sunday carried suggestions that the terms of party officials and
their ages be restricted.
   ``When this or that person has been sitting in his ruling chair
for dozens of years, then no experience he has garnered can
compensate willy-nilly for a dulling of the feeling of newness, a
fear of the risk of going forward,'' the newspaper said.

   Officials at the Canann Valley Ski
Resort say an explosion and fire that killed three maintenance
workers may have been touched off by a compressor used for
snow-making.
   The blaze, fed by at least five 55-gallon drums of fuel housed
in the maintenance area, gutted the building Sunday, authorities
said.
   Resort spokesman Andy Snyder said it appeared the compressor,
part of a snow-making machine, exploded and set off the fire. It
took firefighters about an hour to reach the victims. No other
injuries were reported.
   ``I was on the slope opposite it when it blew,'' said Bob
Gribbin of Springfield, Va. ``I heard an explosion, and fire came
shooting out the back side of the building. Flames shot out to the
back wall (of the maintenance area). I guess it was about 40 feet.''
   The maintenance shop, located at the base of the mountain, is
used to repair resort vehicles and snow-making machines and also
houses the compressors, said Canaan Valley State Park spokesman
Steve Drumheller.
   Snyder said the compressors had been used to make snow as late
as Sunday morning, but were shut off sometime before noon when
temperatures rose above freezing.
   Firefighters from seven fire departments were called to help put
out the fire in the stone and wood building, he said. The resort's
beginners' area was closed for about three hours.
   Authorities identified the dead as Ronald L. Hanlon, 33, Dale W.
Liller, 25, and Randy Lee Crowl, 24, all of Davis.

<HEAD>Runoff Next Week To Determine Next President of Cyprus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A runoff election will be held next week
between a pro-Western conservative and a communist-backed
millionaire to determine who will replace President Spyros
Kyprianou, who lost his bid for a third term.
   Final results from Sunday's presidential election in the Greek
Cypriot part of this war-divided Mediterranean island, put
conservative Glafcos Clerides on top with with 33.3 percent,
followed by businessman George Vassiliou with 30.1 percent and
Kyprianou with 27.3 percent.
   Kyprianou, 55, who remains head of the centrist Democratic
Party, conceded defeat in a televised address and said he will
``continue striving on the basis of the same policy as before.'' He
was running for a third five-year term.
   ``I see the result as approval by the people of a non-party,
independent candidate to unite the people,'' said Vassiliou, an
independent backed by the Communist Party. ``I am sure next Sunday
will complete the renewal to enable us to face the difficult future
for the settlement of our problem,'' said Vassiliou, 56, founder of
the largest market research firm in the Middle East.
   The results made the Feb. 21 runoff between Clerides and
Vassiliou certain, since neither polled more than half of the vote
as required by the constitution of Cyprus, which gained
independence from Britain in 1960.
   Clerides, 69, a proponent of an all-party national unity
government, said: ``There has been no victor or vanquished in this
election, since I will ask the other parties, including the
Democratic Party, to participate in a coalition Cabinet.'' His
right-wing party is considered pro-Western.
   The leader of the small Socialist Party, Vassos Lyssarides,
polled 9.2 percent. With all 334,407 ballots counted, Clerides had
111,491, Vassiliou 100,635, Kyprianou 91,262 and Lyssarides 30,832.
An independent, Thrassos Georghiades, had 187 votes, or 0.06
percent.
   Voting was uneventful Sunday, despite mudslinging during the
campaign and warnings by the rival candidates of imminent
assassination attempts, bombings and other violence. A midday car
bomb explosion in the southern port city of Limassol killed three
senior Palestinian guerrilla officers. But a Cyprus government
statement said the blast had nothing to do with the election.
   The candidates agree on only one thing: that the main issue is
how to reunify the nation, divided into Turkish and Greek sectors
after Turkey invaded its northern third in 1974.
   Dinos Michaelides, the Interior minister, said 95 percent of the
362,928 registered Greek Cypriot voters had cast their ballots when
polling stations closed at 6 p.m. Voting is compulsory.
   In previous presidential elections, the result was always a
foregone conclusion, with the leading candidate either running
unopposed or with insignificant opposition.
   Since 1974, the northern third of the island has been under
Turkish military control. Turkey invaded Cyprus, ostensibly to
protect the Turkish Cypriot minority, in the wake of a coup by
Greek Cypriot extremists seeking union with Greece. In 1983, the
150,000 Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own breakaway state,
which has been recognized only by Turkey.
   A 2,300-man United Nations peacekeeping force patrols a dividing
line splitting the island east to west. Efforts at reunification
through a U.N.-sponsored federation plan have been deadlocked for
more than two years.
   Kyprianou's main plank was the rejection of any resumption of
negotiations with the Turkish side unless the 35,000 Turkish troops
and 65,000 settlers from mainland Turkey withdraw from northern
Cyprus.
   His two main rivals also supported the withdrawal demand but did
not make this a precondition for negotiations.

<HEAD>Newlywed Booked In Death Of His Wife During Honeymoon Cruise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newlywed who said his wife was blown
overboard while jogging on the deck of a ship during a honeymoon
cruise was booked for investigation of murder when the ocean liner
docked, an FBI spokesman said.
   Scott Robin Roston, 36, of Santa Monica was arrested Saturday
after an intense U.S. Coast Guard search found the body of his
wife, FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said Sunday.
   Roston was taken into custody when the cruise ship Star Dancer
docked in Los Angeles Harbor and was being held without bail at the
Terminal Island federal prison. Reagan said he couldn't release
details of what led to Roston's arrest.
   The cause of death of Karen Roston, 26, was to be determined by
autopsy, said San Diego County coroner's office spokesman Robert
Grubb.
   The couple were married Feb. 6 just before embarking on a
honeymoon cruise along the Mexican coast with 731 other passengers,
the ship's staff captain said.
   Roston told authorities that high winds blew his wife off the
deck near the ship's jogging track, but ``the winds were not that
strong,'' Capt. Thomas Wildung said.
   Chief Purser Ken Ehlers said the track closed at 9 p.m. and he
never heard the couple running, though the track is over his room.
   ``This woman was happy,'' Ehlers said. ``She must have woke up
Friday morning thinking how happy she was to be on her honeymoon,
on a cruise. She had no idea she would die ... and now she's gone.''
   Passenger Dick Heinrich, an assistant chief deputy at the Cook
County Sheriff's Department in Chicago, said of the Rostons, ``They
seemed to be enjoying each other. They had a cake delivered to
their table and everyone sang `Happy Honeymoon to You.'''
   ``No one knows what really happened,'' Wildung said. ``No one
heard anything. The husband reported the accident. There were minor
marks on his neck, but it's very difficult to tell how they got
there. He said he got them when he tried to rescue his wife.''
   The woman was reported overboard about 2 a.m. Saturday when the
ship was about 44 miles southwest of San Diego, Coast Guard Petty
Officer Don Roberts said.
   The Coast Guard said it immediately began a search, using a
cutter, a helicopter and a jet.
   The Star Dancer, a Bahamas-registered ship owned by Admiral
Cruises of Miami, Fla., had also searched for the body, but the
master of the vessel and the Bahamian government requested that the
FBI investigate the death, said Coast Guard Lt. Andy Czapowskyj.
   ``They had some suspicion that there may have been some foul
play involved,'' he said.
   The FBI has jurisdiction when crimes are committed against
Americans on the high seas in international waters.

<TEXT>
   Beirut's leftist daily newspaper As-Safir
today published Valentine's Day greetings addressed to American
hostage Terry Anderson and other foreign captives.
   In a front-page report, the newspaper said:
   ``The senders wish their messages would reach the hostages and
that the captors will see them and free the captives whose parents
and friends are waiting impatiently for their release.''
   As-Safir said its staff joins the senders' appeal for the
release of the 22 foreign captives believed held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem extremists. In addition, two Scandinavians were
recently kidnapped in south Lebanon, but they are believed held by
Palestinian gunmen who do not belong to any PLO faction.
   Most of the 150 messages the newspaper received Sunday were
adressed to Anderson, the longest-held foreigner. Anderson, 40, of
Lorain, Ohio, is chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   One message came from Anderson's sister, Peggy Say of Batavia,
N.Y. It said, ``Terry, we love you so much and we'll never give up
the fight for your freedom.''
   In a video-taped message released by his captors on Christmas
eve, Anderson said he had seen some Christmas cards sent to him
printed in As-Safir and the independent newspaper An-Nahar.
   Other Valentine cards were addressed to other hostages,
including Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite. Waite, 48, personal
emissary of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most Rev. Robert
Runcie, vanished after leaving a west Beirut hotel Jan. 20, 1987,
for a meeting with the captors of Anderson and another American
hostage, Thomas Sutherland of Fort Collins, Colo.
   Sutherland, 55, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was abducted June 9, 1985.
   There are eight Americans among the foreigners missing in
Lebanon.

   An assistant principal shot in the

   Nancy Blackwelder, 35, an assistant principal shot in the

well-wishers have sent nearly 40 plants and vases of flowers.
   ``It only hurts when I move,'' she said this weekend. ``We're

<HEAD>Battle Along Thailand-Laos Border Reflects Deeper Tensions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Laos and pro-Western Thailand
say they are fighting a border war to win a remote jungle area they
consider sacred.
   But the conflict that began in November appears to reflect
deeper tensions fueled by centuries of enmity and more recent
quarrels related to the flight of refugees, guerrilla warfare and
smugglers' quarrels.
   The periodic confrontations on the 1,000-mile frontier are
smaller than the battles being fought on the Thai-Cambodian border
between China-supplied Cambodian guerrillas and Soviet-backed
Vietnamese.
   Still, there has been no lack of drama and violence at Thailand
border with Laos. More than 300,000 refugees have fled into
Thailand, including thousands of Hmong tribesmen who once fought
for the United States.
   In 1984, Thailand and Laos fought _ on land and in the United
Nations _ over three border villages. Shootouts along the Mekong
River, which forms much of the boundary line, are common.
   In the most recent trouble, which began in November and has been
steadily escalating, the two sides accuse each other of trying to
grab a sparsely populated area astride Thailand's Phitsanulok
province and Sayaboury province in Laos. The Laotians claim 50
square miles of disputed territory.
   Several hundred troops on both sides have been reported killed
and wounded in the fighting, the largest such engagement since the
Laotian communists seized power 12 years ago.
   Artillery barrages, infantry attacks and the downing of at least
one Thai warplane by a Soviet surface-to-air missile have been
described in official accounts by the two countries.
   Today, Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda announced that a Laotian
military team would arrive in Bangkok on Tuesday for talks on
ending the border battles. But he played down expectations for a
solution.
   Since the 1975 communist takeover in Laos, both sides have taken
some steps toward peaceful coexistence.
   In 1979, they pledged to turn the Mekong into ``a river of
genuine peace.'' But the poorly demarcated river and land boundary
is itself a key source of friction. Both countries pull out
conflicting maps, some dating back to the early 1900s, to prove
their claims to disputed territory.
   Mutual suspicions are heightened by the activities of
anti-communist Laotian guerrillas.
   The Vientiane government claims they operate from Thai soil,
drawing recruits from among the 75,000 refugees still in camps near
the frontier. In turn, Laos provided support for Thailand's now
impotent communist insurgency.
   Lucrative two-way smuggling of items such as water buffalo,
marijuana and consumer goods also have led to disputes that
escalated into armed clashes.
   Although Thailand denies Laotian accusations that the ongoing
fighting was sparked by illegal log poaching by senior Thai army
officers, cases of corrupt dealings invovling Thai or Laotian
officials have surfaced in the past.
   In legal trade, landlocked Laos has tried to decrease its once
nearly total dependence on the Thais for the transit of imports and
exports by opening up transport routes to ports in Vietnam. But a
quarter of all official imports still pass through Thailand, which
prohibits passage of 61 ``strategic goods'' including bicycles,
some medicines and building material.
   The list was reduced from more than 200 items a year ago.
   MacAllister Brown, a U.S. political scientist, wrote recently:
   ``Thailand controls three instruments that can seriously hamper
the development of Laos: the reception of refugees and economic
migrants from Laos, the tolerance of and cooperation with armed
resistance elements, and the ban on transit to Laos of `strategic
goods.'''
   Although the two countries are very similar in language, culture
and ethnic origin, the Laotians have been controlled by the Thais
and the Vietnamese, from the 15th century until France colonized
the area in the late 19th century.
   Vientiane, a royal capital, was brutally sacked by the Thais in
1827.
   ``For nearly eight centuries the Thai authorities continuously
pursued an expansionist and hegemonist policy, carried out tens of
atrocious aggressive wars...,'' said a Laotian government position
paper published in 1984.
   In recent decades, Thailand has grown into an economically
strong nation of 53 million, while colonial repression, war and
mismanagement by the communists has relegated Laos, with barely
four million people, into the ranks of the world's poorest
countries.
   These differences tend to increase Laotians' resentment at being
depicted by the Thais as their ``little brothers.''

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell slightly against most major
currencies in light European trading this morning as dealers
reported some profit-taking.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement that the
Japanese trade surplus had narrowed sharply to $3.072 billion in
January from $8.601 billion in December had reinforced the market's
more positive recent view of the dollar.
   However, dealers said a national holiday in the United States
and a holiday in the northern part of West Germany meant trading
would be limited and they predicted little movement for the dollar.
   ``The Japanese trade figures were very promising, even if not
exceptional,'' said one trader with a major Italian commercial bank
in Milan. ``But they solidified the feeling that the dollar may
have turned the corner.''
   But dealers also warned that in such a thin market, any
profit-taking would exaggerate rate movements.
   ``There are no other factors except profit-taking that could
send the dollar lower,'' said a trader at a major West German bank
in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 131.00. Later, in London, it was
quoted lower at 130.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates:
   _ 1.7090 West German marks, down from 1.7123
   _ 1.4047 Swiss francs, down from 1.4065
   _ 5.7710 French francs, down from 5.7865
   _ 1.9165 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9225
   _ 1,257.50 Italian lire, down from 1,260.75
   _ 1.2660 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2624
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7450 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7401 on Friday.
   Gold was little changed from Friday's prices, but lower than its
opening levels. Dealers said it was pressured by light
profit-taking.
   Bullion markets in Hong Kong were closed for the Chinese New
Year.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $446.70 a troy ounce, up
from Friday's late bid of $443.00. But it fell back at mid-morning
today when the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $443.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $443.30, down from $443.50 late
Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.34 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Friday.

<TEXT>
   Nora Astorga, the nation's U.N.
ambassador and a heroine of the Sandinista revolution, died of
cancer in Managua, the government announced. She was 39.
   During the revolution, Ms. Astorga gained fame for luring a top
general into her bedroom, where he was killed by rebels. In 1984,
the Reagan administration rejected her as Nicaragua's ambassador to
the United States.
   Ms. Astorga, who died Sunday, was a lawyer and a member of the
Sandinista Assembly, one of the leftist movement's highest
consultative bodies.
   She had returned home from New York early last month because of
her illness and was living on a small farm near the capital until
Sunday, the government said in a communique.
   The ambassador ``will be rendered all the honors of a heroine of
both the fatherland and the revolution in her funeral,'' the
communique added. It did not say when the ceremony will be held.
   In a separate communique, the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front, of which Ms. Astorga had been a member since
1969, said she ``took a heroic part in the struggle to overthrow
the dictatorship'' of President Anastasio Somoza, whose family was
in power for 42 years.
   She was awarded the Sandinistas' highest decoration for her role
in the struggle that brought them to power in 1979. The Sandinista
communique called her ``an efficient and disciplined revolutionary
worker.''
   Julio Icaza, Nicaragua's deputy representative to the United
Nations, is serving as acting ambassador, said a spokesman for
Agendas International Inc., a New York-based public relations
company representing the government.
   In Managua in 1978, Ms. Astorga induced Gen. Reynaldo Perez
Vega, deputy commander of the National Guard, into her bedroom,
where anti-government guerrillas cut his throat.
   Ms. Astorga said Sandinista accomplices tried to subdue Perez
Vega, but that when he resisted, they killed him. The original plan
was to kidnap Perez Vega and release him in exchange for 59
Sandinista prisoners, she said.
   In 1984, the United States rejected her as the proposed
ambassador to the United States. She held the rank of deputy
foreign minister at the time.
   U.S. officials said the Reagan administration regarded her as
unsuitable in view of her involvement in the slaying of Perez Vega.
She was appointed ambassador to the United Nations in February 1986.
   Before the revolution, Ms. Astorga earned a doctorate in law at
the Catholic University in Managua, and directed legal and
personnel matters for an engineering firm there. She also studied
at Catholic University in Washington and was fluent in English and
Italian.
   After the overthrow of Somoza, Ms. Astorga became a special
minister of justice for the trials of former members of the
National Guard.
   In an April 10, 1987 speech to the American Society of Newspaper
Editors in San Francisco, she talked about the problems between
Nicaragua and the White House, which has supported the Contra
rebels in their six-year battle against the Sandinistas.
   She said relations were poor because of a ``theory of domination
that says that a small, poor, underdeveloped country has to depend
on one of the two superpowers.''
   Decades of dependency on the United States, she said, had
brought Nicaragua poverty and ``the most cruel dictatorship in
Latin America. ... So we are not willing to do that again.''
   Ms. Astorga represented Nicaragua in deliberations of the
Contadora group, which attempted to end insurgencies in Nicaragua,
El Salvador and Guatemala. She also headed Nicaraguan delegations
to international women's conferences in Denmark and Kenya, the 1985
Latin American Economic System in Caracas, Venezuela, and the Latin
America Economic Conference in Quito, Ecuador in 1984.
   She was married twice and had four children.

   Valentine's Day sprints by all too quickly
for some lovers, but Peter and Maryellen Polichetti were prepared
to make it a marathon.
   The couple from nearby Lewisville took a week's vacation to
compete in the 1988 Great Dallas Kiss-Off, mindful that it took
them 58{ hours last year to win the marathon kissing contest.
   But the Polichettis licked this year's competition in just 4{
hours when the couple's most serious challengers had to leave to
relieve their babysitter early Sunday morning.
   ``I couldn't believe that it would end so quickly,'' said Peter
Polichetti, 38. He and his wife, Maryellen, 39, won a vacation in
Jamaica for their latest victory, which involves continuous kissing
except for short breaks every hour.
   Nine of the 14 couples who registered for the Valentine's Day
contest, which raises funds for the American Heart Association,
decided not compete after learning that the reigning champs had
taken a week's vacation for the same purpose.
   Hank Zecca, Peter Polichetti's employer at an area construction
company, and his wife Vickie proved to be the most serious
competition for the Polichettis.
   ``Our big thing was we didn't want them to win it in an hour,''
said Zecca, 38. ``We thought we'd put up a little token resistance.
It got to be around 1:30 (a.m.) and we said we have to go home for
the kids.''

   At age 70, an Illinois woman says she's
seen it all as a former truck driver, waitress and restaurant
owner. Now she's letting customers see it all _ or almost _ as a
stripper.
   The 5-foot-2, 147-pound Decatur woman, who calls herself Fleta
and performs for Especially for You Dancing Strip-O-Gram, takes off
her feather boa, sleeves, fur-throated elastic top and shimmies out
of a ruffled skirt to music from the 1920s.
   She ends her seven-minute act clad in a black leotard and mesh
stockings.
   ``I enjoy it. If I didn't like it, I wouldn't do it,'' says
Fleta, who refused to give her last name during a recent interview
with the Decatur Herald and Review. She has entertained at more
than a dozen parties in her budding four-month career.
   Fleta's new career got started by accident when she was keeping
house for Strip-O-Gram's owner, Marilyn Bernhardt.
   ``At first Fleta objected, but she changed her mind when I told
her she would get $20,'' Bernhardt said. ``She can Charleston a
whole nine yards and has great looking legs.''

   The London Zoo has appointed an entertainment
director for its caged creatures, reasoning that bored animals are
boring to watch.
   Among the projects he'll consider to amuse and stimulate the
animals are:
   _ showers for pigs and apes and food dispensers for fish and
other animals which they can operate themselves;
   _ musical keyboards on which orangutans can practice;
   _ a playback tape for gibbons to recreate the duets they enact
in the wild and an artificial termite mound for chimpanzees.
   David Shepherdson is the first Behavioral Enrichment Research
Fellow appointed by the 162-year-old Zoological Society that runs
the zoo and the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.
   The federation said today that Shepherdson is charged with
``developing and assessing devices to enrich the animals'
environment and to reduce abnormal behavior associated with
captivity.''
   Shepherdson, 29, attended Sussex University where he studied the
behavior of badgers in the wild.
   ``There has been very little research into the problems suffered
by animals in captivity,'' he said.
   The federation said: ``To give animals freedom to exercise their
instincts and their intuitive powers not only increases their
contentment but also adds to the enjoyment and appreciation of
visitors.''

<HEAD>Court Records: Ray Brother Suffers From AIDS-Related Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of three brothers who were banned from
school because they had been exposed to the AIDS virus has
developed AIDS-related complex, but his doctor says he can remain
active.
   Ricky Ray, 11, does not have a severe or life-threatening
illness stemming from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said
Jerry Barbosa, a specialist in pediatric hemotology and oncology at
All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg. ``Ricky's ARC is stable
and he is showing no signs of progession,'' said Barbosa. ``He
never posed a threat (of spreading the AIDS virus) in the past, and
he doesn't pose a threat to anyone in the present.''
   ``If anything, Ricky is feeling better,'' Barbosa said. ``He's
full of energy.''
   Ricky's brothers, 10-year-old Robert and 8-year-old Randy,
remain in good health, Barbosa said. All three are hemophiliacs.
   Gail Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta, said a patient who has ARC does not necessarily
develop AIDS, a fatal disease that destroys the body's immune
system.
   ARC is caused by the AIDS virus and has a specific set of
symptoms, Barbosa said. Those symptoms, often less severe than
symptoms of AIDS, may include weight loss, loss of appetite, fever,
night sweats, skin rashes, diarrhea, tiredness, lack of resistance
to infection or swollen lymph nodes.
   The AIDS virus is transmitted by sexual contact, sharing
intravenous needles or by receiving a transfusion of infected
blood. Doctors believe the Ray brothers were injected with tainted
plasma-based medication they received to clot their blood.
   Information about Ricky's condition came seven weeks after it
first was reported that he was taking AZT, a drug approved for the
treatment of AIDS.
   The boys' medical records are on public file as part of a
lawsuit filed against the DeSoto County School Board by their
parents, Louise and Clifford Ray. Barbosa filed the latest test
results in court Friday.
   The doctor said he prescribed AZT because early use of the drug
should increase the chance of retarding ARC symptoms.
   The Ray brothers were banned from regular classes in DeSoto
County in August 1986 after they tested positive for AIDS
antibodies. A federal judge ordered their return to the classroom.
   Less than a week after they started school last fall, a fire
destroyed the Rays' home. Authorities ruled the fire arson but no
arrests have been made.
   The Rays moved to Sarasota, where the boys now attend school.

   Flooding on major French waterways has paralyzed
river traffic, inundated some homes and submerged the Seine River
expressway.
   About 800 barges on the Seine, Marne, Yonne and Sambre rivers
were unablie to operate in ``the biggest crisis since 1982,'' the
Boatmen's Union said today.
   The state Bridges and Roads department last week prohibited
barge traffic on the Seine where the high water level made it
impossible for many barges to pass under the bridges of Paris.
   The water level, swelled by unusually high rainfall, has been
rising for the past two weeks, washing out the expressway that runs
along the Seine in central Paris.
   The River Brigade said the Seine water level Monday morning had
exceeded 16.5 feet. An alert is given when the water level hits
five meters or 16.4 feet, the level reached in 1982.
   Water was rising above the haunches of the zouave, the statue of
an infantryman in oriental dress at the foot of the Alma Bridge
near the Eiffel Tower.
   In 1910 the Seine lapped at the zouave's chin in the worst
flooding this century.
   About 100 homes were flooded in Villeneuve-Saint George, in the
Val de Marne region east of Paris, and eight villages were
inundated in the Essonne region, authorities said.
   Small boats have been relaying bread and mail to flooded
communities.
   The Boatmen's Union said the loss to bargeowners, who transport
things like sand, coal and even cars, would be ``important,'' but
could not estimate a figure.

Essay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association will challenge
any subpoena demanding the identity of a doctor who wrote a
controversial essay on a purported mercy killing, the association's
top lawyer said.
   A Cook County grand jury reportedly has subpoenaed the
manuscript of the Jan. 8 article in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, in which a doctor described injecting a fatal
dose of morphine into a young woman suffering from ovarian cancer.
   The AMA's general counsel, Kirk Johnson, has said that while he
would honor a court order demanding the documents, the association
would challenge subpoenas under First Amendment protection.
   Dr. George Lundberg, the journal's editor, said that he has not
received a subpoena. A spokesman for the state's attorney's office,
Terry Levin, would not comment on any reported grand jury action.
   The Chicago Sun-Times said Sunday the grand jury has requested
any in-house memos about the essay and minutes from editorial staff
meetings linked to the article as well as the cover letter sent by
the doctor and the original manuscript.
   AMA officials said they did not verify the purported mercy
killing but believed it was based on fact. They said the author
requested anonymity.
   There has been speculation by outsiders that the article, titled
``It's Over, Debbie,'' was a hoax.
   The essay describes how an exhausted gynecology resident gave a
fatal injection to a patient he had never seen before.
   The essay has sparked debate about the ethics of euthanasia,
which editor Lundberg said was the purpose of publishing it.
   State's Attorney Richard M. Daley became involved because the
Journal and the AMA are based in Chicago. The essay did not
indicate where the author lived or where the purported incident
took place.

<HEAD>Town Plans Celebration For Presidents' Day</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs lead and overline to fix style on Presidents' Day.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GEORGE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's Presidents' Day and time for a party
in this central Washington town.
   George's 260 people planned a community lunch complete with
birthday cake, children's games and a lengthy bingo session.
   ``It's a big deal,'' said Winnie Davey, of the George Exxon
service station, which is running a special on packaged cherry pies
today. ``The whole community is involved.''
   George, located near the Columbia River, was apparently named
after the first president, although some people assert that the
town was actually named after a dog belonging to one of the
founders.
   ``You shouldn't believe everything you hear,'' said Ms. Davey,
which may be a sad commentary on the day celebrating the birth of a
man who could not tell a lie.
   But there is no doubt the town has taken much of its identity
from George Washington and the symbols surrounding him.
   For instance, many streets are named after types of cherries,
including Royal Anne, Montmorency and Bing, said Ms. Davey.
   Businesses have names like the Martha Inn, the Colonial Market
and the Cherry Tree.
   A highlight of today's activities at the community center will
be an 18-square-foot birthday cake in the shape of a mountain with
George Washington's face drawn on it, said Glenda Jenkins,
president of the organizing group known as the Georgettes.
   ``The theme is George Washington's head on Mount Rushmore,'' she
said of the cake, which she believes will feed 1,000 people,
although about 800 showed up last year.
   George actually throws a bigger celebration, including a parade,
during the Fourth of July, because the weather is better, said
Carol Michael, another organizer.

   With shamrocks on the shutters and Grecian columns
at the entrance, the house that once belonged to the late Mayor
James Michael Curley is for sale.
   The 18-room house has three full and two half-baths, a
three-story circular staircase, and a heated garage. Sophie Tucker,
Rodgers and Hammerstein, Eleanor Roosevelt and Madame Chiang
Kai-Shek all have visited the house, said Francis Curley, the sole
survivor of the mayor's nine children.
   Curley, 64, said he can remember the Vienna Boys Choir lined up
on the curved staircase, singing to the accompaniment of a piano
and string quartet.
   His family had owned the house for more than 40 years when they
sold it to the Roman Catholic Church for $60,000 in 1956. The
Oblate Fathers have lived there since but find the upkeep too much
and plan to auction the house April 23. They hope to receive about
$2 million.
   Curley said the Oblate provincial invited him for dinner
recently. It was his first visit back in over 30 years.
   ``There are just too many ghosts,'' he said. ``There had been
nine kids there, and the house used to be filled with people
constantly.''
   Curley was first elected mayor of Boston in 1914 and served four
terms, the last one 1946-50. He also was a member of the U.S. House
and governor of Massachusetts.
   In 1938, he was fined $30,000 in a fraud case and thousands of
people donated money to help pay the fine. He was convicted in a
mail fraud case in 1947 while serving as mayor and sent to prison,
where he served five months.
   President Harry S. Truman pardoned him in 1950. He died in 1958.

   An explosion blew a hole in a ferryboat
at Limassol today as it was being readied to carry Palestinian
deportees on a PLO-sponsored protest voyage to Israel, a Palestine
Liberation Organization official said.
   A man claiming to speak for the Jewish Defense League said the
U.S.-based group was ``responsible for bombing the ship at
Limassol.''
   ``This is only a warning. Next time we will bomb it with all the
people on it,'' he said in a telephone call to The Associated Press
in Nicosia. The man spoke English with an American accent and the
call sounded long-distance. But he would not say where he was
calling from.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   When asked if the JDL also was responsible for the killing of
three PLO officers in Limassol on Sunday, he said: ``No comment,''
and quickly hung up.
   The JDL was founded in the early 1960s by Meir Kahane, now a
member of the Israeli parliament and head of extremist, anti-Arab
Kach Party. Both Kach and the JDL espouse violence in the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   There was no way to verify the identity of the purported JDL
spokesman or to authenticate the claim.
   In Jerusalem, Kahane spokesman Baruch Marzel told the AP, ``I
think this is a great act to sanctify the Lord. This is an
excellent deed and I bless the people who did it.''
   Asked whether the JDL bombed the ship, Marzel said he could not
comment on such issues. He said Kahane was abroad and could not be
reached for comment.
   Cypriot security sources, insisting on anonymity, said the PLO
men killed in a car-bombing in Limassol had been negotiating for
the boat.
   The slain officials were identified as Mohammed Sultan; Mohammed
Buheis, also known as Abu Hassan Kassem; and Marwan Kayyali.
   Limassol port manager John Jijis, interviewed by Israel radio,
said the craft, the 6,151-ton Sol Phryne, formerly sailed between
Limassol and Haifa, Israel. He said it was bought on Saturday but
``definitely not (by the) PLO.''
   He said the explosion occurred ``at about a quarter to six this
morning ... There will be ... an underwater survey to find out
exactly what happened, how big a hole there is and what repairs may
be necessary.''
   One PLO official, who spoke in Nicosia on condition of
anonymity, told the AP: ``We are waiting for a decision by the
(PLO) command. We have to see if there is an alternative ship for
the voyage.''
   PLO officials in Athens, Greece, confirmed the vessel they had
planned to use on the voyage to Israel was damaged by a bomb in
Cyprus.
   The PLO had tried to launch the voyage from Greece, but it was
repeatedly delayed. Before today's explosion, the PLO had ordered
the 130 Palestinian deportees and hundreds of observers and
reporters that had planned to make the voyage to gather at Athens
Airport to fly to Cyprus.
   After the blast, PLO officials stopped some reporters from
boarding the plane to Cyprus, where the voyage was due to start
tonight.
   PLO officials blamed Israel for the car-bomb killings and also
linked the attack to the PLO's efforts to find a vessel for the
voyage to Israel.
   ``Israel started this open war after losing the secret war
concerning the ship,'' the PLO's chief spokesman, Bassam Abu
Sharif, said in Athens.
   The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the
Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned
back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to Palestine.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials had no immediate comment on the
ferryboat explosion, but Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel
had decided, within the framework of various constraints, not to
let the PLO ship reach Israeli shores, Israel army radio said.
   Rabin, speaking before the report of the explosion, said Israel
would stop the boat ``in the ways it sees suitable,'' the radio
said.
   The ship's captain, Cleanthis Vlahopoulos, a Greek from Athens,
told reporters at Limassol that he heard ``a loud bang at about
5.30 a.m.''
   The crew, he said, quickly abandoned the vessel, which began
taking on water. ``The boat was shaking and then it listed,'' he
said. The crewmen later returned to the vessel.
   Cypriot authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the 40-year-old ferryboat was the only ship presently in Cyprus
that would have been suitable for the voyage trip to Israel.
   The PLO voyage, called the ``Ship of Return,'' was designed to
focus condemnation of Israel's policy of deporting Palestinians
from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, seized from Jordan and
Egypt in 1967.
   The deportees includes taxi drivers, laborers, a university
professor, an Anglican bishop, several mayors and city council
members.
   The voyage was supposed to end in Haifa, but Israeli officials
have said they will refuse to let the vessel enter their waters.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has condemned the voyage,
saying it was ``a declaration of war.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Noriega's American lawyers, maintaining
U.S. drug trafficking charges against the Panamanian military
leader are politically motivated, said they would seek a dismissal
of the indictment this week.
   Lawyer Raymond Takiff said Sunday that the defense team would
meet Tuesday with prosecutors but refused to say why.
   He also said he would seek access to the minutes of the Miami
grand jury that indicted Noriega, Panama's military leader and de
facto ruler.
   ``General Noriega told us that he has always been a friend of
the United States and is still a friend of the United States,''
Takiff said Sunday after arriving at Miami International Airport.
   He had been consulting with Noriega about the federal
indictments handed up earlier this month in Tampa and Miami. Takiff
shrugged off a key witness' testimony against Noriega.
   Jose Blandon, the former Panamanian consul general in New York,
``wants to be the next president of Panama,'' Takiff said.
   Blandon, who was fired in January, testified before the Miami
federal grand jury and before a U.S. congressional subcommittee
about Noriega's alleged involvement in cocaine trafficking.
   He also said the CIA had provided Noriega with confidential
information on Sens. Edward Kennedy and Jesse Helms, which the CIA
denied.
   The defense team has ``material which portrays the long and
intricate involvement of Jose Blandon ... with the Communist Party
in both Panama and Puerto Rico,'' Takiff claimed.
   Noriega's lawyers also claimed their client has information that
could influence the U.S. presidential election.
   ``We were given access by General Noriega to files which contain
political dynamite _ files which could affect the upcoming
presidential election in the United States and the positions of
other nations,'' said Takiff, who refused to elaborate.
   ``Right now, we're just going to sit tight with them (the
files). If we have to use them, we'll use them,'' vowed defense
lawyer Frank Rubino.

<TEXT>
   A comet slamming into Earth may have triggered a
yearlong storm of acid rain as poisonous as battery acid that
killed off dinosaurs and other creatures, a scientist says.
   Animals deep in their burrows and creatures living in lakes with
limestone bottoms might have been among the few survivors of the
catastrophic collision 65 million years ago, according to a theory
outlined by Ronald G. Prinn of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   The new theory is a variation on a hotly debated hypothesis that
an asteroid from space doomed the dinosaurs.
   Prinn suggests that a large comet _ one that makes Halley's
comet look like ``a little speck of sand'' _ struck the Earth with
1 million times more force than the world's entire nuclear arsenal.
   ``This would be a very unusual event, something that might
happen once in a billion years,'' Prinn said Sunday at a meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   The idea that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs was first
proposed in 1980 by physicist Luis Alvarez and his son Walter, a
geologist. They said that dust and soot thrown into the air would
have blocked out the sunlight. Temperatures would have plummeted,
and many animals, including the dinosaurs, would have frozen to
death.
   Prinn noted that while there was a large extinction, not all
animals fared equally badly. The great land reptiles and many kinds
of sea life were decimated, but many mammals and plants survived
reasonably well. He said his acid rain theory may explain ``the
peculiar selectivity of the extinctions.''
   Since limestone would neutralize the acid, fish in limestone
lakes might have lived. Hibernating animals deep in burrows might
also have waited out the worst of the acid rain storm, and eggs
laid in the ground could also have survived.
   Plants would have been killed, but their seeds remained to
sprout after the acid storm cleared. However, plant-eating animals,
such as large dinosaurs, would have starved to death or been
asphyxiated.
   Prinn theorized that all calcium-containing ocean animals down
to a depth of about 500 feet would have been annihilated. Deeper
sea creatures would have survived, as would those with skeletons of
silica.
   Many scientists doubt that something from space caused the
massive destruction of species. They note that dinosaurs and other
long-gone creatures died out over many centuries, not all at once,
so a single catastrophe cannot be the culprit.
   David Raup of the University of Chicago argued that there have
been many extinctions over the eons, but only one has been shown to
have occurred about the same time as an apparent heavenly
collision. He said this might simply have been a coincidence.
   Others have suggested that gigantic volcanic eruptions were to
blame for the mysterious extinctions.
   Prinn theorizes that when the comet hit, it blasted out a
crater, spewing water and rock into the air at supersonic speeds,
suddenly heating the atmosphere to enormous temperatures. The heat
made oxygen and nitrogen in the air combine to form nitric acid,
which rained on Earth for a year.

<HEAD>China Criticizes U.S. Policy; Chinese Congress Shows Rare Clout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Chinese foreign affairs expert today
criticized the United States for what he said was interference in
China's internal affairs.
   Huan Xiang, director of the Center for International Studies
under the State Council, condemned the U.S. Congress for its
support of Tibet's exiled religious leader, the Dalai Lama, and its
criticism of China's handling of pro-independence unrest in Tibet.
   Huan, writing in today's edition of the authoritative weekly
Beijing Review, also criticized Congress for passing a resolution
in support of Taiwan independence and denied that China supplies
Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran.
   ``Some people in the political and press circles in the United
States have a very strong sense of national chauvinism, believing
they have the monopoly on truth without considering the changing
world situation and the interests of other countries,'' Huan said.
   Anti-Chinese Protests in Tibet late last year left at least 14
people dead and dozens injured as Tibetan monks battled Chinese
security forces.
   Meanwhile, in the central province of Shanxi, delegates to a
provincial legislature have called for an investigation of a top
legal official in an unprecedented display of their powers, an
official report said today.
   Eighty-six delegates to the Shanxi People's Congress signed a
motion to oust the procurator general, one of the province's top
legal officials, for incompetence, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   ``It is the first time such a high-ranking official has been
subjected to the scrutiny of the deputies,'' Xinhua said.
   But the motion was defeated by a majority of delegates who voted
to allow the procurator general, who was unnamed, to keep his post
while the congress investigates the case. Xinhua did not say when
the vote took place or what the count was.
   The official was accused of failing to act according to the law
and mishandling a number of cases.
   People's congresses serve as legislative bodies at all levels of
government in China, from the municipal to the national. Citizens
actually elect delegates to only the lowest-level local committees,
which in turn send delegates to higher congresses.
   The congresses long have been rubber-stamp bodies, with real
power concentrated in the hands of the Communist Party. In the past
year, however, the official media have portrayed them as having a
larger role under political reforms intended to separate the party
from government functions.

<HEAD>Former Minister Searching for New Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former minister Walker Railey says the peace he
sought by moving to San Francisco has eluded him as questions
persist about the near-fatal strangling attack on his wife.
   Railey says he is weary and resentful of the scrutiny of his
private life, attention which grew after his in-laws filed a civil
lawsuit accusing him of attacking Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey.
   ``I'm kind of between the devil and the deep blue sea,'' Railey
told the Dallas Morning News in an interview published Sunday.
   ``And in a situation like that, it's hard to know what is the
best, most honest and responsible way to respond,'' said the former
senior minister at the First United Methodist Church.
   Railey has told police he found his 39-year-old wife, strangled
nearly to death the night of April 21, 1987, in the garage of their
home. Mrs. Railey is now comatose in nursing home.
   On Feb. 2, Railey's in-laws filed a lawsuit that accused Railey
of maliciously and knowingly trying to choke his wife to death. The
petition seeks unspecified damages to cover Mrs. Railey's past and
future pain, suffering and anguish from the attack.
   Railey says he is innocent, and police have not filed charges.
   In November, Railey moved to San Francisco after giving
guardianship of his wife to her parents and custody of his two
children to friends. Since the lawsuit was filed, he has stayed in
hotels and with friends instead of his apartment, saying he is
trying to avoid reporters and photographers.
   In the interview, Railey refused to give an account of his
actions on April 21.
   ``I get the impression that most people's minds have been made
up a fairly long time. I give the press credit for that. I was
tried and convicted by the public media very early,'' he told the
newspaper.
   Railey also declined to discuss his relationship with
psychologist Lucy Papillon, who told a grand jury she had dated
Railey and who jointly signed the one-year lease on Railey's San
Francisco apartment.
   The former minister said he sought job opportunities and a
chance to regroup emotionally when he moved to San Francisco.
   He said he is living off savings and from his share of equity
from the sale of the Dallas house that he shared with Mrs. Railey
and their two children.

<HEAD>Talks Stalled On Merger Of Rival Opposition Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition party today urged
rival leader Kim Dae-jung to step down to pave the way for a merger
of South Korea's splintered anti-government factions.
   Lawmakers in the Reunification Democratic Party harshly
denounced Kim after his breakaway Party for Peace and Democracy
boycotted a joint meeting to discuss the proposed merger.
   The parties remain at odds over the issue of rewriting election
laws, with the Reunification Democratic Party favoring a system in
which up to three lawmakers would represent each district.
   Party for Peace lawmakers boycotted the meeting after demanding
that a resolution endorsing a system of one lawmaker per
constituency precede other items on the agenda.
   Reunification Democratic Party lawmakers insisted the two
parties first solve thorny issues involving basic rules, such as
power sharing, to accelerate the merger.
   Reunification spokesman Kim Tae-ryong urged Kim Dae-jung to step
down immediately to take ``political and moral responsibility,''
and denounced his reluctance to compromise on the unification.
   In a surprise move Feb. 8, Kim Young-sam resigned as president
of the Reunification Democratic Party, saying he wanted to help
unite the opposition. His resignation put strong pressure on Kim
Dae-jung to do likewise, but he refused to step down.
   Supporters have urged the opposition to field united candidates
to regain public confidence and defeat the governing Democratic
Justice Party in the National Assembly elections in April.
   Roh Tae-woo, the government's candidate hand-picked by outgoing
President Chun Doo-hwan, won the presidential election in December
after Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam split the opposition vote.
   The opposition's failure to field one candidate in presidential
election is believed to have caused its defeat.

<TEXT>
   Rutgers University has banned
fraternity and sorority parties pending an investigation into the
death of a freshman after a drinking party, officials said.
   Middlesex County Prosecutor Alan A. Rockoff said he will meet
with investigators Tuesday to determine if charges will be filed in
the death of James C. Callahan, 18, of North Bergen.
   Callahan died Friday after a pledging ceremony at Lambda Chi
Alpha and a celebration in which a ``tremendous amount'' of liquor
was consumed, Rockoff said.
   An autopsy Saturday indicated fluid and congestion in Callahan's
lungs led to circulatory and respiratory failure, but did not
determine if alcohol played a part in his death, Rockoff said.
   Rutgers administrators on Saturday told fraternities and
sororities to cancel parties and closed Lambda Chi Alpha pending
results of the investigation of Callahan's death, a school
spokeswoman said Sunday.
   Another student who attended the party said pledges were told by
fraternity members ``to drink until you were sick,'' according to a
published report.
   John Deliso told The Central New Jersey Home News of New
Brunswick fraternity members ``kind of had bags on'' to catch vomit.
   Deliso was treated for several hours at St. Peter's Medical
Center for an alcohol-related illness following the party.
   Rockoff has said that although drinking was not mandatory, many
participants were under the state's legal drinking age of 21.
   Callahan and 13 other students were invited to join the
fraternity during a brief ceremony Thursday night, said Peter
Hendricks, an attorney representing his former fraternity. The
party followed. About 40 students attended, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   A man who shot his estranged
15-year-old wife to death while she was walking home from school
carrying Valentine's Day gifts has died from a self-inflicted
gunshot wound, officials said today.
   Johnny Gallardo, 27, who shot himself once in the temple after
shooting his wife twice in the head Friday, died Sunday at Wilford
Hall Air Force Medical Center, said spokesman Tech Sgt. Lowell Cook.
   Janie Gallardo died shortly shortly after she was shot. The
couple had married in 1986, but had been separated since December.
   Police reports say Gallardo assaulted his wife at school in late
January, and friends said she was also attacked another time near
where she was killed.
   Mrs. Gallardo was carrying a box of Valentine's candy, two
carnations and a small stuffed bear when she was killed.
Authorities speculated Gallardo may have thought someone had given
them to her at Lowell Middle School.
   ``It appears this is what enraged him. It appears it was
jealousy,'' police homicide Detective John Campa said Saturday.
   Mrs. Gallardo did not run when her husband approached, said Lulu
Gamboa, 17, who was walking with Mrs. Gallardo.
   ``Johnny said, `Janie, where did you get those roses?' but Janie
didn't say anything. She just kept walking with her head down,''
Miss Gamboa said Saturday. ``Then he pulled out a gun. I thought he
was just playing because he was smiling, but he shot her and we
ran.''
   Gallardo then shot himself, Campa said.
   Miss Gamboa said the flowers and candy were given to numerous
girls by male classmates at a school party Friday. Mrs. Gallardo's
brother, Santos Arocha, said his sister was allowed to marry at 13
because she kept running away with Gallardo.
   Arocha said she returned to her parents' home in December after
repeated abuse and because she wanted to return to school.
   Arocha said the family had been unable to get a restraining
order against Gallardo after Mrs. Gallardo said she wanted a
divorce.
   Miss Gamboa said Mrs. Gallardo was lonely.
   ``She needed a lot of attention and love and she thought she
would get it from him, but she didn't,'' Miss Gamboa said.

<TEXT>
   Uniformed and plainclothes police today
flooded key sites where dissidents planned demonstrations Tuesday
to mark the anniversary of Lithuania's declaration of independence
after World War I.
   The police, accompanied by citizens' patrols, gathered around
historic and national sites in Vilnius, capital of the Lithuanian
republic.
   An officially sponsored demonstration by workers was arranged
today to protest what the government considers U.S. incitement of
Lithuanian dissidents.
   Vilnius city government recently announced that all
demonstrators must obtain an official permit in advance. City
officials said no one applied for a permit.
   Moscow dissidents, however, said Lithuanian nationalists planned
to lay wreaths Tuesday in Vilnius and Kaunas, the republic's two
largest cities.
   Western reporters were barred from traveling to Lithuania on
their own, but the Foreign Ministry took a group of Moscow-based
foreign correspondents to Vilnius on an organized tour.
   Authorities cut telephones of leading Lithuanian dissidents, and
human rights activists in Moscow said police blockaded the
apartments of some would-be demonstrators in Vilnius.
   Last August, widespread demonstrations marked the 48th
anniversary of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the
Soviet Union that led to the 1940 Soviet takeover of the three
Baltic states, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. The states had a
stormy independence between the two world wars and were occupied at
various times by the Germans, Poles and Russians.
   Moscow dissident Valery Senderov said police began blockading
Lithuanian dissidents' apartments Sunday, preventing them from
attending Catholic church services, which have become an outlet for
expressing opposition to Soviet control over Lithuania.
   Senderov said one whose apartment was surrounded was Nijole
Sadunaite, who spent time in a labor camp for disseminating
religious literature. Sadunaite found a note in his mailbox
warning, ``We shall finish you off,'' Senderov said.
   Senderov and religious activist Alexander Ogorodnikov said they
contacted fellow dissidents in the republic and reported that other
Lithuanians did attend church services Sunday and sang nationalist
hymns. They said police stopped and searched some worshipers as
they returned home after church.

   Two U.S. Navy warships which U.S.
officials said were bumped by Soviet vessels in the Black Sea last
week passed through the Bosporus Strait today bound for the
Mediterranean, port sources reported.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
destroyer Caron and the cruiser Yorktown crossed the Bosporus about
7:30 a.m.
   The ships have to cross the Dardanelles Strait before heading
into the Aegean Sea and then into the Mediterranean.
   The U.S. Defense Department said two Soviet frigates
intentionally bumped the U.S. vessels Friday as they were
conducting routine operations and exercising their internationally
recognized right of innocent passage.
   The Soviets said the collision took place as a result of
``dangerous maneuvers'' by the U.S. warships.

   A 42-year-old French-trained
army officer has been named the new prime minister of Madagascar to
replace Desire Rakotoarijanoa, who asked to be removed from the
post.
   President Didier Ratsiraka named Lt. Col. Victor Ramahatra to
the post during a meeting Friday of the ruling Supreme
Revolutionary Council, the government announced.
   Rakotoarijanoa, 54, who has served as prime minister since 1977,
asked to be removed for reasons of health. He returned to
Madagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean off the southeast coast
of Africa, on Feb. 7, after two months of medical treatment in
Paris.
   No details were provided on the nature of Rakotoarijanoa's
illness.
   The new prime minister has served as minister of public works
since 1982. He studied at universities in Lyon and Paris and took
his military and engineering training at a variety of French
schools.
   His replacement in the public works job is Andrianaivomanana
Razafindramisa, who was the former head of the National Military
Office for Strategic Industries, involved primarily with mineral
production and development of the petroleum industry.
   Madagascar, a French colony until 1960, is made up of
Malaysians, Indonesians, Arabs and African ethnic groups on an
island slightly larger than Texas.

   Britain's foreign secretary told his Soviet
counterpart today that arms reductions between the superpowers
would be unacceptable if they give the Soviets an edge in mobile
nuclear missiles and conventional and chemical weapons.
   Sir Geoffrey Howe said the West wanted to see cuts in those
areas as proof of what Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev calls
``new thinking.''
   ``We in the West will be happier ... when we can point to
concrete evidence that new thinking does in practice make the
Soviet Union an easier neighbor,'' Howe said.
   His remarks were prepared for delivery at a luncheon hosted by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Howe arrived in Moscow on Sunday, met with Shevardnadze today
and planned to speak with Gorbachev Tuesday.
   Howe and Shevardnadze also today planned to sign a memorandum in
which their two countries pledge to work together to curb drug
abuse and trafficking. It is the first accord formalizing drug
cooperation between East and West, British diplomats said.
   In his remarks, Howe said Western Europeans are deeply concerned
about their security now that the United States and Soviet Union
have agreed to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   In advance of Howe's visit, the official news agency Tass said
without elaborating that the British government had taken a
``non-constructive stand on the issue concerning further arms
control measures.''
   Tass also criticized the British government for saying it
supports a ban on chemical weapons but not denouncing the
production of such weapons by the United States.
   The anti-drug agreement says Britain and the Soviet Union should
jointly work to educate people about the evils of illicit drugs and
cooperate in stopping the cultivation and trafficking of narcotics.
   The accord also proposes cooperation in treatment and
rehabilitation of drug addicts and legal cooperation in tracking
suspected drug traffickers.
   Details of the accord were spelled out by a Moscow-based British
diplomat, speaking with The Associated Press on the condition he
not be named.
   The Soviet Union only recently officially admitted having a drug
problem, particularly in the Central Asian republics where the
climate is favorable for growing hashish. Previously, the official
media contended drug abuse was only a Western problem.
   The British government estimates 50,000 Britons are dependent on
heroin, cocaine and other controlled substances not including
marijuana.

   Pat Robertson repeated his claim today that
the Soviets have nuclear missiles in Cuba and Vice President George
Bush said it was an outrageous charge ``designed to scare the
American people.''
   ``I'm confident this is not true,'' Bush said in an interview on
a Manchester radio station today.
   Robertson first made the startling allegation Sunday in a
Republican presidential candidates' debate in Goffstown, N.H. A top
Robertson aide later qualified the claim, saying the former
television evangelist meant missile delivery systems, not warheads
themselves.
   But this morning at a candidate's forum sponsored by the Dover,
N.H., Chamber of Commerce, Robertson said, ``the least we can do in
this is get those nuclear weapons out of Cuba,'' though he conceded
he had ``no first-hand evidence of this.''
   Bush said he could not confirm or deny the claim, but said, ``I
think you'll see it knocked down hard in the next few days.''
   ``This is a very serious allegation,'' he said. ``You keep
hearing these outrageous charges from people, which are designed to
scare the American people.''
   In California, a White House official traveling with President
Reagan said: ``There's no indication of any nuclear missiles or
weapons in Cuba.'' The official spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   The Soviet Union did place missiles in Cuba in 1962, but agreed
to remove them after a tense showdown between Nikita Khrushchev and
President John F. Kennedy that brought the world to the brink of
nuclear war.
   Robertson said this morning he based his claim on testimony by
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   At the League of Women Voters debate he said he obtained his
information from a source in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
he declined to identify.
   Robertson said, ``Some information came to me that the Soviets,
in violation of the so-called Khrushchev-Kennedy accords, have put
some SS-4s and -5s in Cuba, which are intermediate-range nuclear
weapons. And somehow, in all this brilliant negotiation that these
gentlemen are so proud of, they've left that out of the treaty.
   ``It seems like, to me, nukes pointing at the United States are
more vital to our security than nukes pointing to Europe,''
Robertson added.
   The surprised moderator, Edwin Newman, said, ``You say you have
learned that Soviet SS-3s and SS-4s have been placed in Cuba?''
   ``Twenty-five of them, fours and fives, that's correct ... You
can check it,'' said Robertson. ``This may be a major flaw in that
treaty we certainly should look into, if there are nukes in Cuba.''
   After the debate, Marc Nuttle, Robertson's political director,
said the candidate was referring to missile delivery systems, not
warheads themselves. Nuttle said he didn't know how many of these
systems are in Cuba and he said the information did not come
directly from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ``but that's
where some of the information was compiled.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the top Republican on that
committee and leading opponent of the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty, recently introduced an amendment demanding that the
Soviets allow the United States to inspect Cuban missile sites.
   At a committeehearing Feb. 4, Helms grilled Crowe about the
possibility that the Soviets are sneaking missiles into Cuba.
   Crowe said that although Cuba is under constant and intensive
surveillance by U.S. satellites and other intelligence-gathering
devices, he could not say with 100 percent certainty that new
Soviet missile deployment would be detected.
   But Crowe said U.S. surveillance is effective enough that, ``We
have high confidence that we know whether or not there are Soviet
missiles in Cuba.'' He said he could not discuss the matter further
in public.
   Helms said, ``My amendment on Cuban inspection rights would
eliminate this gaping loophole.''
   Jim Lucier, the Republican minority staff director on the
committee, said in a telephone interview that Cuba reneged on a
promise the Soviets made in 1962 to allow the United States to
inspect the missile sets.
   ``The Kennedy-Khrushchev agreement was the first INF treaty,''
said Lucier. ``There's been repeated violations. We need to go
there and look and see what's there.''

   A court today released on bail a couple
sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery.
   The Additional Sessions Court set no date for the next hearing
of the case, in which Shahida Parveen, 25, was accused of
committing adultery by marrying her cousin while she was still
legally married to her first husband.
   An Islamic court convicted Ms. Parveen in November, ruling she
was still married to Khushi Mohammed, 52, when she wed Mohammed
Sarwar, 35. Ms. Parveen and Sarwar were sentenced to stoning.
   Ms. Parveen said Khushi divorced her in 1986 because she could
not have children and he wanted to marry another woman. But the
court ruled that the divorce papers she presented were forged.
   Ms. Parveen was 13 years old when she married Khushi, who
brought the case against her.
   On Feb. 4, a higher Islamic court ordered that Ms. Parveen and
Sarwar be released on bail and ordered a retrial of the case. It
said the prosecution had not investigated thoroughly before
bringing the case against Ms. Parveen.
   It said a retrial should decide the case within three months.
   Social worker Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi put up bail of 10,000
rupees each (totaling about $1,140) for Ms. Parveen and Sarwar.
   Last month, Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo intervened in
the case, asking the interior secretary in a note to examine Ms.
Parveen's sentence.

<HEAD>The State NAACP President Vows Another ``Day of Reckoning''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alabama's NAACP president, who was
arrested during an effort to remove a Confederate battle flag from
atop the state Capitol, has vowed another ``day of reckoning.''
   ``I can tell you there will be another effort,'' state Rep.
Thomas Reed said Sunday following a strategy meeting with other
black leaders in Montgomery.
   ``You have not seen anything yet,'' Reed said, but he did not
provide details of his plans.
   On Feb. 2, Reed and 13 other black legislators were arrested on
trespassing charges when they tried to climb a fence around the
Capitol.
   During the news conference, the estimated 70 people who attended
the ``black summit'' stood and clapped in support of a motion to
continue efforts to remove the flag.
   The meeting was attended by Earl Shinhoster, southeastern
regional director of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People; presidents of NAACP branches throughout the
state, and representatives of other black groups, including the
Alabama Democratic Conference and the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.
   Shinhoster asked those attending to wage an intensive lobbying
effort and also to gather support from the heads of their local
chambers of commerce. He also said the NAACP will consider legal
action concerning the Confederate flag in Alabama and three other
states.
   Last year, the NAACP called for the removal of the Confederate
flag that flies on state capitols in Alabama and South Carolina and
is incorporated into state flags in Georgia and Mississippi.
   Shinhoster said the effort to remove what he called an ``odious
symbol of a bygone era'' has the most promise in Alabama because
black legislators ``took the lead and hit the fence and went to
jail.''
   Reed said the flag dispute could have been quickly settled by
Gov. Guy Hunt. But Hunt has refused to remove the flag, saying it
has historical significance and should remain until the Legislature
decides otherwise.
   Reed said the Rebel flag is the ``last psychological weapon''
signifying oppression of black people. He vowed that the oldest
person attending Sunday's meeting would ``live long enough to see
that Confederate battle flag come down from the Capitol.''

   A man accused of killing a cash courier in
a case featured on television was being held without bond after his
extradition from Washington state, authorities said.
   Jerry Strickland, 26, was arraigned Saturday before a 51st
District Court magistrate in Waterford Township, said an Oakland
County jail spokesman.
   Strickland was charged with murder, kidnapping, armed robbery
and two counts of felony use of a firearm in the death last May of
Elmer DeBoer, who was kidnapped and robbed after making a pickup at
a service station.
   Strickland faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if
convicted on all charges. A preliminary hearing is scheduled Feb.
23.
   Strickland also was arraigned on a felony warrant out of
Manassas, Va., where he is wanted for allegedly passing $321.36 in
bad checks on May 9, 1986.
   Strickland and his wife were arrested Feb. 6 in Moses Lake,
Wash., hours after authorities received tips from residents who saw
the case featured on NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' a series
based on open cases. The two were flown to Michigan on Friday.
   Strickland's 17-year-old wife, who was the service station's
assistant manager at the time of DeBoer's death, was being held in
a youth home.
   Waterford Township police Sgt. Donald G. Bailey said prosecutors
will request a waiver of juvenile court jurisdiction so she may be
tried as an adult.

   A quick-thinking 12-year-old boy used
his thumb, a wad of bubble gum and a sock to plug a gas leak after
the toddler he was baby-sitting pedaled a toy fire engine into the
pipe.
   Jim Bliemeister was taking care of 3-year-old David Higgins on
Saturday at the Higgins home when the incident occurred.
   ``David was playing in the basement,'' said Jim. ``He's the kind
of kid who likes to jump around a lot, and he just pedaled his fire
engine into the gas line.
   Jim said he heard hissing from the pipe.
   ``Then I smelled the gas and said, `David, get upstairs and get
me that gum on your dresser.' Then I just waited, with my thumb in
the hole in the line.
   ``David didn't understand at first. First he brought me Baby
Wipes. Then he brought me some of his toy cars. I was getting
worried. But then he came through _ he brought me the gum.
   ``I chewed it really fast, then I stuffed it into the leak. It
was a little smaller than the size of a dime, but it was making
noise. And then I tied the whole thing with a sock. There were
dirty clothes right by, and the hot water heater. ...''
   Jim then called his father, James, who arrived just before
David's mother, Judy, who promptly called National Fuel.
   ``A guy came almost right away,'' Jim said. ``He said I did the
right thing, and he seemed very surprised that I'd sealed it all up
myself. But I didn't know that. I just did it. He said that, if I'd
waited, the whole house could have blown up.''
   Arthur K. Coon, spokesman for National Fuel, concurred Sunday,
saying, ``The boy responded in a responsible way. What he did was
not what we'd recommend anyone doing himself. But the situation was
potentially very dangerous, and he took care of it.''

   About 75 homosexuals held a St. Valentine's Day
kiss-in outside St. Patrick's Cathedral to protest the Roman
Catholic church's attitude toward homosexuality.
   The display of hugging and kissing during Sunday Mass was the
latest in a series of demonstrations at the cathedral by Dignity,
an organization of gay and lesbian Catholics that has been barred
from using church facilities.
   In contrast to the previous week, when two dozen demonstrators
were arrested, there were no arrests Sunday as protesters kissed
each other, blew kisses toward the cathedral and handed out
chocolate kisses.
   ``This is for solidarity and the unity of the gay and lesbian
community,'' said one organizer, Neil Broome. ``We feel we have the
right to assemble before the church to show the affection between
us without fear of reprisal. Besides, it's Valentine's Day. What's
more appropriate than doing it in front of a cathedral?''

<HEAD>Mayor Accuses FBI Of Trying To Spoil Her Soviet Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Maureen O'Connor has accused FBI
officials of trying to spoil her proposed Soviet arts festival with
their suggestion that residents be wary of KGB spies in artists'
clothing.
   Local FBI officials last week said they would encourage
residents who take in Soviet house guests during the proposed
monthlong cultural exchange to report any suspicious activity to
the bureau.
   ``They're just putting a big wet damper on it, if that's what
they're saying,'' said O'Connor, who is organizing the event for
1989 or 1990.
   The mayor said her office is working with the U.S. State
Department and the U.S. Information Agency to arrange the exchange.
   Agent Bob Harman said the FBI is worried the festival will lure
spies bent on befriending and cultivating residents for espionage.
   ``Our experience is that they (the KGB) use these cultural
groups on a regular basis,'' Harman said.
   The FBI is particularly concerned about festival organizers's
proposal to house Soviets with residents of San Diego, he said.
   San Diego is a natural espionage target because of its military
base, which includes the Miramar training facility for Navy pilots
and many defense contractors, FBI agents said.
   Soviet diplomats are watched closely and are forced to follow
their itinerary, but tourists can travel at will.
   ``With that dancer, there very well may be someone standing
around with no apparent purpose,'' Harman said. ``And if I were
involved in hosting that group, there might be a little funny
feeling there that something isn't right.
   ``It's that `something-isn't-right-here' feeling that we want
people to call us about,'' he said.
   The mayor said she has discussed the festival with Soviet
officials in San Francisco and will travel to Moscow this spring to
set plans.

   Army investigators today
questioned a Palestinian teen-ager who said soldiers used a
bulldozer to bury him and three other Arabs alive.
   Troops in Shufat refugee camp on the outskirts of Jerusalem
meanwhile today shot and wounded a Palestinian in the stomach, a
hospital official said _ the known first case of a rioter being hit
by gunfire in the holy city since demonstrations in the occupied
territories began Dec. 8.
   The army detained two soldiers Sunday and said other soldiers
would be taken into custody soon for allegedly taking part in the
burial incident.
   Abdel Latif Mahmoud Ishtiah, 19, was interrogated for half an
hour inside a white police van parked on a muddy road just outside
this village of 4,000 Palestinians, 40 miles north of Jerusalem.
   Relatives had charged in a complaint filed with the army that 20
soldiers grabbed four Palestinians after a violent demonstration in
Kfar Salem on Feb. 5, beat them, forced them to lie on the ground
and then poured sand over them with a bulldozer.
   The four were unconcious when relatives rescued them after
several minutes, according to villagers quoted in Israeli
newspapers. Three were treated at a West Bank hospital and released
the same day and the fourth was hospitalized for eight days, the
reports said.
   Limping badly and with both hands bandaged halfway up the
forearm, Ishtiah was helped from the van by Arab villagers today
after the interrogation.
   ``I am afraid,'' he told reporters, saying he still dreams about
the horror of being buried alive and believes he was very close to
death. Ishtiah said police also threatened to arrest him if he
didn't tell the truth.
   The villagers said one of the four youths was too badly injured
in the legs to walk to the van and the other two were not at home
at the time of Ishtiah's questioning.
   In continuing violence today, riot police fired tear gas in the
Arab east Jerusalem village of Sur Bahir to subdue Palestinian
protesters who erected roadblocks. Associated Press photographer
Max Nash saw police detain two Arab youths.
   Police have arrested 21 Palestinians in Jerusalem since Sunday,
including five Arabs from the Old City suspected of throwing
firebombs and others from Sur Bahir held in the burning of an
Israeli car, Israel radio said.
   In an army communique today, West Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amram
Mitzna ordered military police to investigate the Kfar Salem
incident.
   ``This investigation is receiving the highest priority. So far
two soldiers have been detained and other detentions are expected
in the near future,'' said the communique. Under Israel's system,
charges are not filed until probes are completed, but suspects may
be placed in custody pending the outcome.
   Army radio quoted Mitzna as saying a sergeant-major from the
military government established by Israel in the West Bank and two
or three other soldiers were involved and would be brought to trial.
   While supervising an arrest operation of suspected Arab
agitators in the West Bank village of Abu Dis today, Mitzna told
army radio: ``Even in my worst dreams, I would never imagine such a
thing even though I constantly warn commanders to expect the most
awful things that could happen when soldiers find themselves all of
a sudden commanding and deciding the lives of citizens.''
   A reporter for the Yediot Ahronot newspaper said he saw on
Sunday a foot-high mound of earth where the incident allegedly took
place. Reporters for the Jerusalem weekly Kol Ha'ir said Friday
they dug out a shoe from the dirt.
   Army officials on Sunday said they were investigating a similar
incident in the Gaza Strip refugee camp Shati. They would not
elaborate.
   Anti-Israeli protests in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
have entered their 10th week. According to U.N. figures, 54 Arabs
have been killed by Israelis since demonstrations began.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today left on a visit to Italy
after telling reporters he did not agree with U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz's statement that Arab-Israeli negotiations
must involve a land-for-peace trade.
   The concept of territorial compromise underpins the latest U.S.
proposals for starting a peace process but has led to opposition
from Shamir's Likud bloc, which is against the return of the
occupied lands to Arab sovereignty.
   On Sunday, riot police in the Golan Heights fired tear gas and
rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing Druse
protesting Israel's annexation of the area.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor says mail criticizing his
decision to set up a scholarship fund for blacks reflects
deep-seated racism.
   O'Connor read 10 letters from critics on Sunday in St. Patrick's
Cathedral at a packed Mass celebrating Black History Month.
   ``We may not realize it but deep in our consciousness there is
racism,'' the Roman Catholic Archbishop said.
   The letters ranged from threats to withhold financial support
from the church to anger to what one writer referred to as special
treatment for black people. O'Connor, 68, said he will answer each
letter.
   One writer accused O'Connor of ``stirring up racism.'' Someone
else suggested that the money should go to white people with large
families they are trying to put through parochial schools.
   O'Connor announced last month that he would donate his Social
Security checks _ $6,000 to $7,000 per year _ to the scholarship
fund.

   Republicans George Bush and Bob Dole head
into New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday in a virtual dead heat
while Michael Dukakis maintains his lead among Democrats, new polls
suggest.
   A Gallup survey released today shows Dole at 36 percent to
Bush's 28 percent. Given the poll's 5 percent margin of error, they
are essentially tied.
   Rep. Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson had 12 percent each, former
Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont 7 percent, and 6 percent were undecided.
Gallup polled 589 likely Republican voters Friday and Saturday.
   According to a poll for the Boston Herald and WBZ-TV, Dole leads
Bush 32 percent to 31 percent. On Feb. 9, one day after Dole's
victory in the Iowa caucuses, Bush led Dole 32 percent to 23
percent. The other GOP candidates were in single digits, according
to the survey of 500 likely Republican voters. The margin of error
was 4 percent.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis held comfortable leads in the
Gallup and Herald-WBZ surveys.
   The Gallup poll showed the Massachusetts governor at 39 percent,
followed by Richard Gephardt at 18 percent and Paul Simon at 16
percent. The other Democrats trailed far behind among the 424
likely Democratic voters surveyed. The margin of error was 4
percent.
   The Herald-WBZ survey put Dukakis at 38 percent. Next came
Gephardt at 19 percent and Simon at 13 percent among the 500 likely
voters polled.
   A CBS News poll and a ABC News-Washington Post survey, both
released Sunday, also suggested that Dole, who is coming off a
convincing win in last week's Iowa caucuses, is now even with Bush.
   Among the Democrats, Dukakis remained the runaway leader with
Simon, of Illinois, and Gephardt, of Missouri, fighting for second.
The CBS poll gave Gephardt a slightly higher level of support.
   The CBS survey was conducted Feb. 12-13, while the ABC-Post poll
was based on interviews Feb. 11-13.
   Among Republicans, the CBS survey ran down the race this way:
Dole, 31 percent; Bush, 30 percent; Kemp, 11 percent; Robertson, 10
percent; Dupont, 10 percent; and undecided, 8 percent.
   Given the 4-percentage-point sampling error margin for the
survey, Dole and Bush are essentially tied. In a previous CBS
survey on Feb. 10-11, Dole had 32 percent and Bush had 29 percent.
   In the ABC-Post interviews among Republicans, here was the
breakdown: Dole, 31 percent; Bush, 28 percent; Kemp, 13 percent;
Robertson, 11 percent; du Pont, 11 percent. Former secretary of
state Alexander Haig, who dropped out Friday, drew 1 percent and 4
percent were undecided.
   The ABC survey was based on interviews with 374 likely GOP
voters. The CBS survey was based on interviews with 594 likely GOP
voters.
   Among Democrats, the ABC poll laid out the race in this fashion:
Dukakis, 40 percent; Simon, 17 percent; Gephardt, 16 percent; Jesse
Jackson, 7 percent; Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, 7 percent;
Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, 6 percent; Former Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart, 3 percent; undecided or others, 5 percent.
   The CBS survey gave Gephardt a bit of an edge and Simon a
smaller number: Dukakis, 42 percent; Gephardt, 18 percent; Simon,
12 percent; Jackson, 4 percent; Gore, 4 percent; Hart, 4 percent;
Babbitt, 3 percent; undecided, 13 percent.
   The CBS survey was based on interviews with 483 likely
Democratic voters. The ABC survey was based on interviews with 383
likely GOP voters.
   As with all random sample surveys, these polls are subject to
variations because of chance fluctuations in the sample.
   For polls based on about 400 interviews _ such as both ABC polls
_ that sampling error margin is 6 percentage points either way.
That is, if all likely New Hampshire voters with telephones were
interviewed, the results of these polls would vary by 6 percentage
points simply because of chance variations in the sample.
   For polls based on aout 500 interviews _ like the CBS Democratic
survey _ the sampling error margin is 5 percentage points. For
polls based on about 600 interviews _ like the CBS Republican
survey _ the sampling error margin is 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Prince Edward Goes To Work In The Theater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Edward arrived 10 minutes early this
morning for his new job as a theater production assistant, a pack
of teabags under his arm and a bodyguard in his limousine.
   Queen Elizabeth II's youngest son, who abandoned a career in the
Royal Marines last year, was hired by composer Andrew Lloyd
Webber's Really Useful Theater Company.
   His job as a production assistant is the theater's lowest rung.
It involves everything from running errands to making tea, but it's
the first time a close male relative of the British monarch has
landed employment outside the military.
   The 23-year-old prince, casually dressed in a blue sweater and
collarless tweed jacket, arrived with his personal bodyguard in a
limousine at the Palace Theater in the heart of London's West End.
   Sian Watling, a 29-year-old beautician, handed him a single rose
which she said she bought ``on impulse'' from a nearby flower shop.
   Before the prince's arrival, police with sniffer dogs checked
the theater.
   The Palace is currently playing ``Les Miserables,'' the
smash-hit musical of Victor Hugo's novel of the same title, which
won eight Tony awards.
   The theater building also houses the offices of Lloyd Webber's
company, one of the most dynamic forces in the business,
responsible for a string of successes including ``Cats'' and
``Phantom of the Opera.''
   ``The prince won't be treated as a member of the royal family
but as an employee,'' Bridget Hayward, the company's executive
director, said when he got the job. ``He has said he wants to be
treated as a worker, that is his understanding of the job. He has a
lot to learn and we have plenty of work for him.''
   But being there will show the prince the complexities of what
makes a successful show.
   His pay, if any, hasn't been disclosed.

<TEXT>
   Iraq said today its gunners downed two
Iranian drone planes in the southern sector of the war front,
confirming for the first time that Tehran is using pilotless
reconnaissance aircraft.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said both
drones were downed Sunday night. It quoted an unnamed military
spokesman as saying the first plane crashed in Iranian territory
and the second in Iraq.
   On Sunday, Iran reported that it fired on U.S. helicopters
flying ahead of a convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti ships escorted
through the Persian Gulf by American vessels. The Pentagon said it
had no evidence of the confrontation
   Iran recently reported that home-built drones have been
successfully tested and that its war factories now were working on
drone fighter planes. It was not clear from the Iraqi report if the
drones reportedly downed had been manufactured in Iran.
   Iranian officials had boasted that the drones would boost the
country's air force. Iran's U.S.-supplied air force is outnumbered
by the Iraqis by eight to one.
   Iran has had difficulty finding spare parts for its warplanes
because of sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic after
militants stormed the American embassy in Tehran in November 1979
and held 53 American hostages for 444 days.
   Western military analysts say Iran has 60 to 70 working
warplanes.
   In recent weeks, Iranian warplanes have been action in the war
with Iraq, suggesting Tehran may have bought some of its air force
needs on the black market.
   Iranian officials also say Iran now makes its own version of the
Chinese-made, long-range surface-to-surface missiles and other
projectiles as part of a drive toward self-sufficiency.
   Iran stepped up efforts to manufacture its own weapons after the
United States proposed an international arms embargo of Iran to
force its rulers to agree to a U.N. Security Council call for a
cease-fire in the 7-year-old gulf war.
   Iran claimed this weekend that its forces opened ``direct fire''
on U.S. Navy helicopters that were carrying out reconnaissance
operations Friday ahead of a convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ships
in the gulf, forcing the American helicopters to flee.
   But a Pentagon spokesman in Washington denied the report.
   ``We have no reports ... that indicated that event occurred,''
said U.S. Air Force Maj. Randall Morder.

   Wind-whipped snow that stranded hundreds of travelers fell today
on much of the upper Mississippi Valley and across the northern
Great Lakes region, while rain dampened parts of the South.
   Wind blew up to 20 to 30 mph early today in Iowa and Minnesota,
creating wind chills of 15 to 30 degrees below.
   Hundreds of travelers were stranded overnight in motels and
armories in southwest Minnesota, where near-blizzard conditions
existed today as high wind whipped snow into drifts and cut
visibility.
   ``All the roads are blocked,'' said a police dispatcher in
Redwood Falls, Minn. ``Nobody can leave town ... and I don't think
anybody can get into town.''
   The wind was dying down in other parts of the state and some
highways reopened.
   In Wyoming, wind gusting to 60 mph whipped up blinding clouds of
loose snow and closed Interstate 80 between Laramie and Rawlins.
   Six to 10 inches of snow fell overnight at Wakefield, Mich., and
advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted today over
northwestern and north-central Upper Michigan. One to 3 inches of
snow was expected in southeastern Wisconsin.
   Freezing rain fell over parts of northwestern Pennsylvania and
upstate New York.
   Rain extended from southern lower Michigan across parts of the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys into Alabama. In the six hours up to 7
a.m., 1.9 inches of rain fell at the Meridian Naval Air Station in
Mississippi.
   A band of showers and thunderstorms extended from west-central
Alabama across southeastern Louisiana. Street flooding was reported
early today in Houma, La.
   Elsewhere, scattered light rain and mountain snow extended from
the northern Pacific Coast across the northern Rockies.

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Travelers Stranded By Snow In Southwestern Minnesota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of motorists were stranded by
blowing and drifting snow today in southwestern Minnesota, filling
motels and National Guard armories.
   Elsewhere in the state, however, the wind had died down after
closing major highways.
   ``The winds are going down, but we're at a standstill yet,''
said Lorren Simon, a dispatcher for the State Patrol in Marshall.
   Interstate 90 from the South Dakota border to 10 miles east of
Jackson, a stretch of about 120 miles, was still closed this
morning, Simon said. It was closed at 11 a.m. Sunday.
   Simon said authorities were worried some motorists might still
be stranded in their cars.
   ``Finding stranded travelers is a frustrating process,'' he
said. ``You can't use strong enough language on them. They'll go
out anyway and then they think the public officials should come out
and rescue them when you can't go up and down the road. They get
real perturbed when someone doesn't go out there. But I'm sure
there are going to be people out there in those cars.''
   Authorities said the near-zero visibility in the blowing snow,
along with high drifts, made it impossible for rescue vehicles to
go out.
   ``All the roads are blocked,'' said a Redwood Falls police
dispatcher. ``Nobody can leave town ... and I don't think anybody
can get into town.''
   There were numerous traffic accidents, many of them with
injuries, but no fatalities were reported.
   More than 300 people sought shelter overnight in National Guard
armories in Worthington, Redwood Falls and Jackso, said Lt. Col.
Dave Pearson. Food was provided by the National Guard and members
of the community, 1st Sgt. Ron Balster said.
   ``We lost count at about 212,'' said Balster. Travelers signed
in from Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Kansas and
Chicago.
   `We got 200 furniture blankets from U-Haul,'' Balster said. ``We
got paper towels from Campbell Soup. And people have brought in all
kinds of food. There are sandwiches, chicken. One person just
brought in two gallons of milk.''
   By 2 p.m. Sunday the Worthington Best Western motel was
directing travelers to the armory. ``Just about all the motels were
filled up by 3 p.m.,'' said Clayton Johnson at the Best Western.
   ``We had 12 cars up here at one time fighting to get in the door
for one room,'' said Lucille Thorn, manager of the Oxford Motel.
   Worthington Holiday Inn general manager Connie Bruns said 75 to
100 people spent the night in the lobby and meeting rooms.
   In southeastern Minnesota, conditions were much improved today
with wind still gusting up to 35 mph but with little snow.
   ``There's some drifting on ramps and on side roads, but it
shouldn't be too bad,'' said Bill Henke, a dispatcher for the State
Patrol in Rochester.
   Conditions also improved in northwestern Minnesota and Minnesota
2 was reopened at Crookston. Interstate 94 and Minnesota 210 at
Fergus Falls reopened Sunday night, said Dayle Peterson, a
supervisor with the State Patrol in Detroit Lakes.

   Vice President George Bush today predicted
victory in the New Hampshire primary and said rival Bob Dole has
fallen into the same ``momentum'' trap that snared Bush after the
1980 Iowa caucuses. Democrat Paul Simon told his supporters to look
for ``a real surprise'' in the nation's first primary.
   ``I want New Hampshire to do what it did in 1980'' when
President Reagan turned around an Iowa defeat and beat Bush in the
New Hampshire primary, Bush said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   In 1980, ``I came into New Hampshire talking momentum. Reagan
got the issues out. And now it's the opposite _ Bob Dole is talking
momentum and I'm talking issues ... We're doing better getting out
those differences with Bob Dole on the issues.''
   On the eve of the nation's first primary, the Gallup
organization released a poll showing Dole leading Bush in New
Hampshire by a 36-28 margin, with Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson tied
for third at 12 percent and Pete du Pont fifth with seven percent.
The poll of 589 likely Republican voters was conducted Friday and
Saturday and had a five-point margin of error.
   Other polls also showed the race a virtual tie, with the vice
president's once substantial lead vanished into New Hampshire's
frigid air and the trend moving in the Kansas senator's direction.
   On the Democratic side, Michael Dukakis remained the leader and
the target of sniping by Richard Gephardt and Simon, who are still
dueling for second. The Gallup poll of 424 Democrats showed Dukakis
with 39 percent, Gephardt 18 percent and Simon 16 percent. Its
margin of error was four points.
   Simon, campaigning in Hollis, N.H., claimed the race ``is
between Michael Dukakis and me'' and ``I think it is tightening. I
think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow.''
   Simon began television commercials attacking Dukakis, the
governor of next-door Massachusetts, as a bureaucrat. Gephardt's
new ads lashed at Dukakis too, calling him ``one of the biggest
tax-raisers in Massachusetts history.''
   Dukakis ignored the criticism, devoting much of Sunday to
stating his views on foreign policy issues including Central
America and nuclear arms control. He emphasized his opposition to
funding for the Nicaraguan Contras, but said he would use military
force, if necessary, to thwart a military attack on a Central
American ally.
   Bush cast himself as President Reagan's strong loyalist in a
debate with his five rivals Sunday night, while Pat Robertson
offered the startling assertion that the Soviet Union secretly has
placed nuclear missiles in Cuba _ ``nukes pointing at the United
States,'' he said.
   A White House official promptly disputed Robertson's claim, and
a Robertson aide said after the debate that the candidate had meant
missile-delivery systems, not necessarily warheads.
   Dole displayed the confidence of a candidate who has seen all
the breaks go his way for the past week since trouncing the vice
president in the Iowa caucuses.
   ``Some of us would like to see it end Tuesday here with someone
winning,'' Dole said. He gently boasted later, ``I have come a long
way in the last 30 days.''
   Mindful that a secon loss after his Iowa debacle would be
devastating, Bush acknowledged his own shortcomings as a campaigner
and made clear he didn't intend to give up, no matter the outcome
Tuesday.
   He insisted he has no ``lack of passion'' and declared, ``My
work isn't done yet.''
   For Robertson, the former television preacher, the missiles
remark was one of a series of attention-getting statements over the
past several days that provoked Jack Kemp to say in the debate,
``He has said some off-the-wall things.''
   Robertson said in separate television interviews Sunday that he
``wouldn't have hesitated to kill'' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,
and that he wants to gradually abolish the Social Security system
``over 40 years, moving it into a private system.''
   Robertson failed to show up at a candidate's forum held at a
Jewish temple in Manchester where he had been scheduled to speak
just after the debate. His state campaign director, David D.
Randlett, told leaders of the Temple Adath Yeshurun that he didn't
know why Robertson never showed up. After hurried telephone calls
Randlett said he couldn't find anyone with Robertson who could tell
him.
   Some 150 people had waited for an hour at the same temple where,
four years ago in an emotion-packed session, Jesse Jackson tried to
explain his embarrassing reference to New York as ``Hymietown.''
   Democratic darkhorse Bruce Babbitt, arriving as scheduled,
ridiculed Robertson.
   ``They told me he was too busy turning the next storm out to
sea,'' Babbitt said, provoking laughter. After talking for an hour,
Babbitt said, ``I'm willing to stay here till the sunrise _ whether
it comes at the usual time or Pat Robertson makes it a little
earlier.''
   Robertson, the surprise second-place finisher in Iowa, was in a
struggle with Kemp for third place in most New Hampshire polls. His
campaign manager Mark Nuttle said after the debate that Robertson
had meant to say missile delivery systems _ not warheads _ were in
Cuba. He wouldn't give the source of his information other than
that some of it had been ``compiled'' by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   Outside the debate at St. Anselm College, about 25 ``Youth for
Robertson'' students jeered at about 70 members of ``Cure AIDS
Now,'' a group that includes AIDS victims. The Robertson backers
chanted, ``It's your own fault.''
   Republicans Kemp and Pete du Pont, and Democrats Babbitt and
Gary Hart all faced the prospect of having little choice but to
drop out if they fall short Tuesday _ although du Pont and Hart
vowed to go on in any event. Third place seemed to be the line that
determined the future for Kemp and du Pont.
   In the GOP debate, Kemp and du Pont both attacked Dole as
harboring a secret desire to raise taxes. Du Pont thrust a piece of
paper in Dole's face and asked him to sign a no-tax-increase pledge
while accusing him of pushing through higher taxes in the Senate.
   ``That was to close loopholes on big companies like DuPont,''
Dole said in sharp reply, a reference to the giant corporation that
was begun by du Pont's ancestors and is the source of his wealth.
   The Democratic candidates held their final debate of the New
Hampshire campaign on Saturday night, with Gephardt drawing
criticism from his rivals for changing positions on taxes and a
range of other issues.
   Albert Gore Jr. asked for and got a televised apology from
Gephardt for a profane denunciation of himself and his staff made
by Gephardt campaign manager Bill Carrick earlier in the week.
   Jesse Jackson boarded a 1930s train for a whistle-stop tour
through the Lakes Region of the state and drew hundreds at each
stop despite 20-degree temperatures and gusty winds.
   ``I've stood with you. On Tuesday I want you to stand with me,''
Jackson said from aboard his ``Rainbow Express.''

   Minority demonstrators occupying a
building to protest campus racism sent a sympathy card to the
university's chancellor today after learning that his brother was
ill, and the chancellor responded with a basket of fruit.
   Roscoe Robinson, a spokesman for the group occupying New Africa
Hall, also said the group had revised the language of its demands
to make them more acceptable to the administration. However, he
said the thrust of the demands remains unchanged.
   He refused to say anything further and said he wanted to give
UMass Chancellor Joseph Duffey a chance to review them.
   An estimated 125 demonstrators have held the four-story brick
building on the UMass campus since Friday to protest an alleged
beating of two black students by whites Feb. 7 and other recent
racial incidents at the school. Their demands include the
suspension of five white students allegedly involved in the beating.
   Protesters are to meet with Duffey on Tuesday, Robinson said.
Duffey said he was unable to meet with them today because he had to
visit his hospitalized brother. No further information about the
brother was available.
   The protesters this morning sent Duffey a card expressing
sympathy and wishing Duffey's brother a speedy recovery. Duffey
responded by sending the protesters a fruit basket.
   ``I send affection and respect,'' a card attached to the basket
read.
   With classes scheduled to resume Tuesday at the building, an
Afro-American studies center, Duffey is trying to avoid a
confrontation, said university spokesman James Langley. The
students say they won't leave until Duffey meets their demands.
   ``We're being as patient as we possibly can,'' Langley said. ``I
don't think you'll see any arrests. They are being very peaceful.''
   The black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian students who took
over the New Africa Hall said Sunday a church had pledged money and
restaurants had donated hot meals for the protesters.
   ``We haven't even had to leave the building to buy food,'' said
Rio Gabriel, 21, a junior from Toronto.
   Other demonstrators left briefly for showers and breakfast at
home, Ms. Gabriel said. The campus has been shut down since
Saturday for the holiday weekend.
   She said the leaders of the group talked with black
administrators Sunday in preparation for a meeting with the
chancellor on their demands, which have been increased to include
more financing for minority activities and increased hiring of
minority faculty.
   Duffey acknowledged over the weekend that racism continues to be
a problem at the school.
   ``I think we've got a continuing problem with harassment and
abuse,'' although it is not just racial, he told reporters.
   Last year, the university disciplined six white students who
pleaded no contest to charges stemming from a racial clash in which
a black student was chased and beaten after the final 1986 World
Series game between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets.
   A report issued afterward by the Civility Commission, a group of
faculty and staff members that reviews campus confrontations,
called for hiring more minority faculty and administrators and
urged anti-racism education for administrators, among other
recommendations.
   The report cited the investigation into the racial clash by
Frederick Hurst, the head of the state Commission Against Racism,
who had criticized ``the administration's historical denial of
racial problems'' on campus.
   According to the school, 41 of its 1,339 faculty members and 5
percent of the 20,000 undergraduates are black, mirroring a
nationwide decline in the number of black applicants in the last
several years.

<HEAD>Women Allowed as Scoutmasters</HEAD>

   Boy Scouts of America officials voted to
allow women in leadership positions because fighting continual
court challenges had become too costly and damaged the
organization's image, a spokesman said.
   For 12 years, the Boy Scouts fought challenges to its policy of
providing only male leadership, spokesman David Corti said Saturday.
   Corti cited the ``great cost to the organization, both in terms
of money and in the perception of what we are'' as reasons for the
reversal.
   ``I'm very happy that other women will have the opportunity,''
said Phyllis Gibson, a California woman who was a troop committee
chairman and who was one of several who filed suit over the old
policy.
   Corti said the organization had ``won our court cases and
probably would continue to do so.''
   The organization's National Executive Board voted for the change
during a Thursday meeting in Washington, D.C., said Barclay Bollas,
a spokesman for the Boy Scouts, which is based here.
   ``Our volunteer hierarchy felt boys of this age group should
have the opportunity to be associated with male role models,'' he
said.
   Women had been barred from becoming scoutmasters _ leading a Boy
Scout troop _ as well as assistant scoutmasters, varsity or
assistant coaches, or leaders of Webelos, a program for the age
group between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.
   Some officials were critical of the reversal.
   ``Experts are saying men must spend more time nurturing and
providing male role models for youth and Boy Scouting has provided
this in spades,'' said Ron Phillippo, executive director of the
Indianhead Council, which includes eight counties in eastern
Minnesota and four in western Wisconsin.
   Many positions were open to women, including the job of leading
a Cub Scout troop, officials said. Of 1.1 million volunteers
nationwide, about 500,000 are women, Bollas said.
   ``There was never a question of the ability of women. It was
just that the Boy Scouts felt there ought to be male role models
for boys,'' Phillippo said.
   ``The value in scouting's former policy has been that it
provided boys with a nurturant male role model,'' said Judith
Erickson, a consultant for Minnesota councils and an associate
professor at the University of Minnesota's Center for Youth
Development and Research.
   ``With this change in policy, men must be serious about taking
on the nurturant role in this and other organizations, or this will
be one more instance of women alone developing that type of close
relationship,'' Erickson said.
   Ms. Gibson, of Goleta, Calif., said she doesn't believe there is
any reason why a woman can't be in a scout leadership position.
   ``I have enjoyed working with the boys. I've been a good
motivator of boys. I think it's very important for boys to be
around men and women,'' she said.
   Her son, Chad, also saw no reason for women to be banned from
leadership.
   ``Some of the older scoutmasters care but none of the kids
care,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim today defied
widespread calls to resign because of his wartime past and vowed
not to retreat before ``slanders, hateful demonstrations and
wholesale condemnations.''
   His decision, announced in a prepared text for a nationally
televised speech, seemed certain to deepen Austria's growing
political crisis.
   The 69-year-old president was addressing the fierce controversy
that reached flashpoint last week when a historians' report
questioned Waldheim's moral integrity and said he was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during his World War II service in
the Balkans.
   Today, Waldheim declared, ``I cannot but state that parts of the
report do not correspond to the facts but are built on presumptions
and hypotheses. For that reason, the conclusions drawn cannot be
upheld.''
   Waldheim stressed that he will cling to his embattled presidency
despite calls from across the political spectrum that he should
step down.
   ``In the course of the renewed discussion, the question was also
put about my premature departure from the office of federal
president,'' Waldheim said.
   ``I want to take a stand in all clarity: You, my dear Austrians,
have elected me federal president with a convincing majority in a
secret and direct election for six years.
   ``Thus it is no longer a matter of the man Kurt Waldheim.''
   Waldheim ruled out resignation, saying: ``It is a fundamental
principle of our democracy that an election result cannot be
subsequently corrected.''
   ``A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders,
hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations,'' he said.
   Earlier today, Alois Mock, the foreign minister and chairman of
the conservative People's Party, reiterated his support for the
president as some other conservatives appeared to back away from
Waldheim.
   On Sunday, Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky sharply
criticized Waldheim in a televised interview and made it clear the
controversy was threatening the government coalition between
Socialists and conservatives.
   Vranitzky runs the government in Austria, while the presidency
is a largely ceremonial post. The Socialists are the senior partner
in the coalition government with the conservative Austrian People's
Party, which backed Waldheim when he won the presidency in 1986.
   Vranitzky said he himself would consider resigning if his
leadership continued to be affected by the controversy over
Waldheim.
   The chancellor won rare praise from some conservatives for what
the generally pro-Waldheim tabloid Kurier called ``a great moment
of television.''
   ``Vranitzky has made a huge gamble,'' the tabloid added.
   Robert Graf, a top conservative politician and economics
minister, voiced impatience over Waldheim's failure to act.
   ``The president must take a decision which is very important for
our country,'' Graf emphasized in an Austrian radio interview.
   Graf, who represents influential conservative business
interests, said he was concerned about Austria's battered image
abroad and had no idea how to get out of the crisis.
   The 202-page historians' document suggested there was no proof
that Waldheim took part in war crimes while with the German army,
but said he had made every effort to conceal his wartime past until
his Balkans service was first disclosed in March 1986.
   The report, commissioned by the government at Waldheim's
request, also seriously questioned Waldheim's moral integrity as a
lieutenant in the German army in Yugoslavia and Greece.
   About 1,500 Austrians, including the nation's most prominent
intellectuals, signed a three-page advertisement in the news weekly
Profil demanding Waldheim's resignation. About 5,000 Waldheim
opponents staged a demonstration in downtown Vienna.
   On Sunday, Vranitzky questioned Waldheim's ability to perform
his duties, saying ``the federal president must be an integration
figure, not a disintegration figure.''
   On Friday, former Foreign Minister Karl Gruber stirred outrage
by claiming that members of the commission were Waldheim's enemies
because they were either socialists or Jews.
   Referring to Gruber's statement, Vranitzky said: ``The president
must in the very next hour distance himself from such statements as
Gruber's'' and not wait until the chancellor sends a public apology
and other officials express their dismay.
   In an interview with the Kurier, Waldheim belatedly described
Gruber's comments as ``unacceptable,'' but he qualified his remarks
by saying, ``Gruber was a resistance fighter, I believe he did not
want to express an evil sense.''
   The commission of historians was appointed to investigate
Waldheim's wartime record after the U.S. government put him on a
list of undesirable aliens, which effectively bars him from
entering the United States.
   U.S. officials said Waldheim was a lieutenant in a German unit
that sent thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps. The charges,
originating with the World Jewish Congress, had first surfaced
during Waldheim's candidacy.

<TEXT>
   A union official today called for the closing
of a strikebound International Paper Co. mill as company officials
said they were ready to resume operations following a chlorine gas
leak that injured seven workers.
   Sunday's leak, the third poison gas leak at the mill since late
January, lasted 10 to 15 minutes and was largely contained in a
mill building, said Willis Lyford, a spokesman for Gov. John R.
McKernan Jr.
   Two bleaching plants at the complex remained idle while
officials from the state Department of Environmental Protection
investigated and said they would remain indefinitely to monitor
operations. A chlorine dioxide leak on Feb. 5 forced thousands of
residents to evacuate.
   The latest leak prompted a renewed call for a plant shutdown
from more than 1,200 striking paperworkers, who say the accidents
are being caused by inexperienced replacement workers.
   ``We're still demanding that the mill be closed down,'' said
Brian Doughty, a spokesman for Local 14 of the United Paperworkers
International Union.
   IP spokesman Rick Ouellette said operations at two bleaching
plants closed by the leak would resume later today.
   ``I can just say that modifications are being made,'' said
Ouellette. ``I couldn't give you specfics at this point.''
   ``State environmental officials will remain at the mill to
oversee repairs on the part of the bleaching operation that
resulted in the leak,'' the governor said Sunday. ``And the
officials will remain after repairs are completed and the plant
resumes normal operation to evaluate whether those repairs are
satisfactory.''
   Lyford said the chlorine escaped when a valve failed to shut off
automatically following a cutoff of electricity that halted the
bleaching process. Another similar plant was closed while the
damage was assessed.
   IP officials said there was no exposure outside the mill, and
Jay Town Manager Charles Noonan said no evacuation was required.
   The Feb. 5 chlorine dioxide leak was caused when workers
severing a pipe accidentally dropped a piece on a valve. No cause
has been given for a Jan. 28 hydrogen sulfide leak that injured
eight workers.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has
been investigating the leaks, which the striking unions blame on
inexperienced workers.
   Ouellette said the latest leak ``wasn't a human error.''
   Of five workers taken to Franklin Memorial Hospital in
Farmington, three were admitted for mild to moderate exposure to
chlorine and were in stable condition, said spokesman Kevin Flynn.
   A spokeswoman at Central Maine Medical Center said two people
exposed to the gas were released Sunday afternoon.
   Noonan last week criticized legislators for doing too little to
defuse what he sees as a volatile situation in a town already tense
over a nine-month labor dispute at IP.
   More than 1,200 members of United Paperworkers International
Union and the International Brotherhood of Firemen & Oilers at the
IP mill have been on strike since mid-June.
   IP has kept the mill in operation, staffing it with outside
contractors, supervisory personnel and hundreds of replacement
workers.

<HEAD>U.N. Commission Slams Israel, Nudges El Salvador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission condemned Israel
today for its policies in occupied Arab territories, the 20th
straight year the commission has leveled that criticism.
   The measure, sponsored by 26 Third World and communist
countries, condemmed Israel for ``physical violence in occupied
Palestine, breaking the bones of children, women and men and
causing women to miscarry as a result of severe beatings.''
   In another matter, the commission's special investigator issued
a report expressing concern over the deadlock in talks between the
government of El Salvador and guerilla organizations. It also said
it was concerned about a resurgence of death squads.
   The U.N. commission assailed Israel for ``killing, wounding,
arresting and torturing thousands of Palestinians'' and for alleged
``attempts to kidnap Palestinian children ... and transfer them to
unknown places.'' The vote was 31-8 with four abstentions.
   The United States, France, West Germany, Italy, Norway,
Portugal, Britain, and Belgium voted against the measure described
by speakers as containing excessive language. Costa Rica, Ireland,
Japan and Spain abstained.
   The U.S. delegation was alone in voting against a second measure
condemning Israel for its refusal to apply the Geneva Conventions
to the civilian population and to Palestinian prisoners. Belgium,
Costa Rica, France, West Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway,
Portugal, Spain and Britain abstained.
   A third resolution, declaring as void Israel's annexation of
Syria's Golan Heights, was approved by an identical vote, 31-1 with
11 abstentions.
   A separate vote was held on one paragraph singling out the
United States for its ``pro-Israeli position'' that prevented
``appropriate'' Security Council measures against Israel. It was
adopted 19-15 with nine abstentions.
   The 30-page El Salvador report, compiled by the commission's
special investigator, Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo of Spain, said
the dialogue between the government and leftist guerillas seemed
constructive in its initial stage but that a recent deadlock was a
source of concern.
   The report also expresses concern at indications of a resurgence
of the ``death squads'' despite efforts by the government to
control such activities.
   It lists a decline in the number of politically motivated
executions by members of the armed forces and civil defense forces
while saying that guerilla organizations continue such practice on
a widespread scale.
   It also said guerrillas have continued to ``to be responsible
for maining and killing civilians coming into contact with mines
they have planted.''
   The Salvadorian regular army has tried to apply humanitarian
standards, the report said, but this doesn't ``prevent
unjustifiable civilian fatalities from time to time.''

<TEXT>
   Here is the full text of President Kurt
Waldheim's speech on Austrian television Monday night, as
translated from German by The Associated Press.
   Dear Austrians;
   For several days, you have all heard and read a renewed debate
concerning the person of the federal president; that is, concerning
my person.
   The discussion is not just being conducted in the media, but
confronts us almost everywhere. Questions are being put about
mutual trust, morality and understanding one another.
   I understand these questions _ especially from young people. The
great majority of my fellow citizens did not live through the time
in question. I also wouldn't wish it on anybody to have to live
through this experience of war. Thank God, the living conditions
that existed then cannot be compared in any way with those of
today, so that it's difficult for many people to identify with what
I feel. Perhaps you are also tired of hearing this theme with all
its accusations and contradictions.
   My dear fellow citizens, you have the right to hear from me
myself where and how I stand in this debate. It is a personal
concern of mine to speak with you about these questions because I
want to be understood and because you have called me to the office
of federal president in a secret, direct vote.
   Let's look back: Everything that is now being discussed again,
began two years ago. Then, some weeks before the first ballot (in
the 1986 presidential election) we were all suddenly confronted
with severe charges against me.
   It was a question of my wartime service and people tried from
the very beginning to prove that I had committed war crimes and
covered up war crimes. My accusers came from Austria and abroad.
They stopped at nothing, manipulations, lies and forgeries were
used against me. My accusers called me a murderer, a war criminal
and a liar. Without mercy I was interrogated day after day about
events which took place 40 and more years ago.
   My countrymen, you will remember much from the election campaign
and will perhaps have believed some of the charges. I tried to
reconstruct my war service of 40 years before as well as I could.
Much, too much, remained open. Often for the sake of truth I had to
say that I cannot remember something or that I do not know it. My
accusers kept coming with more new charges and always promised
proof. But the proof did not come. Finally, I could only counter
the dirt of my enemies with one thing: I said it then: I have a
clean conscience.
   My fellow citizens, you trusted me and at the end of these
bitter weeks called me into the high office of the federal
president of our republic.
   As I took up my office, I said that it was my concern to place
what unites us above what divides us. I continue to seek
reconciliation with those who were insulted but also with those who
pursue me with hate.
   My opponents did not let go. It was not enough for them, that my
respected predecessor Dr. (Rudolf) Kirchschlaeger took it upon
himself to examine the validity of the material against me. He
established then that there was no proof for the charges.
Nonetheless, the attacks continued.
   For this reason I finally asked the federal government to
appoint a commission of historians to establish whether there is
any personal culpable conduct on my part during my wartime service.
Some of my opponents, as a precaution, said then that the
commission was only there to serve me. Now anyone who reads the
report of this commission or who has seen the television interviews
of some of the commission members will confirm that they in no way
wanted to be of service to me. I cannot but state that parts of the
report do not correspond to the facts, but are built on
presumptions and hypotheses. For that reason, the conclusions drawn
cannot be upheld.
   My fellow citizens, you can nonetheless look at this commission
report from all sides and you will not find the proof that has been
sought for two years of personal guilt and involvement in war
crimes. This proof does not exist. The actions of the last two
years have ended in the same way as those of the last few days (I
mean) that telegram from Yugoslavia which was presented against me
as conclusive proof and which has now turned out to be an obvious
fake.
   My fellow citizens, in this terrible Second World War, in this
curse for my generation, I saw and experienced endless suffering,
destruction and pain. I was then a young man of barely 20 years. In
1938, a few days before Hitler's march into Austria, I took part in
desperate actions with which we fought against the annexation. Then
came what I two years ago called _ in a phrase that was
misunderstood _ ``fulfillment of duty:'' I was drafted into
Hitler's Wehrmacht. One must see this without illusions and in all
truth: There were not many chances to escape military service. In
the NS (Nazi) dictatorship, hundreds of thousands, indeed millions,
had no other option.
   I have great respect for the heroes and martyrs of that time,
but they were, as always in history, only a few.

   Surgeons transplanted a heart into a 3-week-old Pennsylvania boy
today, while a week-old California boy began his first full day
with a new heart.
   At Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Jonathan Stowe went into
surgery around midnight and emerged at 10:15 a.m., said hospital
spokeswoman Sue Cardillo. He was in critical condition.
   Jonathan, the son of Tabatha and David Stowe of Beaver Falls,
was born Jan. 25.
   In California, a boy identified only as Christoffer received a
new heart in a five-hour operation Sunday at Loma Linda University
Medical Center in Loma Linda.
   ``I have a Valentine's Day story for you,'' said hospital
spokesman Dick Schaefer. The baby was listed in critical but stable
condition after the operation, performed by Leonard Bailey.
   Christoffer's family was identified only as an Air Force family
living in Southern California.
   Both boys were born with hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, a
lethal underdevelopment of the left side of the heart, the hospital
officials said.
   The Pittsburgh hospital's youngest transplant patient before
Jonathan was a 24-day-old boy from Wyoming who received a new liver
in July 1986.
   The Loma Linda hospital has done several transplants on babies,
including 13 heart transplants on children under 4 months, counting
Christoffer's surgery. Ten of those 13 children are alive.
   Bailey, a pioneer in infant heart transplant surgery, stirred
controversy in 1984 when he transplanted a baboon's heart into a
child known as Baby Fae in an effort to save her life. The girl
died 20 days after the transplant.

<HEAD>Tourists Should Leave Sentries Alone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tourists are harassing the uniformed sentries at
St. James' Palace, according to lawmakers who want the government
to do something about it.
   ``I have quite often seen pretty girls putting their arms around
soldiers on duty outside St. James' Palace, while their friends
take teasing photographs of them,'' said legislator Harry Greenway.
   ``Sometimes they hug the soldiers round the neck and squeeze
them. It requires the patience of Job for a young soldier not to
react angrily _ or indeed in any other way,'' he said.
   At Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II's official residence,
sentries were moved in the 1960s from outside the gates to the
courtyard, where the public cannot enter, after one soldier got fed
up with being pestered and banged the butt of his rifle on a
woman's foot.
   But there's no courtyard at St. James' Palace, which houses
court officials and is less famous, and tourists can touch the
sentries there, if they dare.
   Greenway and Sir John Biggs-Davison said they will raise the
matter in Parliament. Biggs-Davison said he will ask Home Secretary
Douglas Hurd for a police report on steps being taken to stop
sentries being ``tantalized.''
   ``It is very unfair that soldiers have to endure these
unpleasant attentions without in any way responding and it is not
good for the dignity of royalty or, for that matter, the army,''
Biggs-Davison said.
   Greenway said tourists also bothered the horses of mounted
sentries on duty at the Horse Guards in Whitehall, the center of
government offices.
   ``I have often seen tourists prodding the horses with their
fingers,'' he said. ``That is not only most unfair and demeaning
but highly dangerous too.''

   The deputy Soviet foreign minister
expressed his nation's satisfaction with the ``upward trend of
bilateral relations'' with Iran after discussions with Tehran
officials, it was reported Monday.
   The visit to Iran by Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky
came one week after a trip by a Soviet envoy to Iran's enemy, Iraq.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said after meeting with
Petrovsky on Sunday that high-ranking officials of both countries
had decided to implement major joint economic projects, the
official Iranian News Agency reported.
   During his four-day visit, Petrovsky reiterated to Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati the Soviet Union's willingness
to withdraw from Afghanistan starting May 15, IRNA reported.
   Musavi praised the Soviet move, the agency said.
   Iran, which shares borders with the Soviet Union and
Afghanistan, has been supporting Afghan Moslem guerrillas who are
fighting the Soviet army and the Communist government in Kabul.
   Gaibnazar Pallayev, vice chairman of the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, pledged during his visit to Iraq that Moscow was
ready to consider an arms embargo aginst Tehran for ignoring a U.N.
resolution calling for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Moscow is
Iraq's major arms supplier in the 7-year-old war.

<TEXT>
   The Senate majority leader called today
for his colleagues to scrap a plan to meet privately during the
impeachment trial of Gov. Evan Mecham.
   The decision to allow for closed meetings had been criticized by
Mecham's lawyer and had touched off protests and editorials from
news organizations.
   ``It has become evident after several days of comments regarding
the adopted Court of Impeachment rules from both the public and the
press that the intent of our actions has been misinterpreted,''
Robert Usdane said in a letter to Senate President Carl Kunasek and
Minority Leader Alan Stephens.
   ``It appears to me that the benefits to the Senate would be
significantly outweighed by the detriments to the process,'' he
added.
   Usdane, like Mecham a Republican, suggested that the rules be
changed to require that all deliberations in public and to either
ban secret meetings or require a majority vote before any closed
meeting.
   Kunasek declined to say whether he would support the change. But
several rank-and-file Republicans said they favored it and Stephens
said he believed his caucus would go along with it.
   A two-thirds vote is needed to change the rules.
   Usdane said deliberating in the open ``will erase any question
as to the fairness and honesty of the outcome of the Senate vote.''
   Mecham is accused by a House resolution of having broken laws by
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, lending $80,000 to his car
dealership and obstructing justice. Mecham, who also faces a May 17
recall election and a criminal indictment over the $350,000 loan,
has said repeatedly that he is innocent of any wrongdoing.
   Rules approved Thursday by the Senate require a closed
conference at the request of any single senator.

   Greek and U.S. negotiators resumed talks
Monday on a new operating agreement for American military bases in
Greece after 1988.
   During this week's third round of talks, the Americans were
expected to respond to Greece's demand that a new accord be linked
to progress on Greek-Turkish problems, officials said.
   The five-year agreement expires in December. Premier Andreas
Papandeou has said Greece is willing to negotiate a new accord, but
it must be approved in a referendum.
   It was not clear how a recent improvement in Greek-Turkish
relations would affect negotiating positions in the talks.
   Papandreou and Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last month agreed to
start regular bilateral discussions and to set up a ``hot-line''
telephone link between Athens and Ankara. In March, the two NATO
allies came to the brink of war over oil-drilling rights in the
Aegean Sea.
   Since the early 1950s, the United States has operated four
military bases in Greece: two near Athens and two on the southern
island of Crete. Greece gets more than $300 million annually in
U.S. military credits.

   The Reagan administration's policy of keeping
military and espionage blow-ups with the Soviet Union from slowing
a drive for better overall relations is back in operation following
the collision of U.S. and Soviet warships in the Black Sea.
   The United States complained about Soviet actions in last
Friday's incident by summoning Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin to a
20-minute protest meeting with the State Department's third-ranking
officer.
   The department issued a public condemnation.
   Yet Secretary of State George P. Shultz has no plan to dwell on
the incident when he goes to Moscow next week to discuss arms
control, regional issues like Afghanistan and the superpower summit
envisioned for the spring, according to an aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   How much damage will the Black Sea incident do to the broad
range of U.S.-Soviet relations?
   ``Not much,'' the aide said.
   Indeed, the State Department's on-the-record reaction to what
Navy officers called the deliberate and dangerous Soviet bumping of
American warships operating innocently in the Black Sea included
comments that conveyed more exasperation than outrage.
   ``As Secretary of State Shultz said just a week ago, we are
prepared to deal with the best and worst of Soviet behavior,'' said
spokesman Rudolph Boone.
   It is, after all, ``a competetive relationship,'' Boone said.
   The statement reflected the administration policy, since the
rise of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, of keeping
distasteful and bitter bilateral disputes from poisoning efforts to
elicit from Moscow a better human rights record, arms control
compromises and a withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
   Over the past three years, whether the issue has been alleged
Soviet spying, the jailing of U.S. journalist Nicholas Daniloff, or
attacks on American military observers in East Germany, the Reagan
administration has complained _ taken retaliatory action in some
cases _ and then gone back to the bargaining table.
   The most serious bilateral blow-up in recent years _ and the one
that came closest to upsetting overall relations _ was the Daniloff
case. The U.S. News & World Report Moscow correspondent was
arrested in August 1986 on espionage charges and held in prison for
several days, despite President Reagan's unwavering denials that
Daniloff was a spy.
   Daniloff was arrested after U.S. authorities jailed Gennady
Zakharov, a Soviet United Nations employee, who the United States
said really was a spy.
   After long negotiations, the affair was settled by both men
being sent home in a deal that paved the way for Reagan to meet
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a summit in Iceland a month
later.
   Another major controversy erupted over charges that Soviet
intelligence had compromised secrecy at the U.S. embassy in Moscow
_ first by planting bugging devices in a new chancery building and
then by compromising Marine guards responsible for security at the
existing embassy office.
   Concern about the two breaches of security reached their height
in early 1987, after three former Marine guards at the embassy were
arrested on suspicion of letting Soviet agents prowl through secure
areas of the embassy.
   At the time, Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze were trying to achieve a breakthrough on a deal to
limit intermediate range nuclear missiles.
   Although Shultz considered calling off a planned conference with
Shevardnadze in Moscow to work on the arms pact because of the
security problem, he went forward with the meeting.
   By all accounts of his sessions with Gorbachev _ in Geneva in
1985, in Iceland and in Washington last December _ Reagan has
raised the bilateral issues and complained about the alleged spying
and bugging.
   He also has protested attacks by Soviet troops on U.S. military
observers operating in East Germany under post World War II peace
agreements.
   Yet the complaints remain in a separate compartment from the
other issues.
   As Rozanne Ridgway, the assistant secretary of state for
European affairs, has put it: ``There will always be set-backs in a
relationship that is continuously evolving. We will always have our
problems with the Soviet Union; that is inevitable. When they do
things we don't like we tell them; often very forcefully.
   ``The goal is to try to manage the relationship.''

<HEAD>Local School Boards Look To State Leadership On AIDS Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If there's anything local school boards
usually don't like, it's orders from above. But many are finding
they need strong state leadership to overcome community obstacles
to teaching children about AIDS.
   ``This is a unique situation,'' said Katherine Fraser,
co-director of the AIDS education project at the National
Association of State Boards of Education.
   ``In a lot of instances, state requirements are resented and are
counterproductive,'' said Fraser. ``But this is a case where many
local boards are facing opposition in their communities and they're
looking to the state for a requirement. They want to go back to the
community and say, `Look, this is something we're required to do.
Let's figure out how.'''
   Eighteen states require that schoolchildren be taught about the
incurable disease, the school boards group found in a survey last
December. Among those without specific AIDS education requirements
are some states with high concentrations of AIDS cases, including
California, New Jersey and Florida.
   Fraser predicted a flurry of activity in many states in the next
few months, not all of it constructive.
   ``There are states where legislators are putting bill after bill
in front of the legislature, and some of them are not well
considered,'' she said. ``The people putting them forward are not
really familiar with the facts. There's a great deal of confusion
about what ought to be done.''
   One state, Alabama, has a mandatory statewide AIDS curriculum.
But most educators and health professionals, including the national
Centers for Disease Control, say the key to a successful program is
broad community involvement.
   ``There's nothing wrong with saying there are the topics you
have to cover. But getting into curriculum, that should be local,''
said Fraser. ``If parents and the community don't support what the
schools are teaching, the program won't work. Kids have to be
getting the same education at home and at church as they are at
school for it to work.''
   Kansas is a state with what some experts consider a model
policy. The state board requires AIDS instruction and teacher
training. The general goal is to promote sexual abstinence and
fidelity. But what is taught, who teaches it and how it is taught
are decisions made at the local level.
   ``Local school boards were not offering AIDS education because
of local pressure opposing it,'' Kansas state board member Connie
Hubbell told a House committee last week. ``I don't think that
local districts would be teaching about AIDS now without strong
state leadership on the issue.''
   Hubbell said AIDS education ideally should be within the context
of health instruction, because if students don't understand germs
and the immune system, they will not understand AIDS and how to
avoid it.
   ``But if schools don't already have a comprehensive health
program, they can't afford to wait. Young people need information
about AIDS now,'' said Hubbell, a member of the board of directors
of the state school boards group.
   Simply requiring AIDS instruction is not enough, Hubbell added.
She said few states have provided funds for their education
efforts; few have figured out how to reach youths at high risk of
infection, many of whom are not in school; and few have systems to
evaluate and monitor the success of AIDS education in local schools.
   Hubbell said public misconceptions, even among policymakers, are
a formidable barrier to the development of successful AIDS
education programs. For example, she said, a 1987 survey of
California school principals in 47 districts showed that most could
not correctly answer more than seven of 14 factual questions about
AIDS.
   The state school boards group and two other national education
groups have received grants this year from the Centers for Disease
Control to help states develop or strengthen AIDS prevention
policies.
   The grants are part of the $30 million CDC will spend this year
on state prevention efforts targeted at school-age and college
youth. Financial and technical help will be available to all state
departments of education, a CDC official told a House committee
last week.
   The center publishes a bibliography of AIDS teaching resources
and last month published ``Guidelines for School Health Education
to Prevent the Spread of AIDS.'' The guidelines recommend broad
community participation and prescribe instruction in preventive
behavior ranging from abstinence to condom use. The guidelines also
graphically describe what students should know at various age
levels.

   Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's landslide
victory in the presidential election was achieved through
widespread fraud, according to opposition leaders and foreign
observers.
   The 75-year-old president and his governing Colorado Party on
Sunday won an eighth straight term, receiving 88.6 percent of the
vote, Interior Minister Sabino Montanaro announced. Montanaro is
also party president.
   Stroessner, elected to a five-year-term, has governed the nation
of 3.8 million people since taking power in an army coup in 1954.
   One opposition leader was detained during the voting.
   Opposition groups and foreign representatives invited to observe
the voting said they witnessed irregularities that included: the
absence of opposition ballots at polling stations, a lack of closed
booths to ensure secret balloting, voting by underage voters and
ballot box stuffing.
   Stroessner is the Western Hemisphere's longest governing head of
state. Among current world leaders, only North Korea's Kim-Il Sung,
who came to power in 1948, has led a country longer.
   The unofficial final vote tally, announced by the party today,
gave the Colorado Party and Stroessner 1,186,693, or 88.6 percent
of the total cast. A total of 1,446,665 voters were registered.
   The Radical Liberal Party, whose presidential candidate was Sen.
Luis Maria Vega, 65, was a distant second with 96,231 votes, or
7.18 percent. The Liberal Party, led by Rep. Carlos Ferreira
Ybarra, 54, was third with 42,056 votes, or 3.14 percent. Final
returns were expected to be released later today.
   The government said voter turnout was high, but did not provide
a figure. The opposition said turnout was lower than 50 percent in
many urban areas.
   The victory, which Montanaro called proof ``the Colorado Party
with Stroessner holds an absolute majority in the countryside and
the cities,'' also gave the party two-thirds of the 72 House of
Deputies and 36 Senate seats.
   The remaining one-third will be split among the two other
parties according to the proportion of votes the two losers
received.
   The opposition candidates who participated Sunday represented
two of the country's three officially recognized opposition groups.
   The third party, the Febrerista Revolutionary Party, has not
participated in elections or government since 1973.
   Three unrecognized parties, the Authentic Radical Liberal Party,
the Christian Democrats and the Colorado Popular Movement, had
urged voters to boycott the elections.
   Domingo Laino, president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party,
was detained most of Sunday at a government office in Col. Oviedo,
80 miles east of Asuncion, and released when the polls had closed.
   He then held a news conference to denounce the elections.
   ``The fraud of Feb. 14 will not be like others,'' Laino said.
``It will be Stroessner's burial ground.''
   Jo Marie Greisgaber, a U.S. consultant to the Washington-based
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a
Democratic Party entity, said she witnessed underage voters casting
ballots in Col. Oviedo.
   ``We also were told that area cotton farmers had been told
cotton prices would not be increased if they did not vote or that
they would not be able to sell their crops,'' she said.
   A U.S. observer with the same institute, Martin Andersen, said a
car in which he and opposition politicians were riding was stopped
in Ypacarai, 15 miles east of Asuncion, by a group of men in
plainclothes and police uniforms.
   ``We were mistreated without provocation and treated in a
beastly fashion,'' said Andersen.
   He said the car's driver, Carlos Romero Perreira, leader of a
dissident faction of the Colorado Party, was struck several times.
   Uruguayan lawmaker Daniel Lamas said he saw voters barred from
casting ballots in secret as well as individuals casting ``up to 10
ballots.''
   Most opposition rallies at Asuncion and a half-dozen other towns
were peaceful. But in Carapegua, 30 miles south of Asuncion, police
armed with clubs broke up a demonstration, and a rally at Col.
Oviedo was suspended due to fear of violence.
   Last week, the U.S. State Department criticized Stroessner's
government in its 1987 human rights report, which said ``Paraguay
has not had a democratic government since its independence in
1811.''
   In the victory speech, Montanaro promised the government would
promote investment of domestic and foreign capital, combat
unemployment, eliminate slums and shantytowns and distribute land
to poor farmers.
   ``We will continue to be anti-communist,'' he emphasized, ``and
no one will surprise us flirting with Marxism wherever it may be.''

   From gypsy moths in the Shenandoah to wild
pigs in the Great Smokies to creeping kudzu in the West, an
invasion of exotic animal and plant species is threating the
nation's national parks.
   A draft summary of a major, just-completed National Park Service
assessment of the condition of natural and cultural resources lists
``encroachment by plants and animals not native to park
environments'' ahead of any other ``major issues and threats'' to
natural resources.
   Sometimes the invasion is part of the ebb and flow of nature, as
with gypsy moths attacking trees in Virginia's Shenandoah National
Park. Sometimes it is the end of a complex process kicked off by
humans, as in the replacement of sawgrass with cat-tail plants in
the Everglades National Park in Florida as a result of
fertilizer-laden water entering the swamp. That changes the whole
food chain in the park.
   Sometimes it isn't easy to decide, as with the ravages of
vegetation caused by wild pigs in the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina or goats in Olympic
National Park in Washington State, or the invasion of kudzu or
eucalyptus at several sites in the South or West.
   Sometimes nothing can really be done as nature slowly replaces
one species with another over the course of a century or so.
   In an interview, parks director William Penn Mott said: ``In the
Florida everglades we have the invasion of the Brazilian pepper; we
have the invasion of the Australian pine. ... It may be there is no
way on God's green earth that we can eliminate the pepper, for
example. ... Over a period of time, it may be that will be the
ecology of the Florida Everglades.''
   Mott's deputy, Denis P. Galvin, added, ``It seems to me one of
the roles of the national parks is to illustrate that kind of
process.''
   There are few really new individual facts about exotic species
in the study, just their appearance in different places.
   ``What the assessment points out is that exotic plants and
animals are a problem in more places than we would have thought,''
said Galvin.
   The study, launched by Mott when he took over the service two
years ago, is the first of its kind since park managers were asked
to list threats to their units in 1980. Results of the exercise,
which will be repeated every three years, have been computerized
for easy access throughout the park system.
   Funds from new and increased visitor fees will be directed at
what park managers judge the most important problems uncovered in
the assessment. This will mean an extra $52 million a year before
collection expenses, with 10 percent of the net reserved for a
special director's discretionary fund, to be spent on research and
protection of resources or interpretation for visitors.
   Nearly 60 percent of park managers said their installations were
threatened in one way or another, one-third of them by activities
outside park boundaries.
   Most natural resources were judged in fair condition, with only
15 percent described as poor. But the managers said they needed to
undertake 2,500 projects over the next three years at what the
service estimated would be $250 million to $300 million, a sum it
noted ``far exceeds the current NPS budget.''
   For cultural resources _ roughly half the units in the system
commemorate something _ managers said a quarter of the sites, a
third of the buildings and a third of the collections were in good
condition. Most sites and structures that are well-documented ``are
relatively free of serious adverse impacts.''
   ``But the status of many cultural resources is unknown because
of an enormous backlog of historical research, documentation,
inspections and cataloguing,'' the summary said in noting that only
12 percent of its museum collections had been catalogued.
   Major problem categories for natural resources _ many also
listed in the 1980 report _ were described as scars from mining,
grazing or farming; overuse; hunting or poaching; legal mineral
exploitation; loss of water and air quality, as from acid rain; and
development near park boundaries.
   Cultural resources were said to be threatened by weathering and
erosion; vandalism and looting; deficient storage of artifacts; a
paperwork backlog; lack of vegetation control and lack of
specialized expertise.

<TEXT>
   President Mauno Koivisto was re-elected
to a second six-year term today, winning a second-round victory in
an electoral college.
   Koivisto, a Social Democrat, garnered 1.5 million votes in a
general election two weeks ago, but fell just short of the absolute
majority he needed to be directly elected without referring the
vote to the 301-member electoral college.
   Koivisto's return to office was never in doubt, and he planned a
reception for 500 people at the official presidential residence
later today to celebrate his victory.
   Conservative Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, who challenged
Koivisto along with three other contenders, released his delegates
to vote freely after the first round of voting gave Koivisto 144
ballots, 7 shy of a majority.
   In the second round, Koivisto picked up 45 of Holkeri's
delegates for a total of 189. Opposition leader Paavo Vayrynen of
the Center Party won 68 votes and leftist candidate Kalevi Kivistoe
got won 26. Nineteen delegates remained loyal to Holkeri. The fifth
candidate two weeks ago, Jouko Kajanoja, had no electors.

<TEXT>
   A senior magistrate on Monday
criticized the U.S. Consulate for granting a new passport to an
American who faces drug charges.
   ``It is hard to imagine a greater act of irresponsibility by a
foreign official,'' said Deputy Chief Magistrate Bruce Brown at
Sydney's Central Local Court.
   Brown heard that Richard Stephen Rotaru, a 30-year-old law
student from Cleveland who is charged with possessing and supplying
cocaine, was issued a new passport by the consulate after his
application for the return of his old one was refused.
   Rotaru was arrested again during the weekend by an off-duty
detective who recognized him as they were boarding a flight bound
for Honolulu.
   After his arrest Jan. 20, he was released on bail, which
included the surrrender of his passport. He applied for its return
on Feb. 5, but was refused.
   Prosecutor Sgt. Ron Broadhead told the court the U.S. Consulate
then granted Rotaru's request for a new one.
   Rotaru's lawyer said his client believed he was within his
rights in using the passport, thinking he was acting under the
direction of U.S. officials.
   Rotaru was ordered to appear to in the Central Court on Feb. 22.

   Nine years ago the forces of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini overthrew the Peacock Throne of Iran and instituted a
fundamentalist Islamic regime. Now Khomeini is old and sick, and a
bloody war with neighboring Iraq continues. Here is a look from
within Iran by an Associated Press correspondent who visited it
recently.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime is in
firm control as his fundamentalist Islamic revolution begins its
10th year, but a power struggle looms when the 87-year-old
patriarch dies.
   His lieutenants appear to be preparing for Khomeini's death,
which will be a major test for the revolution at a time of war,
economic hardship and increasing international isolation.
   Khomeini is reported in poor health and has sought recently,
after years of reluctance, to eliminate obstacles to economic and
social reform.
   He remains the revered Imam, symbol of an Islamic resurgence
that toppled the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought
Khomeini home in triumph Feb. 1, 1979, after 15 years in exile.
   The old man's messianic charisma and authority have held the
revolution together through the long war with Iraq, and Iran's
other pressing international and domestic problems.
   Jockeying for position in the misty world of Iranian politics
has intensified because of elections for the 270-seat Majlis, or
parliament, scheduled for April 8.
   Chief among the rival camps are the revolutionary purists
personified by Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and those called
pragmatists, who are led by the parliament speaker, Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   No threat is evident to the regime itself despite political
rivalries and domestic grumbling.
   Senior revolutionary leaders acknowledge public discontent but
say economic hardship stems from the war, not the revolution. Iraq
invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border incidents.
   They also claim more public projects have been completed than
under the shah and more has been done for the ``mostathafeen''
(deprived), the millions of slum dwellers and peasants who formed
the bedrock support for Khomeini.
   Streets are full of people searching for bargains in the
well-stocked stores, which are prohibitively expensive, or standing
in long lines outside shops that sell rationed goods at
government-controlled prices.
   Everything is available on the black market _ or ``free
market,'' as the Iranians call it _ at 10 times the official price.
   Hojatoleslam Sadeq Khalkali, a former Islamic prosecutor who
ordered the execution of hundreds of opponents in the revolution's
early days, had this to say about political disagreement during a
recent Majlis debate: ``The brave troops at the front should not be
worried by what may appear to be irreconcilable disagreements.''
   Security remains tight, there is great distrust of foreigners,
and the United States still is the ``Great Satan.''
   Revolutionary Guards, fanatical followers of Khomeini who are
present in every village and city neighborhood, appear to have
stifled resistance.
   Islamic puritanism, pervasive in the early days after Khomeini's
return, has been relaxed somewhat.
   Many women still wear the black head-to-toe chador. A sign
outside Tehran's main bus terminal declares in English and Farsi:
``Women not wearing Islamic garb will not be allowed to enter.''
   Others appear in public wearing only headscarves, however, and
many women use lipstick and makeup. Such ``Western decadence'' a
few years ago would have meant arrest and humiliation by the Gashte
Zahrah, the religious vigilantes who patrol the city in unmarked
cars watching for moral turpitude.
   Gashte Zahrah patrols have not disappeared, but they are less
active.
   Enforcement of the ban on alcoholic beverages also has eased.
Whisky, vodka and other liquor are readily available on the black
market.
   Crowds are large at movie theaters, where the fare generally is
patriotic epics, sagas of ancient Persian glories, or feature films
from Japan or the Soviet Union.
   State-run television's two channels are dominated by religious
and political discussions, war footage and documentaries extolling
Iranian victories.
   The government's efficient security network extends to village
level. Cities, offices, schools and businesses are governed by
Islamic councils, run by loyalists of the regime.
   By Western count two million Iranians, many of them middle
class, have fled rather than put up with Islamic restrictions,
economic privation and sending their sons to the war.
   An estimated 600,000 Iranians have been killed and 750,000
wounded, but foreign diplomats say the conflict has helped
strengthen the revolution despite the cost.
   It has built patriotic fervor in the mass of Persian Iran's
overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem population of about 50 million against
the Iraqis, who are Arabs and ancient enemies.
   ``There's dissatisfaction with the strict Islamic rules imposed
on people and with the economic hardship, but at the same time most
people are proud that Iran has resisted the Iraqi invasion and so
much pressure from the United States,'' one Western diplomat said
privately.
   ``People realize there's little they can do. They live in hope
the war may end soon, either through victory or a settlement, so
that at least their economic hardship will be alleviated.''

   Relations among the three surviving Beatles have
improved but Paul McCartney is ``too moody'' to allow any joint
performances to take place, George Harrison said Monday.
   ``Our relationship is quite good but there's no reunion of any
Beatles,'' he told reporters after returning from Los Angeles. ``We
have been having dinner together. We are friends now, the first
time we have been this close for a long time. But it doesn't mean
to say that we are going to make another group or anything.''
   Harrison has had hits recently in Britain and the United States.
McCartney also has had a successful solo career but Ringo Starr's
last album in 1985 was considered too ho-hum for issue.
   On his feelings towards McCartney, Harrison said: ``I am more
friendly with other musicians. Paul is a bit too moody for me.
Anyway there will never be a Beatles concert because there's only
three of them left.''

   Sports stars like Mike Ditka donated items for
auction and the cast of a musical comedy waited tables at a
fund-raising benefit for a 9-year-old girl who lost her lower legs
after being locked in a freezing room.
   The staff of a new pizza restaurant donated all of Sunday's
receipts to a fund to help pay medical expenses for Darlwin
Carlisle. She was found Jan. 17 trapped in an attic room of an
abandoned house in Gary, Ind.
   Many of the sports figures couldn't attend because they were out
of town, but they donated uniforms, equipment or autographed
pictures, said Cher Patrick, a spokeswoman for Edwardo's Natural
Pizz.
   ``We got an autographed basketball from Michael Jordan of the
Chicago Bulls, a hockey stick from Troy Murray of the Chicago
Blackhawks and an autographed T-shirt from wrestler Hulk Hogan,''
she said. ``A number of the Chicago Bears gave autographed pictures
_ (coach) Mike Ditka, Jim McMahon, Mike Singletary and Walter
Payton. We also got pictures from the Chicago Cubs and sets of
tickets from the Chicago White Sox.''
   Local television personalities took turns waiting tables and
were joined by the cast of a long-running revue, ``Pump Boys and
Dinettes.''
   ``The women in the cast all play waitresses, so they were right
at home on the floor,'' said Ms. Patrick.
   She said the amount of money raised wouldn't be known for a day

   Restaurateur-entertainer Sonny Bono
faces stiff competition from seven other hopefuls in this resort
town's upcoming mayor election, but he has the backing of his
ex-wife, singer-actress Cher.
   When Bono, who turns 53 Tuesday, announced his candicacy more
than a year ago, some opponents called it a ploy to boost business
at his Italian restaurant. When he filed candidacy papers earlier
this month for the April 12 election, some said he lacked the
experience to guide a city with an annual budget of $47 million.
   But Cher, who rocketed to fame as half of the rock group Sonny
and Cher in the mid-1960s and then co-hosted a hit television show
with Bono in the 1970s, says he's got plenty of experience.
   ``When we were together, we must have grossed 50, 60 million
dollars,'' said the star of the current hit film ``Moonstruck.''
``I don't know very many idiots who can boast that.''
   The two split up 14 years ago but have remained friends,
recently appearing on the TV show ``Late Night'' with David
Letterman, where they sang their signature song, ``I've Got You,
Babe.''

   The party spread throughout the French
Quarter today as clear skies and 60-degree weather brought revelers
into the streets for the last day of Carnival before Mardi Gras.
   Many people had the day off for Presidents' Day, and the French
Quarter filled with hard-drinking crowds.
   Much of the party today was aimed at the river front, where a
stand-in for Rex, king of Carnival, was to arrive aboard a Coast
Guard cutter on the Mississippi River to celebrate Mardi Gras Eve,
or Lundi Gras.
   The real Rex won't show up in public until Fat Tuesday, when he
parades through the streets.
   On Sunday, police said even rain didn't seem to affect the
number of people who turned out for the traditional parades on the
Sunday before Mardi Gras.
   Television star Alan Thicke, who plays Jason Seaver on ``Growing
Pains, reigned as this year's god of wine, Bacchus 1988. The Krewe
of Bacchus, in a flashy super-parade that capped the night's
processions, celebrated ``20 Years of Bacchus'' by honoring
previous celebrity gods such as William Shatner, Bob Hope and Danny
Kaye.
   Three men were arrested Sunday after one allegedly dumped a soft
drink onto a police officer and then threw the bottle into the
crowd, where it hit a 3-year-old girl in the face, police said.
   The child was reported in good condition today at a hospital.
   Krewe of Bacchus member Robert Chaney was booked with battery on
a police officer and resisting arrest, police said. In addition,
two bystanders were booked with interfering with a police officer.
   Earlier Sunday, the big street party known as Carnival delighted
parade-goers but made life difficult for florists making
Valentine's Day deliveries.
   ``It hinders delivery and we can't make full service,'' said
Ronnie Scheinuk, vice president of Scheinuk the Florist, a company
started by his grandfather. ``We're right on a parade route.''
   Scheinuk said he had to have a delivery crew of 10 start at 6:30
a.m. to finish by 11:30, a half-hour before the first parade rolled
in front of his store. But there were compensations to being on a
major parade route.
   ``We've had tremendous walk-in business,'' he said.

   Merrill Pollack, a sculptor, writer
and former editor of the Saturday Evening Post, has died after a
short illness at the age of 63.
   Pollack, a New York City native and a resident of Grantsville,
died Sunday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Parkersburg. His family did
not disclose the cause of death.
   In addition to working as editor of the Saturday Evening Post in
Philadelphia, he worked as an executive editor for Viking Press and
was an editor for Simon & Schuster.
   In 1977, Pollack moved to Grantsville, where he sculpted and did
wood carvings. From 1981 to 1986, he was editor of a local

   Unexcused absences at Aurora Central High
School will be punished with three-day suspensions as the school
begins a crackdown on truancy starting Tuesday.
   Principal Marc Stine said the new policy was prompted in part by
an absenteeism rate that at times has seen 350 of the school's
1,600 students absent in a single day.
   ``Our policy is no different from that of 95 percent of the
employers in the world,'' Stine said. ``If you're not going to be
in, they expect you to call. Those are lessons that kids _ that
everybody _ has to learn.''
   A second offense brings a five-day suspension, and more
infractions escalate the penalty to consideration by the
superintendent of ``further action.''
   Stine said the new policy is liberal because officials accept
all kinds of excuses for absences, as long as school work is made
up and parents approve.
   ``For some people the annual elk hunting event is as significant
as Christmas,'' Stine said. ``We will excuse a child as long as he
has his parents' knowledge and approval.''

   A businessman today publicly tied a key Haitian
military official to drug trafficking, and said officials of that
nation's government also were involved.
   Osvaldo Quintana, 35, of Miami told a news conference that he
was going to the media because the federal government was stalling
on promises to protect him.
   Quintana, who said he ran a seafood operation here until he
became involved with the smuggling effort in August 1986, has been
testifying before a federal grand jury in Miami about the Haitian
drug connection.
   He said he met with Col. Jean-Claude Paul, commander-in-chief of
the Dessalines battalion in Port-au-Prince, in December 1986 and
arranged for 100 kilograms of cocaine to be shipped to the United
States. The battalian was blamed for repression of anti-government
demonstrators last summer.
   ``We flew (the shipment) out of his own personal ranch in
Haiti,'' said Quintana. The cocaine was flown through the Bahamas
to Florida, he said.
   Asked if higher Haitian government officials were involved in
the smuggling, Osvaldo said ``yes,'' but refused to identify them.
He and said he would make the names public later.
   Quintana said he was twice tracked by Haitian hit squads, with
one following him the to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
office in Miami where he was meeting with an agent.
   That group was arrested when they were spotted waiting outside
the DEA office, he said, but were released a few days later. A
second group later ran him off a highway. Those men were frightened
away by a Florida Highway Patrol officer who happened by, said
Quintana.
   Quintana's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said Quintana had been warned
by the U.S. attorney's office in Miami in January that he would not
get into the federal witness protection program if he talked to the
media about his case. But despite waiting four weeks, no protection
was arranged for him or his family, he said.
   Quintana testified here last month for the defense in the trial
of self-styled Haitian-American freedom fighter Joel Deeb, on trial
for weapons violations in a plot to overthrow the Haitian
government.
   Quintana testified then that high-level Haitian officials were
involved in drug-smuggling.
   Sources in the U.S. attorney's office have told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymnity that a grand jury here is
investigating Haitian officials allegedly involved in
drug-trafficking. The Miami Herald has identified Paul as a target
of the probe.

<TEXT>
   Opening of negotiations and relative
quiet on the warfront have sparked a glimmer of hope that two
decades of savage conflict in Cambodia can be solved through
political compromise rather than more bloodshed.
   After an 8-year-long stalemate, two rounds of peace talks were
recently held between key protagonists: Cambodian resistance leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun Sen of the pro-Hanoi
regime in Cambodia.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, now says that if an
acceptable political solution is reached, it may withdraw its
troops before an announced 1990 pull-out. And Moscow has indicated
it wants to heal itself of two festering Asian sores: Cambodia and
Afghanistan.
   Although negotiations in Paris last December and January did not
produce a mutually acceptable blueprint for peace, both sides say
they are working toward freedom from outside interference and an
end to Cambodia's cycle of agony. Since 1970, Cambodia has suffered
a devastating five-year war; a reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge;
the Vietnamese invasion; and a continuing guerrilla war. Millions
have perished.
   Deep suspicions of Vietnam's motives remain, as do fears of a
return to power of the brutal Khmer Rouge. And analysts are puzzled
by the moves of the unpredictable prince, who on Jan. 30 resigned
as head of a three-party resistance coalition and who regularly
lashes out at his partners-in-war.
   The 65-year-old Sihanouk _ onetime king, consummate survivor,
enduringly popular leader _ headed a coalition of the communist
Khmer Rouge, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and his
own followers fighting the Vietnamese. China arms the coalition.
The Soviet Union fuels Vietnam's war machine.
   Stressing that Vietnam was eager to attract investment from the
West, Hanoi adviser Nguyen Xuan Oanh admitted recently the war in
Cambodia was ``a very costly proposition. It has drained our
resources.'' Besides the burden of keeping about 140,000 troops in
Cambodia, the opportunity costs are great: most non-Soviet bloc
nations continue to shun Vietnam, insisting on a troop withdrawal
before engaging in full trade and aid relations with Hanoi.
   Also widely seen as helping the process of political settlement
are the rise of seemingly more flexible leaders: Mikhail Gorbachev
in Moscow, Deng Xiaoping's followers in Peking, and Vietnamese
Communist Party chief Nguyen van Linh in Hanoi. China cites the
Vietnamese grip on Cambodia as a key barrier to detente with
Moscow, which appears to be seeking closer ties with Peking.
   Changes are also perceived in the military situation. ``I can't
tell you who is winning the war in Cambodia ... but presently both
sides are turning to political means instead of fighting on the
battlefield,'' says Lt. Gen. Sihadaj Bunnag, spokesman of
Thailand's military command.
   Several Western analysts interviewed agree that in recent months
fighting has decreased substantially, although reasons given for
this are largely speculative.
   Rather than seeking combat, one theory says, the resistance
guerrillas are concentrating on grass-roots organization and
propaganda, trying to solidify support for their respective groups
in event action shifts to the political arena.
   Militarily, the balance appears to be unchanged from recent
years: the estimated 50,000-strong fighters of the coalition can't
defeat the Vietnamese but would probably rout the weak, pro-Hanoi
Cambodian army if Hanoi pulled out. The Khmer Rouge remains the
most powerful military force within the coalition.
   For many Western and Thai analysts a ``worst case scenario''
would be Vietnamese entrenchment in Cambodia; continued warfare;
the indefinite existence of 250,000 Cambodian refugees along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   Perhaps the most optimistic future envisioned by Western
observers is a Vietnamese pull-out; a coalition government in
Cambodia with Sihanouk as a major figure; and a withering away of
the Khmer Rouge through defections of younger conscripts and
general hatred of a force robbed of its major appeal: fighting a
foreign invader.
   Sihanouk himself outlines a ``quadripartite provisional
government,'' including the three coalition members and the Hun Sen
side. This foursome would work on organizing general elections
under international supervision and be backed by a four-party
national army.
   Sihanouk appears to be key to the question of peace or war in
Cambodia. He still enjoys widespread domestic popularity and by far
the greatest backing internationally among the coalition's leaders.
His latest maneuvers may be designed to get the fractious coalition
solidly behind his negotiation efforts.
   Since his resignation, the two coalition partners have come
begging for his return. China, although the staunchest backer of
the Khmer Rouge, stressed its support. Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang praised Sihanouk as ``a great patriot and experienced
politician.'' Should the coalition sides ever compete for power in
Phnom Penh, Sihanouk would need Peking's help in curbing the Khmer
Rouge.

<HEAD>Trial Begins Tuesday In Amtrak's Worst Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trial opens Tuesday for a former Conrail
engineer accused of 16 counts of manslaughter by locomotive in
Amtrak's worst fatal crash, a January 1987 accident that killed 16
people and injured more than 170.
   Rick L. Gates was operating three linked Conrail locomotives
that prosecutors say ran a stop signal in Chase, Md., on Jan. 4,
1987, and ended up in front of an Amtrak passenger train that was
traveling about 120 mph.
   Federal investigators say Gates, 33, failed to notice the stop
signals because of drug and possibly alcohol use. Gates has denied
smoking marijuana while operating the train.
   Testimony likely will focus on drug use, warning whistles and
lights in the cab, and a series of approach signals to the switch
where four tracks converge to two at the Gunpowder River railroad
bridge crossing.
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday in Baltimore County
Circuit Court for Gates' trial on 16 counts of manslaughter. Each
count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a
$1,000 fine.
   A county grand jury's indictment accuses Gates, of Essex, Md.,
of ``gross negligence'' in the operation of the locomotives.
   Gates' charges fall under the same law normally used against
people accused of negligence in automobile accidents. Prosecutors
have said this is the first time the manslaughter by locomotive
statute has been used in Maryland.
   Gates, who worked for Conrail for 14 years, has said signals
indicated he should slow down and proceed through the switch.
   But the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that
Gates failed to notice track signals or emergency warnings in the
cab because he was impaired by marijuana and possibly alcohol.
   Blood tests taken immediately after the accident showed both
Gates and brakeman Edward Cromwell had traces of marijuana in their
bodies, but a recent court ruling in a different case could hamper
prosecutors.
   The men were tested under a Federal Railroad Administration rule
requiring urine or blood samples of any worker involved in a
serious accident, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco ruled last week that such tests are unconstitutional.
   The railroad administration has said it will appeal and the
ruling's effect on the trial remains uncertain. It stands as
official precedent only in the circuit court's area, but may affect
judicial thinking elsewhere.
   Even if the evidence is allowed, prosecutors must prove Gates
was impaired by the drugs, not just that he was using them.
   The trial could have implications for government control over
train operators and for more than $294 million in civil suits
arising from the crash. The railroad administration has said the
crash already has helped it in its battle for jurisdiction over
licensing and training of engineers.
   The federal government had no authority to punish Gates or
Cromwell, both of whom resigned from Conrail. Cromwell has been
granted immunity and is expected to testify that he and Gates
fabricated a story to cover up their marijuana smoking on the train.
   Defense attorneys, according to chief public defender Donna
Shearer, will try to discredit Cromwell by pointing out he ran from
the scene while Gates stayed to ``help save lives.''
   Gates' attorneys also say they will present evidence that the
track signals often malfunction, contrary to official statements.

   Sen. Terry Sanford gave the traditional
reading Monday of George Washington's farewell address to a nearly
empty Senate chamber Monday.
   The first-term Democrat from North Carolina took 52 minutes to
read the 7,641-word address, which is traditionally the only item
on the Senate's agenda when the chamber celebrates Washington's
birthday. The Senate has followed the tradition since 1896.
   The fastest reading was 39 minutes by Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, in
1975, while the slowest was an hour and eight minutes in 1962 by
Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-W.Va.
   Only three other legislators were present Monday: Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss.;
and Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont.
   Washington's farewell address, which includes his famous
admonition against entangling alliances with Europe, was originally
written, not spoken. It was first published in the Philadephia
Daily American Advertiser on Sept. 19, 1796.

   Vice President George Bush stumped through
New Hampshire Monday from fast food restaurants to a retirement
home appealing to voters to help him turn back the challenge from
Bob Dole in Tuesday's primary.
   ``I'm going to win tomorrow,'' he told a cheering crowd at
Daniel Webster College. ``Believe me.''
   He said in a television interview that Dole was making the same
mistake Bush himself made in 1980 when he thought that winning the
Iowa caucuses would give him the momentum to carry New Hampshire.
Ronald Reagan soundly defeated Bush here eight years ago after
being upset in Iowa.
   ``I want New Hampshire to do what it did in 1980. ... '' Bush
said on the CBS Morning News. ``Bob Dole is talking momentum and
I'm talking issues on taxes and holding the line on the oil import
fee and on presidential leadership, and I think it's working, so I
want New Hampshire to correct Iowa's mistakes.
   Bush's once strong lead in New Hampshire polls has evaporated
and polls now show the race as a virtual dead heat between the vice
president and the Senate minority leader from Kansas.
   Bush, who finished third in Iowa behind Dole and Pat Robertson,
called Dole's proposal for a budget freeze ``a cop-out because it
avoids the tough decisions.''
   Speaking to elderly residents at a nursing home, Bush called
Dole's plan a ``straitjacket'' that would limit Social Security
cost-of-living increases to two percent.
   Dole has said a two percent COLA cap is one possibility, but he
has also suggested exempting Social Security from a freeze.
   Bush said his own ``leadership freeze'' would achieve a balanced
budget by 1993 without touching Social Secutiy or raising taxes.
   At Bush's side were large posters sitting on tripods that
outlined the two plans in big letters.
   Bush's theme all day was that he was a leader with experience
who had been loyal to President Reagan for the last eight years.
   Crowds were sparse on this Washington's Birthday holiday morning
as Bush, informally dressed in a blue ski jacket, made three
breakfast stops.
   He joined two families on a ski trip at a Bickford's Family
Restaurant for pancakes and bacon, sipped coffee with the customers
at a Dunkin' Donuts, and munched an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's
while chatting with an army sergeant.
   At the retirement home, Bush said, ``I stood with our president
through thick and thin and some suggested that hurt me in one state
or another. But you see, in our family, loyalty is a strength. It's
not all weakness.''
   On the CBS Morning News, Bush said, ``You can't live by the
polls. I've got more delegates now than the rest of them by far _
New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan. Whoever gets the most delegates
will be nominated, but I want to do well here.''

<TEXT>
   The government of the
Bophuthatswana tribal homeland has ``unleashed a reign of terror''
since a coup attempt was crushed last week, a prominent clergyman
said Monday.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, said hundreds of people from the home area of
the coup leaders had been harassed or detained by soldiers of
Bophuthatswana and South Africa.
   South African troops put down the coup hours after rebel
soldiers in the nominally independent black territory seized its
president and several top officials Wednesday.
   Col. David George, police spokesman in Bophuthatswana, said 374
people had been detained in a continuing police operation.
   He would not comment on reports that most belonged to the
Progressive People's Party. Party leader Rocky Malebane-Metsing was
installed briefly as president during the 15-hour coup and remains
at large.
   The Star newspaper in Johannesburg quoted sources it did not
identify as saying five members of the homeland parliament from the
party were taken from their homes Thursday.
   The highest-ranking soldier in the rebellion, Warrant Officer
Timothy Phiri, and other alleged army rebels were charged with
treason, which carries the death penalty, the South African Press
Association reported.
   It said later that Phiri was not among the first 33 accused
soldiers, who appeared in magistrate's court Monday in Mmabatho,
capital of the homeland.
   Chikane said those detained included members and officials of
Malebane-Metsing's party abd people thought to have voted for it
last year.
   He said a crackdown could provoke ``massive resistance that may
result in a violent confrontation between the South African-backed
bantustan (homeland) forces and the people of Bophuthatswana.''
   Anti-apartheid activists condemn the homeland system as an
attempt by white authorities to divide and weaken the black
majority. About half South Africa's 26 million blacks live in the
10 tribal homelands.
   Bophuthatswana, with a population of 1.7 million people in seven
separate parcels of land, is one of four homelands South Africa has
designated as independent. They are not recognized abroad.

   Hundreds of snowbound motorists spent the
night in their cars, on farms and in National Guard armories when a
blizzard clogged major roads for nearly 24 hours in southwestern
Minnesota, authorities said Monday.
   ``We had numerous people, a hundred would not be stretching it,
who spent the night away from home on farms, in addition to the
people who got to town and stayed there,'' said Les Muck, a State
Patrol dispatcher in Marshall.
   Less than an inch of snow actually fell, but wind blowing up to
45 mph picked up more than a foot of snow cover from the ground
Sunday afternoon. The blowing snow cut visibility to zero and piled
up in drifts up to seven feet high, Muck said.
   The State Patrol closed about a 100-mile stretch of Interstate
90 from the South Dakota border to 10 miles east of Jackson on
Sunday afternoon and did not reopen it until late Monday morning,
Muck said. Several other highways and county roads also were closed
during that period, he said.
   There were numerous multi-vehicle accidents with injuries, but
no fatalities were reported, he said.
   Elsewhere, snow blown by wind gusting to 60 mph cut visibility
and forced Wyoming police to close a 99-mile stretch of Interstate
80 between Cheyenne and Laramie for about four hours Monday morning.
   More than 300 motorists sought shelter in Minnesota National
Guard armories in Worthington, Redwood Falls and Jackson, Muck said.
   The Worthington armory had travelers from as far away as
Tennessee, said National Guard 1st Sgt. Ron Balster.
   ``We got 200 furniture blankets from U-Haul,'' Balster said.
``We got paper towels from Campbell Soup. And people have brought
in all kinds of food. There are sandwiches, chicken. One person
just brought in two gallons of milk.''
   ``We had 12 cars up here at one time fighting to get in the door
for one room,'' said Lucille Thorn, manager of the Oxford Motel in
Worthington.
   Many people spent the night in motel lobbies and meeting rooms.
   Tim and Julie Burns of Luverne and their three children _ ages
11 months, 5 years and 8 years _ were among those stranded on I-90
for hours before reaching the armory in Jackson.
   Mrs. Burns said traffic came to a standstill in near zero
visibility Sunday afternoon about 10 miles east of Worthington.
   ``We were on empty (gas tank) and I was really nervous about
that and I told my husband we had to get to another car,'' she said
in a telephone interview from the armory Monday morning.
   A couple from St. Paul offered to let them get in their car,
``so the five of us sat in the back of their car for almost nine
hours, just keeping warm,'' Mrs. Burns said. ``They had a full
tank.''
   Temperatures in the area were in the single digits Sunday
afternoon and 0 to 10 below zero overnight with a wind chill of 20
to 40 below, the National Weather Service said.
   Finally, plows were able to clear the opposite side of the
highway.
   ``Around 1 a.m., we saw cars going in the opposite direction and
one of them stopped,'' she said. ``It was two guys from Sioux City
(Iowa) ... and they said they'd take us to Jackson. And, with our
kids, we wanted to get out of the car and to the armory in Jackson
where we had some space.''
   The family got to the armory around 3 a.m.
   The low visibility and high drifts kept plows and rescue
vehicles off many roads until early Monday, said Lorren Simon,
another patrol dispatcher in Marshall.
   ``Finding stranded travelers is a frustrating process,'' he
said. ``You can't use strong enough language on them. They'll go
out anyway and then they think the public officials should come out
and rescue them when you can't go up and down the road. They get
real perturbed when someone doesn't go out there.''
   Muck said it appeared that all motorists who stayed in their
cars overnight made it out safely when the roads were reopened
Monday morning. ``We've gotten no calls that anybody is missing,''
he said.
   Strong wind also hit sections of northwestern and western
Minnesota on Sunday, forcing the patrol to close I-94 at Fergus
Falls and U.S. 10 in Detroit Lakes for a time. But outside of
southwestern Minnesota, the wind died down overnight in most areas
of the state.

   Army troops will guard polling places
during next month's national elections to prevent a repeat of the
violence that left at least 100 people dead in last week's local
balloting, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad said Monday.
   Anti-government leaders and at least two former members of
Ershad's cabinet are urging voters to boycott the March 3 voting,
contending that Ershad is incapable of holding free and fair
elections.
   Ershad said the army, local police and other security will be
deployed nationwide to prevent similar clashes next month.
   ``They have a special role to play in ensuring free and smooth
exercise of the right of franchise by the voters,'' he told a
meeting of the village defense forces at Shafipur, about 25 miles
northwest of here.
   Political leaders have demanded the army be posted during the
polling. Main opposition leaders, however, have urged citizens to
stay away from the polls.
   The opposition's four-month campaign against the government is
led by Sheik Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The two women have led several
protest marhces and strikes to demand Ershad's resignation.
   Ershad, a former army general who seized power in 1982, has
refused to resign and dissolved parliament in December in the face
of the opposition campaign.
   Two former cabinet ministers in Ershad's government, who
resigned last month in protest, also have called for scrapping the
elections.
   ``The forthcoming elections will push the country on to the path
of dangerous confrontation,'' said former Health Minister
Salahuddin Quader Choudhury and Information Minister Anwar Zahid.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party, which held 212 of the 330 seats in
parliament, and 73 minor parties are taking part in the elections.
The main opposition contends elections held under Ershad in 1986
were rigged.
   Fear seems to be a key factor in whether people would risk a
trip to the polls. While the government says 100 people died in the
violence Wednesday, Hasina claims 500 people were killed and 15,000
injured.
   Giasuddin Ahmed, 40, who was seriously injured last week, said
he would ``never go for the voting ever in my life.''
   Recovering in the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, he said:
``Hooliganism, bombings and killings have destroyed elections as a
means to change the government. I shall never be a party to such an
exercise.''
   A politicial commentator, Amanullah Kabir, said last week's
violence showed the government did not have the resources to keep
the peace at polling places.
   Opposition leaders say the government may make mass arrests
before the national elections.
   ``The government has two options: either postpone the polls or
go for a direct crackdown on us,'' said Dilip Barua, a member of
the eight-party alliance led by Hasina.
   The election commission had to reschedule the local contests.
The commission said balloting would be held at 4,414 voting centers
on March 16.

   Fear of retribution
pervades this Arab village, which the Israeli army sealed off after
four Palestinian youths claimed soldiers buried them alive with a
bulldozer.
   ``Seven men and four women dug up the kids,'' said Rasmi Said
Hamdan, a teacher who reported seeing everything from his home on
Feb. 5. ``They used their bare hands. Two of them were completely
buried and two had their heads sticking out, their mouths full of
mud.
   ``Usually this is a very quiet village. A lot of people worked
with the Israelis. But because they (the villagers) have talked to
the press, there is a feeling that the authorities will take
revenge.''
   The army detained two soldiers Sunday and an official
investigation began Monday. Roads into the community of 4,000
people are blocked with huge piles of dirt, and villagers said the
only two telephones in Kfar Salem have been cut off.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander of the West Bank,
said: ``Even in my worst dreams, I would never imagine such a thing
even though I constantly warn commanders to expect the most awful
things that could happen when soldiers find themselves all of a
sudden commanding and deciding the lives of citizens.''
   Mitzna said on army radio a sergeant-major from the military
government and two or three other soldiers were involved and would
be brought to trial. Military sources said the army did not learn
of the alleged burial until a week after it happened.
   ``I am afraid. I thought I was going to die,'' said one of the
four young men, 19-year-old Abdel Latif Mahmoud Ishtiah, soon after
a military investigator questioned him on Monday. ``I dream about
it all the time.''
   Ishtiah was interrogated in a white police van parked on the
muddy road just outside the village entrance.
   He and the others claim Israeli soldiers seized them after a
demonstration in Kfar Salem that became violent, as have so many
since riots began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
He said the soldiers beat and kicked them and forced them to remove
rocks from the main road.
   Finally, they say, they were ordered to lie on the ground and a
bulldozer covered them with 12 to 16 inches of mud and dirt.
   Assam Shafi Taher Ishtiah, 20, from the same family as Abdel
Latif, said he spent eight days in the hospital after the burial
recovering from cuts and bruises on both legs.
   On Monday, he was in bed at his home, surrounded by friends and
family members. He said four soldiers had burst into the house and
arrested him.
   ``They took me to the entrance of the village, beat me with
clubs and kicked me,'' he said, and more soldiers brought the three
other youths. ``They told us to take the stones from the road,'' he
said. ``After they were removed, they told us to move them five
meters farther.''
   About 40 soldiers were at the scene under the command of an
officer, Assam Ishtiah said. He said a Jewish settler also was
present, and accused the settler of complicity.
   ``The officer took us one at a time and beat us,'' he said.
   All four say they were ordered to lie on the ground, face down,
and the bulldozer covered them.
   ``I didn't know what was going to happen,'' Assam Ishtiah said.
``I thought they would arrest us. I thought they would arrest me
and take me to jail.''
   The soldiers left quickly and neighbors ran to the scene and
began digging the young men out.
   After interrogation Monday, Abdel Latif Ishtiah emerged from the
police van helped by two villagers. Both his hands were bandaged to
midforearm.
   Ishtiah said the Jewish settler had kicked him in the groin and
incited the soldiers to bury the four Palestinians. He said another
of the young men, 25-year-old Mustapha Abdelmajid Hamdan, speaks
Hebrew and heard the settler tell the soldiers: ``Well done.''
   Villagers claimed an official from the Israeli military
government told the muktar, or village leader, the piles of dirt
would be removed from the roads when the village apologized for the
stone-throwing that started the trouble.
   Residents of Elon Moreh, a nearby Jewish settlement, expressed
shock.
   ``I heard about it last night and I said it cannot be,'' said a
settler who guards the gate and would identify himself only as
Eliezer. ``They (the army) will punish them.''
   Daniel Binun, another settler, said: ``We have a basic argument
with our (Arab) cousins about whose place this is, but we don't
have to take the law into our own hands.''

<HEAD>VIENNA: a few.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We others in my generation went under in the machinery of war,
in fear and in the effort to survive. In the dreadful run of a war,
only one thing is certain: death knows no fronts. I say that
because at the end of a war, there are always the wounds, the
widows and the families without fathers. Above all, let us never
forget that the systematic and perfected destruction of European
Jews by the NS (Nazi) regime was added to the horrors of this war.
It must be a holy duty for us to do everything so that the crimes
of this time are never repeated again.
   The war years were a bitter period of learning which I have not
spoken much about and did not want to speak much about. Perhaps
that was a mistake, but it was certainly not a strategy of covering
up. We were all happy then, when the war was over, and tried
together to build a better and more humane world.
   I drew one lesson from this time: I wanted to help assure that
there would never be war again. I wanted to work for peace. I was
able to do this as an ambassador and foreign minister of Austria
and as secretary-general of the United Nations for 10 years.
   My fellow citizens: You can measure, on the basis of my life
since 1945, whether or not I have overcome the bitter
apprenticeship of the war.
   You can judge for yourselves whether your president is the young
lieutenant _ or even the distorted picture of this officer of the
Wehrmacht _ or whether your president is a man who, for decades of
his life, worked for justice, tolerance and peace. I ask you to
form your own judgment.
   My Austrians: In the course of the new discussion the question
was also put about my premature departure from this office of
federal president. I want to take a stand in all clarity: You, my
dear Austrians, have elected me federal president with a convincing
majority in a secret and direct election for six years. Thus it is
no longer a matter of the man Kurt Waldheim. In view of the
slanders, I have often asked myself in the last two years, whether
I should carry on all that.
   It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that an election
result cannot be subsequently corrected. It is, however, also a
question of justice and fairness toward the person, as well as the
respect for the highest office in the state. A head of state must
not retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and
wholesale condemnations. We certainly don't want such methods to be
used against other democratic institutions in other situations. Let
us not endager the self-respect and self-consciousness of our
state. It is a question of belief in our fatherland.
   I see my duty as president in ensuring the functioning of the
basic principles and the institutions of our republic. It cannot
serve this duty if the president retreats in the face of outside
pressure and so puts into question the meaning of democratic
decisions. Such a step could become the beginning of a development
which would bring new and much more serious difficulties. Since the
beginning of my term in office, I bound myself to the thought of
reconciliation and cooperation and continue to profess these
principles very deeply _ despite all the intolerance of my
opponents.
   At the same time, I would like to make clear that I will
decisively confront things I cannot be expected to bear. There must
be no doubt about one thing, only if the polemics stop in Austria
itself, can we expect the debate abroad to calm down. Therefore I
appeal to all Austrians, in particular to all politically
responsible (leaders) in our homeland not to pour oil onto the fire
and to put the interests of the state before party political
interests. The consciousness of the state must always be stronger
than that which may divide us.
   My dear countrymen, you can trust me as you trusted two years
ago when you elected me as federal president. Those people who
spread intolerance and discord cannot be allowed to prevail, but
rather the great majority of those for whom it is a question of our
homeland, of our common Austria. If we want this, we will do it
together and can form the future with new strength.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Kidnap Three More Mayors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leftist guerrilla group that has
launched the biggest rebel offensive in Colombia has claimed
responsibility for the weekend kidnap of eight mayors and three
reporters, police said Monday.
   The National Liberation Army, known as the ELN, said the
abductions are linked with nationwide March 13 mayoral elections,
according to Gov. Eduardo Assaf of northern Norte de Santander
state, who spoke in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio
chain RCN.
   The radio chain Caracol's station in northeast Cucuta city
reported that a person claiming to be with the ELN said in an
anonymous telephone call Saturday that the kidnapped people would
be used to carry messages to the government.
   The kidnap victims would be released soon, the ELN reportedly
told Caracol.
   The rebel group was commemorating the 22nd anniversary Monday of
the death of its founder, a Catholic priest, Camilo Torres. Torres
was killed in a battle with army troops.
   Torres was an admirer of Cuba's Fidel Castro. The insurgent
group still looks toward Castro for ideological leadership.
   All eight mayors and three reporters were kidnapped in northeast
Colombia between Friday night and Sunday afternoon, the police
statement said.
   The last three mayors to be kidnapped on Saturday night and
early Sunday, were Jairo Camargo, of Chitaga in Norte de Santander,
and Edilberto Mejia of Cerritos and Gonzalo Duarte of Carcasi,
towns in Santander state.
   Kidnapped earlier Saturday were the mayors of two more Norte de
Santander towns, Jorge Suarez of Convencion and Ricaute Paez of
Ocana.
   Also kidnapped early Saturday was Daniel Palacios of Morales, in
Bolivar state. He was released hours later.
   Kidnapped Friday were Eduardo Solano of Aguachica, in Cesar
state, and Ramiro Numa of Teorama in Norte de Santander.
   A mayoral candidate in the Norte de Santander town of Gambita,
Antonio Hurtado, disappeared and his family fears he, too, was
kidnapped by the guerrillas, the Bogota daily El Espectador said.
   In Cucuta, the ELN kidnapped two Cucuta radio reporters and a
correspondent for the daily Vanguardia Liberal of Bucaramanga, the
police said.
   Police in Bucaramanga raided an ELN hideout Sunday night and
arrested six people, Col. Orlando Montenegro, the chief of national
police in that northeast city, said in an interview with RCN.
   The police found 776 pounds of dynamite and a car bomb that was
being assembled, the colonel said.
   The ELN began an offensive last month, setting off bombs,
attacking towns and ambushing army patrols.
   The drive keyed on Colombia's main oil pipeline that carries
215,000 barrels of crude a day from the Canon Limon field in
northeast Arauca state.
   The field, along the Venezuelan border, is operated by the
Occidental Petroleum company of Bakersfield, Calif.
   The 500-mile pipeline goes to Puerto Covenas on the Caribbean
coast.
   The ELN blew up the pipeline 12 times in the last two weeks.
Colombia had to suspend its oil exports of 180,000 barrles a day
for three weeks because of the bomb damage.
   The ELN also set off a car bomb Feb. 5 in Bogota, damaging
Occidental's Colombian offices and injuring two guards.

   Tens of thousands of documents were stolen from a
U.S.-run Nazi records center, prosecutors said Monday, but there
was no evidence to back a report they were used to blackmail former
members of the Nazi party.
   Volker Kaehne, spokesman for the Berlin Justice Department, said
investigators suspect the deputy director of the Nazi archives was
involved in the theft of Nazi-era documents from the American-run
Berlin Document Center.
   ``Our investigation so far indicates that the documents were
stolen for profit,'' he said. ``There is no evidence to indicate
suggestions that they were used for blackmail.''
   Kaehne said investigators suspect tens of thousands of documents
were removed from the center, a former telephone tapping center for
the Gestapo, or Nazi secret police.
   The Berlin Morgenpost newspaper, in its Tuesday editions, said
West German authorities have been told for years of suspicions that
documents were being taken from the center.
   An unidentified dealer offered British historian David Irving,
an expert on the Nazi era, documents that allegedly came from the
center nearly a decade ago, the newspaper said.
   Irving told West German authorities of the incident, the paper
said; the officials launched an investigation, but the probe was
later dropped due to a lack of evidence.
   The newspaper cited no sources for its report, which was given
in advance to The Associated Press.
   On Monday, Kaehne acknowledged an investigation into missing
documents at the center was begun in 1983 but dropped for lack of
progress in 1986. He said that inquiry was resumed last summer
after an anonymous tip to authorities.
   The Berlin Morgenpost said Sunday that 80,000 files were missing
from the center and former Nazis paid millions to keep their pasts
secret and the documents from being made public.
   It said many documents contained ``secret information about
leading figures in the Third Reich.''
   In its Tuesday report, the newspaper said those blackmailed
included lawyers, doctors and artists who belonged to Nazi-approved
professional organizations during Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Kaehne said prosecutors believe the missing documents may have
been sold to dealers and collectors around the world for
considerable sums.
   ``There is evidence that some of these documents were sold for
sums of up to 5,000 marks ($2,900) apiece,'' he said in a statement.
   Kaehne said several West German dealers are targets of the
investigation.
   He said authorities recovered about 1,500 documents, including a
letter from Hitler's doctor and correspondence from high-ranking
Nazi leaders.
   He did not say where the documents were found, but Morgenpost
said some documents were seized during a police raid on a Hamburg
dealer.
   Thomas Homan, spokesman for the U.S. mission in Berlin, could
not be reached for comment on Monday, a U.S. holiday.
   On Sunday, he confirmed a criminal investigation into missing
documents was under way and said U.S. officials were cooperating
with West Berlin prosecutors.

<HEAD>Sends Shudder Through Buildings In Las Vegas, 105 Miles Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first announced nuclear weapon test
of 1988 rocked the Nevada desert Monday and sent a shudder through
some high-rise buildings in Las Vegas, 105 miles from ground zero.
   The device produced an explosive punch up to 11 times as
powerful as the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima.
   The test was conducted three weeks after a team of Soviet
nuclear scientists visited the top secret Nevada Test Site _ a
visit that could lead to the monitoring of each other's tests and a
possible test ban.
   And it came the same day the second round of U.S.-Soviet
negotiations on nuclear testing began in Geneva with the Soviets
calling for agreement by June on anti-cheating provisions. That
would permit ratification of two superpower treaties limiting the
yield of test blasts.
   The test, code named Kernville, was delayed two hours because of
unfavorable wind conditions, then another 10 minutes because of
technical problems, according to Department of Energy spokeswoman
Barbara Yoerg.
   The experiment was buried 1,800 feet below the surface of Pahute
Mesa, about 105 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Managers of tall buildings in Las Vegas were warned in advance
not to have workers in precarious positions at the time of the
blast, a standard warning when tests are close to the upper test
limit of 150 kilotons of explosive force.
   Motion was recorded on DOE seismographs at the Riviera Hotel on
the Las Vegas Strip, the Regency Towers Apartments here, and
Scotty's Castle in Death Valley, Calif., southwest of the test site.
   A telephone operator at the high-rise Fitzgerald Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas said hanging plants swayed in the seconds after
the 10:10 a.m. PST detonation. But a controller at McCarran
International Airport control tower reported feeling no motion.
   Ms. Yoerg said she felt no ground motion at the control point,
41 miles from ground zero.
   The blast measured 5.4 on the Richter scale of ground motion at
the National Earthquake Information Center, Golden, Colo.
   ``Everything was fully contained. That makes it a successful
test,'' she said.
   Ms. Yoerg said the test was ``weapons-related'' and sponsored by
Livermore National Laboratory in California.
   It brought to 675 the total number of announced blasts at the
Nevada Test Site since testing began there in 1951. It was the
470th test announced by the United States since the limited test
ban treaty of August 1963, she said.
   The most recent previous test was Mission Cyber, fired on Dec.
2, 1987. There were 15 announced tests last year and 12 announced
tests in 1986. Not all tests are announced for security reasons,
the DOE says.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech Shuts Down Nuke Reactor Amid Safety Concerns,
Controvery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Tech shut down its controversy-plagued
nuclear reactor Monday and the school's president said it would
remain idle at least until safety concerns are resolved and might
never be restarted.
   Tech President John P. Crecine said the school was voluntarily
suspending all reactor operations not already halted by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, pending full NRC approval of the school's
reactor operations.
   The NRC already has suspended irradiation experiments at the
24-year-old reactor on Tech's intown Atlanta campus, following a
mishap resulting in some apparent contamination in the reactor
building last summer.
   ``This move does not in any way reflect concern on my part with
the safety of the reactor operations now or in the immediate
past,'' Crecine said at a news conference. ``It does reflect my
belief that normal, safe and efficient operations of this research
facility are becoming increasingly difficult with the publicity
....''
   Crecine, who characterized the reactor's troubles as ``basically
internal staff problems,'' said the reactor will not resume
operations until its staff is upgraded and the NRC lifts the
irradiation experiment ban and favorably reviews safety procedures.
   He said a permanent shutdown of the troubled reactor operation
is ``certainly a possibility.''
   ``Continuing operation of the reactor is dependent on the
operating and political costs incurred by Georgia Tech,'' Crecine
said.
   Crecine also defended last Thursday's firing of two reactor
staff physicists who had complained about safety problems. Tech had
already decided to ``upgrade the professional quality'' of the
reactor staff, he said, and the two technicians were dismissed as
part of that effort.
   The two workers were among three members of the health physics
staff directly responsible for reactor safety, Crecine said. The
third, a manager, has been transferred.
   The irradiation experiments which the NRC ordered halted
constituted about 20 percent of the work done at the reactor. Much
of the reactor's other operations are conducted for ``non-Georgia
Tech interests,'' such as other universities and for medical
researchers, Crecine said.
   Shutdown of the reactor ``will have an impact'' at Tech, where
about 100 undergraduate students participate in nuclear engineering
classes utilizing the facility, he said.
   The NRC last week blasted Tech, saying safety conditions at the
reactor had not improved significantly since last May, when the
school said it would correct numerous problems at the facility.
``Lack of adequate management'' at the reactor apparently
jeopardized the safety of workers and the public, the NRC said in a
report.

   Heat and hot water have returned after long
absence to the rundown Brooklyn apartment building where the
landlord is serving a 15-day sentence of house arrest, tenants said
Monday.
   But no other repairs are apparent, tenants said.
   Landlord Morris Gross, 76, entered the building Friday to serve
his sentence for failing to correct housing violations. He also was
ordered to apply $137,900 in fines to repairs of more than 400
violations that include roach and mice infestation, lack of heat,
flooding and crumbling ceilings.
   ``The first night (of his stay) heat was on all night. I had to
get up and open my windows,'' said M. Campbell, a fourth-floor
resident in the building.
   But ``nothing is being done to my apartment,'' said Ms.
Campbell, who cited numerous problems within her apartment. She
also said she hasn't seen any repairs being done to the building
itself or in the hallway.
   But apartment 5C was replastered and painted before Gross moved
in with two bodyguards. Angry tenants and a banner reading
``Welcome Reptile'' greeted Gross when he arrived.
   An ankle bracelet Gross is wearing lets authorities know he is
staying in the apartment because it sends an electronic signal to a
transmitter if he wanders more than 100 feet from it.
   Joyce Stewart, tenant association president, said residents had
been unable to talk to Gross about problems in the building and
feared the heat will disappear once he does.
   Ms. Stewart had charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on
only 10 to 12 apartments. ``When you subtract that from 113
apartments, you'll see the real McCoy.''

   Soviet generals said Monday the experience of the
Afghan war will not keep the Soviet Union from supporting other
pro-Kremlin governments around the world.
   The generals appeared at a news conference in Moscow to mark the
70th anniversary of the Soviet armed forces.
   They refused to say how many Soviet soldiers have been killed in
Afghan fighting since December 1979, but Western observers have
estimated Soviet dead may number about 10,000.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a week ago Moscow wants
to start withdrawing its soldiers from Afghanistan by May 15 if
U.N.-sponsored talks can reach a final agreement this spring.
Gorbachev said the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers could be out
of the country in 10 months.
   Army Gen. Yevgeny Ivanovsky said Monday the experiences of
Afghanistan would provide tactical lessons for the Soviet military.
   He said most Soviet casualties in Afghanistan came not in
traditional combat, but from ``mines in the roads, shots from
around the corner and surprise attacks.''
   Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, deputy head of political
administration of the armed forces, said the Soviet military is
drawing lessons from the stalemate with Afghan guerrillas. But he
added, ``This does not put in doubt our readiness to provide moral,
diplomatic, political and other forms of help to a friendly
regime.''
   Asked if sending Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan was a mistake,
he said: ``It was an act of assistance based on a request of a
legitimate government. Therefore it was not a mistake. It was the
fulfillment of our duty.''
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, oversaw
the replacement of one pro-Soviet government with another, and
since then have been engaged in fighting the anti-Marxist, Islamic
guerrillas.
   The guerrillas are backed by the United States, among others.
The Soviet Union and Afghanistan have said the Soviet soldiers
cannot be withdrawn until military aid to the insurgents is cut off.
   Gorbachev said the Soviets would make no demands about the
composition of a future government, putting the role of President
Najib's pro-Soviet government in doubt.
   Meanwhile, Pakistan's minister of state for foreign affairs,
Zain Noorani, left his country for America on Monday for talks with
Secretary of State George Shultz and other U.S. officials on
reaching an accord on the Afghan issue.
   He said the recent shuttle by U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez
between Pakistan and Afghanistan; Gorbachev's announcement on
Soviet troop withdrawal plans and a visit to Pakistan by Soviet
Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov had brought the Afghan issue
forward.
   It was not clear if Noorani's departure for Washington was
prompted by a sharpening of differences between the stands taken by
Pakistan and the mujahedeen guerrillas.
   The Pakistanis, who represent the guerrillas in the
U.N.-sponsored Geneva talks with the Kabul government, have agreed
that some Communist figures could participate in a future interim
government in Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas have refused such a compromise and have insisted
on an all-mujahedeen-run government.

<HEAD>Dark Horses Face Dire Prospects After New Hampshire</HEAD>

   Most of the presidential candidates in
Tuesday's New Hampshire primary were struggling not just to win,
but to avoid losing so badly that it could virtually eliminate them
from the race.
   Democrat Bruce Babbitt, who finished a dismal fifth in the Iowa
caucuses, managed a joke about the precarious existence of his
campaign.
   ``Bruce Babbitt frankly did not start out as a household name,
and some would say he'll end this race as not a household name,''
the former Arizona governor said at one stop Sunday night.
   But for most of his rivals and for those at the back of the GOP
pack, the prospect that the nation's first primary could also be
their last was no joking matter.
   Nearly to a man they were vowing to press on no matter what, but
facing the prospect that a resounding defeat in New Hampshire might
force them to abandon their White House ambitions in the snow, just
as Alexander Haig did on Friday.
   George Bush, the acknowledged front-runner here until a
third-place Iowa finish threw a wrench into the gears of his
campaign machinery, has the money and resolve to continue even
should he sustain a second loss to Bob Dole.
   But a primary defeat here would evoke the memory of Walter
Mondale's loss in the Democratic primary four years ago _ an
outcome that ensured a long, brutal struggle to the convention and
a nomination that proved worthless.
   Democrats Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. campaigned knowing
they had a ticket to Super Tuesday, the next major campaign three
weeks hence across the South. Republican Pat Robertson is sure to
go on, too.
   But there's no such assurance for Democrats Gary Hart, Paul
Simon, Richard Gephardt and Babbitt, who need badly to beat
somebody. Gephardt, a winner in Iowa, seemed to need a second place
finish here to sustain a candidacy badly in debt _ and Simon needed
the same. Michael Dukakis, governor of neighboring Massachusetts,
needed not only to win, but by a respectable margin.
   Republicans Jack Kemp and Pete du Pont needed to beat each other.
   Babbitt told a crowd at a Jewish temple in Manchester Sunday
night, ``New Hampshire this Tuesday has within its grasp the power
of life and death over my candidacy.
   ``There are people who tell you my candidacy is over. They're
the same people who tell you your vote doesn't matter,'' said
Babbitt, who fielded questions for more than an hour and even then
seemed reluctant to go.
   ``I'm willing to stay here till the sunrise, whether it comes at
the usual time or Pat Robertson makes it a little earlier,'' he
joked.
   What kind of finish would it take to allow Babbitt to stay in
the race? ``We're looking for a reason to hang on,'' Babbitt
spokesman Mike McCurry said over the weekend.
   Babbitt's campaign has put up some of its computers for sale
back home in Phoenix. Campaign spokesman Scott Phelps said they
were surplus now that the Iowa caucuses are finished, and did not
signify an impending campaign shutdown.
   Du Pont went into Iowa's caucuses saying all he needed to do was
to beat Kemp to establish himself as the conservatives'
alternative. He failed to do that, so how could he withstand
failing to beat Kemp here too?
   ``I'm going South in any case,'' du Pont insisted.
   In Concord on Monday, du Pont dismissed the pundits'
prognostications. ``Oh, you remember pundits. They're the ones who
told us President Dewey would soon be taking the oath of office,
that President Muskie had this nomination under control, that
Walter Mondale was facing the biggest election victory'' here four
years ago, he said.
   ``I dont know where all those poitical pundits are today but
they ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run for
cover tomorrow,'' said du Pont.

   A six-year series of criminal trials has
left the public with an image of the county sheriff as an
uneducated redneck in reflector sunglasses who doesn't mind bending
and even breaking the law, officials say.
   ``The sheriffs don't talk about it much publicly, but I think
it's embarrassing to them when these other sheriffs get in trouble
with the law,'' said Lawson White, executive director of the
Tennessee Sheriffs Association.
   ``They talk privately about how dang stupid it is,'' Lawson said
last week after Henderson County Sheriff Jack Fowler pleaded guilty
to charges he sexually abused inmates in his jail in Lexington,
near Memphis.
   The string of arrests has left other officials wondering how to
prevent further tarnishing of their ``Walking Tall'' image.
   The 1973 movie about McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser's
fight against crime depicted the Southern sheriff as a courageous,
tough individual who risked his life for law and order.
   Fowler is among 12 Tennessee sheriffs or ex-sheriffs indicted on
criminal charges since 1982. Most of the cases stemmed from charges
they sold confiscated drugs or received bribes to protect drug
runners.
   Officials say the arrests point to the need for changes in the
way voters choose their county's top law enforcement leader.
   The sheriff's association _ anxious to boost its image and
performance in Tennessee _ voted in 1986 to ask the Legislature to
set stricter standards for anyone seeking the office. But the bill
was rejected 50-42 by the state House.
   ``Right now, the only requirements to be a sheriff in Tennessee
is to be at least 18 years old, live in the county you run for
office in _ and be alive,'' White said.
   The bill would have required sheriffs to hold at least a high
school diploma and to have lived in the county for 18 months
preceding an election or appointment. It also would have set
training standards and require that a candidate for sheriff not
have a felony record.
   State Rep. Mayo Wix, a former sheriff and sponsor of the
legislation, contends such standards are needed because of the
delicate balance of duties entrusted to sheriffs.
   In the more populated counties, the sheriff is considered mainly
an administrator. But in smaller ones, they must be administrator,
investigator and jailer, among other things.
   ``It was the hardest job I ever had,'' Wix said of his six years
as Sumner County Sheriff.
   He says the public should remember that the days of the ``good
ol' boy sheriff'' _ when the county's top law enforcement officer
was elected on the basis of popularity than qualifications _ are
slowly dying as populations increase and voters demand more.
   ``It's changing little by little,'' he said. ``The bad sheriffs
are getting weeded out, and the good sheriffs are running on their
record and getting re-elected.''
   Despite support for the bill from all but two of the state's 95
sheriffs, Wix says he has no plans to reintroduce it immediately.
Lawmakers were hesitant to tamper with the system, Wix said.
   ``They felt that anybody should be able to run for public office
_ regardless of their education,'' he said. ``Even the president of
the United States doesn't have to have a high school degree.''

   Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson said
Monday he will donate $50,000 for the college education of Tawana
Brawley, who says she was the victim of a racially motivated attack
near her Dutchess County home.
   Tyson also announced plans for a foundation to aid young crime
victims. The foundation would be supported by an annual fundraiser,
possibly including a boxing exhibition by Tyson.
   Tyson said details would be worked out by boxing promoter Don
King, who joined Tyson at a news conference and promised to match
the champion's pledge of $50,000.
   Tyson, his wife and King visited Miss Brawley at her home for
several hours Saturday. She told the boxer, ``I always wanted to go
out with you,'' and gave him a handwritten note of thanks, King
said.
   The foundation ``starts with her, but it's open to any kids that
are abused,'' Tyson said. ``They need the necessities to make it in
this world. That means education.''
   Miss Brawley, a 16-year-old high school student in Wappingers
Falls, N.Y., says she was assaulted, raped, and smeared with racial
epithets in December by six white men, one of whom allegedly
flashed a police badge.
   She was found stuffed in a garbage bag with ``nigger'' and
``KKK'' etched in charcoal across her breasts.
   She had refused to cooperate with investigators on the advice of
her lawyers, black activists Alton Maddox and C. Vernon Mason.
   But after a meeting with Gov. Mario Cuomo last week, they said
they were willing to let her cooperate with an investigation headed
by state Attorney General Robert Abrams. They are scheduled to meet
with Abrams on Tuesday.
   Tyson did not comment Monday on the criminal investigation, but
commented, ``it looks as if no one's going to get caught'' because
residents of such a small town might be reluctant to talk with
authorities.
   Last week comedian Bill Cosby and Essence Communications owner
Ed Lewis announced a $25,000 reward for information about her case.
   Tyson denied a published report that he had volunteered to act
as Miss Brawley's personal escort. But the boxer said she asked
him, ``Are you gonna beat people up for me?''
   ``I'll do whatever you want me to,'' he said he responded.

   Prince Edward may be fifth in line for the British
throne, but he didn't risk being late Monday on his first day at
work as a theater production assistant.
   He arrived 10 minutes early at his new job, which appropriately
is at the Palace Theater.
   Edward, who abandoned a career in the Royal Marines last year,
arrived with a confident grin on his face, a royal bodyguard at his
side and, most importantly, a box of teabags tucked under his arm.
   Production assistant is the most junior job, and the 23-year-old
prince will be expected to perform the most humdrum of backstage
errands, including making tea for his new co-workers at composer
Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Theater Co.
   Asked if he was looking forward to his first day on the job,
Edward said only: ``Of course I am.''
   Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, is the first
member of Britain's royal family to choose the theater as a career,
according to Buckingham Palace.
   Most of the monarch's male relatives select a military career.
Edward's father, Prince Philip, served in the Royal Navy in World
War II and his other sons followed him: Prince Charles, heir to the
British throne, has commanded a mine sweeper and Prince Andrew was
a helicopter pilot in the 1982 Falkland Islands war.
   Edward arrived in a limousine at the Palace Theater in the heart
of London's West End, casually dressed in a blue sweater and tweed
jacket. Police with sniffer dogs had earlier searched the theater.
   The Palace, which houses the offices of Lloyd Webber's company,
is currently showing ``Les Miserables,'' the hit musical based of
Victor Hugo's novel.
   The Really Useful Theater Company is behind a string of hit
musicals, including ``Cats'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
   LLoyd Webber offered Edward a job after the prince resigned from
the Royal Marines in January 1987, four months into a year-long
course to become a commando officer. Fellow marines said he was
ranked in the top 10 of his class, but British news reports at the
time called him a wimp and said his father was furious.
   Bridget Hayward, the company's executive director, said when
Edward's hiring was announced last month: ``The prince won't be
treated as a member of the royal family but as an employee.
   ``He has said he wants to be treated as a worker, that is his
understanding of the job. He has a lot to learn and we have plenty
of work for him.''
   Edward's salary has not been disclosed. The bachelor prince
lives with his parents at Buckingham Palace and receives about
$34,900 a year from the government.
   Edward studied history for three years at Cambridge University,
and took part in amateur theater productions. He is patron of the
National Youth Theater, Cambridge Symphony Orchestra and the 1988
Festival of London.

   Wind blew over a 30-foot-high wall at a
condominium complex under construction Monday, trapping 18 workers
for about five minutes, authorities said. Ten workers were injured,
three of them seriously.
   Fire Lt. James Hagerty said the crew was using long wooden poles
to manually raise the sheetrock-and-plywood wall when it collapsed.
   ``Basically what they were doing was raising the exterior wall
to the second story of the building,'' he said. ``The wind caught
hold of the framing and becauseitions they lost
their footing and everything came on top of them.''
   Three workers were ho of the icy condspitalized with back injuries.
Seven others
had minor cuts and bruises.

   The mayor of Baghdad signed an agreement
with the former mayor of Jerusalem Monday to make the two cities
sister cities ``in an act of solidarity and for the cause of
peace.''
   Mayor Khalid Abdul Munim Rashid of Baghdad and the former mayor
of Jerusalem under Jordanian rule Ruhi al-Khatib signed a document
during a ceremony attended by Sharifuddin Pirzada, the Pakistani
secretary general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
   In an address at the ceremony, al-Khatib, who was expelled by
the Israelis, after the 1967 war said the move ``is a blessed move
to boost the morale position of al-Quds (Jerusalem) as the city of
peace and a meeting point for the divine faiths,'' he said.
   An Islamic foreign ministers meeting held in Morocco in 1981
decided to urge Islamic capitals and cities to declare themselves
sister cities with occupied Jerusalem in recognition of the role
the city played in Islamic history and in affirmation of ``its
status as the capital of Palestine.''

   A three-week-old boy underwent more than 10 hours of heart
transplant surgery in Pittsburgh Monday and a week-old infant was
upgraded from critical to serious condition, 24 hours after he was
given a new heart in California.
   Both infants were born with hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, a
lethal underdevelopment of the heart.
   Jonathan Stowe, born Jan. 25, entered the operating room at
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh around midnight and emerged at
10:15 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo. He was the
youngest heart transplant patient at that hospital.
   At Loma Linda, Calif., Baby Christoffer, son of a U.S. Air Force
family, received a new heart in a 5-hour operation performed Sunday
by Dr. Leonard Bailey, the surgeon who transplanted a baboon heart
into the infant girl known as Baby Fae in 1984.
   ``Christoffer's condition was upgraded this morning from
critical to serious,'' said Dick Schaefer, spokesman for Loma Linda
University Medical Center, the hospital 60 miles east of Los
Angeles.
   The boy had been in Loma Linda's neo-natal intensive care unit
for six days, three of them on life support, before the transplant
surgery.
   In both cases, the identity of the donor was not released. And
Christoffer's family asked that no more information be released,
Schaefer said.
   Doctors in Pittsburgh could not immediately assess the chances
that Jonathan's operation would succeed, said Miss Cardillo.
   Jonathan, son of Tabatha and David Stowe of Beaver Falls, Pa.,
was in critical condition, which is normal immediately after
transplant surgery, she said.
   ``The operation was a very delicate procedure to perform,'' said
Miss Cardillo. ``Right now the major concern is with overall
function of the organ. He'll be monitored very closely over the
next several days.''
   The Stowes, both 20, have one other son, Chad, 3. Stowe is
unemployed.
   The youngest transplant patient at Children's before Jonathan
was a 24-day-old boy from Wyoming who received a new liver in July
1986. ``He's doing well today,'' Ms. Cardillo said.
   Christoffer was the 13th baby under four months of age to
undergo human heart transplant surgery at Loma Linda. Of the 12
previous infants, nine have survived, including Paul Holc, the
world's youngest heart transplant patient who was given a new organ
hours after birth.

<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composer Frederick Loewe was fondly
remembered by friends Monday as a sentimental and caring man whose
classic tunes from the musicals ``Gigi'' and ``My Fair Lady'' will
be immortal.
   Loewe, whose partnership with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner produced
such romantic standards as ``I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,''
``If Ever I Would Leave You'' and ``On the Street Where You Live,''
died Sunday at Desert Hospital here of a heart attack. He was 86.
   ``His music will be immortal,'' said comedian Red Skelton, his
friend of 45 years. ``The world will always hear him speak, feel
his emotions, for he has only put on a shroud that makes him
invisible. He broke hearts on Valentine's Day. But perhaps, at
last, he found his Camelot.''
   Skelton will deliver the eulogy this week during a memorial
service here. The comedian said Loewe was much loved by members of
this exclusive desert community, and was also friends with area
residents Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra.
   ``I'm very sad. He was an adorable person under his very rough
manner,'' said French actress Leslie Caron, who starred in
``Gigi.'' ``I was quite fond of him. He looked a bit like Edward G.
Robinson playing a gangster ... When I first met him he put me off.
Then I realized he was a softy.''
   ``He was a very sentimental and gentle man. He was always happy
and never gloomy,'' Skelton added.
   The Lerner-Loewe team enchanted audiences with tunes from such
classic musicals as ``Gigi,'' ``Camelot,'' ``My Fair Lady'' and
``Brigadoon.''
   Some of the other songs the team produced were ``Almost Like
Being in Love,'' ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' and ``Get Me to
the Church on Time.''
   Actor-dancer Gene Kelly, who starred in the film version of
``Brigadoon,'' praised Loewe as ``a fine musician who did great
things.''
   ``I was lucky to do `Brigadoon,' because it was a singer's
picture,'' Kelly recalled. ``But Frederick helped make it a
dancer's picture with my small Irish tenor called upon to sing all
those wonderful songs. He was a fantastic man, an eccentric and an
adventurer.''
   Loewe, known as Fritz, died Sunday at 1:51 p.m. at Desert
Hospital, where he had been admitted Wednesday for chest pains.
   Loewe had strong ties to the hospital, donating most of the
funds to build the Frederick Loewe Pediatric Pavilion in 1971, said
Bob Barcklay, the hospital's acting chief executive officer. Loewe
also donated royalties from some of his songs to the pediatric
unit, which are used each year to buy Christmas gifts and toys for
sick children there, he added.
   Lerner died in 1986. His widow, actress Liz Robertson, was in
Manchester, England, on Monday performing in a revival of ``My Fair
Lady.'`
   ``He was just a wonderful generous man who wrote the most
extraordinary, beautiful music. I'm pleased to be performing `My
Fair Lady' on stage in Manchester so that I can celebrate his life
by singing his music tonight,'' she said.
   Lerner and Loewe's partnership began with a one-night flop in
Detroit in 1942. They parted bitterly after ``Camelot,'' their last
Broadway hit, in 1960. After a 1973 reunion for the Broadway
production of ``Gigi,'' originally written in 1958 as a movie, they
remained friends.
   Loewe was born June 10, 1901, to a distinguished musical family
in Vienna, Austria. He began piano lessons as a boy and at 13 was
the youngest pianist to appear as soloist with the Berlin Symphony.
Loewe was 15 when he published ``Katrina,'' a song that sold 2
million copies on sheet music in Europe.
   He came to the United States in 1924 and later wandered the
country prospecting for gold, herding cattle, delivering mail on
horseback and teaching riding at a New Hampshire resort. As a
bantamweight boxer in Brooklyn, he won eight of nine professional
bouts.
   In 1931, Loewe married Ernestine Zerline, whom he divorced after
26 years together with no children. He has no survivors.
   He began his collaboration with Lerner after accepting an offer
from a stock company in Detroit to adapt a farce, ``The Patsy.''
   Lerner's fascination with the Scottish writer Sir James Barrie
led to the team's first hit show, ``Brigadoon,'' and their first
hit song, ``Almost Like Being in Love,'' in 1947.
   Loewe and Lerner went their separate ways for a time, but
reunited in 1951 to produce ``Paint Your Wagon.''
   Next came ``My Fair Lady'' in 1956, a musical adaptation of
George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion.'' The cast included Rex Harrison
and Julie Andrews and ran for 2,717 performances.
   It won Loewe the first of two Tony Awards and the 1964 film
adaptation won several Academy Awards, including best picture.
   The team also produced a film musical, ``Gigi,'' based on a
novella by Colette, in 1958. It was the first film to win nine
Academy Awards, including an Oscar to Loewe as co-writer of the
title song.
   The next project was ``Camelot.'' Critics were hard on the
musical when it arrived in 1960 but it was greatly loved by
President John F. Kennedy, whose short-lived administration was
later dubbed Camelot by admirers.

   Rep. Jack Kemp said Monday that the
Republican presidential race will come down to him and Bob Dole,
whose campaign he derided as one of ``pain, sacrifice and bitter
medicine.''
   Kemp said one-time GOP front-runner George Bush's campaign is
losing ground, based in part on his performance in Sunday night's
Republican debate.
   ``I'm saving second (place) for Kemp,'' the New York congressman
said at a news conference on the banks of the rushing Merrimack
River in downtown Manchester. ``I wouldn't be surprised if we
surprised a lot of people in New Hampshire and surprised a lot of
the Bush staff.''
   Kemp criticized Bush and Dole, generally believed to be in a
tight race for first place, as well as Pat Robertson, who has been
gaining ground since his surprising finish ahead of Bush in Iowa
last week.
   Kemp said he believes the Republican race ultimately will come
down to a contest between himself and Dole _ ``a pain, sacrifice
and bitter medicine Bob Dole campaign versus a growth, hope,
opportunity, progressive, populist, conservative Jack Kemp
campaign. We're going to win the nomination of the Republican
Party.''
   Kemp said Bush television ads accusing Dole of having a history
of raising taxes should be pulled off the air.
   ``It is consumer fraud for George Bush, who has gone along with
every major tax increase of the 1980s, to accuse Bob Dole of being
a tax increaser,'' he said.
   ``George and Bob never saw a tax they didn't hike.''
   During a Sunday night debate, Kemp assailed Bush for saying
``give peace a chance'' in Afghanistan.
   ``That was the rallying cry of the liberal Democrats (in
Congress) to kill aid for freedom fighters'' in Central America,
Kemp said.
   He said peace alone should not be the goal of American foreign
policy.
   ``There's peace in Cuba, peace in Vietnam and peace in Poland,
but there is no democracy,'' he said.
   ``That facist regime in Managua needs to be replaced with
democracy and freedom, and I was embarrassed that the vice
president would make that type of statement that sells short the
cause of democracy and freedom in this hemisphere.''

   AIDS has stricken 41 Italian children under the age
of 12, and 23 of them have died, the Institute of Health said
Monday.
   The institute, a division of the Ministry of Health, said that
as of the end of September, 23 girls and 18 boys had come down with
the fatal disease. The majority of them were the children of drug
addicts.
   Health Minister Carlo Donat Cattin said earlier this month that
800 people have died of AIDS in Italy. The ministry said 1,478
cases of AIDS had been reported in Italy through Dec. 31.
   The government has appropriated $145 million to fight AIDS
through research, the training of health workers and distribution
of information on the disease.

   Democrat Paul Simon, shifting his focus to
Michael Dukakis, said Monday he was gaining on the leader and
looked for ``a real surprise'' in New Hampshire's leadoff
presidential primary.
   Dropping his attacks on Richard Gephardt, with whom he was
dueling for second place, Simon sought to cut into Dukakis' support
and contended he could win outright.
   Polls have shown the Massachusetts governor holding a two-to-one
margin over Gephardt and Simon.
   ``I think increasingly the race is between Michael Dukakis and
me,'' the Illinois senator said. ``What is clear now is we have
moved into second place in contention with Michael Dukakis.''
   Simon stood on a snowy roadside at the New
Hampshire-Massachusetts border and pleaded for voters to ``assert
their independence'' and not back Dukakis merely because he is a
neighboring governor.
   ``There is a difference between me and Michael Dukakis _ a
difference in experience, a difference in commitment,'' he said.
   Simon came to New Hampshire a week ago after finishing a close
second behind Gephardt in Iowa. With his campaign in debt, Simon
went on the attack with television commercials that accused
Gephardt of flip-flopping on a range of positions.
   He dropped those ads on Sunday and replaced them with
commercials that portray Dukakis as a colorless bureaucrat lacking
in vision.
   Simon stuck to his theme of being an unrepentant liberal as he
tried to chip away at Dukakis's lead on the final day of the
campaign.
   He cited education, jobs, long-term care for the elderly and
infirm, arms control and foreign policy. ``Where is the Michael
Dukakis program for long-term care?'' he asked.
   ``We need more than talk of a miracle,'' Simon said in a
deliberate reference to Dukakis' claim to have engineered a
``Massachusetts miracle'' economic turnaround.
   Simon is widely believed to need to finish second in order to
continue a viable campaign. He acknowledged his vulnerability even
while predicting a good showing.
   ``I think it is tightening,'' he said. ``I think there is a
possibility of a real surprise come tomorrow.''
   Does that mean you could win, he was asked.
   ``That is correct,'' Simon said.
   But he added later: ``We have to do well in New Hampshire, and I
am going to do well. If we were to do poorly, we would have to
re-evaluate.''

<HEAD>Babbitt Pledges Action on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY MITMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bruce Babbitt, campaigning hours before
Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary, pledged Monday to pass
national legislation to curb acid rain and take the issue to an
international summit.
   ``The time for research has passed,'' Babbitt said at a rally at
the Statehouse. ``The time for procrastination is over. It's time
for action now.''
   The former Arizona governor told reporters after the rally he
anticipates doing better than expected in the state's leadoff
primary.
   Asked what he would consider a strong showing, Babbitt, who has
been consistently in the single digits in polls, said, ``I honestly
don't know. It depends in some measure on what the prognosticators
and commentators have to say.''
   ``I'm anticipating a strong showing and a surprise, but I can't
put a number on it,'' he said.
   Babbitt was the only candidate to show up at the rally sponsored
in part by the League of Conservation Voters, who last week gave
Babbitt the highest marks among the candidates for his efforts to
clean up the environment.
   Babbitt said that when he thinks of acid rain he remembers the
``immortal words of a president called Ronald Reagan, who once
stood up in a public place and proclaimed that it's trees that
cause pollution.''
   Babbitt said Reagan, as governor of California, once was greeted
by a sign on a pine tree on a college campus that said: ``Chop me
down before I kill again.''
   The ``silent tragedy'' of dying forests and lakes is not
confined to New England, he said.
   Babbitt described his own fight as Arizona governor to demand
that two copper-smelting plants that were causing acid rain obey
environmental laws. When they refused, he went to the legislature
and eventually shut them down, he said.
   But afterwards, Babbitt said, ``I looked over my shoulder and 60
miles across the border in Mexico they were building a copper
smelter which, the day it opened, would erase all the gains we had
made in 10 years of fighting in the West.''
   When he sought help form the Reagan administration to stop the
plant, he claimed, ``They said that's none of our business.''
   Environmental problems ``are our problems but they're also the
planet's problems,'' Babbitt said. He pledged that as president he
will put environmental issues such as acid rain on the agenda of an
international summit.

<HEAD>Soviet Verification Procedures Insufficient for Arms Talks, U.S.
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has told the Soviet Union
that verification procedures worked out for medium-range missiles
will not suffice for the strategic arms talks that begin again this
week, senior arms control adviser Edward L. Rowny said Monday.
   ``We are calling for tough measures which will assure that we
can verify Soviet compliance,'' Rowny told the American Association
for the Advancement of Science in Boston. The text of the speech
was released in Washington.
   The Soviets, he said, can expedite progress on strategic arms
reductions by abandoning their effort to link the reductions to
America's pursuit of Star Wars technology.
   Rowny accused the Soviets of delaying tactics, which he said are
jeopardizing reaching an agreement on strategic arms in time for
President Reagan's meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in late spring or early summer.
   ``They appear to believe delaying tactics will reward them with
a START treaty imbalanced in their favor,'' Rowny said. ``I hope
they will recognize that their intransigence is only dimming hopes
for an agreement before the Moscow summit meeting.''
   Even with the tough verification procedures approved two months
ago as part of the treaty banning medium-range missile, Rowny said,
``it would be misleading to suggest we are on a roll toward a START
agreement.''
   ``We are concerned that the Soviets' heavy reliance on very
large ICBMs may give them a sense of confidence that they could
gain a critical advantage by striking first,'' Rowny said.
   By seeking a limit that permanently reduces both the number and
the proportion of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the Soviet
armory, he said, ``we are asking the Soviets in effect to renounce
any motion that nuclear war is winnable, even if initiated
pre-emptively.''

   Supporters of a presidential primary for
Washington state said Monday they fear the measure has been killed
by pressure from the two political parties and will die without
coming to a vote.
   The bill, which would allow voters to decide whether to scrap
the complicated caucus system, remained bottled up in the House
Rules Committee on Monday.
   The two main backers of a primary, Republican Secretary of State
Ralph Munro and Democratic Rep. Ruth Fisher charged that House
Speaker Joe King, a Democrat, was holding up the bill at the behest
of Democratic state officials.
   Both Munro and Mrs. Fisher said reports that former television
evangelist Pat Robertson may win Washington's Republican caucuses
on March 8 show how easily the caucus system can be manipulated.
   Said Mrs. Fisher, ``If Robertson wins, you can bet we'll have a
presidential primary (created) next year.''
   Mrs. Fisher said Washington's caucus turnout is usually no more
than 3 percent of the registered voters, but that a primary would
easily attract 50 percent.
   Munro said more people attend a Seattle Seahawks game than their
precinct caucuses.

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson, defending his stance on women's
issues, says women hold top posts in his campaign and he expects to
appoint women to a Robertson Cabinet.
   Robertson, in a Republican presidential debate Sunday night in
Goffstown, N.H., rejected criticism from the National Organization
for Women, but said that if working women are given tax deductions
for child care then homemakers deserve tax breaks, too.
   The former television evangelist called NOW ``a very militant,
rather left-wing organization'' and said he would not trust ``one
word that they said'' about his positions on women's issues.
   NOW vice president Sheri O'Dell responded Monday, ``I'd have
more cause for concern if he said something complimentary about
us.''
   She said that Robertson has made clear in his writings, speeches
and sermons over the years that, as a NOW summary of the
candidates' positions put it, he ``advocates old-fashioned `family
values' and the return of women to the `traditional' roles.''
   ``What that means is he believes women are to be submissive to
men in the home, in the workplace, in anyplace,'' said O'Dell. ``He
tries to use Biblical references to support that position.''
   The fifth chapter of Paul's letter to the Ephesians says wives
must be submissive to their husbands. Robertson has cited the verse
in writings and on the religious television show he used to host,
``The 700 Club,'' according to O'Dell.
   ``If the top campaign person on his staff is a woman, I
congratulate him. Maybe he's making some progress on his point of
view,'' said O'Dell.
   Robertson was asked by moderator Edwin Newman about a NOW
political summary that concluded he favored a return of women to
their ``traditional'' role.
   Robertson replied: ``I have more women in my campaign right now
than any other presidential candidate sitting here or any of the
Democrats. The highest paid staff member I have is a woman.''
   His campaign headquarters in Chesapeake, Va., said he was
referring to Connie Snapp, his national director of communications.
   Asked if Snapp earned more than Marc Nuttle, Robertson's
campaign director and chief political strategist, Teresa George, a
campaign press aide, said Nuttle ``is a consultant. He is not
actually on our staff, so she is the highest paid person on the
staff.'' She said the campaign would not disclose Snapp's salary or
Nuttle's compensation.
   She added that women hold 160 of the 300 paid positions in the
Robertson's national office and field staff.
   Robertson also said his advertising was run by a woman, and that
Mary Ellen Miller runs his national voter identification drive.
   All of the candidates except Michael Dukakis have men in charge
of their campaigns. Harvard law professor Susan Estrich is Dukakis'
campaign manager.
   Robertson said he would appoint women to his Cabinet, and added,
``as a matter of fact, there's one of those Doles would make a
fantastic vice president.''
   When the moderator pressed him, Robertson said, ``I would say
that the National Organization for Woman with all due deference is
a very militant, rather left-wing organization. I don't know that I
would trust one word that they said.''
   ``I do not feel that radical feminism is necessary for us today.
And what I think we should have in this society, if a woman wants
to work, I want absolutely to maek sure that she gets the same pay
as a man. But if she wants to stay home, for example, and look
after children, I am advocating that if we can give tax deductions
for child-care support for working women, we can also give tax
deductions to women who want to stay home and look after their
children.''

   Jack Kemp calls the vice president of the
United States an ``embarrassment'' to the Republican party. Paul
Simon asks whether Democrats can trust a man who has supported
nuclear power and the B-1 bomber.
   Candidates are on the attack as the New Hampshire primary
campaign rushes to its climax Tuesday.
   For several of the dozen candidates bidding for support in the
first presidential primary of this election year, Wednesday looms
as a day for unpacking and putting their White House dreams in
storage.
   That prospect lends an air of desperation to their tactics and
heightens the temptation to lash out at the opposition, especially
those leading in the polls.
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Texas professor, said
negative ads are appearing earlier than in past presidential
contests.
   While candidates may get some short-term benefit from savaging
their opponents, she warned, ``anyone who goes on the attack risks
looking non-presidential.''
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas chipped away at Vice President George
Bush's once formidable lead in national polls by suggesting that
Bush was more bystander than participant in Reagan administration
councils.
   That tactic worked well in Iowa and now Bush, looking more like
an underdog, has adopted it in New Hampshire and is portraying Dole
as a Senate leader who has failed to produce the votes to sustain
Reagan vetoes or to get Robert H. Bork a seat on the Supreme Court.
   Most of the attacks stay within a limit that enables the
attacker to claim he's using comparative, not negative advertising.
   The most egregious example of an attack that went beyond normal
bounds was material distributed by supporters of former television
evangelist Pat Robertson that suggested a member of Rep. Jack
Kemp's family had an abortion.
   The material, distributed to fundamentalist Christian voters,
asked, ``Does he deny that his own family was involved in an
abortion?'' Kemp aide Mary Brunette said the allegation was ``a
lie. There's absolutely no truth in it whatsoever.''
   Connie Snapp, a Robertson spokeswoman, said there was a
possibility a campaign worker in Illinois was involved in
distributing the anti-Kemp material.
   During Sunday's GOP debate, Kemp acted outraged when Bush said,
``Give peace a chance,'' in Afghanistan.
   ``That is a embarrassment,'' said Kemp, ``a Republican talking
about give peace a chance.''
   On Monday, Kemp elaborated on his wrath. ```Give peace a chance'
was the rallying cry of the Gephardt-Simon-Jim Wright-wing of the
Democratic party that cut off all aid to the freedom fighters in
Central America,'' the New York congressman said. ``It was an
embarrassment to our party to have our vice president talking like
Jim Wright or Dick Gephardt.''
   Kemp also has attacked Bush and Dole with literature claiming
both would raise taxes and cut Social Security benefits.
   Jamieson said the rule is that front-runners don't attack.
   She cited an ad run by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis as a
classic front-runner appeal.
   ``I'm for more trade,'' says Dukakis, the leader in all polls of
New Hampshire Democrats.
   Dukakis comes across as taking a positive position that quietly
reminds voters that another candidate _ Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri _ has a trade policy his opponents have called
protectionist.
   Gephardt came out of Iowa a winner and quickly was attacked in
ads run by Simon. Those ads cited Gephardt votes in favor of
nuclear power and the B-1 and said they were inconsistent with the
congressman's current positions.
   During the Democrats' debate Saturday, Gephardt complained to
Simon:
   ``When you say in a TV ad, `Who do you trust?' you're really
bringing into play motives, motivation and whether or not somebody
is reliable and I think that goes over the line. We can disagree on
issues.''
   Jesse Jackson called the complaints about attacks ``campaign
fatigue, this tit for tat on how bruised I am.''
   But Ms. Jamieson said there was a legitimate distinction.
   ``I don't like distinction between positive and negative,'' she
said. ``You have fair and unfair. Anything that distorts one's own
or an opponent's record is unfair.''
   Once Dole became the big winner in Iowa and erased Bush's big
lead in New Hampshire polls, he became the target of attacks.
   Du Pont, on the brink of extinction if he doesn't score a
breakthrough Tuesday, contends Dole would raise taxes. That's about
the worst thing a Republican can say about another Republican in
this campaign.
   To prove his point here in notoriously anti-tax New Hampshire,
du Pont thrust a no-tax pledge at Dole during Sunday's debate and
said, ``Sign it.'' Dole refused.
   Bush also has taken up the tax cry against Dole, though he left
it to surrogates.
   At a news conference, Rep. Don Sundquist of Tennessee, a Bush
backer, described Dole as ``a waitin', walkin', talkin' tax
increase about to happen.''

   Former Gov. William W. Scranton is trading
his briefcase for a bookbag as he phases out his ties to corporate
America and prepares to return to college.
   The 70-year-old Scranton, who sought the Republican nomination
for president in the 1960s, will enroll at the University of
Scranton this fall as a student of Latin and Italian. After
sharpening his linguistic skills, Scranton plans to study the
Italian Renaissance, the 15th and 16th century explosion of
knowledge that led man out of the Middle Ages.
   ``I've always been fascinated with the Italian Renaissance ever
since I took a course on the subject in my first year in college,''
Scranton told the Scranton Times in a recent interview.
   Scranton, the recipient of 35 honorary doctorate degrees, said
he has always placed a premium on knowledge for knowledge's sake.
   While on vacation in Maine about a year and a half ago, Scranton
said he thought a lot about becoming old and decided to follow his
own advice _ the best way to remain young is to mingle with young
people.
   For Scranton, that meant returning to college.
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Scranton said, even though it
will mean sitting in a classroom for the first time in 42 years
since he got his degree from Yale Law School in 1946.
   At the University of Scranton, Scranton will study Latin under
Dr. John Wilson and Italian under Frank Cimini. Scranton had some
Latin in high school and college but Italian will be completely new
to him.
   Scranton has pared down his involvement with corporate boards
from 21 to just four and plans to be off those boards by June 1.
However, he said he will continue to remain active in boosting
initiatives that can help the city that bears his family name.

<HEAD>Coroner Calls Newlywed's Death Suspicious</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coroner's official Monday termed suspicious
the death of a newlywed whose husband said she was blown overboard
into the Pacific Ocean while jogging during their honeymoon cruise.
   An autopsy was performed Sunday on Karen Waltz Roston, 26, of
Santa Monica, but the cause of death probably won't be released
until Tuesday, said Deputy Coroner Robert Grubb of the San Diego
County Coroner's office.
   ``Right now, it's pending,'' Grubb said. ``However, we can tell
you the death occurred under suspicious circumstances.''
   The woman's husband of one week, Scott Robin Roston, 36, a
chiropractor who moved from Florida to Santa Monica in June, was
held Monday by federal officials in Los Angeles following his
arrest for investigation of murder.
   Roston was taken into custody Saturday when the cruise ship Star
Dancer docked in Los Angeles Harbor. He was held without bail at
the Terminal Island federal prison.
   ``They were very much in love. He really adored her. I can't
imagine that he would want to hurt her, let alone kill her,''
Roston's roommate told the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. She asked
that her name not be used.
   FBI spokesman Fred Reagan declined to release details of what
led to Roston's arrest. Roston was expected to appear in federal
court later this week.
   The couple were married Feb. 6 before embarking on a honeymoon
cruise of the Mexican coast with 731 other passengers.
   Roston told authorities that high winds blew his wife off the
deck near the ship's jogging track about 2 a.m. Saturday, but ``the
winds were not that strong,'' Star Dancer Capt. Thomas Wildung said.
   Also, Chief Purser Ken Ehlers said the track closed at 9 p.m.
and he never heard the couple running, even though the track is
over his room.
   And passenger Dick Heinrich, an assistant chief deputy at the
Cook County Sheriff's Department in Chicago, told authorities he
noticed what appeared to be hair and earring posts when he went for
a walk on the deck where Mrs. Roston allegedly went over.
   The woman was reported overboard when the ship was about 44
miles southwest of San Diego. The Coast Guard found her body later
that day.

   Iraq said its air force attacked Iranian
troops along the front Monday, while Iran claimed its warplanes
blasted a petrochemical complex and military installations in
southern Iraq.
   Iraq also claimed its forces shot down two Iranian drones.
   Reports by Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September
1980, cannot be independently verified because they rarely allow
access to combat zones.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military communique as
saying Iraqi jets flew 60 combat missions along the war front,
``inflicting substantial losses in men, weaponry and equipment,
then returned safely to base.''
   It said Iraqi helicopter gunships rocketed and strafed Iranian
military posts in 39 sorties, destroying ``many of the enemy's
troop buildups and positions.'' It gave no details.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported that Iraqi
anti-aircraft gunners shot down two Iranian drones at different
times Sunday night. One fell inside Iranian territory and another
crashed in Iraq, according to the communique. It did not elaborate.
   Iran did not comment on the Iraqi claims. A communique issued in
Tehran said the Iranian air force ``effectively carried out
reconnaissance flights over the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman
Sunday to provide air cover for the navy and reconnoiter positions
of foreign vessels in the waterway.''
   The Iranian communique, carried by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency, said Iranian warplanes ``heavily bombarded Iraqi
positions and fortifications'' along the southern front east of the
Iraqi city of Basra, and in Faw Peninsula farther south.
   Iranian warplanes also attacked a petrochemical complex in Basra
in one of five raids carried out by early afternoon Monday, IRNA
said in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia.
   ``All the attacking fighters returned safely to bases after
inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy,'' the agency
quoted a communique as saying.
   Iran's air force is outnumbered 8-to-1 by Iraq's fleet of
Soviet- and French-made aircraft. But in recent weeks, Iran has
used its U.S.-made planes in several raids, suggesting Tehran may
have bought spare parts on the black market.
   Iran has 60-70 operational warplanes, according to Western
military analysts.
   Iraq has previously reported shooting down other Iranian drones.
   Iran recently reported successful tests of domestically built
drones, but it is not known whether it is producing its own
pilotless aircraft yet. It also has reported its war factories are
preparing to manufacture fighter planes.
   The Iranians apparently stepped up efforts to manufacture their
own weapons after the United States proposed an international arms
embargo against the Islamic nation to force its rulers to agree to
a U.N. Security Council cease-fire resolution.
   Iraq has accepted Security Council Resolution 598, which passed
on July 20. Iran said it wants Baghdad condemned as the aggressor
before any settlement can be reached.

   Watching a rerun of a television sitcom
may not sound like the most romantic activity, but Jeff Smith
decided he couldn't think of a better time to pop the question.
   Smith, 25, bought 30 seconds of air time during a local
station's broadcast of ``It's A Living'' to propose to Rhonda Munn.
   Smith made sure Ms. Munn was at home watching station WETO with
him Sunday night when his advertisement appeared midway through the
show. The commercial showed Smith sitting in a chair listening to
the Beach Boys' song ``Help Me Rhonda'' as he proposed marriage.
   The hopeful groom said Ms. Munn was so bewildered by the sight
of him on television that he had to get down on one knee and ask a
second time for her to marry him.
   ``It was like she couldn't quite understand what was happening''
when the ad ran, he said. ``She was laughing and confused.''
   It only took Ms. Munn a few seconds before responding in the
affirmative to Smith's real-life proposal, he said.
   Both Smith and Ms. Munn, 26, live in Kingsport. They work as
chemical engineers for different companies and began dating about
18 months ago.

   Taking the twang out of Texas is the job of a
diction teacher from Detroit who helps natives rid themselves of
regional speech, with an accent instead on efficient communication.
   For $225, Margo Manning is offering Texans a chance to remove
the twang from their talk.
   ``Is Your Texas Showing?'' the diction teacher from Detroit asks
in a newspaper advertisement for her six weekly lessons.
   Students are taught to drop the drawl and pronounce words fully,
speak in more clipped fashion and breathe from the diaphragm.
   ``Since Texas became more of a melting pot in the last six or
seven years, people are more aware of the need to sound less
regional,'' said Ms. Manning, who operates an acting studio in Las
Colinas.
   Carol Huckin, born and reared in Dallas, was a recent student.
   ``My accent was always so strong that people listened to my
voice rather than what I was saying,'' she said. ``People at
parties looked at me and smiled when I wasn't saying anything
funny,'' she told The Dallas Morning News.

   Theirs is a love match sparked at a car
wash, and that's where Judith Couch and Robert Barker tied the knot
on Valentine's Day.
   Florida Car Wash cashier Ms. Couch and manager Barker met in
June at work. When he proposed several months later, owner Bob
Harrington suggested they wed where the romance began.
   ``They work here, they met here, they fell in love here. I
thought it was a natural kind of thing,'' said Ray Barker, father
of the groom.
   Wedding guests pronounced the site romantic, although one had a
wry observation.
   ``This is one of the few car washes in Florida that's
`touchless,''' noted Robin King. ``Let's hope the marriage is not.''

   A concrete contractor looked uncomfortable
Monday amid cameras, microphones and crowds of people waiting for
him to accept an oversize copy of a $6,814,823 check for hitting
the world's largest slot jackpot.
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Cammie J. Brewer told a news
conference at the Cal-Neva Club in downtown Reno. ``I know I have
the money now. It feels pretty good.''
   Brewer, 61, usually feels at home at the small casino where he
became an instant multimillionaire on Sunday by lining up four
``7s'' on one of four Megabucks progressive slot machines. Brewer
and his wife, Jo, have been regular visitors at the Cal-Neva since
they moved to Reno in May 1962, a month after the club opened.
   Brewer said he comes to the Cal-Neva nearly every Sunday morning
to eat the club's 99-cent breakfast and to play the slots. Since
1987, he's been playing the Megabucks machines, more than 200
progressive slots linking 54 Nevada casinos.
   ``I figure if I'm going to play, I may as well play for the big
dollars,'' Brewer said of Megabucks, billed as Nevada casinos'
answer to the California state lottery.
   On Sunday he ate his 99-cent breakfast with his 81-year-old
father-in-law, then played about $20 before he hit the four 7s.
After the third reel showed a 7, he pointed a finger at the fourth
reel and remembers saying ``Come on, let's hit the other one.''
   ``I think I bumped the change girl waving my arms around when
that fourth seven fell into place,'' Brewer said.
   Brewer will receive his winnings in annual $680,000 payments
over the next 10 years. He said he is going back to work on
Tuesday, but plans to semi-retire and spend his money on his 11
grandchildren from his three children.
   ``Our grandkids are going to have a ball,'' Brewer's 59-year-old
wife said. ``I just couldn't believe it. When they called me
yesterday, I just started shaking and crying then called a taxi to
get down there.''
   Brewer wants to look at some motor homes before investing his
money.
   Hitting the jackpot might have made up for forgetting to buy his
wife a Valentine's Day card for the first time in their 25-year
marriage.
   ``This did kind of settle her down,'' he said.
   ``He can do anything he wants now,'' Mrs. Brewer added.
   Sunday's Megabucks payoff surpassed the record jackpot of $4.9
million won by Terry Williams of Los Gatos, Calif., at Harrah's
Reno on Feb. 1, 1987.

<HEAD>Lawyer Uses Secret Service Tactics As Defense for Demjanjuk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for John Demjanjuk used an Israeli
example Monday in contending all secret services are ``insidious''
and the Soviet KGB could have fabricated evidence that his client
commited war crimes.
   During closing arguments at Demjanjuk's trial, lawyer Yoram
Sheftel cited a judicial commission report published in October
that showed agents of Israel's Shin Bet agency routinely perjured
themselves in court for 16 years in order to convict Palestinians
and conceal violent interrogation methods.
   Sheftel said the KGB had more sophisticated ways of fabricating
evidence against Demjanjuk.
   Defense lawyers claim a key piece of prosecution evidence, an
alleged Nazi identity card for Demjanjuk, was forged by the Soviet
Union. Six prosecution experts have authenticated the card, which
says Demjanjuk was trained as a death camp guard at Trawniki in
Nazi-occupied Poland.
   ``Secret service agencies everywhere are insidious and resort to
fabrication and treachery,'' Sheftel told The Associated Press
during a recess. ``I wanted to show that intelligence services can
and have in the past fooled courts in Israel.''
   Demjanjuk, 67, is accused of being a Ukrainian guard called
``Ivan the Terrible'' who brutalized prisoners and operated gas
chambers at the Treblinka death camp in Poland, where 850,000 Jews
were killed in 1942-43.
   The defendant, born in the Ukraine, emigrated to the United
States after World War II and was a retired auto worker living in
Ohio when the United States extradited him for trial. He says the
Kremlin framed him because he fought in an anti-Soviet unit at the
end of the war.
   Sheftel said the identity card was suspect because it came from
Soviet archives closed to the West.
   Dov Levine, the presiding judge, said the card was assumed to be
authentic because it was an archival document, and the defense must
prove forgery.
   To that, Sheften replied: ``In the Soviet Union they use deceit,
even in archives. This document does not come from well-organized
Western archives.''

<TEXT>
   Hard-drinking crowds poured into the French
Quarter on Monday to herald the coming of Mardi Gras _ Fat Tuesday
_ as the pre-Lenten Carnival season that began Jan. 6 headed for
its raucous, often raunchy end.
   Revelers started wandering into Pat O'Brien's bar between
Bourbon and Royal streets at about 10 a.m., said Judy Polgar, a
bookkeeper at the famous watering hole. By midafternoon, the line
outside the door of the popular tourist spot stretched for half a
block.
   ``We've got a good crowd,'' said Polgar, who was in an office
just off the establishment's open patio bar. ``I can hear them.
When I can hear them I know we've got a pretty good crowd.''
   Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds made it difficult to walk down
Bourbon or Royal.
   Out-of-town revelers started trickling into New Orleans last
week and they came in droves during the weekend, undaunted by cold,
windy weather or Sunday thunderstorms.
   On Monday, sometimes dubbed ``Lundi Gras'' or Fat Monday, the
thunderstorms gave way to sunshine and mild temperatures.
   Police spokesman John Marie said Tuesday's crowds could surpass
the estimated 1 million people that jammed the metropolitan area
streets last year.
   ``We do anticipate the crowds to possibly be record crowds as
the weather forecast looks great,'' said Marie.
   Crowds on Fat Tuesday usually stretch from the stately uptown
area, where families gather before sunrise to stake out picnic
areas on the parade routes, to the central business district, where
business virtually shuts down, and on to the French Quarter, scene
of Carnival's raunchiest goings-on.
   In the Quarter, women on wrought-iron balconies bare their
breasts, and gay bars play host to male cross-dressers barely clad
in various combinations of women's underwear, hosiery, high heels,
feathered headresses and beaded gowns.
   ``There's a high degree of tolerance by the police on Mardi Gras
day,'' Marie explained. ``Sometimes the costumes can be outlandish.
   ``But if there are lewd or obscene gestures made, then the
police have to take action.''
   Parades this past weekend featured the usual mix of staid, 19th
century tradition and 1980s bawdiness. The mostly female Krewe of
Iris _ formed in 1917 _ featured fairy-tale themes and its masked
riders tossed the traditional plastic beads, cups and other
trinkets to the thousands who lined city streets.
   By contrast, the 20-year-old Krewe of Tucks featured a king and
queen aboard huge golden toilets. Its maskers threw underwear.
   As usual, the Krewe of Bacchus made the biggest splash in its
Sunday night parade. Along with its huge animated floats and
celebrity king, actor Alan Thicke, it featured a huge moving
aquarium filled with water and a dozen young women in scanty
mermaid attire.

   Actor Matthew Broderick was
fined $175 on Monday for careless driving in a crash that killed a
woman and her daughter.
   Broderick, star of the films ``WarGames'' and ``Ferris Bueller's
Day Off,'' pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving after it
was reduced from the charge of causing death by careless driving.
   Broderick was in New York when the fine was levied in a Northern
Ireland court in Enniskillen. He had been been excused from
attending the trial after the charge was reduced.
   His publicist's office was closed for Presidents' Day and he
could not be reached for comment.
   Broderick and his girlfriend, Jennifer Grey of New York, were on
vacation and driving near Enniskillen on Aug. 5 when they collided
with an oncoming car driven by Anna Gallagher, 28. She and her
mother, 60-year-old Margaret Doherty, were killed.
   The 25-year-old actor was accused of driving on the wrong side
of the road.
   Broderick spent a month in a Belfast hospital with a badly
fractured leg. A court convened in the hospital to charge him with
causing death by careless driving and free him on bail.
   Broderick subsequently returned to New York, where he has
undergone therapy and made few public appearances.
   In statements to police, Broderick said he remembered nothing
about the collision, the court was told. Grey told police she was
putting a cassette tape into the car's stereo and was not looking
out the window when the crash occurred.
   Defense attorney David Smyth and prosecutor Jim Scholes agreed
in court that it was not known why Broderick was on the wrong side
of the road.
   ``It is a tragic situation and no one will ever know exactly
what happened. I am instructed to indicate that Broderick will
always feel extremely upset,'' Smyth told magistrate Robert Porter.

<TEXT>
   A Miami businessman who has accused top Haitian
government officials of involvment in cocaine trafficking said
Monday he was going public with details on the charges because of
two attempts on his life.
   Osvaldo Quintana, 35, said at a news conference that he
personally arranged a cocaine shipment with Haitian army Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, the powerful commander of the key batallion in
Port-au-Prince, the nation's capital.
   Quintana said he knew of involvement by higher Haitian
officials, including those in the ruling government council, but
refused to give any names.
   His attorney, Ellis Rubin, said he was trying to arrange for
Quintana to testify before the same U.S. Senate committee
investigating alleged drug smuggling by Panama's military
strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Rubin said Quintana, who operated a seafood company before
becoming involved with drugs, has testified before a federal grand
jury in Miami investigating Haitian drug connections, including
Paul's role.
   Sources in the U.S. attorney's office have told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymnity that a grand jury here is
investigating Haitian officials allegedly involved in drug
trafficking. The Miami Herald has identified Paul as a target of
the investigation.
   The colonel ``was the one who supplied us with the landing
field, the equipment, the whole thing,'' said Quintana. He said he
met with Paul to arrange a 100-kilogram cocaine shipment in
December 1986.
   ``We flew (the shipment) out of his own personal ranch in
Haiti,'' said Quintana. The cocaine was flown from the ranch, 90
miles outside of Port-au-Prince, through the Bahamas to Florida, he
said.
   Quintana was eventually turned in to the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration by the owner of a plane he hired, he said, and then
agreed to cooperate with the DEA.
   After testifying in a trial here last month, Quintana told
reporters he had once seen 9,000 kilograms, or 19,800 pounds, of
cocaine in duffel bags in the palace of Haiti's
then-president-for-life, Jean-Claude Duvalier, before he was
deposed in early 1986.
   Quintana said Monday he was twice tracked by apparent Haitian
hit squads, including one that followed him to the DEA office in
Miami.
   That group was arrested when they were spotted waiting outside
the DEA office, he said, but were released a few days later. Two
months later, a second group ran him off a highway. Those men were
frightened away by a Florida Highway Patrol officer who happened
by, said Quintana.
   Rubin said Quintana was warned by the U.S. attorney's office in
Miami in January that he would not get into the federal Witness
Protection Program if he talked to the media about the case.
   But since then, no protection has been arranged for him or his
family, Rubin said.
   ``We've given the federal government four weeks in which to do
something for Mr. Quintana,'' said Rubin. ``They have not done so.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Norris, who head's Miami's major
drug traffickers prosecution section, confirmed Monday that
Quintana ``has been a source of information and is a potential
witness'' but refused to say if the investigation involved Haiti.
   He said the U.S. attorney's office was not in a position to
promise protection for Quintana because that program is handled by
the U.S. Marshal's Service.
   Messages seeking comment from the Miami DEA office were not
answered by midafternoon Monday.
   Rubin blamed the lack of action for his client on a division in
the U.S. government on whether to proceed against Haitian officials
and possibly destabilize a friendly government.
   ``It does no good to expose narcotics coming from, Panama,
Colombia, Honduras, unless you also shut off the Haitian
connection,'' the attorney said.
   Quintana testified here last month for the defense in the trial
of self-styled Haitian-American freedom fighter Joel Deeb, who was
on trial on weapons violations charges in a plot to overthrow the
Haitian government.

<HEAD>Elementary School Opens with High Hopes after Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Loop Elementary School opened its doors
Monday to 335 youngsters from a rainbow of racial and economic
backgrounds, following two years of controversy over the makeup of
its student body.
   ``There are no more Hilliard Homes children and Dearborn Park
children. They are all South Loop children,'' Principal Joan Fron
declared.
   The $5.5 million inner-city school features special fine arts
and science facilities and a staff of teachers that parents helped
choose.
   But there are problems.
   Some low-income youngsters can't attend until third grade, which
parents fear will put them at a disadvantage. And there may be
problems maintaining the required racial balance among the student
body without overcrowding.
   But Bob Saigh, the city Board of Education's spokesman, is
optimistic.
   ``They won't allow that school to fail. ... It's being set up to
succeed instantly _ in fact, I think it's already succeeded,'' he
said.
   Parents from Dearborn Park and Printers Row, growing
middle-class bastions reclaiming an inner-city wasteland, had
fought two years for a new school, saying it had been promised when
redevelopment changed the neighborhood. Meanwhile, their children
attended classes in a modified townhouse and other schools.
   But residents of the Chicago Housing Authority's low-income
Hilliard Homes project angrily reminded the Chicago Board of
Education they had been awaiting a new school for more than 20
years.
   In the end, the board devised a plan that allows children from
both areas to attend the school. It calls for a student body of 540
_ 30 percent white and 70 percent minorities. Class size is to
remain at an average 30 students.
   Classes began Monday with about 85 youngsters from Hilliard
Homes, 70 from the Dearborn Park area, 45 from two middle-income
high-rises and about 135 others, including 15 Hispanic children,
from around the city.
   The school serves pupils from kindergarten through sixth grade,
and eventually will be expanded through the eighth grade.
   ``As long as integration is maintained and there's no
overcrowding, we're satisfied,'' said Judy Hoch, leader of Friends
of Dearborn Park School.
   But the board's plan gives preference to youngsters from
adjoining neighborhoods. That means Hilliard Homes children will
attend nearby Haines Elementary until third grade, when they can
transfer to South Loop.
   Hilliard parents say this will put their youngsters at a
disadvantage.
   ``We don't think we can be sure to get the same education until
we go to the same school from kindergarten through eighth grade,''
parent Jacqueline Russell said.

<HEAD>British Want Cuts in Soviet Mobile Missiles and Conventional Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' resumption of chemical weapons
production sabotaged talks on banning the arms, Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze charged Monday.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Shevardnadze
the West will not settle for a Soviet advantage in mobile nuclear
missiles or conventional or chemical arms.
   The West wants to see more evidence of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' in foreign policy, said Howe, who
arrived Sunday for a brief visit. He is to meet with Gorbachev on
Tuesday.
   ``We in the West will be happier with (the USSR) when we can
point to concrete evidence that new thinking does in practice make
the Soviet Union an easier neighbor,'' Howe said at a luncheon
Shevardnadze held in his honor on Monday. A text of his remarks was
made available to The Associated Press.
   The Soviet foreign minister urged a ban on chemical weapons,
saying they are ``the only weapon of mass destruction which is most
probably intended for use in the area from the Atlantic to the
Urals.''
   Last December the United States began producing binary chemical
weapons, which produce a toxin by combining two relatively harmless
agents, following an 18-year moratorium on production of chemical
weapons.
   Talks on a worldwide ban on chemical weapons were close to
concluding with an agreement before the U.S. decision to begin
producing binary weapons, Shevardnadze said.
   ``The binary sabotage, and it cannot be described in any other
way, may push us ... to a new spiral of the chemical arms race,''
said Shevardnadze, according to the Tass news agency.
   ``Binary weapons, in our judgment, precisely mark the boundary
line between the interests of the United States and its European
allies. Not an imaginary boundary, but the one inherent in the
capabilities of these weapons and their delivery vehicles,''
Shevardnadze said.
   In his speech, Howe said Western Europeans are deeply concerned
about their security now that the United States and Soviet Union
have agreed to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   ``They see Soviet pressure for a nuclear-free Europe, which in
reality means a nuclear-free Western Europe, with our Eastern
neighbors still in possession of a large mobile nuclear arsenal, in
addition to your preponderance in conventional and chemical
weapons,'' the British foreign secretary said.
   Howe dismissed what he called ``any artificial linkage'' between
a U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut strategic weapons and the U.S.
``Star Wars'' program.
   Disputes over President Reagan's plan for a space-based shield
against nuclear attack still stand in the way of an agreement to
cut both sides' arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles by 50
percent.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz will be discussing that
issue with Soviet leaders after he arrives in Moscow on Sunday.
   Howe ruled out any negotiation with the Soviet Union over
British and French nuclear forces, urged Soviet support for
sanctions against Iran to end the Iran-Iraq war and welcomed
Gorbachev's announcement last week of a timetable for removing
Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.
   Howe and Shevardnadze signed an agreement Monday committing
their countries to working together to fight drug abuse and
trafficking.
   Shevardnadze and Howe last met Dec. 7 at Brize Norton Royal Air
Base, where Gorbachev stopped off on his way to Washington. The
Soviet leader and Reagan signed an agreement to eliminate their
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
   Precipitation in the form of snow, sleet, freezing rain and rain
was scattered across much of the eastern third of the nation Monday
as warmer air pushed northward ahead of a cold front.
   Temperatures warmed slowly across New England, causing a mix of
wet snow, freezing rain and sleet across the St. Lawrence Valley,
the Adirondacks and Champlain Valley of eastern New York state into
Vermont. The mixture changed to rain farther south into the Mohawk
Valley. Winter weather advisories covered much of New York state
and Vermont as roads become icy and slick.
   Showers were scattered into the upper Ohio Valley with snow,
sleet and freezing rain across north-central Pennsylvania, and the
mixed precipitation changed to rain during the afternoon.
   Snow showers were scattered from the central areas of the Great
Lakes into the middle Mississippi Valley. The heaviest snowfall was
across northeastern Lower Michigan, where up to 11 inches of snow
had accumulated at Rogers City in Presque Isle County since Sunday
night.
   Showers were scattered from eastern areas of the lower Ohio
Valley through South Carolina and Georgia, and showers and a few
thunderstorms were scattered across northern Florida.
   Another cold front was moving across the northern Rockies with
gusty wind and some freezing rain.
   Livingston, Mont., clocked wind gusts to 74 mph and wind blew at
nearly 50 mph at Helena, Mont. East-central and southeastern
Wyoming also had high wind, blowing at 30 to 40 mph and gusting to
50 to 60 mph at times at Casper, Cheyenne, Laramie and Rawlins.
Wind along Interstate 80 along the passes reached 70 mph during the
morning, and part of the highway had to be closed for about four
hours because of blowing snow.
   High wind across sections of Minnesota whipped up snow from the
ground and low visibility and high drifts closed roads and stranded
travelers in the southwestern corner of the state. Some major
highways closed at midday Sunday and did not reopen until 24 hours
later.
   Blizzard-like conditions were reported across parts of
east-central Idaho during the morning near the Montana border, with
wind reaching around 45 mph at Pocatello with occasional snow.
Besides the snow at Pocatello, rain fell during the morning across
north-central Idaho.
   Rain and gusty wind also were reported across western Washington
state during the night. The town of Forks received 2.50 inches of
rain in 24 hours ending at 4 a.m. PST. Wind gusted to more than 50
mph at the Hood Canal and Evergreen bridges.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., to 80 at Vero Beach, Fla. The low for
the day was 23 degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn.
   For Tuesday, scattered snow showers were forecast from eastern
North Dakota across the upper Mississippi Valley and upper Great
Lakes. Scattered snow also was forecast from the eastern half of
New York state into Maine, with rain or snow across parts of
Massachusetts and rain scattered along coastal southern New
England. Scattered showers also were forecast across southern
Florida.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted from the upper half of the
northern Plains through the upper Mississippi Valley and much of
the Great Lakes region into northern New England; in the 50s and
60s from western Oregon and the central Pacific Coast across the
southern Rockies, the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley
and the southern half of the Atlantic Coast into the northern half
of Florida; in the 70s over the southern California coast and the
desert Southwest, west-central and southern Texas and southern
Florida; and in the 30s or 40s across most of the rest of the
nation.

   Last-minute polls released Monday indicated
George Bush and Bob Dole were locked in a very close battle in New
Hampshire's Republican primary.
   One poll suggested Dole had edged ahead, but another said the
battle in the nation's first primary Tuesday had tightened.
   Among the Democrats, Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon are
struggling for runner-up honors behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis in New Hampshire.
   The latest ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll from Friday
through Sunday gave Dole a slim lead, but the day-to-day numbers in
the survey suggested the race had tightened since Friday.
   The interviews with 572 likely GOP primary voters gave Dole 34
percent, to 27 percent for Bush. Given the poll's
5-percentage-point margin of error, that is a small Dole margin.
   The poll put Rep. Jack Kemp of New York at 14 percent, former
television evangelist Pat Robertson at 10 percent, and former
Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont also at 10 percent. Others had 2 percent
and 3 percent were undecided.
   Tracking polls are samples taken each night and then added
together for the three-day results.
   The Sunday night results from the ABC-Post survey suggested a
tightening race. Those one-night numbers gave Bush and Dole 32
percent each among the 319 voters interviewed. ABC's analysis said
Dole surged last week, but that the race closed up Saturday and
Sunday.
   The latest CBS News poll of 588 likely GOP voters in the state
gave Bush 32 percent and Dole 31 percent. Kemp, du Pont and
Robertson were tied with 9 precent each. Ten percent of those
interviewed Saturday and Sunday were undecided, even after the
leaning undecided voters were subtracted. The sampling error margin
was 4 percentage points.
   A poll conducted for the Boston Herald and WBZ-TV had results
similar to the one-day numbers.
   This survey, conducted Thursday through Sunday, had Dole at 32
percent and Bush at 31 percent. In less than a week since Iowa's
caucuses, Dole has closed a gap that stood at 32 percent to 23
percent in Bush's favor.
   Far behind were Kemp at 9 percent, and du Pont and Robertson
tied at 8 percent of the survey of 500 likely GOP voters.
   A Gallup Poll conducted Friday and Saturday put Dole at 36
percent, his largest margin to date over Bush, who was the choice
of 28 percent of the 589 likely GOP voters surveyed.
   Kemp and Robertson each had 12 percent in the Gallup poll, while
du Pont had 7 percent and 6 percent remained undecided ahead of
Tuesday's primary.
   The Gallup organization reported a 5 percent margin of error
among the GOP voters.
   Among Democrats, all the polls put Dukakis far ahead as always.
   The ABC-Post survey of 591 likely Democratic voters gave Dukakis
40 percent. Simon had 17 percent and Gephardt 15 percent.
   Then came Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee with 8 percent;
Jesse Jackson, 6 percent; former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, 6
percent; former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, 4 percent; others, 2
percent; and undecided, 2 percent.
   The margin of error was 5 percentage points.
   The latest CBS survey Saturday and Sunday put Dukakis at 37
percent. Gephardt had 15 pecent and Simon 14 perent. Jackson had 8
percent; Gore 4 percent; Hart 4 percent; Babbitt, 3 percent; and
undecided 15 percent. The poll, based on interviews with 475 likely
Democratic voters had an error margin of 5 percentage points.
   The Herald-WBZ survey put Dukakis at 38 percent. Next came
Gephardt at 19 percent and Simon at 13 percent among the 500 likely
voters polled. Jackson was at 6 percent, Hart and Gore at 4 percent
and Babbitt at 3 percent.
   The margin of error of the survey, conducted Thursday through
Sunday, was 4 percent.
   The Gallup poll gave Dukakis 39 percent, followed by Gephardt at
18 percent and Paul Simon at 16 percent. Jesse Jackson was picked
by 7 percent of the 424 likely Democratic voters surveyed, Bruce
Babbitt by 5 percent, Albert Gore Jr. by 5 percent, and Gary Hart
by 3 percent.
   The Gallup organization reported a 4 percent among Democratic
voters interviewed Friday and Saturday.

<HEAD>Stroessner's Opponents Say Vote A Farce</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders on Monday
challenged the lopsided vote totals that gave Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner his eighth straight term as president.
   The ruling Colorado Party's final, unofficial tally released
Monday showed that Stroessner won 88.6 percent of the vote.
   The party's count also showed a 7.4 percent absentee rate, but
opposition leaders contended that up to 40 percent of the 1,446,665
eligible voters boycotted Sunday's balloting.
   Opposition leaders had urged voters to abstain and accused the
ruling party of stuffing ballot boxes, not providing opposition
ballots, failing to guarantee voting secrecy and allowing
ineligible voters to cast ballots.
   The 75-year-old Stroessner, the longest-serving head of state in
the Western Hemisphere, has led Paraguay since a 1954 military coup.
   The Colorado Party also won two-thirds of the 72 house seats and
36 senate seats. The remaining one-third will be split
proportionally between two participating opposition parties.
   The Radical Liberal Party received 96,231 votes, or about 7.2
percent, the ruling party said. The Liberal Party got 42,056, or
3.1 percent.
   The party tally listed 8,838 spoiled votes and 5,627 blank
ballots and said 107,220 people did not vote. Voting is obligatory
for all citizens between 18 and 60 years old.
   Miguel Abdon Saguir, a vice president of the unrecognized
Authentic Radical Liberal Party, charged that ``voting booths were
lacking in the majority of voting places and the vote was public
and not secret, polling officials handed out sealed envelopes with
the official candidate list already inside and opposition parties
had few or no observed overseers at the polls.''
   Luis Andrada Nogues, secretary-general of the Christian
Democrats, also an unrecognized party, told the Roman Catholic
broadcast station Radio Caritas that the majority of polling places
lacked opposition observers and in some cases no opposition ballots
were provided.
   ``As a result, this is a de facto government,'' he added.
``Yesterday's elections were a joke and the Radical Liberal and
Liberal parties allowed themselves to be used in a farce.''
   Stroessner on Sunday described the unrecognized opposition as
``liars.'' Justice Minister Jose Eugenio Jacquet referred to them
as ``insurrectionists and subversives.''
   Sabino Montanaro, interior minister and party president, said
that the government plans to combat unemployment, eliminate slums
and shantytowns and promote domestic and foreign investment.
   The Colorado Party ticket led by Stroessner garnered 1,186,693
votes, or 88.6 percent of the total, the party said. In 1983,
Stroessner won slightly more than 90 percent.
   Spokesmen for the National Election Board, which has a majority
of Colorado Party members, said final official vote totals probably
would be available Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Roxanne Pulitzer, whose version of
life in exclusive Palm Beach hit The New York Times bestseller list
this week, says she feels no bitterness toward her ex-husband five
years after their tawdry, well-publicized divorce.
   ``This is my Valentine's Day present,'' Ms. Pulitzer said of
reaching No. 10 Sunday on the national non-fiction bestseller list
with ``The Prize Pulitzer: The Scandal That Rocked Palm Beach _ The
Real Story.''
   The book, which on its first page calls Palm Beach a ``Buffet
Society Babylon,'' is full of gossip about the rich and famous,
from Alfred Bloomingdale to Barbra Streisand.
   There are also descriptions of her cocaine use and sexual
fantasies and realities. She says that the first time she slept
with publishing heir Herbert ``Peter'' Pulitzer, she fantasized
about making love to O.J. Simpson, the former star running back for
the Buffalo Bills football team.
   Ms. Pulitzer, 36, is surprisingly favorable to Pulitzer, who has
remarried and says he has not read his ex-wife's book.
   ``I married him because he was the sexiest, smartest, funniest,
strongest, most intriguing and interesting man I had ever known,''
she says in the book. They met when her first marriage, to an
upstate New Yorker with a home in Palm Beach, broke up.
   In an interview, she said she and Pulitzer, 56, no longer have
any personal conversations. She says she once loved him and does
not bear him any bitterness.
   ``Sadder but wiser, I've learned that the rules are different in
Palm Beach, just as the rich are different. Both are more ruthless.
My story is about that difference and my failure to appreciate it,
whether out of foolishness, love, passion or all three,'' she says
in the book.
   At the 1982 divorce trial, Pulitzer and other witnesses
testified about her cocaine use, affairs, occult experimentation
and in general, ``gross moral misconduct,'' in the words of Circuit
Judge Carl Harper.
   Harper awarded custody of their twin sons to her husband. Ms.
Pulitzer, who has visitation rights, got to keep her Porsche,
jewelry and some other items, and received $2,000 a month alimony
for two years.
   Stunned by the ruling and outraged by the portrayal of her as,
she recalls in her book, ``a sex-crazed, cocaine-addicted disciple
of witchcraft,'' Ms. Pulitzer refused all interviews and book
offers.
   Her money gone, she posed nude in ``Playboy'' in 1985, received
more calls from publishers and changed her mind.
   ``A lot of it had to do with the headlines of 1982, which left a
negative taste in everybody's mouth. It just gnawed at me
constantly that that was a negative situation I hadn't taken care
of,'' said Ms. Pulitzer, a native of Cassadaga, N.Y.
   Kleenex heir James Kimberly, whose former wife Jacquie plays a
prominent role in the book as the third person in an alleged menage
a trois with the Pulitzers, says the book is ``garbage.''
   ``Do you eat garbage? It's utter garbage, as far I'm
concerned,'' Kimberly told The Palm Beach Post.
   ``I have no comment on that,'' Pulitzer said of his ex-wife's
literary success when contacted Monday at his estate in Okeechobee.
``I have two young boys to bring up. That's a full-time job.''
Before hanging up, he added that he hasn't read the book.
   Other prominent Palm Beachers have said the book is just another
in a string of attacks on the high-society enclave that prides
itself on exclusivity, including ``Doonesbury'' cartoons by Garry
Trudeau comparing ID requirements to South African laws that
enforce apartheid.
   Ms. Pulitzer said she has written ``an upbeat book that's not
revenge-oriented'' for Villard Books with help from Kathleen Maxa.
   She also says she wanted to provide a set-the-record-straight
account for her sons Mac and Zac, now 10, and to present her
arguments for joint custody in divorces, although she admitted few
people are buying the book for her opinions on divorce law.
   She saves her venom for Palm Beach. Although she lives in an
apartment here, across a shipping channel from her old stomping
grounds, she still shops and gets her hair done in Palm Beach, she
says.
   The reactions she receives vary from insults to congratulations
for her courage, she says.
   ``Palm Beachers as a whole have always thought of me as an
intruder, that I married into a lifestyle I didn't deserve, that I
didn't go to the right boarding schools,'' she said.
   ``In Palm Beach you have to be Episcopalian; you can't be
Catholic, you can't be Jewish, you can't be black. I find that all
to be very wrong,'' she said.

   Indian troops screened 30,000 men in a
search for Tamil rebels and detained 131, India's chief diplomat in
Sri Lanka said Monday.
   Ambassador Jyotindra Nath Dixit also said nine people believed
to be rebels died in the operation.
   He said some rebels likely evaded Indian forces during the sweep
that began Thursday in the Batticaloa district, about 140 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   ``Investigations are continuing and we believe that some Tamil
rebels have escaped Batticaloa and moved north and west of the
town,'' he said.
   He said similiar searches were under way in the Vavuniya
district in the north and the Trincomalee district in the northeast.
   Meanwhile, a curfew imposed by Indian troops in and around
Batticaloa was lifted for 12 hours Monday. Shops and businesses
were crowded as people emerged after a weekend restricted to their
homes.
   Tamil rebels are fighting for a separate nation in the northern
and eastern portions of the island. Tamils, who are predominantly
Hindus, say they are face discrimination from the majority
Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist.
   Thousands of Indian troops have been sent to the island to
disarm the rebels and enforce a July pact aimed at ending the
four-year Tamil separatist war.
   Tamil rebels have rejected the accord, which was signed by India
and Sri Lanka. The pact grants limited autonomy to Tamil-dominated
areas in the north and east.
   On Friday, Indian troops herded hundreds of men into a football
stadium and conducted house-to-house searches in the eastern region.
   The operation is aimed at finding members of the largest Tamil
militia, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. A statement issued
by the Tigers said no Tiger rebel had surrendered or been captured
by the Indian troops.
   Dixit wouldn't elaborate on the detentions, but said up to 31 of
the 131 held were ``hard-core'' members of the Tiger group.
   An Indian helicopter sunk a boat in the Batticaloa lagoon during
the operation and about nine people died, he said.
   ``We believe they were Tamil Tigers. Our helicopters fired
warning shots but the boat did not stop and we had to sink it,'' he
said.
   Dixit said that between 45,000 and 48,000 Indian troops were in
eastern and northern Sri Lanka. He denied media reports that nearly
100,000 troops were deployed.
   He said less than 2,000 troops were involved in the searches in
the east. Sri Lankan officials say nearly 15,000 Indian troops were
involved.
   ``It is in no way a major military offensive as the media both
here and in India has made out,'' Dixit said.
   More than 360 Indian soldiers have died since Indian forces
began battling the Tigers in October, according to official figures.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.

<TEXT>
   President Mauno Koivisto won a second
six-year term Monday in a vote by the electoral college, which
acted when no one got a majority in the general election.
   Koivisto, a Social Democrat, won 1.5 million votes in the
election two weeks ago. He was 3 percent short of a majority and
the decision went to the 301-member electoral college, where his
victory was never in doubt.
   The conservative Prime Minister, Harri Holkeri, challenged
Koivisto in the electoral college along with three other
contenders, but released his electors after the first round gave
the president 144 ballots, 7 shy of a majority.
   In the second round, Koivisto picked up 45 of Holkeri's
delegates for a total of 189.
   Opposition leader Paavo Vayrynen of the Center Party won 68
votes, leftist candidate Kalevi Kivistoe got 26 and 18 stuck with
Holkeri. The fifth candidate in the general election, Jouko
Kajanoja, had no electors.

<HEAD>Veteran Policeman Funeral Draws Hundreds Of Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of law enforcement officers from
throughout Colorado and surrounding states formed a procession
Monday to pay last respects to an officer killed in a dramatic,
nationally televised police chase.
   Robert W. Wallis, 51, a 21-year veteran of the Denver Police
Department, was killed Feb. 9 when he was struck by a vehicle
driven by an armed man fleeing from a robbery. He was hit when he
got out of the unmarked police car that he had used to try to block
the escape.
   The robber, Phillip Hutchinson, 24, later was shot to death by
officers after he took an elderly man hostage. The incident was
captured on videotape by the crew of a television news helicopter,
who helped foil the escape by landing their craft on the ground in
Hutchinson's path.
   Funeral services were held Monday morning at the Basilica of the
Immaculate Conception in Denver, then streets were closed to
traffic along a five-mile stretch of city streets as the funeral
procession moved to Crown Hill Cemetery in Wheat Ridge.
   About 1,200 of the estimated 1,500 people at the funeral were
police officers, said Denver Police Department spokesman John
Wyckoff.
   ``Bob died doing what he did best, serving and protecting,''
said the Rev. Raymond Jones, police chaplain who officiated at the
funeral Mass. ``Bob was a good friend, a fair man in judgment, a
person who also made you feel better.''
   Following the service, the hour-long procession to the grave
site included hundreds of police cars and about 700 police
officers, most in uniform. At one point, the procession was four
miles long.

   The AFL-CIO said Monday it will ask
Congress to give government inspectors the power to close unsafe
workplaces and make it easier to file criminal complaints for
violations resulting in death or injury.
   Holding its annual winter meeting here this week, the labor
federation's 36-member executive council said the 17-year-old
Occupational Health and Safety Act is ``badly out of date'' with
other job and community safety laws.
   ``Reforms are needed to expand protections to workers not
currently covered, to expedite standard setting and to require
working training and education,'' the council said.
   Although the details of the requested legislation have yet to be
worked out, Margaret Seminario, deputy director of the AFL-CIO's
occupational safety and health department, said it will include a
provision broadening coverage to several groups of workers now
exempted.
   Among them are workers in the nuclear industry, some 3 million
transportation workers and more than 14 million employees of state
and local governments.
   The 14.3-million-member labor federation said it also wants to
give inspectors for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration the same authority that a sister agency, the Mine
Safety and Health Administration, has to shut down a plant or other
workplace when there is a significant hazard posing an immediate
threat to workers.
   OSHA inspectors can do that in some limited cases now, but they
first have to obtain a court order. Some companies also have
refused to allow OSHA inspectors to even enter their plants without
such an order.
   By contesting an OSHA citation for a violation, companies
effectively can postpone abating or correcting an unsafe condition
until all appeals are exhausted, Ms. Seminario said.
   The AFL-CIO measure also would require safety and health
committees with union or other worker representation at each job
site. The committees would be given the right to conduct
inspections, review an employer's hazard control measures and
direct a shutdown of a dangerous job.
   Business groups also want the law changed, but in a different
way. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has called for legislation that
would mandate cost-benefit analyses, now being practiced as policy
under the Reagan adminstration, before OSHA can issue new or
toughen existing health and safety regulations.
   The chamber also wants to prohibit OSHA from ``interference'' in
issues that it says more appropriately belong under the
jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.
   In the past year, unions have succeeded in getting OSHA to levy
fines up to more than $2.5 million against companies such as IBP
Corp., the nation's largest meatpacker, and International Paper
Co., during strikes and other labor disputes.

<HEAD>Government Says Television Journalist was Partial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH NAVARRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Monday an
American television journalist and his associates were expelled for
``twisting the facts'' and having an ``openly partial'' stand.
   ``The government of Panama and its people reiterate their
position of open doors to all news media of the world ... within
the legal, ethical and moral concepts that govern the area in our
country,'' said a statement from the Justice and Interior Ministry.d Tyrone
and Della Rae Franklin.
   The correspondent said an agent came to his hotel room Saturday
night and told him to pack his bags, and he was put on the first
available flight to Miami. He was the second CNN correspondent
expelled from the country since last summer.
   He and the network denied Panama's charges.
   Reporters for The Washington Post and The Miami Herald have been
refused entry to Panama in recent weeks.
   According to the government statement, ``From the first moment
of his arrival in Panama, Lamotte worked diligently to misinform
the audience of that network about the political developments of
Panama, twisting the facts, placing a morbid sensationalism on his
reports and projecting a negative image of the country and its
daily events.''
   It said the reports were ``openly partial to elements that seek
instability and chaos in Panama.''
   Burt Reinhardt, president of CNN, issued a statement at the
network headquarters in Atlanta saying: ``The reporting by
correspondent Larry Lamotte was fair and accurate. The real problem
is that CNN is widely watched in Panama as the only U.S. news
service carried by satellite in that country and the government
objects to any unfavorable reports.
   ``Last week CNN carried extensive live testimony by former
members of the Noriega government who appeared before a Senate
committee investigating the flow of drugs and money through
Panama.''
   Lamotte said Monday in Atlanta: ``I was objective, fair and
balanced. I went down to Panama with the intention of covering a
news story _ not with a chip on my shoulder or anything _ and
that's exactly what I accomplished in Panama. But objective,
balanced reporting is not what the government of Panama wants.''
   In another development, a pro-government newspaper said Monday
an official request would be made soon for the U.S. Army Southern
Command to leave its base in the former Canal Zone. The Southern
Command runs U.S. military operations in Latin America.
   El Matutino, citing Foreign Ministry sources, said the demand
awaits only the approval of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties, the canal is to be turned
over to Panama at the end of 1999.
   Washington has been exerting pressure on Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, military commander and the power behind Delvalle's
government, to step down.
   Public demonstrations against Noriega began last June after the
colonel who retired as second in command accused him of illicit
activities ranging from corruption and narcotics trafficking to the
assassination of political opponents.
   Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Florida earlier
this month for drug-related activities.

   Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's ambassador
to the United Nations, was buried Monday with the honors of a
national heroine and a martyr of the leftist Sandinista revolution.
   Mrs. Astorga, who died of cancer Sunday at age 39, gained fame
during the revolution by luring a general into her bedroom, where
he was killed by rebels.
   She gained more publicity in 1984, when the Reagan
administration rejected her as ambassador to the United States.
   In a eulogy at the the Government House Hall of Heroes and
Martyrs, where the body lay in state Monday, President Daniel
Ortega said:
   ``We have to accept her death, filling the void she left with
her example. At the time she fought, victory and triumph were only
hopes, but she was there, watching as he companions were killed our
wounded, but she always went ahead in combat.
   ``That was her conduct always, committed to the cause of the
poor and the workers and the freedom of Nicaragua. She was
outstanding as an examplary militant on the political front, among
the masses and the Sandinista women's organizations, and in action
as a commando.''
   Ortega recalled the ``commando'' action of 1978, at the height
of the Sandinista revolution, when she lured Gen. Reynaldo Perez
Vega, deputy chief of the National Guard, into her bedroom and
rebels cut his throat.
   Mrs. Astorga, who was married twice and had four children, later
explained the original plan was to kidnap Perez Vega and release
him in exchange for 59 Sandinista prisoners. She said the rebels
tried to subdue him, but Perez Vega resisted and they had to kill
him.
   Ortega said Monday: ``That was Nora, always firm, always
advancing, always assuming the post the revolution assigned her
during the times of struggle against the Somoza dictatorship and
afterwards, when it triumphed.''
   She was buried at the General Cemetery in Managua's old quarter.
   Mrs. Astorga was a lawyer and a member of the Sandinista
assembly, a consultative body.
   Ortega appointed her ambassador to the United Nations in
February 1986.
   The Sandinistas ousted President Anastasio Somoza, whose family
had ruled for 42 years, in July 1979.

   Vice President George Bush, pulling out all
the stops in his bid to block Bob Dole from a second straight
victory, campaigned Monday on the eve of New Hampshire's primary
with conservative hero Barry Goldwater.
   ``I believe in George Bush. He's the man to continue the
conservative revolution we started 24 years ago,'' Goldwater, the
party's 1964 nominee, said in a campaign ad. ``He's the
best-qualified candidate for president in my lifetime, other than
me, George.''
   In a furious day of campaigning, Bush said he has turned the
tide that began running against him with Dole's victory last week
in the Iowa caucuses.
   ``I'm going to win tomorrow. Believe me,'' Bush told one campus
rally, discounting polls that gave Dole a small lead.
   In the five-minute commercial with Goldwater, the vice president
added, ``I sense a rising tide...With your help, it will carry me
to the White House.''
   In the election-eve ad taped and broadcast Monday, Bush
suggested Dole is too much a creature of Washington carry on the
Reagan revolution.
   ``This election is really a question: Who can you most trust to
continue the Reagan revolution? Who can you rely on to build on
what we have done?'' Bush said in the ad.
   Bush slammed Dole for backing an oil import fee and suggested
Dole would raise taxes in other ways if elected.
   ``My closest opponent, Sen. Dole, says he believes in our
revolution....Sen. Dole is a popular and respected figure in
Washington. But that's where the pressure is most intense to
repudiate Reaganism with a tax hike,'' Bush said.
   Goldwater, 79, the retired senator, flew six hours from his home
in Arizona to be at Bush's side on the final day of the primary
campaign.
   ``I served with Bob Dole for many, many years in the Senate,''
said Goldwater, who walked with a cane. ``I think he's done a very
good job. But running the political affairs of 47 people (in the
Senate) is not like running the lives or helping in running the
lives of 250 million-odd people.''
   Dole shrugged off the Goldwater endorsement, saying: ``He can't
vote in this state.''
   Legendary Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams, the Hall of Fame
outfielder, also posed at a news conference with the vice president.
   Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, Bush's state chairman, said
Sunday's night debate turned the tide. He said the polls ``show
great movement since the debate. The polls are catching up with
reality. We're ahead. We're going to win.''
   Bush said Monday morning in a television interview that Dole was
making the same mistake Bush himself made in 1980 when he thought
that winning the Iowa caucuses would give him the momentum to carry
New Hampshire. Ronald Reagan soundly defeated Bush here eight years
ago after being upset in Iowa.
   ``I want New Hampshire to do what it did in 1980. ... '' Bush
said on the CBS Morning News. ``Bob Dole is talking momentum and
I'm talking issues on taxes and holding the line on the oil import
fee and on presidential leadership, and I think it's working, so I
want New Hampshire to correct Iowa's mistakes.
   Bush's once strong lead in New Hampshire polls has evaporated
and polls now show the race as a virtual dead heat between the vice
president and Dole.
   Bush, who finished third in Iowa behind Dole and Pat Robertson,
called Dole's proposal for a budget freeze ``a cop-out because it
avoids the tough decisions.''
   Speaking to elderly residents at a nursing home, Bush called
Dole's plan a ``straitjacket'' that would limit Social Security
cost-of-living increases to two percent.
   Dole has said a two percent COLA cap is one possibility, but he
has also suggested exempting Social Security from a freeze.
   Bush said his own ``leadership freeze'' would achieve a balanced
budget by 1993 without touching Social Security or raising taxes.
   Crowds were sparse on this Washington's Birthday holiday morning
as Bush, informally dressed in a blue ski jacket, made three
breakfast stops.
   He joined two families on a ski trip at a Bickford's Family
Restaurant for pancakes and bacon, sipped coffee with the customers
at a Dunkin' Donuts, and s while chatting with an army sergeant.

   A turbine blade from an Eastern Airlines jet
shattered on takeoff Monday and sparked a brush fire just outside
the airport, but the plane returned safely and no one was injured,
authorities said.
   Flight 8 from Miami to Newark, N.J., was taking off from Miami
International Airport about 11 a.m. when the incident occurred,
said Jack Barker, regional spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   ``Right after takeoff the pilot had a problem with the No. 2
engine and shut it off,'' said Barker. ``Parts of the turbine blade
came out and landed on airport property, and some of them landed in
a parking lot.''
   The jet, a twin-engine European-built widebody A-300 Airbus, can
fly safely on one engine, and the pilot returned to the airport 10
minutes later without incident, said Barker. The plane carried 249
passengers and 10 crew members.
   Some passengers said they feared for their lives when the
turbine disintegrated.
   ``It sounded like it hit something,'' one unidentified woman
passenger told Miami's WPLG-TV. ``There was a loud crash and it
just dropped for a few seconds, and then everybody just clutched
each other.''
   Meanwhile, the hot pieces of the engine had ignited a small fire
in a wooded area outside the airport, but no buildings were
threatened and no one was injured.
   The fragments ignited rubbish and tires in the lot, and four
fire engines were still fighting the blaze four hours later, said
Metro-Dade Fire Department disptacher Joanne Davis.
   Barker said the cause of the turbine failure is under
investigation, and said there have been only rare problems with
A-300 engines previously.
   ``It could be something sucked into the tube or it could be a
turbine failure,'' he said.

   Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole
was upbeat Monday on the eve of the nation's first primary, but he
refused to predict flatly that he would notch a second straight win
in Tuesday's New Hampshire balloting.
   ``It feels good, like it did in Iowa last Monday,'' Dole said at
the Windham Town Hall, his last stop during a day of last-minute
campaigning.
   Flanked by Olympic gymnast Peter Vidmar, former baseball
Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and his chief New Hampshire backer, Sen.
Warren Rudman, the Kansas senator dodged repeated questions about
the outcome Tuesday.
   ``I don't know how we're going to do ... That's up to you,'' he
said.
   Speaking to several hundred people in the town hall, Dole used
the analogy that Monday as primary eve was akin to Christmas Eve.
   ``It's one hour before the stores close. You might as well take
me. I'm the last one who came along today,'' he said.
   Dole trailed Bush here in the polls by a substantial margin
before Dole won the Iowa caucuses last Monday. Since then, he has
surged in the polls, some of which gave him a small lead. But
others suggested his surge had abated, leaving the race too close
to call.
   William Brock, Dole's campaign manager, said that no matter what
the outcome, Bush was a loser in New Hampshire. ``You can't have a
campaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility,'' he
said.
   While Bush bid to salvage New Hampshire, Brock already was
looking beyond.
   As for the Bush campaign's claim to have a ``fire wall of
support'' in Southern states which hold primaries and caucuses next
month, Brock said, ``It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.''
   Returning to the theme that has dominated his effort, Dole said
he stands behind his 27-years of public service and nearly 12,000
congressional votes _ a record Bush has said does not mean Dole has
the ability to lead a country.
   Dole chided Bush for blaming Congress for America's deficit
ailments.
   ``Bush bashes Congress all week and then brings up 35
congressmen to help him out'' in New Hampshire, referring the
people who came to the state Sunday to help spread Bush's message.
   ``I'm not someone who's been on the sidelines, I'm someone who's
been in the arena,'' Dole said.
   Earlier in the day, Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, autographed
copies of their book ``The Doles _ Unlimited Partners'' while at
the Fox Run Mall in Newington.

   One diehard puffer threw a kicking and hitting
tantrum on the Long Island Rail Road, but otherwise, no-smoking
rules took effect Monday with grumbling acceptance by New York
commuter rail riders.
   The violent reaction came on the 6:10 a.m. train from Manhattan
to Babylon when William Mackney, 30, of Island Park was asked to
put out his cigarette, according to LIRR spokesman Brian Dolan.
   ``He became abusive, and then allegedly kicked the assistant
conductor, and the conductor then became involved, and the man
kicked the conductor, and then the passenger allegedly struck the
assistant conductor in the face,'' Dolan said.
   Railroad police took Mackney off at Jamaica, Queens, and charged
with one count each of harassment and criminal possession of a
controlled substance, Dolan said. The possession charge was filed
when Mackney could not provide a prescription or other
documentation for seven Valium pills in his possession, the
spokesman said.
   Other protests were verbal.
   ``I think we're more discriminated against than anyone else
around,'' said Julie Sullivan of Danbury, Conn., who lit up while
waiting for a Metro North train at the North White Plains station.
   Kathleen Macklowe, who sells computers, pulled strongly on a
cigarette as she waited to board her LIRR train in Mineola.
   ``I have one, maybe two, before I board,'' she said. ``I light
up as soon as I get off.''
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, parent of the
railroads, voted last month to outlaw smoking under threat of
losing federal mass transit funds.
   Among those welcoming the ban was Jan Schoenfeld, a salesman and
onetime pack-a-day smoker from Mineola.
   ``I literally quit smoking because of the putrid smoking cars,''
said Schoenfeld. ``We were caged in that smoking car and couldn't
breathe. I had to quit to survive.''
   Dan Brucker of Metro North said the law would be enforced in a
``gentlemanly manner,'' and that smokers would be get summonses
only if they refuse to put out their cigarettes when asked. There
were no plans to put smokers off trains, he said.
   Violators face fines of up to $100.
   A hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 25 in a suit against the
ban filed in state Supreme Court in White Plains.
   The LIRR collects 272,000 fares on an average day, and Metro
North collects just under 190,000.

<TEXT>
   Ten more people have been
killed in black facitional violence in Natal province, including an
elderly couple who were stabbed to death, police reported Monday.
   Six of the deaths reported overnight occurred in black townships
near Pietermaritzburg. Among them were a 70-year-old man and his
wife, 60, and 61-year-old woman, all stabbed.
   More than 400 people have been killed in the Pietermaritzburg
area since early 1987 in a power struggle between two black
organizations.
   Four blacks were killed in KwaDengezi, a township near the port
city of Durban, the police reported Monday. They said attackers
hurled a firebomb at a house, then fired at occupants who fled.
   Most of the Natal violence stems from a feud between the United
Democratic Front, South Africa's largest anti-apartheid coalition,
and Inkatha, the more conservative organization of Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Buthelezi, chief minister of the KwaZulu black homeland, opposes
apartheid but condemns the coalition's advocacy of boycotts and
other militant strategies. Front leaders consider Buthelezi too
cooperative with white authorities.
   On Sunday, Buthelezi released the text of a letter to Archie
Gumede, co-president of the United Democratic Front. In it, he
proposed peace talks and blamed both sides for letting the violence
continue.
   ``Men, women and children are being butchered,'' he wrote.
``Apartheid continues to kick us in the guts. And yet we are
pathetically shouting at each other from public platforms. It
shames me, it shames us both.
   ``Do you and the UDF want a measure of sanity to prevail? You
and I know that for this to happen, we will have to reach some sort
of accord.''

<HEAD>Front-Runner Dukakis Says Democratic Race is Tightening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of the first-in-the-nation New
Hampshire primary, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis ignored
polls showing him far ahead and said the Democratic race is
tightening.
   Dukakis said he believes the attacks of his chief rivals _
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon _ may
have cut into his support.
   ``I haven't been watching a lot of television lately, but I'm
told people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me,''
Dukakis said. ``I assume that's going to take its toll.''
   At a campaign stop in Concord, Dukakis lashed back at some
criticism he has been taking from Simon in recent days. Dukakis
bristled at the charge by Simon that he is a technocrat who doesn't
care about people.
   ``Ask the people who know me best,'' Dukakis said, ``if there is
another state in the country that is seriously proposing universal
health care. I don't think you'll find that in Illinois.''
   Simon, Dukakis said, ``obviously does not know what he's talking
about.''
   Dukakis criss-crossed New Hampshire in a whirlwind final day of
campaigning. He said he would not speculate whether he will achieve
the 10 percentage point margin that some observers have said is the
dividing line between a convincing and a disappointing victory
margin for the governor.
   ``In the closing days of a campaign, things always tighten,''
Dukakis said. The governor repeatedly exhorted his charges to take
nothing for granted Tuesday and to work until the polls close to
get out the Dukakis vote.
   Looking ahead to primaries in the southern states _ including
Super Tuesday, March 8, when nearly all the Southern states hold
primaries _ Dukakis said he will write off no region or state.
   ``I want to be a candidate who demonstrates that he can do well
in all parts of the country,'' he said.
   In a speech in Claremont, N.H., to about 2,000 students from
several school districts, Dukakis abandoned a prepared text in
which he planned to take direct aim at Gephardt and Simon.
   In one particularly pointed line directed at Gephardt in the
prepared text, Dukakis quoted from a speech by Missouri native
Harry S. Truman in which the late president said:
   ``The policy of reducing barriers to trade is a settled policy
of government ... It is a policy from which we cannot and must not
turn aside.''
   Instead, Dukakis free-wheeled, giving a brief, standard campaign
summary and then taking questions.

<TEXT>
   The government traded one new cordoba
Monday for 1,000 old ones and raised paychecks to five times their
former level in an attempt to control inflation, which reached at
least 1,500 percent last year.
   President Daniel Ortega announced the currency reform in a
broadcast address Sunday, declaring that 10 new cordobas will buy
one U.S. dollar.
   He said the plan was ``the best-kept secret of the people ... so
that it would not be discovered by the CIA.''
   Other measures in the leftist Sandinista government's economic
package made salaries five times December levels and increased
prices of several staples.
   Gasoline, for example, rose from three new cordobas a gallon to
15. Pay rates had not been adjusted to balance last year's rampant
inflation.
   Because of inflation, the government had been collecting
50-cordoba notes and converting them to 50,000 by stamping on three
more zeroes.
   Until Monday, a dollar cost 70 cordobas in the official market
used to import machinery, petroleum and other essential goods,
21,000 cordobas in the parallel market and up to 60,000 in the
black market.
   For the currency changeover, the government opened more than
2,000 booths. Thousands of people lined up, bringing sacks stuffed
with the old notes.
   New currency is offered in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500
and 1,000 cordobas. The government retired the old cordoba
denominations of 500, 1,000 and 5,000, and the stamped 20,000,
50,000 and 100,000 notes.
   Ortega said a Nicaraguan could exchange up to 10 million old
cordobas, equal to 10,000 new ones, and bank deposits would be
adjusted automatically.
   Three days are allowed for the exchange, during which only
newspapers, fuel, medicine and medical services can be purchased
with the old bills.
   The government established a temporary radio service to provide
information on the currency exchange.
   According to the Defense Ministry, a helicopter crashed in
central Chontales province Sunday because of ``mechanical
failure,'' killing five soldiers, a government official and a local
representative of the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Vice
President Sergio Ramirez said the helicopter was carrying new
currency.
   Rides on public transport are free during the exchange period.
The national telephone company suspended cordoba payment of
international calls until a new rate schedule could be prepared.
   Ortega has blamed Nicaragua's economic problems on the
6-year-old war with U.S.-supported Contra rebels and the American
trade embargo. According to government figures, the two factors
have cost Nicaragua $3.8 billion in lost income.
   Dinicio Marenco, the budget and planning secretary, said Monday
currency reform ``puts the country in a better position to
administer the economic situation.''
   On Sunday, vice president Roberto Gutierrez of the central bank
said the new economic measures would ``benefit production, the
fiscal situation and the external trade of the country.''
   An opposing view came from Enrique Bolanos, president of the
Higher Council of Nicaraguan Private Enterprise. He predicted
``more inflation in the costs of agricultural production'' and
``unprecedented'' price increases for consumer basics.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Monday short-range
NATO missiles should not be upgraded now, underscoring differences
with the United States as Chancellor Helmut Kohl prepares to visit
Washington.
   Chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost also said the
chancellor will call for an East-West treaty banning chemical
weapons, another point of dispute between West Germany and the
United States.
   In recent weeks, U.S. officials have urged the implementation of
a 1983 NATO decision to upgrade the short-range nuclear weapons in
central Europe.
   U.S. and other NATO officials say short-range missiles gained
added importance with the superpower agreement to scrap
intermediate-range rockets.
   The West German government says NATO must develop overall arms
control strategies first and it insists on reductions in superior
Soviet conventional arms before it upgrades the short-range
missiles.
   ``The Federal Republic sees no need for an isolated decision on
modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems at
this point,'' Ost said Monday. ``Such decisions should be taken
only after new overall (disarmament) concepts are worked out.''
   The short-range and battlefield nuclear weapons in central
Europe have a range of less than 300 miles and thus primarily reach
targets on West German and East German territory.
   Kohl, who travels to Washington on Wednesday, has urged
repeatedly that higher priority be given to reducing the overall
number of short-range weapons rather than upgrading particular
systems.
   Ost also said: ``During his talks in the American capital, the
chancellor will once again press for a worldwide ban on chemical
weapons.''
   U.S. officials have said in recent months that it would be
difficult to verify such a ban, but West German officials contend
problems can be worked out.
   ``Verification is certainly a difficult question which needs to
be solved, but it should not lead us to question the basic
feasibility of a chemical weapons agreement,'' Ost said Monday.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel on Monday
defended his country's policies in the occupied territories and
blamed Arab countries for ``horrendous'' conditions in Palestinian
refugee camps, an Israeli spokesman said.
   Shamir told Italy's president, Francesco Cossiga, that he does
not consider an international Middle East peace conference a good
idea but is interested in the latest U.S. peace initiative, an
Italian official said.
   Shamir arrived in Rome Monday for a two-day visit, his first
trip outside Israel since the start of Palestinian demonstrations
in the Israeli-occupied territories Dec. 8.
   His schedule includes talks with Italian political leaders but
not with Pope John Paul II.
   The prime minister met at a hotel with about 60 leaders of
Italy's Jewish community, which numbers about 40,000. The meeting
was closed to the media.
   Avi Granot, an Israeli Embassy spokesman, said Shamir described
the situation in Palestinian refugee camps in Israel as
``horrendous'' and blamed ``the Arab countries that have not only
refused to solve the problem of refugees but continue to do
everything possible to prevent an amelioration of the situation.''
   ``We are constantly working for new initiatives for peace,''
Granot quoted Shamir as saying.
   ``We have very clear ideas and proposals that will be presented
at the negotiations once they are convened,'' the spokesman quoted
Shamir as saying. ``We will never give in to the demands of our
enemies who are trying to destroy us ... with war and terror.''
   Bianca Finzi, president of Bologna's Jewish community, handed
Shamir a letter signed by 500 Jews which expressed concern over
Israel's ``repressive'' measures in the territories and the
``paralysis'' of the coalition government.
   Shamir was scheduled to meet Tuesday with Premier Giovanni Goria
and leaders of various political parties.
   During a 30-minute meeting with Cossiga at Quirinal Palace,
Shamir said he did not consider an international conference ``the
best formula'' for solving the Arab-Israeli conflict, said an
Italian official at the talks, who briefed reporters on condition
of anonymity.
   However, the official quoted the Israeli president as saying he
found ``useful elements and ideas'' in the latest American
initiative.
   According to Israeli officials, the plan calls for an
international conference to launch Arab-Israeli talks by April.
   Negotiations would first focus on a temporary plan to give
self-rule to 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   By December, talks on the final status of the territories would
begin even if autonomy was not implemented.
   Cossiga visited Israel two months ago.
   Anti-Israeli protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are now in
their 10th week. According to U.N. figures, more than 50 Arabs have
been killed by Israelis.

<HEAD>Talks on Nuclear Testing Resume With Anti-Cheating Measures On
Agenda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators on Monday discussed
ways to test anti-cheating measures as they began a second round of
talks on limiting nuclear test explosions.
   Agreement on verification measures would permit ratification of
two superpower treaties limiting the yield of test blasts.
   The talks are due to last six to eight weeks.
   The chief Soviet delegate, Igor Palenykh, said on arrival
Saturday that the two sides are expected to agree on the dates and
details of joint nuclear test explosions, one in each country, to
be held by June.
   Each side will demonstrate its detection technology in the
experiments. Palenykh said the tests will help the two sides agree
``preferably in the first half of 1988'' on verification measures
for the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful
Nuclear Explosions Treaty.
   Both pacts limit test explosions to 150 kilotons. A kiloton
equals the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT.
   The U.S. Senate never ratified the pacts because of concerns
they were unenforceable.
   Palenykh said he hoped the two sides would agree on a
combination of anti-cheating measures that would include both
on-site detection, which Washington favors, and the remote
monitoring system Moscow wants.
   Washington has not set a deadline for agreement.
   During the session, preparations for the experiments will
continue at the main Soviet test range at Semipalatinsk and the
U.S. site in the Nevada desert, Palenykh said.
   The round opened with a meeting at the U.S. mission. The U.S.
delegation is headed by Robert Barker.
   At the first round in November, the two sides agreed in
principle to the joint tests.
   Both sides agree the negotiations should eventually focus on
reducing and ultimately banning nuclear tests.

   More than 200 youngsters tromped through
woods in cold and snow up to 2{ feet deep Monday in search of two
hatchets hidden in an annual game to remind youths of the honesty
of the nation's first president.
   The 66th Washington's Birthday hatchet hunt sent children racing
through the Kennebunk Woods to find the hatchets and other prizes,
including flashlights and compasses, said Billy Curtis III of the
Athol Fire Department, one of the sponsors of the event.
   ``They were a brave little lot,'' Curtis said.
   Tisha Mallet, 10, of Athol emerged from the woods two hours
later with the prize of the day _ the George Washington Memorial
Hatchet.
   An hour later, David Leger, 11, of nearby Hubbardston found the
Johnny Johnstone Memorial Hatchet, named in honor of the late
Alexander ``Johnny'' Johnstone. He was general secretary of the
local YMCA, which started the event.
   Legend has it that the young George Washington chopped down a
cherry tree with his little hatchet and then admitted doing so,
telling his father, ``I cannot tell a lie.''

<HEAD>Tibetan Religious Leader Says Past Government Policy Abetted Riots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panchen Lama, Tibet's No. 2 religious leader
and generally a supporter of Chinese policy, says Beijing's
``leftist ideology'' helped spark last fall's violent anti-Chinese
riots in the province.
   The 49-year-old high priest, speaking to Tibet's legislature
last month, also contradicted Chinese statements that no Tibetans
were shot by police in a riot on Oct. 1.
   Western journalists reported as many as 14 Tibetans and ethnic
Chinese were killed.
   The Panchen Lama said most police followed orders not to fire on
crowds in central Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, but that warning
shots ricocheted, injuring or killing people. One person died after
being hit directly by a bullet, he said.
   The demonstrations called for an end to Chinese domination over
the remote mountain area. China, which claims Tibet has been an
integral part of Chinese territory for seven centuries, gained firm
control after its army entered Tibet in 1950.
   The Panchen Lama's Jan. 19 speech was carried by Radio Tibet and
seen Monday in a report by a British Broadcasting Corp. monitoring
service. He returned to his home in Beijing from Tibet this week
after a monthlong inspection tour.
   ``When we arrived in Tibet, we found that comrades of the Han
nationality were angry, as were comrades of the Tibetan
nationality,'' he said. Hans are ethnic Chinese.
   The Panchen Lama agreed with Chinese officials that ``the
incidents were mainly caused by `splittists' inside and outside
Tibet who colluded with each other.''
   But he added that ``over a period of more than 20 years under
the guidance of erroneous leftist ideology, we did many wrong
things that we should not have done and we should correct these
mistakes. We left wounds in the minds of many people and need to
cure such wounds.''
   Tibet was devastated in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, during
which Red Guards destroyed Buddhist temples, persecuted people for
their religious beliefs and tried to suppress the customs and
language of the remote mountain area.
   The Panchen Lama was critical of Chinese reports on the
disturbances, saying there were many misinterpretations because few
Chinese journalists spoke Tibetan.
   Reporters ``wrote their reports in Chinese according to these
inaccurate interpretations, and the editors or editors-in-chief
revised the reports according to the requirements of such
reports,'' he said.
   The official Chinese media, in a campaign to emphasize the
government position on Tibet, has carried hundreds of reports about
Tibetans who condemn the rioters, monks who regret their actions in
the riots and social and economic progress in the area.
   The reports have increased this week with the approach of a
two-week religious festival that attracts thousands of Tibetan
pilgrims to Lhasa. The Panchen Lama confirmed that officials
considered canceling the festival because of concerns of possible
violence.
   The Panchen Lama is a loyal supporter of Chinese policy, in
contrast to the man considered Tibet's religious leader, the Dalai
Lama.
   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 and lives in exile in India.
The Chinese government says his anti-Chinese statements and calls
for Tibetan independence were the main cause of the riots, which
were led by monks.
   The Panchen Lama spent nine years under house arrest for
refusing to denounce the Dalai Lama, and was not permitted to visit
Tibet again until 1982.

   No one knows how large the underground economy
is, but it functions in countries throughout the world at
considerable direct and indirect costs, according to a new study.
   ``Under the table and off the books, millions of persons
worldwide are engaged in jobs that evade the relevant tax and labor
laws _ frequently with an official scowl, but a tacit wink, from
their governments,'' says the report released Monday by Johns
Hopkins University.
   Titled ``The Informal Economy: Studies in Advanced and Less
Developed Countries,'' it includes essays by 19 authors from Italy,
Spain, Uruguay and Bolivia as well as the United States.
   One author estimates the size of the underground economy at 4.4
percent, another 10 percent, another 33 percent of total
production. The size also varies by place and industry.
   ``Negative consequences of the (underground) process are endured
not only by workers _ who must cope with low wages, insecure jobs
and lack of occupational safeguards _ but also by entire
industries,'' they say.
   Bolivian cocaine processors, Soviet vodka distillers and
thousands of New York unregistered cabdrivers are all considered
part of a growing underground world economy that the says skews
statistics as well as producing huge unreported and untaxed profits.
   Whatever the amount, the underground activity rarely if ever
shows up on the official statistics used by nations and world
organizations in making crucial economic policy decisions.
   A decade ago the size of the underground economy in New York
City alone was estimated at more than $16 billion.
   Saskia Sassen-Koob, director of the urban planning program at
Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture and Planning,
says a survey in 1981 of four blocks in Manhattan found 90 percent
of all interior construction being done without permits. She
estimates that there are 21,000 ``gypsy'' taxicabs not licensed by
the city, twice the number of legal cabs.
   A study based on a survey of 1,000 recent Soviet immigrants to
the United States estimates that in Soviet cities of the late
1970s, 40 percent of the households received more than a quarter of
their income from ``informal'' activities. These ranged from
distilling vodka to market gardening, and from bootleg medical
services to repairing private cars with parts stolen from
government garages, according to former residents.
   In Latin America about 40 percent of the workforce is believed
to be ``informally'' employed, the editors say.

   A dentist facing charges stemming from
the discovery of a man's mummified body eight years after his death
asked a circuit court judge Monday to withdraw a guilty plea, his
lawyer said.
   ``When he pleaded guilty, he didn't have a lawyer and wasn't
familiar with court procedings,'' attorney John Pepmeyer said.
Richard G. Kunce had pleaded guilty Feb. 1 on a misdemeanor charge
of failing to report a death.
   Kunce, 56, a former Aurora dentist, was charged in the case of
Carl L. Stevens, whose body was found last month at his
Knoxville-area home.
   Stevens' widow, Carole, 42, also pleaded guilty to charges of
failing to report the death. The charge carries a maximum of one
year in prison and $1,000 fine. The pair were awaiting sentencing.
   Both also are charged with forging Stevens' name on legal and
bank documents. Kunce also is charged with cruelty to the Stevens'
teen-age son and daughter who also lived in the house with the
corpse, authorities said.
   Kunce, who had been in custody since Jan. 29, was released from
Knox County Jail on Sunday after posting 10 percent of his $55,000
bond. Mrs. Stevens also is free on bond.
   Stevens died at age 40 on May 12, 1979, but his body was
preserved through a natural dehydration process, officials have
said.
   Judge Ronald Tenold will schedule a hearing on the request to
vacate Kunce's guilty plea in the next few days, Pepmeyer said.

   Police agreed Monday to beef up security at
a sprawling shopping mall after fights broke out among some
teen-agers.
   ``I can't give you any numbers, but we are going to have some
more officers out there this weekend,'' Moline Police Capt. Thomas
Marxen said Monday after meeting with officials of Southpark Mall.
   ``We are confident there won't be any more problems out there,''
he said.
   But police said early accounts of the incident were exaggerated;
though an estimated 100 teens were on hand, they were not all
involved, police said.
   ``All 100 kids were not fighting. A scuffle broke out here and
there among the group,'' Moline Police Lt. Ken Hanger said.
   ``They found one barbecue fork and one piece of wood _ very few
weapons,'' he said.
   Three 15-year-olds from nearby Rock Island were arrested on
disorderly conduct charges Saturday after teen-agers started
fighting near a drug store at the mall, police said. Those arrested
were released later that day.
   ``People were scared in here,'' said one merchant, Victor Meeks.
``I had people crowding around this booth and asking me if they
could get inside because they were scared.''
   Disturbances have been escalating for weeks at the 135-store
mall, merchants said, with some saying it involved high school
rivalries and others saying it was a deliberate diversion to
provide cover for shoplifters.
   ``Two or three people were fighting and some other gang members
came down and got involved in it,'' mall employee Dan Kreiter said.
``It's been building every weekend and every time a few more people
get mad. It just built up until ... everything let loose.''
   Mall officials hired police officers to work Saturday because
they were expecting problems after minor fights had broken out the
weekend before, Marxen said.
   ``We weren't expecting such a large number of kids,'' Police
Sgt. Barry Schmelzer said. ``We had two officers in the area but
they weren't able to contain the crowd, not only the people who
were fighting but the people who gathered.''

<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim rejected the
``slanders, hateful demonstrations and wholesale condemnations'' of
those who want him to resign, and urged the nation Monday to unite
behind him.
   His televised speech appeared certain to deepen divisions caused
by the report of an international panel of historians last week. It
questioned the president's moral integrity and said he was ``in
close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did
nothing to stop them.
   On Monday, Waldheim claimed without giving specifics that
``parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are built
on presumptions and hypotheses. For that reason, the conclusions
drawn cannot be upheld.''
   Waldheim, 69, used highly emotional language in appeals both to
World War II compatriots and those too young to know ``the horrors
of this war.''
   He said he might have erred in not discussing his wartime past
but said he never tried to conceal it. ``I have a clear
conscience,'' the former U.N. secretary-general told Austria's 7.5
million citizens.
   In their 202-page report, the historians concluded that Waldheim
tried to cover up his service as a German army lieutenant in the
Balkans. The government appointed the panel at Waldheim's request
in September, after the United States put him on a ``watch list''
of undesirable aliens.
   In an interview broadcast Monday on ABC's World News Tonight,
Waldheim appealed to the American public for understanding.
   ``If I have misled my friends in the United States because I
didn't say anything as far as my military career is concerned, I am
sorry. ... It was not done purposely. Believe me. And I hope this
will be understood because I have so many friends in the United
States. And I hope they will believe me that I haven't done
anything wrong.''
   Waldheim also said that resigning would be against the wishes of
those who elected him.
   ``Do you really think that a clear decision by the Austrian
people on the presidency _ who should be president _ should be
corrected? Accusations which are completely wrong, which have no
foundation. Why should then the president resign, leaving the
country in disaster?,'' he said.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said in a televised interview Sunday,
which was praised even by conservative critics, that Waldheim ``did
not deal exactly with the truth'' and must restore his credibility.
   Vranitzky said he would consider resigning if the conflict over
Waldheim continued occupying time the government should devote to
other matters. The Socialist chancellor leads a coalition with the
conservative People's Party, which supported Waldheim for election
in 1986.
   Socialist Party secretary Heinrich Keller said after the
14-minute speech Monday it was ``a great disappointment'' and means
Waldheim ``will continue to be an unbelievable burden for our
country.''
   A petition drive for Waldheim's resignation has obtained more
than 2,000 signatures, including those of most leading
intellectuals, according to an employee of the news magazine
Profil. It printed the first 1,496 signatures on three pages Monday.
   About 5,000 opponents of Waldheim demonstrated in downtown
Vienna on Sunday, and about half marched to his office in the
Hofburg palace, calling for his resignation.
   The president has consistently denied wrongdoing since Austrian
and U.S. media first disclosed his Balkans service in March 1986,
during the presidential election campaign. As the controversy
continued, he has refused all demands that he resign.
   Waldheim reiterated his stand on Monday, arguing that
resignation would undo a decision fundamental to Austria's
democracy.
   ``In the course of the renewed discussion, the question was also
put about my premature departure from the office of federal
president,'' he said. ``I want to take a stand in all clarity: You,
my dear Austrians, have elected me federal president with a
convincing majority in a secret and direct election for six years.
   ``Thus it is no longer a matter of the man Kurt Waldheim,'' he
said. ``In view of the slanders, I have often asked myself in the
last two years whether I should carry on.
   ``It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that an
election result cannot be subsequently corrected,'' Waldheim said.
``A head of state must not retreat in the face of slanders, hateful
demonstrations and wholesale condemnations.''
   In a runoff election in June 1986, Waldheim won with 53.6
percent of the vote.
   Hans Rudolf Kurz, the Swiss chairman of the historians'
commission, said in a magazine interview published Monday he thinks
Waldheim would do Austria a service by resigning.
   Alois Mock, deputy chancellor of Austria and head of the
People's Party, reiterated his support for Waldheim but Economics
Minister Robert Graf, another leading conservative, expressed
impatience.
   Graf said Waldheim ``must take a decision which is very
important for our country.''
   In a radio interview several hours before the president spoke,
Graf said he was concerned about Austria's tainted image and
praised the comments Vranitzky made Sunday.
   Conservative commentators who once stood solidly behind the
president also were complimentary about the chancellor.
   In an apparent reference to Vranitzky, Waldheim asked political
leaders Monday ``not to pour oil on the fire'' of debate.
   He said the debate abroad would abate if ``the polemics stop
inside Austria itself.''
   To ``my dear countrymen'' he said:
   ``You can trust me as you trusted me two years ago when you
elected me. ... Those people who spread intolerance and discord
cannot be allowed to prevail, but rather the great majority of
those for whom it is a question of our homeland, of our common
Austria.
   ``If we want this, we will do it together and can form the
future with new strength.''

   A court sentenced seven men to labor camps Monday
for running a crime ring that used African diplomats to smuggle
paintings, icons and jewelry out of the country, Tass said.
   The official news agency said the sentences ranged from four to
eight years.
   ``During the arrest and search more than 200 paintings of the
15th-20th centuries, 800 icons framed in pearls, jewelry (including
works of Faberge) and 2.5 million rubles (about $4 million) worth
of diamonds were confiscated,'' Tass reported.
   It said the total value of the stolen goods was 4.2 million
rubles, or about $6.7 million at the official exchange rate. The
agency did not say when the men were convicted, but sentencing
often occurs at the time a verdict is read.
   Tass said Yuli Fand, a painter and former policeman, led the
ring. He and his gang had contacts among Soviet emigres who
operated antique shops in West Berlin and Vienna.
   The news agency said the group was aided by a number of
diplomats from about 10 African countries who acted as couriers.
   ``Some of them were accredited and others are still accredited
in Moscow. Using their diplomatic privileges, they carried
valuables across the border and smuggled to the USSR money and
sometimes consignments of watches and other goods,'' Tass said.
   Among those sentenced was Fassinou Emmanuel Totin, a citizen of
Benin who had been a graduate student at a Moscow university.
   Fand was sentenced eight years in a labor camp and Totin to
five. Eduard Rapoport, Valentin Andronnikov and Yegeny Popov
received six-year terms, Boris Khavilov was sentenced to a five and
Marat Oster got four.
   The men's property was confiscated.

   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who made a crusade
out of wooing business to the state, is now threatening to sue
Chrysler Corp. for breaking what Thompson says was a promise to
keep an auto plant open.
   Thompson said Chrysler promised it would build Omni-Horizon cars
for five years at a Kenosha plant it took over when it bought
American Motors Corp., and that a suit will be filed if the state
can't get a satisfactory settlement.
   Chrysler officials have denied the plant closing would break a
legal commitment. ``We did not lie to anybody,'' company chairman
Lee Iacocca told reporters when asked about the Kenosha decision
last week.
   Late last month Chrysler announced it would halt production at
the 86-year-old plant. The move will result in the layoff of about
5,500 workers by late summer.
   Thompson maintained the company made the five-year pledge in
exchange for a state promise of money to help retrain workers.
   Wisconsin's business image, as well as the image of Chrysler and
Iacocca, could be affected if the case goes to court, some
legislators and business leaders say.
   Stewart Macaulay, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law
School, said Wisconsin would have an ``iffy'' lawsuit, but good
arguments by the state could lead to an out-of-court settlement.
   ``The audience the state is trying for now is Chrysler
lawyers,'' said Macaulay, who has taught contract law for 30 years.
   Thompson said West Virginia is preparing to go to trial with a
similar lawsuit filed last fall after an Anchor Hocking Co. glass
factory closed in Clarksburg and put 940 people out of work.
   He insists the lawsuit can be won, even though there is no
signed contract calling for autos to be produced in Kenosha for
five years.
   ``There is no reason for Chrysler not to live up to its
agreement,'' he said. But ``we are going to explore every
possibility to settling this as quickly as possible,'' he added.
   Members of the business community, the Legislature and the legal
profession express doubts about the wisdom of filing a suit.
   ``We're working very hard to project Wisconsin as a
business-friendly state,'' said James Haney, president of the
Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, a 3,000-member association.
   Haney said a state's reputation in the business community can be
``set back real fast if you aren't careful.''
   ``This will undo all the governor has sought to do to improve
the business climate'' in his first 13 months in office, said
Democratic state Sen. Russell Feingold.
   ``We're going to get a black eye in the business community
across the nation,'' said Feingold, a frequent foe of the
Republican governor.
   But Thompson said failure to enforce the verbal agreement would
send the wrong message. ``They broke their word. There is no other
way to describe it,'' he said.
   State Attorney General Donald Hanaway has advised Thompson that
despite the lack of a written contract, Wisconsin has a ``clearly
enforceable'' agreement with Chrysler.
   Gerald Greenwald, Chrysler Motor Corp. chairman, said company
officials were sorry the plant had to be closed.
   ``I guess you could say Chrysler was overly optimistic'' when it

   Police fought Palestinians in the holy city
Monday and hospital officials said an Arab was wounded by gunfire.
It was the first bloodshed reported in Jerusalem since riots in the
occupied lands began Dec. 8
   In the West Bank town of Kfar Salem, 40 miles north of
Jerusalem, military investigators questioned four young Arabs who
say Israeli soldiers using a bulldozer buried them alive after a
protest Feb. 5.
   ``I am afraid. I thought I was going to die,'' Abdel Latif
Mahmoud Ishtiah, 19, said soon after he was questioned in a white
police van. ``I dream about it all the time.''
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander in the West Bank,
said a sergeant-major from the military government and two or three
other soldiers were involved and would be tried.
   He told army radio: ``Even in my worst dreams, I would never
imagine such a thing even though I constantly warn commanders to
expect the most awful things that could happen when soldiers find
themselves all of a sudden commanding and deciding the lives of
citizens.''
   In another case, the newspaper Hadashot said three soldiers of
the elite Golani brigade were given jail terms of at least 21 days
each for violating orders against excessive use of force. The army
said it had no information on the matter.
   According to U.N. figures, 54 Arabs have been killed by Israelis
since protests began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Most of
the dead were shot by soldiers, and hundreds have been wounded.
   Israeli media, meanwhile, said leaflets have surfaced in the
occupied territories calling on residents to stage a ``day of
wrath'' Tuesday by stepping up protests, attacking Jewish
settlements, holding commercial strikes and staying home from their
jobs.
   In Jerusalem, members of the Gush Emunim settlement movement
said they were printing flyers to be distributed in Arab areas. The
leaflets contain threats that if the protests continue, Arabs might
be ousted from the West Bank, Israel television said.
   Israel radio said 21 arrests were made Monday in Jerusalem,
which Israel has annexed, bringing to 437 the number of Arabs
detained in the city since trouble began in December. It said the
latest arrests include four activists who been leaders in
organizing protests.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy said arrests were made in
the Shufat refugee camp and Silwan village, both inside the city
limits.
   He said police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse
stone-throwing protesters in Anata, near Shufat. Levy said there
were no reports of shooting, but a border police officer at the
scene told photographers rubber bullets and live ammunition were
used.
   Officials at Mukassad hospital said a 23-year-old Arab from
Shufat was brought in with a gunshot wound in the abdomen. The
Arab-run Palestine Press Service said he was shot during a clash in
Shufat.
   Border police in Jerusalem's Sur Bahir neighborhood fired tear
gas to subdue protesters who built roadblocks of twisted metal and
burning tires. Associated Press photographer Max Nash saw police
detain two young Arabs.
   Sur Bahir residents said border police broke into their homes.
They showed reporters smashed windows, a dented gas heater, an
overturned television set and shattered glass panels of a china
cabinet.
   Increasing signs of friction appeared between Israel and the
United States over new American proposals for Arab-Israeli
negotiations based trading territory for peace.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told a news conference before
leaving for Italy he disagreed with a statement by Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, made in a speech last week in Washington,
that negotiations must involve such a trade.
   ``That's not the principle that guides me,'' said Shamir, whose
right-wing Likud bloc opposes the return of land Israel has
occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.
   Later in Rome, Shamir defended his country's policies in the
occupied territories and blamed Arab countries for ``horrendous''
conditions in Palestinian refugee camps, an Israeli spokesman said.
   Shamir told President Francesco Cossiga the call for an
international Middle East peace conference was not ``the best
formula'' but said he is interested in the latest U.S. peace
initiative, an Italian official said.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who leads the center-left Labor
Party and is Shamir's rival in the coalition government,
recommended a joint Labor-Likud approach to the U.S. initiative.
   ``I also proposed that we sit together,'' he said. ``It doesn't
look so good when American envoys come, and it seems that there are
two governments. Despite the differences of opinion, we need to sit
together.''
   Israel radio said the Supreme Court heard four hours of argument
about three Palestinians ordered expelled from the occupied lands
as a result of the riots. Four were sent to Lebanon last month
despite international protests that deportations violate Geneva
conventions.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, a ferry being readied to carry Palestinian
deportees on a PLO-sponsored protest voyage to Israel was damaged
by an explosion in the Cypriot port of Limassol on Monday. A man
claiming to speak for the Jewish Defense League said the U.S.-based
extremist group was responsible for ``bombing'' the ferry.
   In Athens, the PLO's chief spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said the
much-delayed voyage will sail. It was not clear when it would get
under way.

   The Irish Republican Army
claimed responsibility Monday for the fatal shooting of a part-time
soldier in the Ulster Defense Regiment.
   The claim was made in a statement to news media, delivered hours
after the Royal Ulster Constabulary said gunmen followed a
23-year-old man into the carpentry shop where he worked in Kilkeel,
County Down.
   Police said the man was shot five times in the head and chest
and died later in the hospital. Friends identified him as Alan
Johnston, a carpenter and lance corporal in the Ulster Defense
Regiment, a locally recruited, mainly Protestant organization.
   Police said the gunmen fled in a stolen car later found
abandoned in a predominantly Roman Catholic area a half-mile away.
   Johnston is the seventh person to be killed in sectarian
violence this year in Northern Ireland where the outlawed IRA is
fighting to end British rule in the province.

   A broken oil line on an air compressor used
in artificial snow-making apparently caused an explosion that
killed three men and destroyed a building at a ski resort, the
state fire marshal said Monday.
   Gauges recovered from the blast at the Canaan Valley Resort
State Park ski area indicated the three men had started the
compressor before it exploded Sunday, fire marshal Walter Smittle
said.
   ``All this is speculation,'' Smittle said. ``We're waiting for a
technician to arrive to verify (the preliminary findings.)''
   Smittle estimated damage at up to $1.2 million.
   State police identified the victims as Ronald L. Hanlon, 33;
Dale W. Liller, 25; and Randy Lee Crowl, 24, all of Davis.
   The explosion occurred in the resort's maintenance building, a
50-by-75-foot stone and wood structure at the base of the Canaan
Valley ski area. It housed a vehicle maintenance area, an office
and six compressors that mixed water and air to make artificial
snow.
   The employees killed were ``snow makers'' and had been
performing routine maintenance on one of the six compressors when
it exploded. The five other units also were destroyed.

   A man died early Tuesday when the car he had been
driving burst into flames a few yards from Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's official London residence and office at 10 Downing
Street, police reported.
   Police bomb squad officers raced to the scene fearing a possible
terrorist attack but Scotland Yard said in a statement: ``There was
no trace of an explosive device.''
   The statement said the cause of the fire at the entrance to
Downing Street from Whitehall, the main thoroughfare in the area,
was not immediately known. ``A car pulled up in Whitehall at the
entrance to Downing St. and burst into flames. The fire was put out
by London Fire Brigade and the body of a man was found inside the
car,'' an earlier statement said.
   The incident happened shortly after 1 a.m. and was witnessed by
a police officer on duty at the metal security barriers which
separate Downing Street from Whitehall.
   The car had been traveling down Whitehall from the direction of
the the Houses of Parliament, the statement said.
   Whitehall was sealed off as police investigated the wreckage.
   No details about the dead man were immediately known. A fire
brigade spokesman said the body had been badly burned.
   Mrs. Thatcher's office said in a statement that the prime
minister was at 10 Downing Street at the time of the incident but
had not been in any way involved.

   A ferry being readied to carry
Palestinian deportees on a PLO-sponsored protest voyage to Israel
was damaged by an explosion Monday that was believed set off by a
limpet mine.
   A man claiming to speak for the Jewish Defense League said the
U.S.-based extremist group was responsible for blasting the
6,151-ton Sol Phryne at Limassol, its home port on Cyprus' southern
coast.
   A senior PLO official interviewed in Nicosia said: ``It was an
underwater blast caused by a mine that was stuck, probably by
frogmen, onto the vessel. It was attached to a time fuse.''
   Asked what the Palestine Liberation Organization planned to do
now, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``We
are waiting for a decision by the command. We have to see if there
is an alternative ship for the voyage.''
   ``The JDL is responsible for the bombing at Limassol,'' said an
anonymous caller. ``This is only a warning. Next time we will bomb
it with all the people on it.''
   He telephoned his statement to The Associated Press in Nicosia.
   He said ``no comment'' when asked if the JDL also was behind the
Sunday car-bombing that killed three PLO officials in Limassol.
   The three _ Mohammed Sultan, Mohammed Buheis and Marwan Kayyali
_ were involved in negotiations to charter the vessel for the
voyage, Cypriot security sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The JDL advocates use of violence in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
It was founded in the early 1960s by New York-born Meir Kahane, now
a member of Israel's Parliament and head of extremist, anti-Arab
Kach Party.
   There was no way to verify the caller's identity.
   The head of the Jewish Defense League, Irv Rubin, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from Los Angeles:
``Whoever did this righteous action, we don't know him or her
personally ... It's a great honor they gave us the credit, but it
belongs to people much more courageous than the Jewish Defense
League.''
   A group that belonged to the original JDL, the Jewish Defense
Organization, said in a statement issued Monday in New York: ``The
JDO claims no direct involvement in this righteous attack, but
supports it 100 percent.''
   In Athens, Bassam Abu Sharif, the PLO's chief spokesman who has
been overseeing preparations for the much-delayed voyage, insisted
the ``Ship of Return'' will sail.
   ``We are continuing our plans and we will sail, in spite of
Israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas, noble
ideas,'' he said.
   Fouad al-Bittar, the PLO diplomatic representative in Athens,
said ``the damage (to the 40-year-old ferryboat) is not very
severe.'' He said a hole 21{ inches wide was ripped in the hull.
   In Algiers, a senior aide to PLO chief Yasser Arafat said the
organization will get another craft for the voyage. Salah Khalaf,
better known as Abu Iyad, also said ``Zionist terrorism'' disabled
the Sol Phryne.
   The PLO had tried to launch the voyage from Greece, but it was
repeatedly delayed, reportedly under Israeli pressure.
   The 130 deportees plus hundreds of international supporters and
journalists were taken in buses to Athens airport Monday and were
told they would be flown to Cyprus to board the boat.
   After news of the blast reached Athens, most returned to their
hotels.
   Sol Phryne's captain, Cleanthis Vlahopoulos, said his vessel
``would not be fit to sail for several months.''
   The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the
Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned
back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to Palestine.
   The trip is designed to focus condemnation of Israel's policy of
deporting Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
seized from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   The deportees included taxi drivers, laborers, a university
professo, an Anglican bishop, several mayors and city council
members.
   The voyage was supposed to end in Haifa, but Israeli officials
have said they will refuse to let the vessel enter their waters.
   Limassol Port manager John Ghighis told the AP, ``There will be
... an underwater survey to find out exactly what happened, how big
a hole there is and what repairs may be necessary.''
   Israel radio quoted political sources in Jerusalem as saying the
PLO itself set off the explosion because it realized it could not
succeed in its mission to reach Israeli shores.

   A local businessman won what was described as
the world's biggest slot machine jackpot _ $6.9 million _ at a
casino here Sunday, officials said.
   The 61-year-old man lined up four ``7s'' on a Megabucks
progressive slot machine at the Cal-Neva Club to claim the jackpot.
Officials declined to identify him, saying he'll be introduced at a
news conference Monday morning at the casino.
   The good fortune may help the man make up for a lapse, officials
said: He told them he had forgotten to buy his wife a Valentine's
Day gift for the first time in 26 years.
   The payoff surpassed the previous record jackpot of $4.9 million
won by Terry Williams of Los Gatos, Calif., at Harrah's Reno on
Feb. 1, 1987.
   Williams won his jackpot on a similar Megabucks progressive slot
machine. Megabucks links slot machines in various casinos across
the state.
   Megabucks officials said Sunday's big winner goes to the
Cal-Neva for breakfast every Sunday and regularly plays their slots.

   A frenetic final search for votes marked the eve of the nation's

invasion of exotic animal and plant species is threating the
nation's national parks.
   A draft summary of a major, just-completed National Park Service
assessment of the condition of natural and cultural resources lists
``encroachment by plants and animals not native to park
environments'' ahead of any other ``major issues and threats'' to
natural resources.
   Sometimes the invasion is part of the ebb and flow of nature, as
with gypsy moths attacking trees in Virginia's Shenandoah National
Park. Sometimes it is the end of a complex process kicked off by
humans, as in the replacement of sawgrass with cat-tail plants in
the Everglades National Park in Florida as a result of
fertilizer-laden water entering the swamp. That changes the whole
food chain in the park.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime is in
firm control as his fundamentalist Islamic revolution begins its
10th year, but a power struggle looms when the 87-year-old
patriarch dies.
   His lieutenants appear to be preparing for Khomeini's death,
which will be a major test for the revolution at a time of war,
economic hardship and increasing international isolation.
   Khomeini is reported in poor health and has sought recently,
after years of reluctance, to eliminate obstacles to economic and
social reform.
   He remains the revered Imam, symbol of an Islamic resurgence
that toppled the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought
Khomeini home in triumph Feb. 1, 1979, after 15 years in exile.

   Opening of negotiations and relative
quiet on the warfront have sparked a glimmer of hope that two
decades of savage conflict in Cambodia can be solved through
political compromise rather than more bloodshed.
   After an 8-year-long stalemate, two rounds of peace talks were
recently held between key protagonists: Cambodian resistance leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun Sen of the pro-Hanoi
regime in Cambodia.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978, now says that if an
acceptable political solution is reached, it may withdraw its
troops before an announced 1990 pull-out. And Moscow has indicated
it wants to heal itself of two festering Asian sores: Cambodia and
Afghanistan.

   Prince Edward may be fifth in line for the British
throne, but he didn't risk being late Monday on his first day at
work as a theater production assistant.
   He arrived 10 minutes early at his new job, which appropriately
is at the Palace Theater.
   Edward, who abandoned a career in the Royal Marines last year,
arrived with a confident grin on his face, a royal bodyguard at his
side and, most importantly, a box of teabags tucked under his arm.
   Production assistant is the most junior job, and the 23-year-old
prince will be expected to perform the most humdrum of backstage
errands, including making tea for his new co-workers at composer
Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Theater Co.
   Asked if he was looking forward to his first day on the job,
Edward said only: ``Of course I am.''

   This is where they teach elephants to
do tricks.
   In six months to a year, the Way Kambas Elephant School can
teach an elephant to salute, sit on concrete bench, lift things,
pull cars, climb steps, kick a ball, step over a prostrated person
_ and play soccer.
   This year 25 of the school's best soccer players were selected
from a group of 42 to play Feb. 8 at Bandar Lampung as a highlight
at a national Koran-reading contest. The Koran is the Moslems' holy
book.
   The players received three months' intensive training on how to
play good, clean soccer, because even in elephant soccer, which has
become popular in some areas of Southeast Asia, a player can be
penalized.
   After graduating from the school, the elephants are auctioned
off, with a knockdown price of $5,992, to perform in circuses or
other events.
   Most of the elephants enrolled in the school come from the thick
tropical jungles here on the island of Sumatra.
   They are rounded up with the help of experienced trainers from
Thailand called ``Mahout.'' The Mahouts have brought several
``seasoned'' elephants from Thailand called ``kunce'' to help lure
prospective students to a secluded spot, where they are narcotized
with dart-guns.
   Then the sedated elephants are loaded onto trucks and brought to
the school at Lampung.
   The idea of teaching wild elephants to do tricks arose after the
government decided against trying to decrease Sumatra's elephant
population to keep them from damaging farm crops.
   Thus, with the help of the government of Thailand, the school
was established in the Way Kambas district of south Sumatra in
August 1985.
   The school covers an area of 1,235 acres and has a staff of 10,
including five Thai Mahouts.
   An increasing human population on Sumatra and uncontrolled
slash-and-burn farming methods have resulted in a scarcity of food
for wild elephants, leaving them to forage on farms.
   The province of Lampung alone has about 500 wild elephants,
whose number grows at a rate of about 20 a year.
   The Indonesian government has launched several campaigns to move
the elephants to conservation areas. The biggest conservation
campaign, started in 1982, has succeeded in moving 230 wild
elephants into a conservation area in central Sumatra.

   Chatru Singh has given up praying to the
``rain gods.'' He is tired of waiting for the misery of drought to
end. He's thinking about leaving his farm and moving to a city like
New Delhi.
   His fields lie barren, his cows and buffaloes are emaciated for
lack of fodder, and he has barely enough food for his family.
   Four consecutive years of drought here in the state of Rajasthan
have reduced his farm and hundreds of thousands of others to
expanses of dust.
   The drought has brought severe shortages of drinking water and
fodder, spiraling prices and fears of even worse times ahead if the
rains fail again this year.
   The lack of water and feed even has afflicted the state's
hundreds of thousands of camels, the main mode of transportation
for villagers scattered about the desert area.
   Instead of growing lentils and wheat on his five-acre farm,
Singh, 46, now builds roads under a government relief program.
   He considers that demeaning work, but it provides him with 70
cents a day to feed his wife and three children.
   ``First the monsoons failed so our summer crop was destroyed,
and then we couldn't sow the winter crop because there was no
moisture in the earth,'' Singh said during a pause in his work on
the road. Even so, he said, he sowed some seeds, but the birds ate
them.
   The Rajasthan state government is engaged in a massive relief
program, selling wheat at subsidized prices, hiring people for
construction work, running camps for abandoned cattle and deepening
wells. But officials say that if it doesn't rain this summer, the
state cannot continue the program.
   Rajasthan, which forms a part of the vast Thar desert extending
from western India to Pakistan, traditionally is drought-prone. The
normal rainfall in the state, known for its forts and palaces,
varies between 2 inches to 10 inches but last year the rains failed
completely.
   India was gripped by the century's worst drought last year and
16 of its 25 states were affected. Those states asked the federal
government in New Delhi for $4.6 billion in assistance but got only
$1.54 billion to divide up among them.
   ``We will have a law and order problem this summer if it still
doesn't rain,'' said R.N. Meena, the Ajmer district's top
administrator.
   ``Many animals will die. No one can save them. Only the rains
can.''
   The district has an estimated 650,000 cattle and they need
fodder, Meena said.
   ``We bring in about 80 to 90 trucks from other states while the
requirement is 400 trucks.''
   Water in Ajmer, a city of 450,000 people, comes once every three
days, and people store it in every available receptacle. Housewives
save bathwater to use for their laundry.
   Anasagar, a huge artifical lake that provided drinking water to
Ajmer, is completely dry for the first time since it was created in
the 12th century by the damming of the Luni River. Residents say it
is a curious sight to see people walk on the lake bed.
   ``There is hardly any ground water here because the area is
rocky,'' said Ram Prashad Choudhary, spokesman for the district. He
added that only very big farmers can afford the high cost of
digging irrigation wells.
   It costs about $7,692 to dig a well because the drilling has to
go down 700 feet to reach ground water, Choudhary said.
   Many poor people, whose main occupation was raising cows and
selling milk, have abandoned the animals or sold them to butchers
from Bombay at throwaway prices.
   A count in 1983 came up with 49 million head of cattle in all of
Rajasthan, India's second-largest state with 39 million people.
Nobody knows how many are left. In normal conditions, each animal
requires about 45 pounds of food a day.
   The people of Rajasthan often face the dilemma of feeding
themselves or their cattle.
   Zakeera Banu, a Moslem woman working on a state project to
deepen a pond near Ajmer, said, ``I earn 9 rupees (70 cents) a day.
I can either buy enough fodder for my two goats or vegetables for
ourselves.''

   The government estimates that 10,000
to 20,000 homeless children roam the streets of the Ermita
red-light district in Manila, falling into lives of prostitution,
petty crime and drug addiction.
   Volunteers and social workers have mobilized in an effort to
save them.
   ``We have street children, we have all types of exploited
children. They are victims,'' said Nenuca Ross, a volunteer with
the government's Department of Social Welfare.
   Many of the children drifted into Manila from impoverished rural
provinces.
   But with few skills and no education, both parents and children
survive by begging and by selling cigarettes and smuggled watches.
Many of the children go on to prostitution, pickpocketing,
shoplifting, extortion and drug trafficking.
   But the government and private agencies are now intensifying
efforts to find and rehabilitate such children and break the cycle
of crime and poverty.
   ``We go to them,'' Mrs. Ross said. ``We talk to them. We sit on
the sidewalks with them, invite them to a hotdog sandwich or
something.''
   Mrs. Ross said the children are easiest to persuade on rainy
days when ``business is bad'' or when they are apprehended by
police.
   Once they have been found, children 6 to 13 years old are taken
to the welfare department's ``tent schools'' where they receive
counseling and the rudiments of reading and writing.
   Those who have suffered serious beatings, drug addiction or
sexual abuse are taken to a half-way house in Alabang, a Manila
suburb where they receive psychiatric help. Teen-agers go to
state-run juvenile institutions.
   Officials say child prostitution has been a problem for years
and President Corazon Aquino has promised to crack down on child
prostitution and give greater priority to child welfare programs.
   Rita Roque, Manila's welfare department director, said the
city's two tent schools have successfully reintegrated some 100
children since the program began last year. The department plans to
build a third school in Ermita, the red-light district of seedy
bars, brothels and cheap hotels near Manila Bay.
   Mrs. Ross said about 800 children have been graduated over the
past two years from the Alabang center. But she added that about
800 others escaped and returned to the streets.
   ``That's because they are not helped,'' Mrs. Roque said. ``It's
not because they really want to but there is no other way for them
to survive. Unless a helping hand comes along and helps them
recover, that is what will happen to them.''
   Mrs. Ross said criminal syndicates work actively against welfare
workers to prevent children from seeking help.
   ``I've seen some of these transactions, but we cannot
intervene,'' she said. ``There is a Mafia. They are surrounded by
pimps. They have become hardened. We cannot reform their
personalities.''
   In the best of circumstances, she added, saving a child who may
never have had a home can be a long, painful process.
   ``A (street) child does not open up to you until maybe six
months,'' she said. ``You have to gain their trust first. You don't
force them to open up because they will all answer lies. They've
learned this from the streets. But if you leave them at their own
pace, little by little they will tell you their stories. They know
they have a friend.''
   For 18-year-old Jose, a former drug addict, the breakthrough
came when he asked social workers to give him a birthday party.
   Mrs. Ross said that during the party, Jose began to cry and
admitted it was not his birthday.
   ``I told him never mind, that's for all the birthdays you never
had,'' she said. ``He was touched. From then on he said, `I want to
go to school, I will stop my drugs,' and he did stop.''
   The youth is now in the fourth grade and serves as ``older
brother'' to newcomers at the Alabang center.
   ``We are building up for the future,'' Mrs. Ross said.

<HEAD>WORLD BYWAYS: Chile's Patagonia _ Seldom is Heard a Disparaging

<DATELINE>COYHAIQUE, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A disparaging word about Chile's
military government seldom is heard in the homes on the range of
rugged Patagonian.
   More than 1,300 miles removed from the political machinations of
Santiago, the nation's capital, inhabitants say they prefer
progress to protest.
   And many are quick to credit President Augusto Pinochet, the
right-wing army general, with bringing the 20th century to the
isolated southern region, where even the relatively young recall
when hitching posts lined the streets.
   ``He is a great man,'' proclaimed Amalia Chible, standing in the
sunlit living room of her roadside home and restaurant about 70
miles south of Coyhaique, the region's capital.
   On the wall hangs a color photograph of Pinochet, broadly
smiling from behind his presidential desk. It is hand-signed,
``Affectionately yours.''
   Support for the army commander who seized power in a 1973 coup
is considered stronger in Chile's rural provinces than in the big
cities, where the political opposition is most active. But nowhere
is it stronger than in Chilean Patagonia.
   The reason lies outside Mrs. Chible's door: an unpaved but
well-tended road that the government calls the Great Southern
Highway.
   The two-lane road winds along the southern Andes for some 350
miles, through mountains, forests and sheep ranches. Still under
construction, it was started by Pinochet's administration. He
considers it one of his most important public works and each year
proudly comes to officially open a new stretch.
   ``People cried with joy when the road came through,'' Mrs.
Chible, who is about 50, told a visitor. ``Before, life was
terrible. Now the wool gets out, and life is rich.''
   Abel Avedano, a horsecart operator, agreed, calling the road
``one of the great works'' of the president. ``You've go to give
him that.''
   Cut off from the rest of the country by deep fiords, towering
mountains and glaciers, Patagonia remained virtually uninhabited
for a long time after Chile achieved independence from Spain in
1810. It was notorious for blustery weather year-round, with winter
temperatures dipping to 20 below zero.
   Settlers began trickling in when, in the early 1900s, the
government handed out tracts of land to sheep ranchers.
   Coyhaique was founded just 50 years ago, and until recently was
little more than a place where ranch hands came to get drunk on pay
day.
   ``The people were fairly rough-edged,'' recalls Mario Miranda,
an art historian who was born in Coyhaique in 1951.
   He recalls, as a child, seeing a cowboy ride his horse down the
narrow hallway of the local hotel, firing a six-shooter into the
ceiling.
   ``The guests, who were sleeping just above, were terrified,''
Miranda said. ``It was quite a scandal.''
   Then came the highway, and with it new settlers, supermarkets,
department stores. Jeeps, pick-up trucks and even taxis have
replaced horsecarts on the downtown streets. At the airport, where
an aging cargo plane used to land just once a week, modern
passenger jetliners arrive daily with businessmen and tourists.
   ``We went from the hitching post to video clubs, practically
overnight,'' Miranda said.
   Employed by the state education department's division of
culture, Miranda is anxious to preserve some of the settlers'
traditions, such as working with leather and wool. ``It's rapidly
becoming contaminated by the contact with outside, with Santiago.''
   Many of the traditions came from Argentina, through the mountain
passes that once were the only way in and out of Chilean Patagonia.
Political relations between the neighboring countries often have
been tense, and a territorial dispute brought them to the brink of
war in 1978. Pinochet's efforts to develop and populate the region
are seen, at least in part, as an effort to protect it from
invasion.
   Recent waves of nationalism have diluted the area's Argentine
flavor. Chilean cowboy songs and dances replaced those of the
Argentine gaucho, and the Argentine habit of drinking tea from a
hollow gourd became less popular.
   Francisco Mena, an anthropologist who works with Miranda, said
that in outlying villages and farms many of the old customs are
preserved.
   ``People spin their own wool, weave their own ponchos and make
their own riding tack from leather they themselves have tanned,''
he said.
   But many have left Patagonia to sign on for ranch work in the
U.S. West. Some come back when their three-year contracts are up.
Others, having developed a taste for American living, don't.

   The South Korean press is enjoying a
broad degree of freedom after years of tough official control, but
opposition quarters maintain it still is manipulated by the
government's ``hidden hands.''
   Nevertheless, the nation's newspapers are reporting and
commenting more vigorously on politics and other subjects that for
years had been limited or banned by the government.
   President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who takes office Feb. 25, promises
to ensure full press freedom and made it a key point in his
election campaign. The government began easing press restrictions
last summer under pressure from Roh.
   ``We have done much and there should be nothing to complain
about,'' said Lee Jung-bai, the assistant culture-information
minister.
   Journalists agree the government has abandoned most controls on
the domestic press, such as regular visits to newspapers by
security agents and the issuance of ``press guidelines'' that
dictated what could be reported and in what way.
   Government reguirements on registration of journalists have been
dropped and new legislation will end limits on newspapers having
news bureaus outside their headquarters locations. There also will
be no limits on the number of pages a newspaper can publish.
   ``The ball is in the court of the news media. It's up to them,''
said Rep. Lee Min-sup, a ranking member of Roh's Democratic Justice
Party.
   Opposition politicians and dissidents contend, however, that
much of the press still remains under government control through
``hidden hands.''
   Rep. Kim Tae-ryong, spokesman for the main opposition
Reunification Democratic Party, said, ``No basic changes have been
made and the press still is no more than a public relations tool of
the government.''
   The opposition claims the government exerts behind-the-scenes
influence and control, ranging from intimidation to patronage and
bribery. They also contend the media is packed with government
supporters.
   Rep. Ahn Dong-sun, spokesman for the opposition Party for Peace
and Democracy, claimed journalists are practicing self-censorship.
   Kim Tae-hong, secretary-general of the dissident Council for
Democratic Press Movement, said, ``Essentially, Roh is the same as
his dictatorial predecessor. He would not give in easily. We must
continue to fight for press freedom.''
   Several editors and reporters rejected the opposition charges of
self-censorship, but said they want to help ensure ``sound
political development'' without endangering social stability.
   One senior editor, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
many journalists are cautious because ``they suspect the true
intention of the government.''
   The opposition claims the country's two networks, which are
state-owned, project only a government viewpoint and that opposing
points of view receive little attention or are distorted.
   A Korea Broadcasting System (KBS) spokesman, Lim Ung-shik,
rejected the opposition's charges.
   ``Our news and other programs are fair by any standard,'' he
said.
   Lim said KBS has recently started some new programs, including
talk shows to which opposition figures are regularly invited.
   Government officials say the criticism the networks may end
after a neutral broadcasting committee is set up in June, as
required by a new law, to nominate the heads of the two networks.
Some opposition lawmakers will be appointed to serve on the
committee to ensure fairness.
   The government is also preparing to inaugurate in March a new
press law that would drop a requirement for government approval to
start new newspapers or periodicals.
   Seven newspapers have so far applied to start publishing under
the new law. South Korea now has 20 national daily newspapers with
an estimated combined circulation of 12 million.
   The first beneficiary of the new law would be a newspaper that
some 200 dissident journalists plan to publish this spring with
support from 3,300 sponsors, including 1,000 college professors,
100 lawyers, 200 religious leaders and 200 literary figures.
   Song Kun-ho, president of the newspaper, The Hankyoreh Shinmun,
said the project will be started with 5 billion won ($6.8 million)
to be raised through public shares. Song said 15,000 people have so
far responded, contributing about half of the needed money.
   Song and the other journalists, dismissed from their previous
jobs on grounds of anti-government activity, said their newspaper
would emphasize human rights and spearhead press freedom.
   The influential Roman Catholic Church also has announced it will
start a newspaper in April and set up a nationwide radio network in
September.
   Critics of the government contend the new press law is
restrictive because it stipulates that new newspapers must use
certain kinds of presses that cost millions of dollars. They
contend this would keep control of the press in the hands of
establishment groups.

<HEAD>Danish Air Force May Take on Women as Fighter Pilots</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK POWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Katrine Hvitved, a 16-year-old high
school student, wrote an irate letter to a newspaper complaining
that Danish air force discriminates against women and keeps her
from fulfilling her dream of flying an F-16 jetfighter.
   But the air force has told her, maybe not.
   ``I would like to be a pilot, but can't be one in the
military,'' she wrote to the newspaper Jyllands-Posten. ``It's
unjust!''
   Two weeks later, Defense Minister Bernt Collet replied to
Katrine in a letter to the same newspaper saying an air force
policy of keeping women from piloting military planes is under
review and likely to change.
   Women are accepted in Denmark's armed forces but they cannot fly
planes.
   Katrine, who specializes in science and mathematics at school,
said by telephone from her home in the port city of Aalborg she was
delighted with Collet's response.
   ``I've been crazy about jet planes for years and enjoy visiting
air force bases.''
   But she added that she still has a problem.
   ``My parents would rather I stayed on the ground.''
   Nevertheless, she's decided to join a parachutist's club.
   Last year the military began a study women pilots. Based mainly
on the experiences of other NATO countries, the report is expected
to be submitted to a parliamentary committee for action later this
year.
   ``The military chiefs seem to be very positive towards the
proposal,'' said Maj. Benny Hansen of the air force, the Defense
Ministry official who deals with personnel.
   A decision to allow women into flight training would be in
keeping with military policy laid down in 1980 of equal rights in
all branches of the armed forces, Hansen added.
   Experiments since 1980 placing women in combat units have proven
successful, Hansen said.
   ``The military hasn't noticed any weakening of fighting strength
in combat units with women in them.''
   A total of 844 women, including 58 officers, were serving in all
armed forces branches as of June last year, the date of the latest
available statistics. They were in field units in the infantry, the
tank corps, surface-to-air missile squadrons and base patrol duties.
   The navy has five women officers and 99 sailors. They serve on
inspection vessels, corvettes and torpedo boats. But they aren't on
submarines, where quarters are too close.
   Hansen said he sees no problems for women as helicopter or
transport plane pilots. But experts are still concerned about how
women would stand up to the extreme gravitational forces
experienced by pilots of supersonic jets.
   G-stress and speed and precision of reaction were problems for
male fighter pilots, too, Hansen said.
   In Denmark, aspiring combat pilots go to a two-year civilian
flight school supervised by the military before being sent to
United States for advanced training.
   ``Female pilot trainees will face the same physical and
psychological demands that men do, and there will be no lowering of
standards to get women in,'' Hansen said.
   Nor would a woman's maritial status or the fact she had children
be taken into account, he added.
   Hansen pointed out that in neighboring Norway, where women
already train as military pilots, only two out of 300 candidates
have earned wings.
   The Netherlands, Canada and United States also have trained
women pilots for their air forces.

<HEAD>Shortages of Cooking Oil and Sugar Rile Egyptians</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than President Hosni Mubarak's efforts
to bring peace to the Middle East, Egyptians are talking these days
about shortages of cooking oil and sugar. It's angry talk.
   Cooking oil and sugar are important items on the Egyptian menu,
used extensively by peasants who make up half the nation's 51
million people.
   Cooking oil is added to beans, which are eaten at breakfast and
dinner, and used to fry vegetables, especially eggplant and
potatoes, the usual peasant lunch.
   As for sugar, Egyptians consume so much in tea, pastries and
candy that the Health Ministry has begun a television campaign in
an effort to persuade people that more than six lumps a day is
harmful.
   The shortages have been assailed in the news media and heatedly
discussed in coffee shops.
   The subject has come up in the Shura Council, a government body
of experts in various fields who give advice to Mubarak and to the
People's Assembly, the national legislature.
   And in the People's Assembly itself, Prime Minister Atef Sedki
was taken to task because of his Cabinet ministers had denied that
the shortages exist. Sedki admitted they were not being entirely
candid, but he assured the assembly that Egypt once again will get
by.
   Food shortages are nothing new to Egypt. The country must import
60 percent of what it eats and it doesn't have the money to pay for
all it needs. In addition, it increasingly has more mouths than it
can feed, as the population explodes at a rate of 1 million every
nine months.
   That coupled with stagnant food production has transformed the
country from the food exporter it was three decades ago to the
importer it is today. The nation, facing a foreign debt of $44
billion, doesn't have the money to pay for it all.
   Nobody has a ready solution. Increasing food production isn't
easy because only about 4 percent of the country's land area, the
Nile River Valley, is fertile, and little money is available to
reclaim and cultivate the desert.
   Egypt is among the world's biggest producers of cotton, which is
the source of most cooking oil used in the country, but it must
import more than 80 percent of its needs _ at a cost of $250
million a year.
   ``We import 500,000 tons of cooking oil, at the cost of $500 a
ton,'' said Rifaat Saadawy, an official in charge of oil imports at
the Industry Ministry.
   ``So the cooking oil crisis is connected with the foreign
exchange crisis, and any shortage in foreign currency means a
shortage of providing cooking oil for local consumption.''
   Similarily, despite expanses of sugar cane in central Egypt, the
country's farmers produce only about half the nation's needs,
forcing imports of 700,000 tons for almost $158 million last year.
   A further complication is that many stable foods are distributed
through expensive subsidy and ration systems. Under pressure from
the International Monetary Fund and at the urging of the United
States, the government has been trying to reduce the subsidy
systems' burden on the national Treasury.
   For the past two years, it has tapered off the number of
subsidized items available at government stores or purchased with
ration cards from private markets. But the items taken off the list
cost much more.
   Despite the cutbacks, the government spent $2.2 billion in the
1986-87 fiscal year on subsidies for food and other items. That's
only $675 million less than the subsidy bill in 1983-84 and remains
much higher than levels Washington and the IMF want.
   The government does not want to eliminate or sharply reduce
subsidies because it fears a recurrence of food riots in which more
than 70 people were killed in 1977.
   For peasants like Nawal Mohamedein, who lives at el-Faronia, 30
miles north of Cairo, the system is not working.
   ``The official price of a one-kilogram (2.2-pound) bottle of oil
was 80 piasters (36 cents,) but now it is not available in the
shops,'' she said. ``I buy it off the black market for 3.5 pounds

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When presidential aspirant Joseph Biden was
caught in rhetorical plumage borrowed from a British politician, an
uproar ensued. But how many candidates or other movers and shakers
write their own speeches and quip their own quips? Their eloquence
is manufactured by self-effacing, anonymous ghosts, who work
overtime in an election year.

   ``No one,'' Walter Lippman said, ``can write
an authentic speech for another man. It is as impossible as writing
his love letters for him or saying his prayers for him.
   ``When he speaks to the people, he and not someone else must
speak. For it is much more important that he is genuine...than that
he be bright, clever, ingenious, entertaining, eloquent or even
grammatical.''
   No specialized talent is required, Lippman said. ``Anyone who
knows what he is doing can say what he is doing, and anyone who
knows what he thinks can say what he thinks.''
   Lippman was an important columnist whose judgments were closely
attended by presidents, tycoons and other pillars of power. But on
the matter of speech writing, no oracle was ever more widely
ignored, then or now.
   Especially now, an election year, when the full monsoon is upon
us. Never were more people cleaving the air with more speeches
written by other people.
   In the stupefying war of words, 12 of the 13 original candidates
for president used at least one mercenary each, as do most
senators, representatives, governors, mayors, bank presidents,
tycoons and assistant tycoons. Humble Gary Hart has no speech
writer.
   The Super Bowl, of course, is the White House, where President
Reagan has five full-time writers, four researchers and assorted
free-lance specialists to help him with a portentous speech on the
crisis in Iran or Wall Street, with a one-liner for reporters, a
tidbit for a tete-a-tete with visting royalty in the Rose Garden,
an inspiring sermon on the State of the Union, taped birthday
greetings for Jimmy Stewart, a proclamation summoning the attention
of his countrymen to Dairy Goat Awareness Week.
   For three days of summitry with Mikhail Gorbachev, the boys in
the back room provided the Great Communicator with warm words of
welcome and farewell, one treaty signing statement, one evening
broadcast, two dinner toasts and nine Russian proverbs for targets
of opportunity. (He used seven.)
   Cooling or thawing, the Cold War is fought with the menace of
vast armadas of planes, aircraft carriers, submarines, guided
missiles, nuclear bombs and speech writers.
   Ted Sorensen wrote for John Kennedy. Fyodor Burlatsky wrote for
Nikita Khrushchev. They met for the first time in New York two
years ago.
   ``In effect, we have met before,'' said Burlatsky. ``We have
corresponded.''
   ``Really?''
   ``You helped write President Kennedy's messages during the
missile crisis. I helped write Chairman Khrushchev's answers.''
   Eyeball to eyeball, typewriter to typewriter, the twain met.
   William Safire wrote for Richard Nixon. Georgy Kornienko wrote
for Leonid Brezhnev. In 1972, in the Great Hall of the Kremlin,
after the signing of the first treaty limiting strategic weapons,
the writers sat side by side basking in the warm glow of the toasts
they had written for the two world leaders.
   Kornienko, particularly, basked during Brezhnev's delivery of
his toast.
   ``Can you not hear the steps of history going by us?'' he
whispered to Safire, ghost to ghost.
   The example may be Russian rococo but it is history, they say,
that lures perspiring writers to aspiring presidents. The chance
that one day their words may soar out of the Oval Office or a joint
session of Congress is the fuel propelling most of the
practitioners now pounding typewriters in planes, trains, buses,
cars, motel rooms, bathrooms and the dank wings of theaters. The
hope of marble sustains them in their frantic anonymity.
   Ever after their words become history, a curious honor code
prevails among presidential speech writers. Even at this late date,
neither Clark Clifford nor Ted Sorensen will tell you which golden
phrases he crafted for Harry Truman or John Kennedy. It was years
before we learned that honest George Washington got help on his
farewell address from three ghosts named Madison, Jefferson and
Hamilton.
   Safire and Pat Buchanan reveal nothing about the language they
supplied Nixon or Reagan, but on a vice presidential level they
have confessed their connection with the ``pusillanimous
pussyfooters'' and ``nattering nabobs of negativism'' immortalized
by Spiro Agnew.
   Among Jimmy Carter's writers, the vow of silence was
particularly easy to observe after his speech before a
distinguished audience in Mexico City. None was tempted to rush
forward to claim authorship of his jocular remarks about jogging in
Mexico because of ``Montezuma's revenge.''
   Besides his humor, Carter's writers worried about twists of his
tongue. To their horror, in a major speech, they heard him identify
a huge block of voters as ``eyetalians'' and one of the party's
saints as ``Hubert Horatio Hornblower'' (nee Humphrey). Gerald
Ford's writers tried to keep him away from ``judgment,'' which he
insisted on making ``judg-a-ment.''
   Reagan's writers luxuriate in his masterful delivery of their
lines but their ulcers stir when he strays from the text. At such
times, he has been known to come up with a statistic or item
unchecked by White House researchers which later requires
correction. This president literally saves his own supply of speech
goodies in a shoe box.
   Sen. Robert Dole's staff worries most about his wit, which seems
clearly the best among the candidates _ but unreined lunges for the
jugular. George Bush's two writers tense up when he ad-libs
something folksy. Trying to explain why he did poorly in an Iowa
straw poll, the vice president said his supporters were probably
busy that day with other things, like a daughter's coming out
party. This in a state gloomy with farm foreclosures.

   ``We're paid for our anonymity,'' said Landon Parvis, one of the
busiest ghostwriters around. ``It's almost like a doctor-patient
relationship.''
   Never was that confidentiality more strictly obeyed than in the
presidential demise of Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware. His writers
said nothing. Asking them was like asking a team of surgeons which
one killed the patient.
   ``I made some mistakes,'' Biden said without further explanation
of the mysterious osmosis by which the same words, images and
family memories traveled incognito from Neil Kinnock, who wanted to
be prime minister of Great Britain, to Joe Biden, who wanted to be
president of the United States.
   Safire, now a New York Times columnist and reigning scholar on
speechmanship, thinks Biden may have suffered self-hynosis in the
wearying blur of the campaign and began to believe that Kinnock's
thoughts were his thoughts.
   Safire points out that he and other presidential writers over
the years have borrowed speech patterns and rhythms from each other
without attribution. He does concede that Biden's loan was a case
of ``heavy lifting.''
   Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin asked what difference does it
make, anyway? Most candidates and many politicians use speech
writers. Is it more moral to buy a speech and claim it as your own
than to steal it?
   In the flurry of charge and counter-charge, only Al Haig
appeared safely immune among the candidates. Who would think to
accuse him of literary theft, this square-jawed warrior who fires
his crossbow at the State Department for ``Cheshire-catting,'' who
rises fearlessly against ``bureaucratic amoking'' and is ready to
``caveat that'' or ``context this''?
   Abe Lincoln, the president who delivered the greatest speeches,
wrote his own. Of the two best orators of their time, Franklin
Roosevelt used a phalanx of ghosts and envied Winston Churchill for
being able to write his own.
   George Washington's three helpers went on to become presidents
themselves. No presidential writer since has done quite as well,
although Judson Welliver now enjoys something of a revival more
than 60 years after his time. There is now a Judson Welliver
Society of former White House writers.
   Who, you may well ask, was Judson Welliver? He's the fellow who
went to work for Warren Harding as a ``literary clerk'' and became
the first full-time presidential ghost in history. He also wrote
for Calvin Coolidge. To no avail. Alice Longworth still thought of
Coolidge as someone ``weaned on a pickle.''
   Speech writers are torn by a conflict of code and ego. They
readily tell you that as a result of getting to know their man, his
ideas, tastes and speech patterns, the text they finally give him
is basically ``his.''
   This is their answer to Lippman. The words may be theirs; the
thinking is the client's. Also, says Robert Shrum, who writes for
Rep. Richard Gephardt, the American people would scarcely approve
of their busy president consuming three days to write a speech.
   But the hired hands also yearn for a statute of limitations on
the law of silence so that students of history will know who wrote
what. A writer and his words are not soon parted. At Nixon's first
inaugural, Safire found himself wandering around the edge of the
crowd silently mouthing his lines as the president spoke them.
Embarrassed, he moved on and there was Buchanan mouthing his lines.
   All agree it would be difficult to write for someone they
disliked. In this respect, the busiest is the most ecumenical;
Landon Parvin writes for Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, corporate
heads, other Republicans AND some Democrats who suit his ideology
but wouldn't care to have that public.
   Last year, Parvin's work for Reagan ran the gamut from the
solemnity of major speeches on Iran-Contra and AIDS to scores of
one-liners on the order of: ``It's true hard work never killed
anybody, but I figure why take the chance.''
   Washington is a city that consumes humor almost as fast as
taxes. Candidates, officeholders, lobbyists and rising bureaucrats
hunger for it. The Kennedys have been known to call a comic off the
floor of a Las Vegas nightclub for a quick fix for the Gridiron and
other local festivals.
   Mark Shields, columnist and occasional supplier, notes changes
in the humor market:
   ``We're not nearly as ethnic. There are no Pedro, Pat or Manny
stories being told. The one group you can make fun of is the WASPS.
You can do `Quiche is their idea of soul food' or `They tailgated
during the war of 1812.' There is no Episcopalian Anti-Defamation
League.''
   There is a legend among speech writers which they doubt is true
but they tell it with a relish that suggests their own Walter Mitty
dreams.
   It concerns an intense president who could be sweetly benign or
thunderously abusive. After two years of that, one writer snapped.
And so:
   The president was rushing out to the Rose Garden for a routine
appearance. He scooped up the speech cards handed him by the writer
and without reading them first the Leader of the Western World
sallied forth:
   ``There are those who say we can't fulfill the Great Society
program and fight the war in Vietnam at the same time. They're
wrong and I'm going to tell you why. There are those who say we
can't feed the hungry at home and also lift living standards around
the world. They are wrong and I'm going to tell you why.''
   Two more such refrains and Lyndon Baines Johnson was now ready
to tell them why. Then, he turned to the last card and found only
this: ``Now you're on your own.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Scientists who are just beginning to understand
the AIDS virus are becoming optimistic that they can find a way to
thwart it. Here is a report on some of the things they have learned
and the things they have yet to learn.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Virologists have learned a lot about their enemy,
the AIDS bug. It is devious and elusive, stunningly elaborate, yet
self-controlled, even finicky.
   It insinuates itself into the body's blueprints, its genes. It
stays there forever. No one can imagine a way to get rid of it.
   In its sly way, the virus does nothing outwardly bad at first.
For five years, 10 years or longer, it may burrow deep, hiding,
making a grudgingly slow stream of new copies of itself. The body's
half-hearted attempt to kill it gets nowhere. And the virus's
unsuspecting host feels fine.
   But something evil is happening. The immune system is eroding.
Then, as though responding to some signal, the virus springs
furiously to life. It replicates at an astonishing rate. And it
wipes out one brand of blood cell that is essential for health and
life.
   Everyone agrees: HIV is an impressive foe.
   Genes with names like tat and art rev it up and dampen it down.
With each new discovery of its florid system of checks and
balances, with each new example of the virus's guile, the AIDS
story seems only to get worse.
   This is a virus like no other. It is designed through evolution
to elude the body's own defenses, the blood-borne radar and
missiles of its immune system. Worse, it is designed to attack that
system and destroy it. In time, it does.
   ``It is what it is, and we are beginning to understand it,''
says Dr. William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston.
   ``What we should understand is how bad it is. The news is very
bad, and it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.''
   Yet Haseltine and others who dissect the germ's inner machinery
say that what they see there also gives them reason to be
optimistic. There is plenty to go wrong.
   The immediate goal of their work is to figure out how the virus
works. How it latches onto its target. How it gets inside. How it
takes over and makes new copies of itself. How it kills.
   Each step requires a tightly choreographed ballet between the
virus's own genes and the chemicals it makes _ an ornate, even
beautiful, interplay of molecular thermostats and feedback loops
that nudge the virus to life, fire it up and quiet it down. Surely,
the experts reason, anything so complicated must be ripe for
sabotage.
   ``If one knows the critical steps in virus replication, then
strategies to interfere with those steps would be useful,'' says
Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal of the National Cancer Institute. ``In AIDS,
you constantly need recruitment of new infected cells for the
immune system to be totally suppressed. So any way of blocking new
infection is important, and therefore interfering with the life
cycle is important.''
   By Haseltine's count, the virus makes at least 13 proteins that
are potential targets for drugs.
   ``The idea,'' he says, ``is that when we learn enough about
their three-dimensional structure, we will be able to design drugs
by synthetic chemistry to fit into their little niches and crannies
and stop them from working.''
   Labs headed by Haseltine and Wong-Staal, a colleague of HIV
co-discoverer Robert Gallo, made many of the key early discoveries
of how HIV works, and they have been joined by several other groups
in picking apart the virus. New details pile up quickly.
   From this investigation, a profile of the enemy emerges.
   AIDS stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but in its
short history, that name has already become outdated. AIDS is not
just a collection of symptoms but a disease with a clear cause, a
microbe called HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus.
   The virus lives in the body's fluids _ blood, semen and vaginal
secretions, among others. Naked virus floats about freely in these
liquids, but it's also carried about inside white blood cells.
Among the most plentiful of these infected cells are monocytes and
macrophages, scavengers that eat bacteria and other bits of useless
and dangerous matter.
   AIDS spreads when the free virus or infected cells pass from one
person to another. Blood-contaminated hypodermic needles can carry
them directly into the bloodstream. More often, however, the virus
is passed during sexual intercourse, perhaps when virus-laden blood
cells cross the mucous membranes of the genitals.

   Ordinarily, such tainted cells display an alien protein on their
surface. It serves as a sort of badge declaring, ``I'm infected.''
But in one of its many tricks, the AIDS virus circumvents this
convention. Some of these infected macrophages are filled with
thousands of viruses, but they are Trojan horses that give no
warning of their cargo. The body, unconcerned, mounts no defense _
even if such a defense would do any good, which, apparently, it
does not.
   Once inside, the infected cells bump into healthy ones and pass
along their contents. Within days, the virus is established in
tissues throughout the body. Several kinds of cells eventually get
infected, including brain cells, B cells that make antibodies and
Langerhans cells, a form of macrophage that penetrates most of the
body's tissues and lives for decades.
   All of them have one thing in common: Their outer skin contains
a molecule called T4. Among them, one variety of blood cell is
special. It is covered with so much T4 that it's called a T4 helper
cell. A single cell may be coated with 60,000 T4 molecules.
   Of all the cells that the virus enters and subverts, the T4
helper cell is the only one it kills directly. Unfortunately, the
helper cell is a critically important soldier in the body's
microbial warfare. It's a kind of master cell that oversees other
branches of the immune system, coordinating their response to
germs. Without them, this intricate system becomes chaotic,
aimless. Parasites that ordinarily don't stand a chance run
rampant. Overwhelming infection and death are the unstoppable
consequences.
   But this final stage of the infection, the phase called AIDS,
may come a decade or more after those first infected macrophages
cross into their new host's bloodstream, full of virus looking for
T4.
   At first, the virus replicates quickly. Large amounts of it are
found in the central nervous system, then in the blood and finally
in other secretions. For a few weeks, the victim may feel sick with
aches and ills that mimic mononucleosis.
   But then the symptoms clear up. Production of virus drops to a
trace. Now the person is an AIDS carrier, able to pass the
infection on the others but looking and feeling perfectly normal.
   For several years, it may seem as though nothing is wrong. But
that is an illusion.
   ``Something is happening during that asymptomatic period that
eventually results in enough damage that the whole system
collapses,'' says Haseltine. ``I think of it as a dam eroding. The
damage is being done, but the dam looks fine.''
   At last the virus comes to life. Levels rise in the bloodstream.
T4 helper cells start to die. And the symptoms of AIDS set in.
Within about two years after those symptoms appear, the number of
T4 cells in the blood inexorably drops to near zero.
   How does HIV get away with it? In the usual course of viral
surveillance, the branch of the immune system called the B cells
recognizes the invader for what it is and makes antibodies. These
are chemicals that tightly latch onto specific spots on the virus's
surface and mark it for destruction.
   People make antibodies against the AIDS virus, too. But they
don't stop the bug. Scientists aren't sure why, although they have
some theories. Perhaps the spots the antibodies need to attach
themselves to are hidden deep in recesses in the virus's coat.
Perhaps they're disguised with a covering of sugar. Maybe the
antibodies bind to the wrong spot on the virus, failing to harm it.
Or maybe the virus simply stays one step ahead, mutating its shell
faster than the body can fashion new antibodies to fit it.
   The virus's coat is made of a sugar and protein combination, or
glycoprotein, called the envelop protein. It has two parts. The
inner one, called gp41, is imbedded in the surface of the virus.
Loosely attached to gp41 is the outer envelop protein, called gp120.
   Gp120 has an intense attraction for the T4 molecule on human
cells. When it finds this target, it binds tightly, holding the
tiny virus to the rough surface of the much larger cell. Then the
gp41 takes over and fuses the membranes of the virus and the cell,
allowing the inner part of the virus to enter the cell.
   Its goal now is to splice its own genes into those of the cell
so it can turn the cell into a virus factory, manufacturing
thousands upon thousands of new copies of itself.
   For HIV, however, that's even more difficult than it sounds, for
this bug is a retrovirus. Like all creatures in nature, the
assembly plans for a new AIDS virus are contained in the coded
material called genes.

<HEAD>BOSTON: called genes.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The genes of people, spiders, mushrooms and most everything else
are made of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Each gene contains the
code for assembling a protein that's used to build or regulate the
organism. When its protein is needed, the gene spins off a mirror
image of itself in a substance called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. The
RNA is shuttled to the cell's protein assembly factory, where it
serves as a temporary blueprint.
   Retrovirus genes are backwards. They are made of RNA. To get
going, the virus has to translate them into DNA. This is the job of
enzymes made by a gene called pol.
   Like other retroviruses, HIV has three basic genes. Besides pol,
they are env, which makes gp120 and gp41 to form the outer shell,
and gag, which creates the protein needed for the virus's inner
core.
   However, unlike simple retroviruses, HIV has at least four
regulatory genes and probably more. They are called tat, art, sor
and 3'orf. Even though scientists have worked out the entire
genetic code of the AIDS virus's RNA, they are not sure how many
genes are involved in all. Some of them overlap, sharing stretches
of RNA, while other genes are spliced together from here and there
along the strand of RNA.
   The pol gene produces polymerase and ribonuclease H, known
jointly as reverse transcriptase, as well as protease and
integrase. Together, these enzymes transcribe RNA into DNA, clean
it up, and insert it neatly into the cell's own genes, where it
becomes a permanent part of the body's genetic library.
   All the pieces are in place for the virus to instruct the cell
to turn its attention toward making and assembling viral proteins.
In T4 helper cells, however, this usually doesn't happen. Even
though one in five of them may be infected, only about one in
10,000 is actually producing viral proteins. In the rest of them,
the virus lies quiet, or latent.
   It can come to life only when the T4 helper cell itself is
stimulated by some immunological emergency to divide and produce
new cells. This is not true of monocytes and macrophages. In these
cells, the virus can make a slow, steady stream of new viruses or
suddenly explode with activity. But whether any of these infected
cells actually churn out new viruses depends on an intricate
interplay between the virus's regulatory genes.
   Among the most intriguing of these is tat. It's a kind of
fast-forward switch. Tat produces a protein that causes the other
genes to work faster. It can speed up virus production 1,000-fold.
The tat protein even makes the tat gene work harder. It becomes a
positive feedback regulator, triggering runaway viral production.
   However, tat has an alter ego called 3'orf (pronounced
three-prime-orf). It slows down virus replication, and it may be
one way that the virus establishes latent infection.
   Another way is through the art gene, also known as trs. Art is a
kind of switch. When art is turned on, the virus makes the
structural proteins necessary for constructing new copies of
itself. But when art is turned off, it makes only the regulatory
proteins.
   Finally, there is sor. Its protein somehow makes the virus more
infectious, so it spreads more rapidly through the body.
   Using these genes, HIV transforms useful cells into virus
factories. Most of the infected cells survive, even though they are
making virus. However, the T4 helper cells eventually die, and they
are killed in two ways.
   When cells are infected with HIV, they often display copies of
the virus's envelop protein on their own surface. The envelop
protein is highly attracted to the T4 molecule. This turns the
infected cell in a sort of giant virus, roaming the bloodstream in
search of cells with T4 on them. When it finds one, it sticks to
it. This results in clumps of 100 to 500 cells known as syncytia,
and all of them eventually die.
   The T4 helper cells may also die through a process called
autofusion. The surfaces of these cells contain so much envelop
protein and T4 that its skin folds over onto itself and sticks
together. Each place that envelop protein and T4 touch, a hole is
punched. The cell grows leaky and explodes.
   How did HIV get to be such an efficient killer? Probably by
accident.
   Most viruses, whether they cause flu, cold sores or warts, don't
kill their hosts. A dead host, after all, is a very poor host.
Instead, they cause passing illnesses or lifelong infections that
may be aggravating but aren't lethal.
   ``The AIDS epidemic is just a slight miscalculation on the
virus's part,'' Haseltine says. ``It could be a single mutation in
almost any one of the regulatory pathways. It allows it to make too
much virus too quickly in T4 cells, and that allows it to be more
easily transmitted and more lethal. It could be one single mutation
that separates us from no epidemic and this terrible epidemic.''

was jammed with high-spending customers gulping bottles of beer to
wash down earthworms cooked with golden mushrooms and other
specialties.
   Open worship of Caishen in Communist China would have been
unthinkable not too long ago, but today seems perfectly appropriate
on this lightly developed but resource-rich island, which is to be
the biggest proving ground yet for the country's capitalist-style
economic reforms.
   Chinese leaders last year promised to offer a slew of incentives
to speed development and attract much-coveted foreign investment to
this island off China's southernmost coast, between the Philippines
and Vietnam.
   Since mid-1987, the Chinese media has breathlessly reported
almost daily on the big plans for the island. ```Hawaii of Orient'
a Vast Building Site'' said one recent headline in the China Daily.
   New highways, deep-water ports, airports, railways and power
stations are promised. Official reports in early 1988 indicate that
a nuclear power plant could be in the cards.
   ``All projects that are helpful to the island's economic
development will be encouraged,'' said Peng Qinghai, vice-director
of the Hainan Economic Commission.
   The Chinese leadership views the iron, rubber, copper, oil and
other natural resources found throughout the 13,568-square-mile
island _ nearly twice the land mass of the Hawaiian Islands _ as a
magnet for foreign investors.
   They also hope the sparkling white beaches that seductively
curve for miles on end along the island's southern coast will
attract foreign tourists to a Waikiki of the South China Sea.
   The island _ which local officials often refer to as `baodao,'
or Treasure Island _ is to become China's 31st province this spring
as a sign of Beijing's serious intentions to bring Hainan into the
modern world.
   Beijing's bold plans, if carried through, could mean profound
changes for the population of about 6 million people, many of whom
remain firmly planted in the past.
   Hainan's people work the water and land in timeless fashion;
wooden fishing junks crowd the main harbors while peasants work
small rice paddies with simple plows pulled by water buffalo.
Others cultivate fields of sugar cane, coffee, pepper, pineapple
and tea that dot the lush countryside.
   In the capital city of Haikou, population about 300,000, the
central district's streets are lined with worn two-story buildings
that date from the early decades of the century. In the
countryside, some peasants live in huts of baked mud and straw and
go without electricity.
   Nearly four decades of Communist rule has failed to quash
ancestor worship and the belief in spirits.
   For example, clansmen accompanied by musicians with horns,
drums, gongs and cymbals can be seen walking in procession down the
island's main road in a ceremony to implore their long-deceased
ancestors to return home.
   In the mountainous region of the island's interior, the Li
ethnic minority still send off their dead amid elaborate rituals
that include burials peppered by the noise of firecrackers and
vintage flintlock rifles and by drinking parties at which rice wine
flows for several days and nights.
   The people understand their backwater island is to become a
``special economic zone'' _ China's name for regions where economic
practices can stray from the Marxist straight and narrow to spur
development _ and hope it will mean more money.
   ``We're very happy'' about the plan, says a man surnamed Zhen
who earns $16 a month at a Haikou firecracker store. ``Our standard
of living will go up, our wages will go up.''
   An employee of the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm in
southeastern Hainan, taking a brief pause from burning brush to
speak with visitors, said she believed that in the future ``our
wages will rise and so will prices.''

   But scholar Huang Youjing, a 23-year-old researcher of Hainan's
minorities, said he was unimpressed with government efforts to
build up the area.
   Speaking in Tongza, the minority region's central city where
markets are well-stocked and apartment buildings are popping up all
over, Huang said the government had neglected the countryside.
   ``I know what I'm going to say will bring me trouble,'' Huang,
an ethnic Li, said intently within earshot of a foreign affairs
official. ``The central government has spent a lot of money to put
up buildings and give outsiders the impression of a flourishing and
rich (minority) area.
   ``But in reality, the people's standard of living is very low.
The central government is not providing money to improve the
standard of living'' in areas far from the view of visitors, he
said.
   Whether Beijing's grandiose plans for Hainan development will be
realized remains to be seen. The record of the four existing
special economic zones along China's southern coast _ all much
smaller than Hainan geographically _ is mixed.
   In Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, nine years of special
status has transformed a sleepy rural area into a boom town of half
a million people. But development has been haphazard and the
economic incentives offered foreign developers has attracted
primarily basic assembly plants instead of high-technology industry.
   And Chinese authorities are painfully aware that a previous
effort to build up Hainan's economy led to a widespread
racketeering scandal three years ago.
   From 1980, Hainan was allowed to import duty-free vehicles and
16 other luxury goods for its own use to help speed development.
But with the complicity of local authorities, enterprises from
kindergartens, banks and newspapers turned themselves into
importers and resold the goods to the Chinese mainland.
   The trade in 3.3 million cars, color television sets, video
recorders and motorcycles lined the pockets of individuals and
enterprises with millions of illegally earned dollars.
   This time, authorities warn, such behavior will not be
tolerated. ``Our policy is that getting rich through labor is
glorious. However, you should get rich according to our policies,''
Hainan party official Yao Wenxu explained at a news conference in
Beijing last year.
   Officials say those policies will include offering 50-year
leases on land, relaxing foreign currency controls, waiving duties
on imported production material and granting the new province
decision-making autonomy. China has said that details of the vague
promises will be announced this year.
   Reported plans to build a modern infrastructure have been vague,
too, although some financing details have started to surface.
   For example, about $100 million in World Bank loans are to go to
construct the Daguang Hydropower Station, which is expected to
generate 240,000 kilowatts of electricity and irrigate about
164,500 acres of farmland by 1990, a press report said.
   The need for a stable electricity supply was made clear to
visitors recently when power outages occurred three evenings in a
recent week at one of Haikou's pricier hotels.
   Foreigners, whose investments and know-how are urgently needed
to develop the island, remain largely skeptical.
   Slowly, however, development is stirring. New hotels geared to
overseas visitors are going up, many in recent weeks. By the end of
1987, according to People's Daily, foreign businessmen signed more
than 200 contracts committing more than $80 million joint ventures,
co-operative enterprises and factories.
   Many Chinese from the mainland believe Hainan is the place to be
and are applying to move to the island by the tens of thousands,
officials say.
   ``This is an open place that has a future,'' said one young
doctor who traveled 800 miles from Wuhan in central Hebei province
to seek a job at a local hospital. But his chance of success was
slim, he said while relaxing at a seaside tourist area, because
``too many people are applying.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A sharp drop in box-office sales is putting a
lot of French movie theaters out of business in a country where
cinema is a national passion. Film directors say they're keeping
busy, but, in the words of one, ``Any director who shuns television
is a dead man.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Film directors here, who regard reports of the
death of French cinema as highly exaggerated, have not slowed their
pace: They make a movie every three days, as many as the Americans.
   ``Crisis, crisis,'' mocks Claude Lelouch, who is spending $10
million on a Jean-Paul Belmondo film he wants to premiere in
Madison Square Garden. ``All this whining is ridiculous.''
   Jean-Jacques Annaud, another Frenchman with an Oscar, laughs,
``You think there is a crisis? Try to find a cameraman. Or an
actor. They're all busy, and their prices go up every day.''
   Talk of crisis followed a year of mediocre films and a 20
percent drop in box-office sales in France. A revolution in French
television means six channels show 1,200 films a year. Video
rentals are up.
   Directors say that is a challenge to make spectacular or
imaginative films to lure couch potatoes back into theaters. In any
case, they add, television is just another branch of the business.
   ``This is a problem of theater owners, not filmmakers,'' Annaud
says. ``I may be sad that people see my work on a little box
instead of a screen, but I don't feel I'll lose my job if cinemas
close.''
   Few directors seem endangered in a country where the film
industry is a national obsession. French filmmakers, in a nation of
55 million, earn 10 percent of world box-office receipts.
   The range is wide.
   Francois Truffautdied in 1986, but every other major director of
the 1950's New Wave is still making movies. Claude Chabrol does two
a year. Eric Rohmer, at 67, works hard on tiny budgets.
   Jean-Luc Godard, an aging rebel loved mainly by critics, just
brought out ``Soigne Ta Droite'' (Watch Your Right), a metaphysical
meander in the mind of a director trying to make a film to order.
   At the other extreme, hot young comers like Luc Besson
(``Subway'') and Leos Carax (``Mauvais Sang,'' or Bad Blood) are
trying to solidify success from their early films.
   Louis Malle, after slowing down in the United States, came home
to make a smash hit: ``Au Revoir, les Enfants'' (Goodbye,
Children), about kids deported by the Nazis.
   Bernard Tavernier, finished with ``Round Midnight,'' returned to
do ``La Passion Beatrice,'' a hard saga of incest and violence set
in a corner of 14th century France.
   At the Cannes Film Festival, Maurice Pialat's ``Sous le Soleil
de Satan'' (Under Satan's Sun) was the first French entry to win
the best-film award since Lelouch's ``A Man and a Woman'' 20 years
ago.
   Claude Berri's back-to-back films about the disappearing French
peasantry, ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon des Sources,'' were
successes even in U.S. shopping mall cinemas. So were ``Diva'' and
``Betty Blue'' by Jean-Jacques Beneix.
   ``There is no reason not to be optimistic,'' says Serge Tubiana,
editor of the prestigious Cahiers du Cinema. ``Some fine films are
being made.''
   Plenty of money is available, Tubiana says, but a new breed of
businessmen-producers do not know how to spend it. He says it will
take time for television executives to learn to wield their power.
   For example, no one would touch Coline Serreau's ``Trois Hommes
et un Couffin.'' It was a smash when someone finally did. As
``Three Men and a Baby,'' the U.S. remake grossed $70 million in
1987.
   The state works hard to assure a steady crop of filmmakers. Its
influential academy, the Institute for Higher Cinema Studies, turns
away three times more students than it accepts.
   ``The tendency among younger people is toward the classical, the
old styles,'' says Solveig Anspach, an IDHEC student. ``I don't see
any worry about the future.''
   She said her class is 40 percent women, a level that few would
have believed possible a decade ago.
   ``It is not easy for a young director to find backing, but if
you have a good idea, and you are determined, you can do it,'' said
Camille de Casabianca, whose ``Pekin Central,'' won praise.
   Any director with a screenplay can apply for an advance from the
state-supported National Cinema Center, which takes a cut of
box-office receipts. Private money is often available.
   But successful filmmakers like Annaud prefer to cross borders,
breaking out of the limited French market.
   His ``Name of the Rose,'' was based on an Italian novel, with
English actors and German money. The script was written in English
and French. He shot the film in English and dubbed it for France.
   ``I would much rather spend $25 million for the international
market than $3 million for only France,'' he says. ``The risk is
less because of the percentages.''
   Crossing cultures can be risky. Annaud won an Academy Award for
foreign films with ``Black and White in Color.'' But the film
ridiculed colonialism, and it flopped among the sensitive French.
   Annaud is unperturbed by a dearth of French stars. Directors
fight over the bearlike Gerard Depardieu. But Annaud's next film
stars a real bear. Called ''l'Ours'' (The Bear), it looks at
hunting from the viewpoint of a Kodiak cub.
   Lelouch corraled Belmondo, fresh from a hit theater run in
``Kean.'' He plays a 50-year-old adventurer, the world's ninth
richest man, who grew up in a circus and trots the globe taming
lions and women.
   It is called, ``l'Itineraire d'un Enfant Gate,'' meaning, the
Journeys of a Spoiled Brat.
   The director, who not coincidentally just turned 50, wants to
present the film on a 7,500-square-foot screen at the Bercy sports
complex in Paris. Then, for America, at Madison Square Garden.
   ``We have to find new limits, new ideas that become possible as
the technology develops,'' Lelouch says. ``I hope in my lifetime I
can film the picture that keeps turning in my head.''
   He pursued his theme:
   ``There is always something better, bigger, more interesting to
do. I can imagine films being shown all over the world at the same
time, on a sort of pay-TV system, which would earn enough to allow
us to do anything.
   ``You have to adapt and improve with the means. Any director
today who shuns television is a dead man.''
   Annaud, a different sort of filmmaker, agreed with Lelouch.
   ``Where is the conflict?'' he reflected. ``It is like concerts
and records. Why do some people go to a concert hall instead of
buying a compact disc? In the end, it is the same.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The traditional 27-piece brass band so common in
Europe almost faded from the American scene after World War II. But
since a Pittsburgh conductor formed the River City Brass Band eight
years ago, the brass sound has been on the rebound.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call it the Boston Pops in brass or the common
man's symphony. But, please, says conductor Robert Bernat, don't
call it ``oompah.''
   The bright, upbeat music of the 27-piece, British-style River
City Brass Band is leading a modest grass-roots revival of a
tradition that peaked at the turn of the century.
   ``It's just a great big, juicy, fat sound,'' Bernat says.
   The conductor says people are surprised the band plays popular
and contemporary songs, classics and folk tunes, not just marches
and what he calls ``oompah.''
   ``When they think of brass bands, oompah is what people usually
think of,'' he says. ``That's German beer garden music,
lee-dee-dee-duh-oom-pah-pah. And we do that sometimes.''
   River City features two percussionists and 25 brass horns,
including 10 cornets, four tubas, three trombones, three horns, two
euphoniums a recent sold-out performance at a suburban Pittsburgh middle
school, the band played music written by John Philip Sousa, Scott
Joplin and George Gershwin. The audience chose Sousa's ``The
Thunderer'' for the encore, clapping loudly with the march, tapping
their feet and rocking in their seats.
   ``There's a certain type of march that when you play the
audience goes mad,'' Bernat says. ``The audience's reaction is
predictable.''
   Most shows also feature a sing-along.
   ``They come to our concert and they just let it go,'' says
Bernard Black, solo cornet player. ``They can sit there and stamp
their feet and clap their hands and whistle. I've never heard that
many people, 1,500 people, in church singing together something
like `Let Me Call You Sweetheart.' ''
   ``Bob turns around and conducts them like the Boston Pops,'' he
says.
   ``It just sort of puts you on a high,'' says concert fan Frances
McBriar. ``The music is so exciting. It's so American. You connect
bands with parades. I love a parade and that's what brass bands
remind me of.''
   River City's subscribers have grown from about 85 in 1981 to
more than 2,600 this season and the band is debt-free for the first
time, says General Manager Joan Kimmel.
   But popular appeal has come sooner than critical acclaim. The
Pennsylvania Council of The Arts, for example, has limited its
funding of River City because it does not consider brass band music
a form of art.
   ``Band music is an entertainment form,'' says Christine Voigt,
music director for the council. ``It's in the context that band
music is meant for parks and orchestral music is fine art and meant
for a different audience.''
   Droste says the main difference is that a brass band appeals to
everyone and plays a greater variety of music.
   ``It's a very eclectic mix and though it's a grass-roots
movement, the standards are very high,'' he says. ``We appeal to
the common man, the man in the street.
   ``It would be very difficult to find a better band than the
River City Brass Band. They would compare very favorably with the
top brass bands in England, where they have the best brass bands in
the world.''
   Carl Jackson, a free-lance musician who has played trombone with
the band for about five years, says he underestimated the brass
band.
   ``When I got the announcement of the brass band tryouts, I said,
`Come on, you can't be serious,''' he says. ``I've learned it's a
very serious thing.''
   Bernat says a ``significant stamp of approval'' came when the
band recently was chosen to perform in 11 Australian cities in
March during the 1988 Australian bicentennial celebration, along
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir,
the Texas Boys Choir and Twyla Tharp Dance Company.
   At home, River City performs a 28-concert subscription series in
Pittsburgh's lavish Carnegie Hall and in an old movie theater and
two suburban schools. It has toured about 15 states.
   ``We get out to the audience rather than trying to get the
audience to come out to us,'' Kimmel says. ``It has that whole
`Music Man' feeling, that they can have this right here in river
city.''
   Kimmel said all kinds of people attend concerts. But at the
city's Carnegie Hall, ``it's fur coats and CEOs and the kind of
people you see at the symphony.''

   As Maude Breen in the CBS miniseries
``Bluegrass,'' former ``Charlie's Angel'' Cheryl Ladd is a woman
out for revenge, success, her own horse farm and a winner at the
Kentucky Derby.
   This being television and the windup of the February ratings
sweeps, the two-part series, to be shown Sunday and Monday, also is
rife with intrigue, back-stabbing, and social climbing. There are
lots of blue skies and green pastures, beautiful horses and a
rousing finale at Churchill Downs.
   ``I play a woman who was raised in the area but is forced to
leave after her father is accused of burning a barn,'' Ladd says.
``He was the farm manager and he took the blame for the son. The
son also tries to rape me at the beginning of the picture. He's
played by Wayne Rogers.''
   Laughing, she adds, ``He's so charming. You just know he's a
snake.''
   ``Bluegrass,'' from a novel by Borden Deal, also stars Brian
Kerwin, Anthony Andrews, Shawnee Smith, Diane Ladd, Kiernan
Mulroney and Mickey Rooney.
   Filmed entirely on location around Lexington, Ky., it was
directed by Simon Wincer, who also directed the Australian movie
about horse racing, ``Phar Lap.''
   ``Maude is a kind of steel magnolia,'' Ladd says. ``I liked her
because of that. She's pretty determined to do it her own way. I
liked that, too. I liked that she's not afraid to get her hands
dirty. She can dress up, then turn around and put on jeans and muck
up a horse stall.
   ``She's an underdog. I think a lot of people will be rooting for
her. I grew up in a small town in South Dakota. My aunt had a farm
and my grandfather lived in an even smaller town. I can identify
with these kind of people. And my husband and I have a quarter
horse ranch in Colorado, so I know something about horses, too.''
   ``Bluegrass'' opens with some brief scenes that show Maude as a
teen-ager and the unhappy memories she left behind.
   ``They asked me if I wanted to play her as a 15-year-old,'' she
says. ``That would be quite a stretch. It was flattering, but I
thought better of it. What I really said was, `Get real!'''
   Then it jumps ahead 15 years, as Maude, now a widow, returns to
buy a run-down farm with a vow of turning it into a breeding stable
for winning thoroughbreds.
   Ladd is married to producer Brian Russell, whose Indian Neck
Productions has turned out such films as ``Hoosiers,'' ``From the
Hip,'' ``Flight of the Navigator'' and ``The Witching Hour.''
   ``We'll go up to our ranch and load up some pack horses and ride
into the mountains for four or five days,'' she says. ``We'll pitch
tents and live outdoors. I ride a buckskin cutting horse named Half
a Buck.
   ``It's funny, but I didn't have much luck with horses when I was
a kid. I had a bad experience of being thrown and kicked. I thought
there was something about me that horses didn't like.
   ``On `Charlie's Angels' I had to jump out of a Jeep onto a horse
and ride out of the camera frame. Thank goodness for the wrangler.
The horse looked at me, laid his ears down and and went for the
lowest branch. The wrangler went after me and pulled me off the
horse. It was like a scene from a movie. He said, `This horse is
trying to kill you.'''
   Whatever it was, Ladd got over it, learned to ride and has even
been in a few races.
   This is the third miniseries for Ladd, who previously starred in
``A Death in California'' and ``Crossings.'' Last year she was in
the TV movie ``Deadly Care'' as a nurse battling her addiction to
drugs.
   Her next project may be an adaptation of a book she recently
bought called ``Fulfillment,'' about a Minnesota farm family at the
turn of the century.
   ``There's talk of making `Bluegrass' into a series,'' she says,
``but I'm not very interested in doing another series at this point
in my career.''
   Nor is she interested in doing a ``Charlie's Angels'' reunion.
``All of us gagged at the prospect,'' she says. ``We didn't feel we
could go home again. We've all moved on.''
   Ladd replaced Farrah Fawcett in the second year of the show.
Other long-running angels were Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson.
   Producer Aaron Spelling is developing a new generation of
``Charlie's Angels'' for Fox Broadcasting Co.

   The queen of off-Broadway has enlarged her
kingdom this season.
   At an age when most people would have been retired for nearly 20
years, Lucille Lortel has gone uptown with two major Broadway
productions _ ``Sarafina!'', an exuberant South African musical,
and ``A Walk in the Woods,'' a drama about American and Soviet arms
control negotiators.
   Not exactly commercial fluff, but then making money never was
the reason Miss Lortel got into producing more than 40 years ago in
the backyard of her Connecticut home.
   ``If a work is theatrical and if it's something that moves me,
then I will do it,'' she says. ``It is the theatricality of a play
that appeals to me, not necessarily the subject matter.''
   Miss Lortel, stylishly dressed in a black-and-white striped
blouse and a black skirt, sits in the living room of her Fifth
Avenue apartment. Her theater past is there, along with the
present. An oil portrait of Miss Lortel hangs above an elegant
couch.
   The apartment is award heaven. A Tony stands on a table. There
are proclamations, declarations, decrees and a parade of
photographs in almost every room.
   There is a photograph of Miss Lortel with Sam Waterston and
Robert Prosky, the two stars of ``A Walk in the Woods.'' The play
by Broadway newcomer Lee Blessing focuses on the informal,
one-on-one meetings of an American delegate and his Soviet
counterpart to the nuclear disarmament talks in Geneva. The two men
break diplomatic red tape by taking walks in the woods to discuss
their countries' problems.
   ``Darling, I fell in love with `A Walk in the Woods,' when I saw
it at Yale last year,'' she recalls. ``I felt that I had to do it.
And it's important enough and good enough to do on Broadway.''
   Miss Lortel backs up her opinions with her money, some $850,000
plus to put ``A Walk in the Woods,'' a one set, two-character
drama, on Broadway.
   ``I tell you, it's a feeling I have, like when you seen a fine
painting or something,'' she says. ``You can't explain it or why
you feel emotional about it. This is the way I feel about plays.''
   The money was left her by her husband, Louis Schweitzer, who
made his fortune in the cigarette paper business. It was Schweitzer
who got her out of and then back into the theater.
   When they met during the Depression, Miss Lortel was an aspiring
actress. By then she had appeared on Broadway, portraying a slave
girl in ``Caesar and Cleopatra,'' starring Helen Hayes.
   ``I next played a virgin in `The Virgin Man' and then a
nymphomaniac in `The Shanghai Gesture,''' she laughs. ``I had very
long flowing hair in those days.
   ``In fact, a couple of those pictures on the piano might show
what I looked like then,'' she says, gesturing to a provocative,
almost modern photograph of a young, seductive-looking woman. ``I'm
a little shocked at myself when I see them.''
   Schweitzer and Miss Lortel were married in March 1931 on the
luxury liner Leviathan as the couple was returning from Europe. The
new wife continued to dabble in show business, but eventually gave
up her career.
   ``You have to remember, it was 1931, honey, and his family was
very strict,'' she recalls. ``He wasn't, but his family was. In
fact, my husband called me `Volly,' meaning voluptuous.''
   Sixteen years later, Miss Lortel found herself back in show
business, pretty much by accident. Friends were looking for a place
to hold a reading of a new play, and she offered the old white barn
on her 18-acre Westport, Conn., estate. A new summer theater was
born.
   ``In the beginning, it wasn't so much that I picked the plays,''
she recalls. ``They picked me. Usually a director or a playwright
came to me with something.''
   At the White Barn Theater, she gave work to actors like Zero
Mostel, Eva Marie Saint and Kim Hunter and life to experimental
plays or new works by unknown authors. Over the years, as the White
Barn's chief decision maker and financial backer, she has produced
scores of works, including Athol Fugard's ``Blood Knot,'' Sean
O'Casey's ``Red Roses for Me,'' Edward Albee's ``Fam and Yam'' and
Paul Zindel's ``The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon
Marigolds.''
   As a 24th anniversary present, Schweitzer bought his wife the
Theater de Lys, a small, off-Broadway playhouse, in 1955. The first
play she produced there _ a revival of the Weill-Brecht musical
``The Threepenny Opera'' _ ran for seven years.
   The show's long run stymied Miss Lortel's producing instincts,
so she took to presenting weekly matinee performances of new and
old works at the de Lys while ``Threepenny'' was running at night.
Richard Burton read Shakespeare. Siobhan McKenna played Hamlet.
Lotte Lenya recalled the life of Bertolt Brecht. The Matinee Series
lasted nearly 20 years before Miss Lortel decided it had run its
course. All her work led her to be dubbed ``the Queen of
off-Broadway'' by Washington Post theater critic Richard L. Coe.
The name stuck.
   Schweitzer died in 1971 but his wife kept busy, looking after
her off-Broadway property, renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in
1981, running the White Barn, and co-producing several Broadway
shows including ``Angels Fall'' and ``As Is.''
   Today, Miss Lortel keeps busy seeing new works and rarely is
home during the evening. Often she's out five nights a week,
looking at Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway and even
showcase productions for new scripts.
   ``My life is the theater,'' she says. ``I didn't have any
children, but the theater is my child. Since my husband died, I
don't know what I would have done without it. It's been my whole
life. It's a wonderful place to go. You lose yourself in it,
especially if it's good.''

<HEAD>New President Plans to Reorganize Haiti's Long-Dominant Army</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The 7,000-member military, long a
dominant force in Haiti, would be put to work building bridges and
promoting public health under a reorganization plan drawn up by the
nation's new leader.
   The plan, a key part of the 86-page platform of President Leslie
Manigat's National Democratic Progressive Rally, also would
separate the police from the armed forces and put them under
civilian control.
   ``There is a perception the army was ... corrupted by the
Duvalier dictatorship,'' the party document says. ``But there is
another truth, also incontestable, that the army was the victim of
the Duvalier dictatorship, which humiliated, dismantled and
decapitated it.''
   ``There must be a ... rehabilitation to wipe out the image that
the army is a repressive force against the civilian population.''
   Manigat as a candidate and now president has acted as a buffer
between the army and its harshest critics. He claims he can control
the institution that has dominated politics in this impoverished
Caribbean country of 6 million people from the time Haiti won
independence from France in 1804.
   Following the end of the 19-year U.S. occupation in 1934, the
army put Dumarsais Estime in as president in 1946, took power
itself in 1950 under Col. Paul Magloire, and helped Francois ``Papa
Doc'' Duvalier win a disputed election that began a brutal 29-year
dictatorship in 1957.
   Duvalier set up the Tonton Macoutes militia, which came to be
generally regarded as street thugs, when the army and coast guard
plotted against him. He emasculated Haiti's armed forces by
shuffling, retiring and sometimes executing commanders. He based
promotions on loyalty to him, and gave away state monopolies to his
military favorites.
   When Duvalier's son and successor, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier, fled into exile in February 1986, a military-dominated
junta led by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, then the army's chief of staff,
took control and ruled by decree for two years leading up to
Manigat's election Jan. 17 and inauguration Feb. 7.
   Opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the army
will return to the barracks as Namphy, now the commander in chief,
had pledged before the election, and whether Manigat has the power
to reorganize or dismantle an entrenched military hierarchy.
   A Western diplomat who closely tracks political and military
developments here said in an interview: ``All those who made
officer between 1959 and 1971 were Duvalier appointees of very low
quality. ... The officers who graduated in 1973 (two years after
``Baby Doc'' reopened the Haitian Military Academy) ... see things
differently. They're more progressive, they're more educated,
they're more professional.
   ``But they're blocked by the system, they're blocked by the
Duvalier appointees above them _ the colonels, the generals _ who
are not leaving,'' said the diplomat, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
   The military also has been linked to drug trafficking and to the
smuggling of cars, rice, sugar and other goods.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration opened an office in
Port-au-Prince in November because cocaine smuggling was rising so
rapidly in Haiti. A DEA informant, Osvaldo Quintana, testified in
federal court in Miami, Fla., in January that the trafficking was
taking place under the protection of Haitian soldiers.
   Armed Forces of Haiti officials rarely respond to such criticism
or charges. The military is a closed, secretive organization.
   All interviews have to be cleared with Brig. Gen. Carl Michel
Nicolas, who is Namphy's successor as chief of staff. Nicolas did
not respond to a written request for an interview with The
Associated Press.
   The present-day army structure was established by U.S. Marines
in 1916 to help put down a guerrilla-style insurrection. It is the
main component of the armed forces, which also include the police,
coast guard, fire department, a presidential guard and several
other battalions and departmental commands.
   The armed forces' main role is to protect the president and
maintain security _ a difficult task given their small numbers and
inadequate equipment and training. The fire department is
notoriously slow, and residents who have been robbed have to send
their own cars to pick up police investigators.
   Military recruits, drawn from the lower middle class, are paid
the equivalent of $160 a month on a pay scale that ranges up to
$1,800 for colonels and $3,400 for Namphy, the top commander.
   Enlistment terms run for six years and the military is
considered a good career in a country where more than half the
population cannot find steady work and the annual per capita income
is about $350.
   Training is limited, and equipment consists mostly of aging
hand-me-downs from the United States _ M-1 rifles and M-14
automatic weapons, a half-dozen helicopters of which only two or
three work, a few armored personnel carriers and some cutters that
patrol the coast.
   For 7,000 men, fewer than a single U.S. Army division, there are
five generals and 24 colonels.
   While Namphy is the commander in chief, the 500-man battalion at
the Dessalines Barracks acts semi-autonomously under Col.
Jean-Claude Paul.
   The Dessalines battalion was involved in almost every incident
last summer when soldiers shot and killed unarmed anti-government
demonstators.
   The green-uniformed, black-booted battalion, which patrols
streets in this sprawling capital of 1 million, was noticeably
absent Nov. 29, however, when gunmen with hand grenades and
automatic weapons killed at least 34 people and forced the
cancellation of what would have been Haiti's first free, open and
independently run presidential election in 30 years.
   ``It is the only unit that is really feared here,'' the Western
diplomat said, noting that some of the Duvaliers' Tonton Macoutes
were incorporated into it. ``The men are very loyal to (Col. Paul).
He ignores the chain of command and commands them directly.''
   Nevertheless, the diplomat said he was optimistic that Manigat
might succeed in his efforts to educate and modernize the armed
forces, and reorient soldiers to accept civilian rule and
participate in national development.
   ``The young officers aspire for change and they see it coming,''
the diplomat said. ``The problem remaining is the Dessalines
Barracks. We're waiting to see what Manigat will do about that.
   ``In the next five years, we'll see a new generation of officers
with diplomas who have traveled abroad, who are of a different
mentality, who are young and cultured. They can give a new image to
the army.''
   A leading Haitian academic who has had a 30-year acquaintance
with Manigat said he is not sure that will happen.
   Speaking only on the condition that he remain anonymous, fearing
recrimination, he said: ``The army wants to leave the civilian
structures of power, not power itself. There's too much money to be
made.
   ``Manigat is no puppet. Far from it. It is an extremely
interesting battle. He makes the army believe he supports it. The
army makes him believe they support him. Each one knows the other
is lying. ...
   ``In the final analysis, Manigat is not capable of dominating
the army or manipulating power. Haiti's immediate future is going
to be as tragic as its present and its past. I fear uprisings among
the people.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Kaufman is a filmmaker who welcomes challenge. He took
Tom Wolfe's sprawling paean to the first U.S. astronauts, ``The
Right Stuff,'' and made a highly original film that deserved better
than it got at the box office.
   Now Kaufman undertakes an even more daunting assignment: filming
Milan Kundera's novel of eroticism and politics in 1960s
Czechoslovakia, ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being.'' He has
created a movie in the grand tradition of storytelling. It is
intimate yet epic, a compelling human triangle played against the
cataclysm of the 1968 Soviet invasion.
   Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a Prague brain surgeon and a
tireless womanizer. He merely commands ``take off your clothes,''
and women joyfully obey. Tereza (Juliette Binoche), a shy but
firm-minded country girl, enters his life, and he agrees to marry
her. But his philandering continues.
   Sabina (Lena Olin), a free-spirited artist who fears commitment
as much as Tomas, is content to remain his mistress. As tensions
mount in the marriage, Soviet tanks roll into Prague to quell the
growing liberalization. Tomas and Tereza flee to Switzerland. But
unhappy with his duplicity, Tereza returns to Prague and he
follows. Punished by the authorities for their defection, they
settle on the farm where the story comes to an abrupt end.
   ``The Unbearable Lightness'' does not lend itself to
condensation. There are too many complexities, too much probing of
human motivations. The story requires careful telling, and Kaufman
requires almost three hours. Only in the rustic setting does the
pace falter.
   The film is illuminated by two extraordinary performances: by
Juliette Brioche, whose Tereza marvelously traces a woman's
emotional and intellectual growth; by Lena Olin, who manages to
balance Sabina's sensuality and her aestheticism. The sequences in
which they photograph each other in the nude is a masterful
celebration of the female form.
   Day-Lewis, the amusing young snob of ``A Room With a View,'' is
perfect within the confines of the hedonistic Tomas, his dark eyes
smoldering with lust. But Kaufman and co-writer Jean-Claude Carrier
never overcome the onesidedness of the character.
   Saul Zaentz, whose other achievements include ``One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Amadeus,'' produced with superior taste.
All departments are commendable, especially Sven Nykvist's camera
work and Leos Janacek's music.
   The Orion release is rated R, with much female nudity and sexual
activity. Running time: 171 minutes.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Unchanged Ann-Margret</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Ann-Margret recently won a Golden Globe
for her television performance in ``The Two Mrs. Glenvilles,'' she
experienced a warming wave of nostalgia.
   ``It was just 27 years ago thatthey (the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association) gave me the first award I ever received _ as the most
promising newcomer of the year,'' she recalled. ``It was in the
same room (International Ballroom, Beverly Hilton), and I remember
everything about it, including the dress I wore.''
   In a town where most promising newcomers come and go like the
Santa Ana winds, Ann-Margret is a phenomenon. After a
quarter-century she continues high on any producer's casting list
for sexually charged roles. At 46 she remains athletically curved,
the emerald eyes smoldering, the voice throaty and inviting.
   She remains unchanged in other ways as well. The deep, full
laugh erupts often, more in nervousness than mirth. She speaks in
quiet, hesitant sentences, recalling the immigrant girl who seemed
bewildered when Hollywood proclaimed her sexuality in such films as
``Kitten With a Whip'' and ``The Pleasure Seekers.''
   Ann-Margret and Roger Smith, her husband-manager for 20 years,
live in the hilltop house overlooking Benedict Canyon; it had been
the honeymoon home of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. The other
day in the sunny living room where Bogie once held court, the
actress reminisced about her Hollywood career and talked about two
forthcoming films: ``A Tiger's Tale,'' with C. Thomas Howell and
Charles Durning; and ``A New Life,'' with Alan Alda and Hal Linden.
   In ``A Tiger's Tale'' she plays a character named is Rose Butts.
Howell plays Bubber Drumm.
   ``It takes place in Texas, as you might guess,'' she said.
``Bubber is one of my daughter's boyfriends, and Rose tries very
hard to get away from him. But he is so dear and so adorable, and
he really wants to see her. They go out a couple of times as
friends.
   ``But he is so insistent, she realizes he really loves her. And
she realizes she loves him. He's very sweet, and quite innocent.''
   In ``A New Life'' she and Alda play a couple who have been
married 26 years. They have a 24-year-old daughter.
   ``In the very first scene we're in the divorce lawyer's office,
and he's saying `Why are you doing this?'
   ``He's a workaholic,'' Ann-Margret said. ``He loves her very
much, but he works five days a week and plays golf with clients on
Saturday and tennis on Sunday. The rest of the film concerns all
the people he dates and all the people I date. There are some very
odd characters out there.''
   She was born Ann-Margret Ollson in Valsjobyn, Sweden, in 1941,
and accompanied her parents to the United States at the age of 5.
Her talent developed early, and at 16, she appeared on Ted Mack's
Amateur Hour on television. After a year at Northwestern
University, she left to tour with other students who formed a music
group called the Suttletones. After a few bookings, the group broke
up and Ann-Margret looked for work in Hollywood.
   ``I auditioned for George Burns at his office at General Service
studio 28 years ago,'' she recalled. ``He still has his office
there.
   ``We found a piano on one of the stages. We took the tarp off,
and my pianist played for me. I did a couple of songs, and Mr.
Burns asked me if I would be in his show.'' She appeared with Burns
at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, and Burns' pal Jack Benny put her
on his television show.
   Frank Capra chose Ann-Margret to play Bette Davis' daughter in
``A Pocketful of Miracles,'' and Fox cast her in the remake, with
Rodgers and Hammerstein music, of ``State Fair.'' But it was ``Bye,
Bye, Birdie'' with Dick Van Dyke that established her as a hot new
star.
   Ann-Margret supplied her special brand of sex appeal to such
leading men as Steve McQueen (``The Cincinnati Kid''), Dean Martin
(``Murderer's Row''), Anthony Quinn (``R.P.M.''), Alain Delon
(``Once a Thief'') and Elvis Presley (``Viva Las Vegas''). Not
until Mike Nichols' ``Carnal Knowledge'' (1971) did Hollywood
achkowledge that she could act. She won an Academy Award nomination
as supporting actress, a feat she repeated with ``Tommy'' in 1975.
   In 1967, she married Roger Smith, the handsome blond star of the
``77 Sunset Strip'' TV series of the '50s. He abandoned his own
acting career to become her personal manager, guiding her not only
for films but in her dynamic night club act.
   Backstage at a Lake Tahoe casino in 1972, she fell 22 feet from
a platform to the stage, suffering a broken arm, five facial
fractures and a brain concussion. Within 10 weeks she was ready to
star again her Las Vegas act.
   The personal appearances ended abruptly in 1983 when Smith was
stricken with myasthenia gravis, a disease of the nerves that
weakens muscles.
   ``For a long time Roger had no strength, couldn't even make a
fist,'' she said. ``Happily, he has been in remission for two years
now. He works out every day in our gym for an hour and a half. He
skis and rides a bike. He's in good shape.''
   Ann-Margret works out daily, too, and she may one day return to
the act. It all depends on Smith: ``It's very simple: he's first.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Major Degas Retrospective Opens in Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in more than 50 years, Paris is
celebrating the unparalleled genius of Edgar Degas, the 19th
century artist whose graceful ballerinas and busy race track scenes
have long been synonymous with impressionism.
   More than 300 paintings, drawings, monotypes, pastels,
watercolors, photographs and sculpture by the man who once said he
wanted to die ``illustrious and unknown'' are on show at the Grand
Palais until May 16.
   Critics say Degas got his wish. In his lifetime, he was famous
for the sweet-faced ballet dancers in crinoline tutus he portrayed
on stage under the lights, in rehearsal, at rest and exercising at
the barre.
   At odd angles and sometimes off center, the ``dancers'' were
experiments in perspective and composition that differentiated
Degas from his impressionist contemporaries. In 1912, five years
before his death, ``Danseuses a la Barre'' (``Dancers at the
Barre'') sold for 430,000 francs _ then one of the highest prices
on record.
   But Degas did not consider himself the painter of ballerinas.
For him, they were just ``a pretext for painting pretty fabric and
capturing movement.''
   Funded by a $1.5 million grant from United Technologies Corp.,
the exhibition will travel to the Museum of Fine Arts in Ottawa,
Canada from June 16 to Aug. 28 and the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York from Sept. 27 to Jan. 8, 1989.
   More comprehensive than previous Degas shows, this one features
little known works rarely seen in public and which reveal an artist
who was misogynist, anti-Semitic and voyeuristic, someone critics
said liked to ``peep through keyholes.''
   One of Degas' favorite subjects was women at their toilette and
he painted them tirelessly throughout a 60-year-career. Bathing in
the tub, stepping into the tub or climbing out, draped over the tub
or sitting on its edge, washing, drying and combing their hair,
Degas' nudes were ongoing experiments in form and color,
perspective and technique.
   Early in his career, he used oils almost exclusively. But at the
age of 36, his vision began to decline and he turned to pastels,
watercolors and later charcoal. By 1912, he was completely blind.
   ``Until now, nudes had always adopted studied poses,'' Degas
said in 1886, after the last impressionist show. ``My women are
simple people, concerned only with what they're doing. Here's one
washing her feet. It's as though you were looking through the
keyhole.''
   There were other simple folk in Degas' paintings: thick-waisted
and perspiring laundresses; jockeys on horseback; cafe singers
belting out the latest tunes; hat makers with swollen, pinpricked
fingers; and naked prostitutes, shown in the picture ``Party for
the Boss.''
   But there were also numerous renditions of Degas' stuffy,
middle-class milieu. The son of a banker, he painted the stiff
portraits of bored looking gentlemen in dark suits and their
buttoned-up wives.
   Degas was a notorious anti-Semite who broke with many of his
closest friends, including Camille Pisarro and the wealthy Halevy
family, during the Dreyfus affair. A firm believer in the guilt of
Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish captain convicted of treason, he once
kicked out of his studio a woman model who casually mentioned the
possibility of Dreyfus' innocence.
   ``Le General Mellinet et le Grand Rabbin Astruc'' (``General
Mellinet and Rabbi Astruc''), a small format portrait, also caused
controversy because of the unflattering way in which Degas
transformed Astruc's fine features.
   ``Degas, blinded by Judeophobia, sacked his divine model,
replaced a miniature mouth by fat sensual lips,'' Gabriel Astruc,
the rabbi's brother, said at the time.
   ``This painting is not a work of art,'' Astruc said. ``It's a
pogrom.''
   One of the most striking early masterpieces on show is
``Portrait de Famille,'' also known as ``La Famille Bellelli''
(``The Bellelli Family'') (1858-67). Though the subject was family
members he supposedly liked, critics have long wondered at the
painting's surpising absence of warmth and affection.
   Another early painting unlike any of his later works is
``Interior or the Rape'' (1868-69), showing a bedroom scene between
a young woman with bare shoulders kneeling on the floor, her back
to a tall, bearded man watching her intently.
   The show catalog refers to the work as one of Degas' ``most
mysterious ... highlighting the difficulty the artist had with
women.''
   As Edouard Manet put it in a letter to Berthe Morisot, ``He
isn't natural. He is incapable of loving a woman. He can't even
tell her. He can't do anything.''

   Rick Springfield considers himself a searcher, a
learner. And three years ago, he discovered that he needed some
time away from the music business.
   After a series of hit albums, a featured role in the hit TV
soap, ``General Hospital,'' and a feature movie, ``Hard to Hold,''
Springfield had had enough.
   ``I had nothing to say,'' he recalled.
   ``There was no one moment. It was a process. I was walking
around my house _ this beautiful ranch in Malibu. I was thinking
about how unhappy I was.''
   On his new LP, ``Rock of Life,'' Springfield sings about the
pressures of fame, why he had to quit, why he is back.
   ``I was caught with my guard down when the world came
knocking,'' he sings on the title track _ the album's first single.
``There's pain and confusion and I'm trying to understand.''
   On ``World Start Turning,'' he sings: ``Just another soul lost
in America, I was so frustrated.''
   One of the problems with fame, he said, was that being the idol
of millions of female fans created tension with his
then-girlfriend, Barbara Jean, who is now his wife. ``We had a lot
of problems. I denied her for a while. People would ask me if I had
a girlfriend and I'd say `no.' She had trouble handling me.''
   Springfield's first hit single was ``Speak to the Sky,'' a Top
15 hit in 1972 and No. 1 in his native Australia. He also released
the albums ``Comic Book Heroes'' and ``Wait for Night.''
   When his music career cooled, he took up acting, making
appearances on ``The Six Million Dollar Man,'' ``The Rockford
Files'' and ``The Incredible Hulk.''
   But it was his role as Dr. Noah Drake in ``General Hospital''
that set Springfield's career soaring.
   In the early 1980s, he released the platinum-selling albums
``Working Class Dog'' and ``Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet.''
``Jessie's Girl,'' a single from ``Working Class Dog'' reached No.
1 on the charts and earned him a Grammy Award in 1981. ``Success
Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet'' yielded another major hit single, ``Don't
Talk to Strangers,'' which earned a Grammy nomination for best male
pop vocalist.
   But after the hit LP ``Living in Oz,'' and 1985's ``TAO,''
Springfield took time off to be with his wife and their newly-born
son, Liam. Becoming a parent was a major turning point in his life.
   ``I accepted the responsibility,'' he said. ``I realized I had
to be strong enough for both of us.''
   Raising a child also made him think about his father, who had
died a few years before Liam was born.
   On ``Tear It All Down,'' the rocker that leads off Side 2 of
``Rock of Life,'' he sings: ``I look at my innocent boy as he
sleeps. ... I wish there was some way I could talk to my father
again.''
   ``I felt I needed to talk to him,'' Springfield said. ``Seeing
myself with Liam, I saw a lot of him in me.''
   Despite the hiatus, Springfield was able to record the new album
in only nine weeks. ``I was very definite about I wanted. I do
extensive demos,'' he said.
   He also credits producer Keith Olsen, who worked on ``Jessie's
Girl'' and another hit single, ``I've Done Everything for You,''
with giving him the sound he wanted.
   ``When I finished the demos, I realized there would be a lot of
vocals,'' Springfield said. ``Keith is real, real good with vocals.
Keith has the ability to create a warm sound.''
   While most of the album is about the downside of fame, the two
final songs are upbeat: ``Hold On to Your Dream'' and ``(If You
Think You're) Groovy.''
   ``Hold On to Your Dream'' is about losing hope, then regaining
it. ``Don't tell me it's over, I still smell the fire,''
Springfield sings.
   ``Groovy'' is the album's only remake. Written in the late '60s
by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane of the English rock group, The
Small Faces, ``Groovy'' is a personal favorite of Springfield's and
a song that almost did not get put on the album.
   ``I had to fight a couple of battles but I had good reasons for
putting it on the record: A _ It had a different slant. B _ It's a
part of my life, an important part of my life,'' he said.
   With the album completed and a worldwide tour anticipated,
Springfield is hopeful about maintaining his popularity.
   ``I think I've taken my audience along with me,'' he said. ``I
don't think I'm going to lose fans because I'm married. I think the
young crowd is in a position to appreciate what's being said.''
   Regardless of how successful his comeback is, Springfield wants
to continue to grow as a person.
   ``I'd like to have the time to grow as a writer and learn what I
need to learn,'' he said. ``Discovering yourself is instrumental.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Harvard Medical Student Is Acclaimed Short
Story Writer</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Please note language in last graf.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethan Canin could be easy to hate: He's a Stanford
University graduate, a student at Harvard Medical School, a budding
literary star and he even has what used to be called matinee idol
good looks.
   At age 27, he has seen his short stories collected in a
critically acclaimed new book, ``The Emperor of the Air'' (Houghton
Mifflin Co., $15.95).
   Canin has enough charm to deflect resentment. He is modest and
self-deprecating, almost worried about his near overnight success.
And at a time when trendy young writers such as Jay McInerney, Tama
Janowitz and Bret Easton Ellis are regularly bashed by literary
critics, Canin is different enough to resist comparison.
   ``We're different kinds of writers,'' said Canin during a recent
interview at the Harvard Bookstore cafe. ``I don't want to be
movie-star famous. I want to move people with my writing ...
because I'm so moved myself by (good) writing. But it's really easy
to get swept up by the American publicity machine.''
   Every story Canin has written since age 19 has been published.
   And his stories bear little resemblance to the world of the
neo-hip New Yorkers chronicled by the new breed of writers. There
are no tales of bohemian artists in SoHo, no cocaine-snorting
yuppies, no alienated college students.
   Instead, Canin writes simple and spare stories in the voices of
the elderly and middle-aged as well as the young. They are about
people on the verge of change, people confronted with decision and
possible crisis. They are people not unlike Canin: facing a new and
scary experience. Canin will tell you that most of the varied
characters in his stories ``are me.''
   His tales also hint at the dark side of life: the inevitability
and quiet anguish of aging; the shadow of infidelity over a long
marriage; the emotional violence that often lurks within families.
But they end just short of despair. His characters have hope,
however jaded.
   The old man in ``We Are Nighttime Travelers'' has been married
to his wife for years. The two have grown so far apart that they
live isolated, secret lives, separated by inches of bedsheet every
night that might as well be miles. Though he feels himself dying a
little bit more each day, surrounded by pills, poor circulation and
a faltering memory, the old man is suddenly seized by a sense of
renewal in the midst of decay. He takes his wife on a romantic walk
in middle of a cold night. Later, he kisses her for the first time
in ages and has ``the feeling of a miracle.''
   Canin is a fourth-year medical student at Harvard and said that
some of his insight into the elderly came from the older people he
has examined.
   ``You meet 40 people a day and you talk to them about their
lives,'' he said. ``A lot of them are older. If someone comes in
under 55 you're so grateful to see young flesh.''
   Medicine keeps him in contact with people. He has balanced a
love and aptitude for science with writing since he started at
Stanford. He began as a physics major and took a creative writing
class for an easy grade. His teacher sent one of the stories he
wrote in class (included as ``Lies'' in his book) to a literary
quarterly in the Bay Area and it was accepted.
   ``It's still the biggest thrill I've ever received,'' he said.
   He switched to an English major at Stanford and then earned a
master's degree in fine arts from the Iowa Writer's Workshop. He
only wrote two stories in Iowa, and said it's a competitive place
``where I think some people really clam up.''
   As a result, Canin applied to medical school after Iowa and was
accepted at Harvard. He wrote most of his stories in medical
school, many when he had to study for exams. ``It was a kind of
mini-rebellion,'' he said.
   But once again, Canin is postponing science. Though he has only
several months left of medical school, he is planning to take at
least a year or two off. He leaves for Mexico on April 1 and hopes
to write a novel there.
   Canin freely admits to a charmed life. But he is equally candid
about the peculiar fears that accompany a lifetime of good fortune.
   ``My life has been very good,'' he said. ``If it were to turn
bad, maybe I'd be the first person to go out and stab someone.''
   That ominous sentiment echoes Canin's favorite story in his
collection, ``American Beauty'' in which a boy waits all summer to
hear worldly wisdom dispensed by a troubled older brother leaving
home.
   ``If something ever goes wrong, you're going to turn into a son
of a bitch, just like me,'' the brother tells him. ``Just like
every guy in the world. You don't know it yet because everything's
all right so far. You think you're a nice guy and everything hasn't
really affected you. But you can't get away from it. It's in your
blood.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Brenda Lee Eyes Broadway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For timeless torch singer Brenda Lee,
the dilemma is not what to sing but what to leave out.
   With a career spanning more than 30 years, she finds it
impossible to sing all her hit records during one concert.
   ``I do three medleys and still have to leave out a bunch,'' the
irrepressible 43-year-old performer says. ``I'd be up there three
hours if I sang them all.''
   Her tender, bluesy voice on such songs as ``I'm Sorry'' and
``All Alone Am I'' has carried her to record sales of about 100
million.
   ``It feels pretty good,'' she says. ``It's kind of unbelievable
in a way. But it feels great.''
   After 12 million-selling single records and performances in 52
foreign nations, she embarks on another career milestone this year.
She's set to begin appearing in a musical called ``Music! Music!
Music!'' at Opryland USA in Nashville.
   It's a preliminary step to what she hopes might be performing on
Broadway. Earlier in her career, she did summer stock in ``The
Wizard of Oz'' and ``Bye, Bye Birdie.''
   ``It's always been in the back of my mind,'' she says about the
yearning for the New York stage. ``But I don't know if it ever will
come about.''
   The Nashville production will pose a new challenge for the
entertainer who earned $35 for her first performance in 1955 and
eventually grew to such stature that she sang for the queen of
England.
   ``It will give me a chance to do some different things,'' she
says. ``I thought I'd fit into it well. It will give me a chance to
spread my wings a little.''
   Miss Lee will be seen this spring on a special musical
production called ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' on the Public
Broadcasting Service. She recently appeared in a similar show,
``Legendary Ladies,'' on cable TV's Cinemax.
   Her rollicking ``Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree'' just
enjoyed another holiday season and now has sold more than 6 million
copies.
   ``It feels a little strange when I sing it in July, but that's
all right,'' she said.
   Only her ``I'm Sorry'' has more sales, 10 million.
   She professes to having no favorite hit, but says, ```I'm Sorry'
has a special place because I believed in it so long before I
recorded it. But I liked all of the songs.
   ``It bothers me to leave them out (in concert) because the
people want to hear certain ones. If they yell out a request, I
stop and do it and let the show go longer if I can.''
   Her other hits include ``Comin' on Strong,'' ``Sweet Nothin's,''
``As Usual,'' ``Fool Number One'' and ``Too Many Rivers.''
   Her ``Break It to Me Gently'' preceded a hit version by Juice
Newton. Similarly, she had a hit with ``Always on My Mind'' before
Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson recorded it.
   She offers these comments on current female pop stars:
   Madonna _ ``I like her. She's got a different style and a flair
and she's her own person. She's courageous in what she does.''
   Whitney Houston _ ``She's a very classy lady and a very good
singer with roots in gospel music that show through. She's bringing
back ballads and I'm glad she's around to do that.''
   Cyndi Lauper _ ``She reminds me of me as far as her energy and
singing. I wasn't as wild or as way out as she may be but she's
very energetic and unorthodox and I was that way. She doesn't just
stand there and sing and be pretty. She jumps around and moves and
sweats and gets close to the audience. I like that.''
   Miss Lee, who made her 19th tour of Japan in December, says her
love of performing has not dwindled since she was dubbed ``Little
Miss Dynamite'' as a teen-age entertainer nearly a quarter century
ago.
   ``Keeping up your zest for singing is not hard. It's everything
else _ getting there and the travel _ all the stuff that goes into
it. Singing is definitely the easy part,'' she says.
   ``I want to keep doing it because I love the business and I know
how to do it. I've lasted because of the people who've bought the
records and supported me and because of the DJ's who've played my
records.
   ``I've had so many thrills it would be hard to pick the top
one,'' she says. ``When you sing for heads of state and queens,
have gold records and win awards, it's so hard to say one was the
most exciting.
   ``One of them was meeting (gospel great) Mahalia Jackson. She
was one of my idols along with Judy Garland and Sophie Tucker.''

<TEXT>
   
   ``You Can Dance'' (Warner Bros.) _ Madonna
   
   It's got a good beat and you can dance to it. Madonna's new
album isn't really new, but rather a collection of danceable hits,
remixed by club deejays masterful at that peculiar art of taking
the artists' work, track by track, and reconstructing it. Most such
remixes become 12-inch dance singles, and ``You Can Dance,'' is
basically a compilation of these.
   The album includes ``Everybody,'' Madonna's first single,
remixed into a long dance version, and the 12-inch disco mixes of
``Holiday,'' ``Into the Groove,'' ``Over and Over,'' ``Physical
Attraction'' and ``Where's the Party?'' The only new cut is
``Spotlight.''
   All are vintage Madonna _ light, unburdened, often hypnotically
rhythmic pop music that you can, indeed, dance to, and sometimes
even listen to.
   ``Into the Groove'' may be recognized by film buffs since it got
additional notice in Madonna's film debut, the 1985 ``Desperately
Seeking Susan.'' Her film career hasn't prospered since then, but
her recording career has not flagged.
   ``Where's the Party?'' is from her most recent album ``True
Blue,'' released last year.
   Madonna got her start in dance clubs, and ``You Can Dance'' is
an obvious tribute to the disco milieu, where stamina and
dependability are more valuable than intellect any day. It might
just be the only dance record you'll ever need _ if you need only a
beat, not necessarily heart, to get moving.

<HEAD>IBM Announces New Mainframes, Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. on Monday
announced a new design and new internal software for its largest
computers, continuing a chain of enhancements dating back to the
first System-360 in 1964.
   The world's dominant maker of mainframe computers, IBM controls
about 70 percent of the market. The huge computers are used by the
government and almost all major businesses.
   IBM said the improvements would allow computers to obtain access
to information more rapidly and allow users to develop new programs
for their own needs more easily.
   IBM also unveiled new models of its biggest line of mainframe
computers, the 3090 series, and of its slightly smaller 4381
series. IBM said the new architecture _ a way of putting computers
and data storage devices together _ would permit more productive
use of existing computers.
   The computer giant said the new operating system, which governs
the internal workings of a computer, was a major new development
comparable to the advent of the System-360 in 1964, the System-370
in 1970, and the 370-Extended Architecture of 1981.
   The Enterprise Systems Architecture-370, the new operating
system, can be used in IBM's 3090 and 4381 mainframe computers.
   The ESA-370, which controls the division of room in a computer
data storage device, allows computers to reach 16 trillion
characters of data that are held in ``virtual storage.'' That is
8,000 times greater than the virtual storage accessible with IBM's
current operating system.
   Information held in virtual storage can be retrieved almost as
quickly as information held in the computer's main memory.
   IBM also announced a program for helping computers get at stored
information more rapidly. IBM said the program, called Data
Facility Storage Management, is the most ``significant storage
advancement in 20 years.''
   It also announced a piece of hardware that allows the 3090 to
run as if it were four different computers in one.
   ``These new products have important benefits to our customers
now, and help them plan for the future by setting a path for IBM
large system growth into the next decade,'' said Edward Lucente,
IBM vice president and group executive in the U.S. marketing and
services group.
   ``They establish a new foundation for future enhancements that
will continue to help our customers take advantage of these new
capabilities,'' he said in a statement.
   IBM said the 3090 models 280E and 500E would cost $4.9 million
and $9.65 million, respectively. The 280E will be available in the
second quarter of the year, while the 500E will be available in the
third quarter.
   The 4381 models 91E is priced at $550,000, and the 92E is priced
at $920,000. Both will be available in November.

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling party-owned newspaper, Kenya
Times, hit the streets Monday with a new look and a new part-owner:
British newspaper publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Kenya African National Union, by law the country's only
political party, bought the newspaper on April 5, 1983 and changed
it to the Kenya Times.
   It is published by Kenya Times Media Trust, a joint venture
between KANU Investments and Maxwell Communication Corp.
   Maxwell and KANU announced in January 1987 they would be
partners in a series of media-related businesses, including a
textbook publishing company.
   Maxwell said he would invest $45 million in the project, which
includes a 30-story, twin-tower communications center in Nairobi.
   Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers last year sent people to train
Kenya Times journalists and printers, and the newspaper received
new equipment.
   The new Kenya Times is the first major undertaking of the
partnership.
   The revamped newspaper has dropped the crowing cock _ the KANU
symbol _ for a shield and crossed spears, which is part of Kenya's
coat of arms. Also changed is the newspaper motto, from ``The Badge
of Patriotism'' to ``The Voice of the People.''
   The price remains unchanged at about 20 cents.

<TEXT>
   The number of oil and gas rigs working in the
United States dropped by 18 this week to total 968, Baker Hughes
announced.
   This week's total reflects the number of rigs working as of last
Friday. A year ago, the count 806, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The previous week, the rig count had recovered from recent
losses by posting an increase of 22 to total 986. The rig count
usually declines during the first few months of the year.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number
of rigs actively exploring for oil, and not rigs producing oil. The
rig count is a widely-watched industry index of drilling activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged this year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the count
reached a peak with 4,500 active rigs. But in the summer of 1986,
the rig count fell to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began compiling
figures _ as oil prices plunged to less than $10 per 42-gallon
barrel.
   Among the major oil producing states, California, Oklahoma and
Michigan each gained five rigs this week.
   Wyoming and Louisiana posted the largest decreases, losing 10
and seven respectively. Ohio and Kansas each lost five rigs, and
New Mexico and Texas each lost three. North Dakota's count was down
by two.

<HEAD>Societe Generale Shares Soar As De Benedetti Launches Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares of Societe Generale de Belgique
SA soared Monday as Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti launched
his long-awaited bid to take control of Belgium's largest holding
company.
   But dealers noted that Societe Generale's shares, which surged
580 francs to 4,730 francs, or about $135.14 each, remained well
above the 4,000 francs a share de Benedetti has offered to pay.
   Dealers predicted de Benedetti would wait for the price to fall
before increasing his stake. His current offer runs through March 4.
   The Italian investor claims to be the largest single
shareholder, controlling through allies about 38 percent of Societe
Generale's stock. He is seeking to acquire an additional 15 percent
stake in the company.
   Societe Generale's shares traded at a record 4,850 francs a
share last Thursday. But the shares plunged 700 francs each on
Friday, when a group of mostly Belgian investors failed to agree
with France's Compagnie Financiere de Suez to keep Societe Generale
anchored in Belgium.
   Failure to reach an agreement forced Belgian industrialist Andre
Leysen, head of the Gevaert N.V. holding company, to quit as the
group's spokesman, strengthening De Benedetti's hand.
   De Benedetti is seeking to run the day-to-day operation of
Societe Generale, which controls a third of the Belgian economy,
and turn the company into a pan-European holding enterprise.
   The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around Leysen said
it controlled 28 percent of the company's outstanding shares, while
Suez claimed 15 percent. But together with various small allies,
Leysen said the bloc would have been assured of absolute majority
at shareholders meetings.
   Rumors surfaced as to a possible replacement for Leysen, but no
one has yet been named.
   Economic Affairs Minister Phillipe Maystadt said over the
weekend that ``vital sectors'' of the economy that are controlled
by Societe Generale would still be subject to a government veto,
whoever holds a majority stake in the company.
   ``Above and beyond all the financial games, we must return to
the essential point for Belgium, which is that certain strategic
sectors remain under Belgian control,'' Maystadt said.
   In recent weeks, trading of Societe Generale shares off the
Brussels stock exchange often outweighed official trading, with
anonymous buyers paying premium rates for the company's shares.
Last Thursday, the unofficial share price rose as high as 5,300
francs.
   Traders said they could not tell Monday who bought Societe
Generale shares.

<HEAD>Pirelli Has No Comment on Reported Bid For Firestone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pirelli S.p.A. declined Monday to confirm or deny
Italian media reports that it is negotiating a $1 billion
acquisition of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.'s tire division.
   Pirelli Managing Director Jacopo Vittorelli said through a
spokesman that the company ``always has contacts with big and small
competitors, but in this specific case we can't confirm the
substance of the reports. But we can't deny it either because we've
always shown interest in the North American market.''
   Officials at Firestone, based in Akron, Ohio, had no comment.
   Headquartered in Milan, Pirelli is the world's fifth largest
tire maker with sales of $3.65 billion in 1987. Pirelli currently
holds 1.5 percent of the U.S. tire market. The company has no
manufacturing plants in North America.
   The Pirelli official said he would disclose any information ``as
soon as the facts called for it.''
   Italian newspaper reports over the weekend said Pirelli had
offered $1 billion for Firestone's tire division in an effort to
strengthen its position in the U.S. market.
   The Rome-based national daily La Repubblica quoted an
unidentified Pirelli official as saying that ``if we want to, we
can buy Firestone; we have both the capacity and the means.''
   Firestone is the third-largest tire manufacturer in the United
States.
   Acquiring Firestone's tire division would make Pirelli the
world's third largest tire manufacturer, following Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co. of Akron, Ohio, and Generale Des Establissements
Michelin of France, respectively, the Italian news reports said.

   Shares prices ended higher Monday but off their
peaks in extremely quiet trading on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index gained 5.2
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,739.2.
   Volume was a mere 248.3 million shares, the lowest daily volume
since the year began. It compared with 323.4 million shares Friday.
   Share prices opened higher but drifted off on lack of volume. A
quiet morning turned into an uneventful afternoon as the closure of
U.S. financial markets because of the Washington's Birthday holiday
deprived the London market of any new direction.
   ``Today was canceled through lack of interest,'' said one dealer

<HEAD>Dollar Falls In Quiet Trading, Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>

closed due to national holiday.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell Monday in Europe, where
trading was quiet due to holidays in West Germany and the United
States. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar moved up and down a bit
during slight position-adjusting maneuvers among those who remained
to trade.
   A holiday in the northern part of West Germany and the national
Washington's Birthday U.S. holiday emptied most foreign-exchange
trading rooms, they said.
   ``We are doing only nominal trading,'' said one dealer at a
major West German bank in Frankfurt. ``Very small sums are crossing
the floor.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 131.00. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 130.15 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.7455 to buy one pound, compared with $1.7401 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday
included: 1.7085 West German marks, down from 1.7123; 1.4040 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4065; 5.7705 French francs, down from 5.7865;
1.9180 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9225; 1,257.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,260.75, and 1.2658 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2624.
   Gold prices rose in active European trading. The late bid price
of gold was $445.10 a troy ounce in London, compared with late
Friday's $443.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $445.50, compared with $443.50
late Friday.
   Bullion markets in Hong Kong were closed for Chinese New Year.
   Silver bullion prices rose marginally in London where it was
trading at a late bid price of $6.35 a troy ounce, compared with
Friday's $6.34.

<HEAD>Groupe AG Sweetens Bid for Assubel-Vie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgium's largest insurer, Groupe AG
S.A., said Monday it raised its offer for rival insurer Assubel-Vie
SA by 20 percent to 7,200 francs, or about $205.71 per share.
   Groupe AG announced the new bid, its second for Assubel-Vie, to
offset a counter-offer for Assubel-Vie's stock by a group of
investors backed by Assubel-Vie.
   The new bid, which values Assubel-Vie at almost 9 billion
francs, or about $257 million, will be launched Tuesday and run
through the end of the month, Groupe AG said in a statement.
   The offer is for all of Assubel-Vie's 1.24 million shares,
Groupe AG said. Assubel Vie is not quoted on the Brussels stock
exchange.
   The sweetened offer is considerably higher than required under
Belgian takeover regulations, which requires offers to increase by
5 percent.
   A Groupe AG official said the company made a higher offer ``to
avoid a bidding war.''
   However, Assubel-Vie, Belgium's third largest insurer, indicated
it would continue to resist Groupe AG, even though the group
supported by Assubel-Vie is offering 6,000 francs, or $171 per
share.
   The group includes Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA, Belgium's second
largest holding company; Assurances Generales de France, a
state-owned French insurer; Cobepa, a Belgian holding company, and
Cie. Generale Mosane.
   Assubel-Vie called in the four companies after Belgium's banking
commission ruled last month the company had to come up with
alternative shareholders if it wanted to block Groupe AG's bid.
   The group's counter-offer for Assubel-Vie was launched a week
ago and expires on Friday.

   Domestic car and truck sales, boosted by
aggressive buyer incentive programs, rose 2.8 percent in early
February over the same period a year ago, automakers reported
Monday.
   ``Sales are very strong. We haven't seen a major downturn in the
market yet, although many were expecting one,'' said Chris
Cedergren, an industry analyst with J.D. Power and Associates in
Agoura, Calif.
   Car makers sold 192,001 domestically built cars and 102,754
domestically built light trucks in the nine selling days from Feb.
1-10, up from 170,134 cars and 84,734 trucks in eight days in the
same period a year ago.
   Sales are compared on the basis of average daily sales during a
period rather than on straight totals. While car sales rose only
0.3 percent from early February 1987, truck sales climbed 7.8
percent.
   On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars were selling at an annual
rate of 8.4 million vehicles, indicating dealers were doing a brisk
business in early February.
   ``The market will probably subside in mid-February,'' but a
major sales dive isn't likely, Cedergren said.
   Among the Big Three automakers, General Motors Corp.'s car sales
fell 4.2 percent against early February 1987, but sales of
domestically built GM trucks rose 4.6 percent. GM's share of both
markets shrank, however.
   Industry-leader GM held 50.9 percent of the domestic car market,
down from 53.3 percent a year ago, and 40.7 percent of the truck
market, down from 41.9 percent a year ago.
   Ford Motor Co., the nation's second-largest automaker, sold 5.9
percent more domestic cars than a year ago and 3.7 percent more
trucks. Ford's share of the car market grew to 28.8 percent from
27.3 percent a year ago, but its domestic truck share fell to 35.5
percent from 36.9 percent a year ago.
   No. 3 Chrysler Corp.'s sales of domestically built cars jumped
12.8 percent, and its share of that market increased to 14.9
percent from 13.3 percent a year ago.
   Chrysler's domestic truck sales rose 24.6 percent in early
February while its market share grew to 22.1 percent from 19.2
percent a year ago.
   Cedergren said Chrysler, suffering from large inventories, cut
production and offered the most aggressive buyer incentives in the
market.
   American Honda Motor Co., the No. 4 U.S. automaker, suffered a
15 percent drop in sales from early February 1987, and its share of
the market shrank to 3.8 percent from 4.4 percent a year ago.
   But Cedergren blamed Honda's lost sales on short supply of its
popular cars. ``Demand outstripped production,'' he said, adding
that Honda has only a 10- to 12-day supply of domestic cars,
compared with an industry norm of 60-65 days supply.
   Nissan Motor Corp.'s U.S. car sales tumbled 45.5 percent in
early February and its domestic truck sales fell 10.7 percent,
making it the only domestic maker whose truck sales declined.
   ``Nissan's been having problems all year. Nissan has been the
least tolerant of yen-induced price increases. Even though the cars
are American-built, much of the componentry is brought from
Japan,'' Cedergren said.
   Nissan's U.S.-build Sentra subcompact sedan and coupe have
suffered from increased competition in the small-car segment of the
market, he noted.

   A new superconductor that operates at higher
temperatures and may be easier to adapt to practical applications
has been discovered by a research team in Japan, scientists said
Monday.
   The superconductor is not merely a refinement of either of the
two known high-temperature superconductors, but an entirely new
compound that in some respects may exceed the performance of the
others, said a panel of scientists at the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   The new material _ a mixture of bismuth, strontium, calcium,
copper and oxygen _ raises the temperature at which
superconductivity occurs to about 243 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit, a jump of more than 50 degrees above levels attained
with previous superconductors.
   Scattered reports have appeared during the past year of
superconductivity occurring at room temperature or even higher
temperatures, but those observations have not been confirmed and
are not widely accepted.
   In contrast, the properties of the new material were confirmed
within days after its discovery was disclosed on Jan. 22 in a
newspaper in Japan, the researchers said.
   ``I personally am quite happy we have found a third one,'' said
K. Alex Mueller of IBM in Zurich. He won a Nobel Prize last fall
for his discovery in January 1986 of the first of the new
high-temperature superconductors.
   Mueller's superconductor was made of lanthanum, strontium,
copper and oxygen.
   Superconductors carry electricity with no resistance and
therefore no wasteful dissipation of electricity. Before Mueller's
discovery, superconductivity occurred only at temperatures a few
degrees above absolute zero, about 459 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit. Comparatively expensive liquid helium was required to
cool them to the temperatures at which they became superconducting.
   A year after Mueller's discovery, Paul Chu of the University of
Houston and others discovered a second superconducting compound
made of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen that became a
superconductor above the temperature of liquid nitrogen, 321
degrees below zero Fahrenheit. That was important because liquid
nitrogen is relatively inexpensive and widely available.
   Later in the year, researchers demonstrated that the second
compound could carry significant amounts of electrical current, an
important requirement for practical application of superconductors.
   Last month, a Japanese team led by Hiroshi Maeda discovered the
new bismuth superconductor. Maeda did not attend Monday's meeting.
   Mueller noted that for the third consecutive year a new
superconductor has been discovered in January. ``One may have hopes
we'll have another in a year,'' he said.
   The new superconductor appears to be flexible, suggesting that
it might lend itself more easily than the others to the fabrication
of wire, said Angelica Stacey, a chemist at the University of
California, Berkeley.
   Because the superconductor operates at significantly higher
temperatures, its electrical properties at the temperature of
liquid nitrogen may be superior to the properties of the other
superconductors, said John Rowell of Bell Communications Research
in Red Bank, N.J.
   As a general rule, the properties of superconductors improve the
farther you go below the so-called transition temperature at which
they become superconducting, he explained.
   Critical properties in addition to the transition temperature
are the maximum current the superconductor can accommodate and the
maximum magnetic field it can withstand, Rowell said.
   Another potential advantage of the new material is that bismuth
is more stable than barium, which means that the new superconductor
might be less likely to break down chemically over a period of
time, said Stacey.
   Although the researchers were optimistic that the new compound
would have useful properties, they said not enough time had yet
elapsed for those properties to be measured.
   Philip W. Anderson, a professor of physics at Princeton
University in New Jersey, said the availability of a third
superconductor will make it easier for researchers to develop
theories explaining how high-temperature superconductors work.
   Anderson said he believes the new superconductors are profoundly
different from conventional superconductors.
   ``What we've discovered is not just a new kind of
superconductor,'' he said, ``but a new kind of metal.''

<TEXT>
   The past year was a good one for the beef
cattle industry, and 1988 will bring renewed efforts to export its
products, the president of the National Cattlemen's Association
said Monday.
   From a cattleman's viewpoint, beef prices ``are going to be very
good,'' NCA President Jack Dahl told reporters at the association's
annual convention. Aggressive promotional campaigns and stronger
demand will reduce the amount of beef in the market, resulting in
better prices, Dahl said.
   Because of health concerns, the industry has in past years
experienced overproduction and lower sales, with American consumers
buying more poultry, pork and other products.
   Some experts say there is little evidence to suggest a
strengthening in demand for meat products in domestic markets.
   The NCA is working hard in Congress and with foreign governments
to lower or eliminate tariffs and embargoes on American beef, Dahl
said.
   ``We must promote and advertise beef to improve demand, but that
will do us little good if we are legislated or regulated out of
business,'' he said in a report to nearly 5,000 cattlemen and
family members attending the convention and trade show in Orlando.
   Alan R. Middaugh, president of the U.S. Meat Export Federation,
said a 21 percent increase in Japan's beef quota last year, plus
projected increases through the end of the century, demonstrate the
benefits of developing foreign markets.
   The Japanese government responded to high consumer demand by
hiking the import quota in August by 37,000 metric tons, Middaugh
said.
   In the first 11 months of 1987, American beef and veal exports
worldwide totaled 192,731 metric tons valued at $703.8 million.
This was a 22 percent increase in tonnage and a 26 percent increase
in dollar value over the previous year, Middaugh said.
   Of the 1987 totals, 116,668 metric tons or $511.5 million went
to Japan, he said. That represented a 13 percent increase in
tonnage and 17 percent increase in dollar value over the previous
year.
   Dahl said NCA ``strongly supports the (U.S.) government's
position to abolish quotas. But other changes need to be made in
the distribution of beef in Japan. . . We know that the Japanese
have a great liking for beef.''

<TEXT>
   Israel's consumer price index rose by 1.6
percent in January, slightly higher than predicted, the Central
Bureau of Statistics announced Monday.
   In December, the inflation rate stood at 1.3 percent, and for
all of 1987 it reached 16.1 percent, the lowest in 15 years.
   Finance Minister Moshe Nissim called on employers, unions and
workers to show restraint in wage negotiations in order to slow
down inflation.
   ``The index is relatively high, and we have to work for a lower
figure,'' Nissim told Israel radio. ``But there is no doubt that if
want to reach a desirable level, a European level, it doesn't work
at once.''
   The price increase was largely fueled by rising prices for
fruits and vegetables. The consumer price index measures the change
in retail prices for a basket of goods and services.
   In 1985, the government launched a sweeping austerity program to
curb triple-digit inflation and reduce a $750 million budget
deficit.
   The reforms helped reduce inflation from a record 444.9 percent
in 1984 to 19.7 percent in 1986.

   Campeau Corp. said it will submit a sweetened
cash bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. ``in excess of $65 a
share'' on Tuesday, when the retail giant's board is set to meet to
review takeover offers.
   Federated said in a statement Monday that while its board may
act on the bids at the meeting, ``there can be no assurance that
any definitive transaction will take place.'' A $65-a-share bid
would value the retail giant at about $5.75 billion.
   Federated, which confirmed it has been negotiating with numerous
parties, has twice spurned Campeau. Federated rejected Campeau's
initial $47-per-share, $4.2 billion takeover offer as inadequate
and turned down an improved $61-per-share, $5.4 billion bid because
it was not convinced Campeau had the necessary financing.
   Federated said it was notified of Campeau's intentions in a
letter over the weekend. A Campeau spokeswoman confirmed that
Campeau will make an offer to Federated's board to ``enter into a
definitive agreement providing for a price per share in excess of
$65 in cash.''
   While Federated did acknowledge it had held talks with Campeau,
it did not identify other parties it has negotiated with. Among
those believed to be interested in Federated is the leveraged
buyout firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co.
   Last week, in a letter to Henry Kravis, Campeau Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Robert Campeau warned that any agreement
between KKR and Federated would be met with ``a vigorous legal
challenge.''
   Federated said the negotiations involve the possible
restructuring of the Cincinnati-based retailer, which operates
about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales exceeding $11 billion
in 1987.
   ``The purpose of these negotiations is to be able to present to
the company's board of directors ... several alternatives for the
board's consideration. Each of the parties has been urged to make
its best proposal, because the board may take definitive action at
that time,'' Federated said in its statement Monday.
   The company also said the board will consider ``the risks
inherent in any such transaction, the financial capability of the
purchaser, and the extent to which any purchaser may have taken
action to discourage others from submitting proposals to the
company.''
   A Campeau spokeswoman retorted that ``possible action to
discourage others'' was ``a veiled reference to Campeau's letter to
KKR, and if that is the case, we believe our letter is totally
justifiable.''
   Federated revealed in a Feb. 5 Securities and Exchange
Commission filing that it was considering alternatives including
selling assets, restructuring, or an outright sale of the company.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based development company, bought Allied
Stores Corp. in December 1986. Campeau sold several Allied
divisions but retained retailing chains including Ann Taylor,
Brooks Brothers and Jordan Marsh.
   Federated's holdings include the New York-based chains of
Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Straus, Filene's of Boston, Burdines
of Miami, Rich's in Atlanta, Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire in Los
Angeles, I. Magnin in San Francisco and Lazarus in Cincinnati.
   Ohio politicians are worried that Campeau will buy Federated,
sell off major portions of the company and fire or lay off large
numbers of its employees.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio and chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said last week he is
concerned that a Campeau purchase of Federated could reduce retail
competition in New York City, Boston and Miami, where Allied and
Federated both own stores.
   Separate, Campeau has obtained a restraining order against a
recently enacted Ohio law the makes takeovers by foreign companies
more cumbersome.

   Congressional leaders have agreed to
iron out differences between House and Senate versions of a trade
bill and send it to the House floor for passage by April 1, Speaker
Jim Wright said Monday.
   Wright, D-Texas, told reporters after meeting with the AFL-CIO's
executive council that he won an agreement last week with Senate
Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia and all the leaders
of the legislation to wrap up a House-Senate conference on a
compromise version by March 23.
   ``No question in my mind, we'll pass a trade bill ... with
enough votes to override a veto, should that be necessary,'' he
said.
   White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker said last month that
President Reagan would veto either version as they stand now as
being too protectionist. Both were passed early last year, but
efforts to reach a House-Senate compromise to be sent to the White
House were abandoned after the October stock market crash.
   Basically, each would require countries with free access to U.S.
markets to provide that same type of open access to American goods
in their markets. If a country does not remove its tariffs or
quotas on American goods, the president would be required to impose
the same measures on their exports to the United States.
   Wright said he also met last week with Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III and Reagan's trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
expressing a willingness to compromise on the administration's
biggest objections. He said he also promised them a House vote on
the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement by the end of the year.
   ``I don't want to push them into a corner of threatening
vetoes,'' he said. ``They would be smart if they didn't threaten
vetoes, if they hedged a little bit on that because we can modify
some things.''
   Wright made it clear that some version of a measure requiring
employers to provide their workers 60 days advance notice of plant
closings will be in the final package. But he indicated that a
sacrifice will likely be made of a provision in the House bill
written by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Both provisions have shared the status as the AFL-CIO's top
legislative priority for more than two years. Both also share the
biggest focus of White House veto threats.
   Gephardt's measure, a primary theme in his presidential
campaign, would mandate retaliatory import quotas or tariffs on
some countries if they do not reduce their trade imbalances with
the United States by 10 percent a year.
   His use of TV spots, warning Korea that if it didn't open up its
markets to American goods it could face U.S. tariffs he said would
raise the price of a Korean-made Hyundai car to $48,000 in the
United States, was credited with reviving his campaign with a
victory in last week's Iowa caucuses.
   Wright complained of a ``fixation'' on the Gephardt measure,
predicting that the conferees will agree on ``something in
between'' it and a Senate modification that links the enforcement
mechanism more to how much U.S. exports to a particular country
rise.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said unions still prefer the
Gephardt language, which is aimed primarily at South Korea, Japan,
Taiwan and West Germany.
   Despite the large devaluation of the dollar against most foreign
currencies last year that helped send U.S. exports surging, the
trade imbalance with those four countries widened by more than an
additional $8 billion last year to more than $100 billion.
   ``We continue to insist that whatever comes out must be
substantive, forceful and effective and not simply an expression of
pious good wishes,'' Kirkland said.

   The Coca-Cola Co. on Monday reported net income
for the fourth quarter of 1987 fell 39 percent to $192.96 million,
or 52 cents per share, compared with the year-ago period.
   In the 1986 fourth quarter, Coca-Cola reported net income of
$314.5 million, or 82 cents a share, augmented partly from the sale
of 51 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises, its new bottling subsidiary.
   Net operating revenue during the final 1987 quarter totaled
$1.99 billion, up 16 percent from $1.72 billion in the year-ago
quarter.
   For the 12 months ending Dec. 31, the soft drink giant reported
net income of $916 million, or $2.43 per share, down about 2
percent from net income of $934 million, or $2.42 a share, in 1986.
   For the 1987 year, net operating revenue totaled $7.66 billion,
up almost 10 percent from $6.98 billion in 1986.
   ``We emerged from 1987 with a corporate structure focused on our
core business and designed to optimize the growth opportunities of
each of our businesses,'' said Coca-Cola Chairman Roberto C.
Goizueta.
   ``Because of the momentum of our soft drink business, leadership
in the citrus market and strategic investments in the bottling and
entertainment businesses, we fully expect another strong
performance in 1988.''
   Sales of soft drink cases to retail stores grew 6 percent in the
United States in 1987, he said, and sales of Coca-Cola Classic
alone increased 9 percent. Domestic sales of soft drink syrup and
concentrates rose 1 percent.
   Unit sales in foreign markets rose 11 percent for the fourth
quarter and 9 percent for the year. Operating profit overseas
increased 25 percent for the year, due primarily to a weaker
dollar, the company said.
   Sales of juices and fruit drinks made by Coca-Cola's food
division also were up, although operating income was down 45
percent because of long-range investments in the orange juice
business, increased spending on advertising and promotions, and a
$36 million writeoff for business system changes, the company said.
   The company noted its Columbia Pictures subsidiary combined with
Tri-Star Pictures in December to form Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc., which is now a free-standing company.
