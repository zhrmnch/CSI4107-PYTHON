   A senior commander ordered his officers Sunday
to view film footage of troops brutally beating Arab prisoners and
said the Israeli army must not become ``a rabble army.''
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, head of the Central Command that is in
charge of the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, gathered all
officers over the rank of platoon commander Sunday and showed them
the footage shot by CBS News in the West Bank town of Nablus,
Israel radio reported.
   ``I'm against those who think we can sweep internal problems
under the carpet just because they're not pretty,'' Mitzna said
earlier on Israel radio. ``We have to make sure we don't become a
rabble army.''
   The film, which showed four soldiers in Nablus kicking and
beating two Palestinians last Thursday, shocked many Israelis who
believed violence by soldiers during three months of Palestinian
demonstrations had receded after new army orders last week limited
the use of force.
   Some members of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
Bloc defended the soldiers.
   ``I'm against the lynch atmosphere,'' said Likud legislator
Pinchas Goldstein. ``There was no need to arrest the soldiers.''
   Transport Minister Chaim Korfu, also of Likud, told the Cabinet
Sunday the press should be barred from the occupied lands for three
months.
   ``We are in a confrontation,'' Korfu later told Israel army
radio. ``We must take these minimal measures when we know for
certain (the media) is responsible for some of the violence.''
   According to U.N. figures, 74 Arabs have been killed by the
Israelis during the violent in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip since Dec. 10. Hundreds have been wounded and there have been
many cases of soldiers severely beating Palestinians.
   The CBS film showed four soldiers, members of a tank unit,
kicking the Palestinians whose hands were tied behind their backs
and smashing them on the legs and arms with fist-sized rocks.
   The four were arrested and their deputy unit commander, a
captain, was suspended. It was announced Saturday that the four
soldiers would be tried by a military court. Mitzna ordered the
release of the two Arabs.
   Amalia Harpaz, the mother of one of the four soldiers filmed by
CBS, said her son Saguy had changed since he began serving in the
occupied territories 10 weeks ago.
   ``I educated my son to go the army, take responsibility and
defend the country,'' she told Israel radio. ``What has happened is
that he has turned into a beater of women and children.''
   She is a resident of Kibbutz Gesher, a communal settlement.
   Israel radio said several lawyers have offered to represent the
soldiers without charge. It reported the lawyers said if anyone was
responsible for a crime, it is Israel's leaders.

   A salvage crew raised a sunken oil barge
Sunday from the murky depths of Guemes Channel, one month after it
sank and spilled some 70,000 gallons of heavy bunker oil into
Washington's inland waters.
   With the inverted barge held at the surface by thick cables
strung from two giant cranes, crews began pumping the more than
300,000 gallons of oil that remained in the vessel into a second
barge. Officials said they wanted to get the stricken barge
floating on its own before they attempted to slowly roll it right
side up.
   A helicopter hovered overhead to track the movement of an oil
sheen that appeared as the barge was raised. The sheen was caused
by 500 to 1,000 gallons of lighter oil that was detected after the
barge broke the surface about 7 a.m., said Mark Stewart of the
state Division of Emergency Management.
   The barge initially held about 22,000 gallons of light oil in
addition to the heavy oil.
   Stewart said surface skimmer boats had cleaned up about 160
gallons, while absorbent pads collected an additional, undetermined
amount.
   The oil sheen moved about two miles south. Coast Guard Lt. Eldo
DeLong said the sheen reached some kelp beds near Burrows Bay, but
did not touch any beaches.
   State Department of Ecology workers said three seabirds were
contaminated, but they did not appear badly injured and were not
captured for cleaning.
   Marine biologists and state environmental experts were assessing
the damage from the bunker oil spill, which had been difficult to
determine because the heavier-than-water oil had sunk.
   But Ats Kiuchi, a DOE spokesman, said it appeared the fragile,
inner coastal environment had avoided a disaster that, if the barge
had spilled its entire cargo, would have been the worst oil spill
in the state's history.
   Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Laboratory
has found some oil in sea cucumbers, said Paul Cassidy, the lab's
director of operations.
   The U.S. Coast Guard tug ``Spike'' used absorbent pads to clean
up some oil after the barge was raised while a second boat was
positioned near Shannon Point, 100 yards away, to prevent any oil
from reaching shore.
   The 176-foot-long barge, operated by Olympic Tug and Barge of
Seattle, sank Jan. 31 in about 130 feet of water four miles west of
Anacortes and about 100 yards off Shannon Point.
   The barge had been loaded at an oil refinery at Anacortes and
was being towed by a tug to Seattle when it began listing and
capsized.
   The cause of the sinking remained undetermined.
   Coast Guard Lt. Eldo DeLong said the barge will be taken to the
Anacortes city dock where a boom would be put around it and any
remaining holes would be patched. Eventually it will be taken to
Seattle, he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: United States Has Sent Envoy To Iran For Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A London newspaper said Sunday that the United
States has sent a secret envoy to Iran to discuss re-establishing
diplomatic links.
   The Observer, in an unattributed story, did not identify the
official but said he is apparently a close friend of President
Reagan and went to Tehran two weeks ago. It said the envoy was
traveling under the name of Clark.
   The Observer said the envoy met middle-ranking Iranian
officials, who asked for assurances that any arms embargo against
them as proposed by the United Nations should be delayed until
early this summer.
   The United States is seeking a U.N. ban on arms sales because
Iran has not accepted a cease-fire agreement in its eight-year war
with Iraq.
   There have been no diplomatic relations since the U.S. embassy
in Tehran was stormed Nov. 4, 1979, and held for 444 days with
diplomats and others kept hostage inside.

   Leaping luggage and sniffing out sneaky smugglers,
the latest addition to Miami International Airport's K-9 corps has
racked up impressive credits in his first two months on the beat,
his human colleagues say.
   King, a romping 2-year-old cross between a black Labrador
retriever and a German short-haired pointer, has a nose that makes
news.
   Since the U.S. Customs Service gave King to Metro-Dade police,
he has sniffed out $86,000 in drug-scented cash, 347 pounds of
cocaine and helped collar four suspects, said police Lt. Larry
Martin.
   The beloved rookie, one of three canines used by Metro-Dade
police at the airport, has all but matched the 400-pound career
total of Ringo, who just retired after about a decade, Martin said.
   ``He's an up-and-coming dog,'' Martin said of the enthusiastic
pooch, who with handler Detective Ken Buzzi, graduated from the
U.S. Customs dog training school in Front Royal, Va.
   King and Buzzi were still getting used to the domestic flight
areas of Miami International after their December graduation when
they made their first score Dec. 17.
   A man carrying Christmas presents on a flight from Denver fit
the profile of a smuggler. Denver police had been suspicious.
   The man agreed to a search and King ``alerted'' to a drug odor
in his packages. More than $40,000 in drug-tainted cash was
discovered, Buzzi said.
   The fact that a specially trained dog identified the money as
having been associated with narcotics was probable cause to seize
it, Buzzi said.
   Soon afterward, King found a similar amount of drug-tainted cash
packed in a Mercedes Benz.
   The two occupants of the car were arrested and are awaiting
trial in Dade County Circuit Court, Buzzi said.
   King's abilities also led to the discovery of 185 pounds of
cocaine and the arrest of two Eastern Airlines employees on Feb. 1.
   The next day, he sniffed out 155 pounds of cocaine concealed
underneath the floor in the belly of an L-1011 aircraft. He
detected 7 pounds of cocaine on an earlier search to bring his
total to 347 pounds, Martin said.
   ``I worked mostly narcotics for the last 16 years,'' said Buzzi.
``The biggest seizure I made was 600 pounds and it took me almost
10 years. But working with a detector dog, we've found almost 400
pounds in the first two months we were back from school.
   ``We're both still a green team. I've been a police officer for
18 years but I feel like a rookie again. It's like a whole new
career,'' he said.
   While King has a ``super-fine nose,'' he is not perfect, Buzzi
said.
   King gets tired sometimes while working his eight-hour shift,
``but so far he's been on the money,'' he said.
   Detector dogs cannot sniff the enormous volume of luggage,
freight and planes used to smuggle narcotics and money through this
primary port of entry for drugs, Buzzi said.
   Any dog and its handler are only as good as the watchful
authorities who suggest likely targets.
   ``It was mostly luck and being in the right place at the right
time,'' Buzzi said.

   Mohammed Ali Abu Leban, accused of hurling a
firebomb at Israeli soldiers, saw his lawyer for the first time
five minutes before he appeared in military court.
   The 19-year-old signed a confession written in Hebrew, a
language he does not know, and said interrogators abused him.
   As authorities round up growing numbers of Arab suspects in an
effort to quell nearly three months of unrest, Israel's methods of
detaining and trying Palestinians has drawn a hail of criticism.
   ``I feel totally helpless in this sham of a system,'' said Abu
Leban's attorney, Jonathan Kuttab, a Palestinian who graduated from
the University of Virginia law school in Charlottesville.
   ``In 98 percent of the cases, lawyers cannot see Palestinian
clients until after they `confess,' and judges will accept the
`confession' at face value, no matter what you say,'' Kuttab told
The Associated Press.
   Abu Leban, shackled and dressed in a blue-jeans jacket, flashed
a V-for-victory sign as he entered the tiny courtroom in a closed
army base. He waved to his father, whom he was seeing for the first
time since his arrest.
   Abu Leban had been held incommunicado for 18 days, until he
signed a four-page confession. He said he signed only after
interrogators beat him, deprived him of sleep and forced him to
squat in a corner for hours.
   Kuttab said it was unlikely his client's contentions would be
accepted in court. Allegations of unfairness in the military court
system prompted the attorneys' association in the Gaza Strip to
decide to boycott all military court proceedings.
   But Israeli officials argue the system is fair.
   ``There are some exceptions. But a defendant who feels he was
mistreated during interrogation can raise the issue in court, where
due process of law is ensured,'' army prosecutor Amos Giora, a
native of Ann Arbor, Mich., said in an interview.
   Giora and other Israelis argue the only obvious shortcoming in
the military court system was redressed by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin earlier this month when he announced that Israel, after 20
years of occupation, would establish army appeal courts.
   Kuttab said figures assembled by Palestinian lawyers show the
total number of Arab detainees, normally about 3,000 at any one
time, has doubled and the army has set up four new prisons with
tent barracks in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   According to the army, 1,927 Palestinians were arrested and 93
placed in jail for six months without trial under emergency
regulations from Dec. 8 to Feb. 9. The Arab-owned Palestine Press
Service puts the number of Arabs jailed without trial at 147.
   The process from arrest to trial in the military court system is
well documented. A Palestinian suspected of participating in
anti-Israeli activities is usually detained in the middle of the
night because soldiers fear their presence in Arab towns or refugee
camps during the day might spark protests.
   The detainee is handcuffed, often blindfolded, and taken to a
military prison. No arrest warrant is ever shown and family members
are not told where the suspect is being taken.
   It often takes a lawyer several weeks to track down his new
client, who can be held incommunicado for up to six months. A judge
is required to order a detention extension after the first 18 days.
   ``During the period of interrogation, the detainee is routinely
subjected to beatings, forced to spend long hours in uncomfortable
positions, threatened and submitted to other psychological
measures,'' Kuttab said.
   ``Usually before the first 18-day period is up, the defendant
breaks down and confesses to a variety of illegal activities,''
Kuttab said. ``Only after this is he permitted to see an attorney,
and only then is the attorney told what charges his client faces.''
   Abu Leban entered court with five other Arab defendants, four of
whom had no attorney present. Kuttab was able to see his client and
the charge sheet against him only minutes before the court session
began.
   Kuttab argued in court that Abu Leban signed the confession only
after being abused. He asked for, and was granted, a separate
hearing about the admissiblity of the evidence.
   Kuttab said he did not intend actually to present a case on
whether the evidence should be admitted, but only to use the extra
time to try to plea bargain a shorter sentence.
   ``If I protest, his interrogator will deny it and he will just
end up getting a tougher sentence,'' Kuttab said.
   ``What hurts most about the process is the pretense of
propriety,'' he said. ``With a judge and a prosecutor and a defense
attorney, it looks all right from the outside. But in fact, on a
certain level, I feel I am a collaborator in the evil system.''
   ``At least I brought him some cigarettes,'' Kuttab said of Abu
Leban, shaking his head as he left court. ``I've turned into a
social worker more than a lawyer in this system.''

   The fertile Missouri River bottom lands
where the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan Indians thrived for seven
centuries are gone forever, buried beneath the waters of Lake
Sakakawea.
   The 200-mile-long reservoir drove the Indians onto higher, less
productive land, sliced their reservation into isolated sections
and is blamed for precipitating soaring unemployment and alcoholism.
   The three tribes, who say they were coerced into surrendering
the bottom lands without just compensation as the lake filled
behind Garrison Dam, believe they have a chance this year to get
$178.4 million that they and a special federal commission think
they deserve.
   ``The problem has been with us for 40 years. The time is right
for a resolution,'' said Tribal Chairman Edward Lone Fight.
   The tribes, which total about 7,700 people, are asking the
state's congressional delegation to introduce legislation that
would give them $3.6 million a year for 50 years plus 4 percent
interest on the unpaid balance of the settlement.
   The money would come from federal hydropower revenues, rather
than the U.S. Treasury, which tribal leaders believe should make
the legislation more palatable to Congress.
   The bill also would fund municipal water projects on the
reservation and authorize, but not pay for, replacement of a
hospital and other facilities destroyed by the reservoir.
   Lone Fight says the bill ``is something that's supportable'' in
Congress.
   But the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs opposes further
compensation for the tribes. Rural electric cooperatives don't like
the idea of dipping into hydropower revenues. And members of the
state's congressional delegation have yet to support the bill.
   ``We hope that something can be introduced this session. But
until we can find something that everyone feels comfortable with,
nothing can be introduced,'' said Mary Jo Vrem, an aide to the
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   The tribes accepted $12.6 million from Congress in 1950, but
Garrison Dam was already built and Lake Sakakawea was forming when
the money was offered. The tribes and their supporters say the
Indians had no choice but to take the settlement.
   ``When the Indian people were negotiating for the best possible
deal, the water was up to their ankles ... and the offers were
going down,'' Lone Fight said.
   When dam construction began in the 1940s, 90 percent of the
Indians lived and farmed in the river valley, as their ancestors
had for seven centuries. Unemployment on the reservation was
negligible.
   Today, unemployment exceeds 50 percent and alcoholism is
rampant, problems that have been linked to the disruption caused by
Garrison Dam. About 3,400 Indians live on the reservation; another
4,300 tribal members live elsewhere.
   Lake Sakakawea is named for a Shoshone guide who worked for the
Lewis and Clark expedition up the Missouri River in 1804.
   ``In my 66 years, I have seen a drastic change from being
self-sufficent to being a very desperate economic situation,'' said
Luther Grinnell, a tribal judge. Grinnell grew up on a family farm
near Elbowoods, the reservation's main town before it was inundated.
   The tribes grew their own vegetables and cattle, cut firewood
from trees along the river and mined nearby coal deposits, Grinnell
said.
   ``We never heard of unemployment because everyone had their
farms, and those who had jobs didn't farm,'' Grinnell said.
   A five-member panel appointed by Interior Secretary Donald Hodel
concluded in 1986 that the tribes were owed $178 million to $412
million in compensation.
   The Joint Tribal Advisory Committee agreed with Indian claims
that the lake destroyed their self-sufficient way of life and
precipitated the tribes' continuing social problems.
   If the tribes get the settlement, the money would be earmarked
for programs, such as work projects and alcohol treatment, that
would attack the reservation's social ills, Lone Fight said.
   However, in a recent meeting with tribal leaders, Assistant
Secretary for Indian Affairs Ross Swimmer claimed that the tribes
have been adequately compensated through the federal services they
receive.
   Swimmer's position was characterized by Ray Cross, an attorney
for the tribes, as ``disingenuous.''
   Bureau of Indian Affairs officials will meet soon with members
of North Dakota's congressional delegation to discuss the tribes'
proposal, BIA spokesman Carl Shaw said.

   Enrollment is up and the debt is down at
Fisk University, where only a few years ago students shivered in
unheated dormitories because the historically black private
institution could not pay its gas bill.
   As Fisk winds down its celebration of Black History Month, which
included the dedication of a stamp honoring author James Weldon
Johnson, faculty and students also celebrated the university's
return from the brink of financial disaster.
   When the Nashville Gas Co. cut off service in early 1984 until
Fisk paid a $170,000 debt, students brought space heaters to class
and joined with faculty and staff members to raise funds to ensure
the university's survival. The overall debt mounted to $4.1
million, but classes continued.
   Henry Ponder, appointed Fisk's president in July 1984, led the
school on a course of austerity programs and aggressive
fund-raising.
   When Ponder was told, for example, that boiler repairs would
cost $350,000, he found a Fisk alumnus, a maintenance expert, who
did it for only $60,000.
   Ponder acknowledged in a recent interview that things are better
at Fisk, but added ``you have to get the public to understand that
help is still needed to get the resources to move this institution
... to the forefront of educational institutions in this country.
   ``I don't say that lightly. That's where we've been and we will
get back,'' said Ponder, who said the school did not lower its
academic standards during its financial troubles.
   Today, debt at Fisk has been reduced to $200,000 and its
endowment has reached $3.9 million. An unrestricted gift of $1.3
million by entertainer Bill Cosby in December 1986 gave the school
a boost, but officials say they have received substantial
grass-roots support, too.
   However, three of the university's 23 trustees announced Friday
that they will resign at the end of the school year. One trustee
said the resignations were related to the accountability of those
charged with day-to-day administration. Fisk's financial aid
director and assistant director were fired in December for
allegedly failing to fill out forms to receive financial aid.
   Faculty salaries have increased 30 percent over the last three
years to an average of $32,000 for a tenured professor, although
still below the $35,000 to $40,000 Ponder said is appropriate.
   Aggressive recruiting of students brought enrollment, which
dipped to 500 at one point, up to 644 students in the 1988 spring
semester, an increase of 27 percent over the 1987 spring semester,
said Harrison DeShields, director of the office of admissions and
records.
   Bryon Cobb, a student from Huntsville, Texas, said Fisk's role
in black history in America was important to him.
   ``Fisk introduced the black spiritual to the world, it was
active in the civil rights movement, W.E.B. DuBois went to college
here,'' Cobb said.
   In addition, he said, ``My understanding is that a degree from
Fisk is as respected as one from Harvard.''
   The financial crisis at the school had some positive benefits
for the Fisk community, said Roland Hayes Robinson, now a graduate
student.
   ``The student body handled the crisis well, we shared space
heaters. It united us. We were able to confront a problem and come
through it,'' Robinson sid.
   The university, founded in 1867 by the Freedmen's Bureau during
Reconstruction, is no stranger to struggle. In fact, the campus was
purchased with $150,000 raised by the college's Jubilee Singers
during a European tour in the 1870s.
   The earnings of the singers, whose tours still bring $60,000 a
year to Fisk, also paid for building Jubilee Hall, whose exterior
was recently restored with a $150,000 federal grant.
   James Weldon Johnson, a poet who was a diplomat and an early
organizer of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, was a professor at Fisk in the early 1930s. W.E.B.
DuBois, a philosopher and writer who graduated from Fisk in 1888,
also helped found the NAACP and was the first black to earn a
doctorate from Harvard.
   ``I think students are attracted here because it has the
reputation of a good community. When they get here, they find out
we have a dynamic science faculty and many of our students go to
medical and dental schools,'' Ponder said. About 60 percent of Fisk
graduates enroll for postgraduate study.
   Revais Mitchell, executive assistant to the president and a
history professor, said Fisk's financial problems mirrored those of
other liberal arts college, but were worse.
   ``In the 1960s and 1970s the philosophy of supporting a liberal
arts education dried up and the interest shifted to business
degrees,'' Mitchell said.
   But Mitchell said the quality of education at Fisk has never
suffered and that peeling paint and cold classrooms don't mean poor
academics.
   ``I try to tell my students that there has always been an
element of suffering in the tradition of black education,'' he said.

   Thousands of students marched through London
Saturday, waving banners, chanting and banging drums to protest the
government's proposed Education Reform Bill.
   Police, who closed several main roads to traffic, estimated
about 10,000 demonstrators participated but the Nationl Union of
Students put the figure at 15,000-20,000.
   At one point, some 200 students sat down for several minutes at
the entrance to 10 Downing Street, official residence of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. Police said there were no arrests
during the demonstration.
   Student leaders say Education Secretary Kenneth Baker's measure
will result in less student representation on college governing
bodies and give industrial and commercial organizations too much
influence in higher education and education for adults. Baker
claims his bill will raise standards and improve the quality of
state education.
   The bill is now before Parliament.

<HEAD>Three Mexican Nationals Convicted In Murder Of U.S. Customs Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Mexican nationals, including a former
Mexican police detective charged in the torture-murder of a U.S.
drug agent, were convicted of conspiring to murder a U.S. Customs
agent.
   The charges grew out of a series of meetings with an undercover
investigator in which defendant Raul Lopez Alvarez offered to
murder the Customs agent for a $25,000 fee. No killing took place.
   Lopez, 29, who also faces charges in the 1985 slaying of U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena, was
convicted Friday of conspiracy to murder a federal agent and
conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent.
   Two men Lopez hired in Mexico to assist him, Carlos Quintero
Maldonado, 25, and Fabian Jimenez Martinez, 22, also were convicted
in the conspiracy. Quintero was acquitted on a charge that he
traveled to the United States from Mexico to carry out the murder
plot.
   The men could receive life imprisonment. Sentencing was
scheduled for April 18 before U.S. District Judge Pamela M. Rymer.
   Lawyers for the defendants had argued that Lopez and the two men
he hired never intended to carry out the murder, but had planned
all along to stage a ``rip-off'' of the undercover drug agent with
whom they were negotiating. They believed that the undercover agent
was a narcotics dealer.
   Lopez, a former homicide investigator for the Mexican state
judicial police, told undercover agents he was an ``enforcer'' for
the powerful narcotics organization of Rafael Caro Quintero and
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and had a direct role in Camarena's
abduction and torture.
   In 12 hours of government tapes presented as evidence, Lopez
bragged about his knowledge of Camarena's torture and promised to
repeat it on the Customs agent.
   ``If it was part of a scam, they oversold it too much,'' said
jury foreman David Armas, 28, a postal worker from Alhambra.
``Especially when they talked about killing someone _ you looked at
their faces, and they showed no remorse.''
   Nine people have been indicted in the Camarena case, two of whom
will be tried with Lopez. Caro and Fonseca are jailed in Mexico
City in connection with the case. Lopez had been charged in Mexico
with the Camarena murder, but was later released.

   A man accused of attempting to sexually
assault actress Tracy Scoggins, a co-host of the Miss USA pageant
here, was rearrested Saturday after a judge's decision to set him
free on $100 bond sparked protests.
   He later was freed again after posting a much higher bond.
   The man, Pedro Concepcion Padilla, 35, of El Paso, was initially
arrested Thursday night after the assault in a hotel elevator. He
was released early Friday on $100 bond set by associate municipal
magistrate Rodolfo Romero. But the low bond infuriated State
District Judge Brunson Moore, as well as Miss Scoggins, and Moore
ordered him arrested again.
   Padilla turned himself in at 9:35 a.m. Saturday and jailed again
on $100,000 bond. He posted the required 15 percent of that amount
later in the day and was freed after spending about five hours in
custody.
   Officials said the man originally gave authorities a false name,
Antonio Garcia.
   He was re-arrested through the help of his attorney, according
to sheriff's Capt. Paco Aguirre.
   ``I'm shocked and I'm outraged,'' Miss Scoggins said Friday
after the suspect's release. ``What this says to me is that a man
like this can save himself a whole expensive night of dinner and
dancing and just pay $100 to assault the woman of his choice.
That's a pretty good deal.''
   Miss Scoggins, who starred in the ABC television series ``The
Colbys,'' suffered minor bruises during the attack. Security guards
and other guests who heard her screams came to her aid and subdued
the attacker, she said.
   If convicted, Padilla could be sentenced to up to 10 years in
prison and fined up to $5,000.
   Miss Scoggins, who lives in Malibu, Calif., is in El Paso to be
co-host of the Miss USA pageant, which will be broadcast live
Tuesday nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Reagan administration officials said Saturday
that Eric Arturo Delvalle, recognized by the United States as
Panama's president, decided on his own to go into hiding, but that
he remained in telephone contact with U.S. diplomats in Panama City.
   Delvalle is ``safe and in high spirits'' after escaping arrest,
and the struggle against the country's military leader will
continue, Delvalle's envoy to Washington said.
   The permanent council of the Organization of American States,
after a lengthy and at times heated debate Saturday night on the
situation in Panama, took no position on the turmoil there.
   Reagan administration officials denied participating in
Delvalle's escape, though they said the U.S. ambassador to Panama,
Arthur H. Davis, was in contact with Delvalle by telephone.
   They said they were not sure what Delvalle's next move would be.
   President Reagan, who usually spends weekends at Camp David,
Md., was at the White House receiving reports on the fast-moving
situation.
   The 30-member OAS council sidestepped a decision on whether to
seat as Panama's ambassador to the organization Robert Leyton, the
current envoy who is loyal to Panamanian military chief Manuel
Antonio Noriega, or Larence Chewning Fabrega, Delvalle's delegate.
There had been indications from officials of the American
delegation that the council would seat neither man, chosing instead
to recognize Soraya Cano, a Panamanian career diplomat who is a
member of the Panamanian delegation to the OAS.
   The start of the formal council debate had been delayed for five
hours while the envoys wrangled in private over the question of
whom to credential as Panama's representative.
   But when the debate commenced, shortly after 9 p.m. EST, no
resolutions were offered dealing with that sticky question.
Instead, Leyton was admitted to take part in the debate, at least
for the time being, and he launched into a tirade against the
United States, accusing it of trying to destabilize his government.
   ``I wish to somehow resolve the crisis in the government of
Panama,'' Leyton said. ``But this is not the forum.''
   Leyton steadfastly denied U.S. charges that Noriega has been
involved in drug trafficking, although the former Panamanian
ambassador to the United States, Gabriel Lewis, told the council,
``We are suffering a new phenomenon _ narco-militarism. This
narcotic militarism knows no frontier.''
   Richard T. McCormack, the U.S. ambassador to the OAS, said the
United States could not accept the decision by the Panamanian
National Assembly in which Delvalle was deposed ``in a 10-minute
rump session.''
   In a riveting moment, Lewis had OAS technicians play an
audio-cassette in which he had tape-recorded the telephone
conversation with Delvalle's wife, Mariela, as Panamanian military
personnel surrounded her house after her husband had fled.
   Mrs. Delvalle, in a trembling voice, described how she had told
the officers ``My husband isn't here, nor are you going to find
him.''
   A member of the U.S. mission, declining to be identified
publicly, indicated that a part of the problem for the OAS
ambassadors in deciding which Panamanian representative to
credential was that they had doubts about what stance they should
take. ``They're afraid of doing something which might prejudice the
position their government has taken'' on Noriega, the official said.
   Chewning said questions also had been raised about whether El
Salvador's ambassador, Ernesto Rivas Gallont, had the right to
request the special session, with some ambassadors who support
Noriega opposing it.
   Chewning said those who oppose having the issue debated in the
OAS ``simply don't want the rest of the world to know what's going
on in Panama.''
   He said the ambassadors had not allowed him or Leyton to address
the gathering.
   Jose B. Sosa, the Panamanian ambassador accredited to the U.S.
government, said in an interview on Cable News Network's
``Newsmaker Saturday'' that he was in touch with Delvalle
supporters in Panama City and ``we understand he is physically all
right, he's safe and in high spirits,''
   ``The struggle that President Delvalle is leading now is a
struggle to get the country back to civilian rule and get the
country into democratic process and that's what the Panamanian
people want,'' Sosa said. ``That's why we feel we are going to
carry the struggle, carry this fight.''
   ``The Panamanian people are going to rally behind the
constitutional president, he is going to win this out,'' Sosa said.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States had nothing to do with Delvalle's decision to leave
his house to avoid arrest, but that the Panamanian had been in
touch with Davis by telephone.
   They denied initially that the United States knew Delvalle's
whereabouts, but later in the day, when asked if U.S. officials
knew where Delvalle had gone, they said, ``he is at an undisclosed
location.''
   According to the U.S. officials' account, soldiers came to
Delvalle's house at 8 a.m. and were met at the door by Delvalle's
wife. While the soldiers were telling her they wanted to take
Delvalle, the president escaped out a back door, the officials said.
   ``It was his own decision, we did not do this,'' said one
official, when asked if the United States had participated in
Delvalle's escape.
   Several of Delvalle's family members, including several children
and grandchildren, stayed overnight at the U.S. Embassy in Panama
City, the officials said.
   The officials reaffirmed a U.S. decision to continue recognizing
Delvalle as Panama's president, despite his replacement by a
cabinet minister loyal to Noriega.
   Delvalle's flight posed a dilemma for U.S. policy-makers because
his departure for the United States or another country would remove
a key anti-Noriega symbol around which opposition to military rule
could gather.
   Administration officials said on Saturday they hoped to marshal
international support behind Delvalle's presidency, notably among
Central American nations.
   High-level meetings continued at the State Department, where
officials described the situation in Panama City as calm.
   They said the 10,000 American troops in Panama _ assigned to
protection of the Panama Canal _ were continuing to keep a low
profile.
   The United States policy toward Noriega has grown increasingly
hostile in recent months and the sentiment intensified after Feb.
5, when two federal grand juries returned indictments portraying
him as a key conspirator in an international drug trafficking
operation.
   Delvalle had been viewed by the administration as little more
than a front man for Noriega, but that all changed Thursday evening
when he broke with the military chieftain.

   Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold
turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt
won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth
Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.
   ``It's over. Back to school,'' said Thomas, who won the bronze
medal despite three faulty landings. ``I'm not going to make any
excuses. I was really skating well this week. It wasn't supposed to
happen, I guess. But I tried.''
   While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to
music from Bizet's ``Carmen,'' Manley was so sensational in the
freestyle that she finished first with seven judges. Combined with
a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the
short program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley in
second place.
   Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became the
first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold
in 1948 and '52. Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do it
before Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
   Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S.
figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly
Saturday after doing well earlier in the Games.
   By contrast, Manley had the sellout crowd at the Olympic
Saddledome enraptured. They cheered, hooted and stamped their feet
when she finished hitting every element of her program.
   Jill Trenary of Minnetonka, Minn., finished fourth. She was
fifth heading into the long program, worth 50 percent of the
overall score.
   Thomas' bronze was the third figure skating medal here for the
United States. Brian Boitano won the men's crown, and a bronze in
pairs went to Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard.
   In addition to the three figure skating medals, the U.S. team
had three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.
   Speed skater Bonnie Blair, America's only double medalist, tried
again Saturday in the 1,500 meters but finished fourth, well off
the pace. She won the gold in the 500 and the bronze in the 1,000
meters.
   As the Olympics winded up its next-to-last day, the Soviet Union
had 27 medals, including 11 golds, while East Germany in second
place had 22, including nine golds.

<TEXT>
   Amy Lynn Hardin, the infant who won the
hearts of supporters from Southern Illinois to the White House when
she became the youngest liver transplant recipient five years ago,
died Saturday at her home here.
   She was 5 years old. The transplanted liver Amy received on May
10, 1983, had begun to fail around Thanksgiving, said her mother,
Robin Hardin.
   On Dec. 11, the family took Amy to the University of Minnesota
Hospital in Minneapolis, where the transplant had been performed.
But the girl returned home Jan. 16 after doctors said her chances
for recovery were not good.
   ``She couldn't stand it anymore,'' Mrs. Hardin said. ``We made a
promise that we wouldn't take her back to the hospital. We brought
her home and the family took turns being with her.''
   ``She's at peace now,'' Mrs. Hardin said.
   People throughout the region rallied in late 1982 and early 1983
to raise more than $260,000 through a variety of fund-raisers to
pay for what then was considered an experimental transplant
operation.
   The rock group Kiss performed a benefit concert for Amy in 1983
at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis. That same year, Amy received a
letter of support from President Reagan.
   ``If it wasn't for the community getting together, we wouldn't
have had five years,'' Mrs. Hardin said. ``She was the joy of our
life. She was very strong. She fought all the way to the end.''
   Amy was 11 months old at the time of the transplant. At that
time, she was believed to be the world's youngest liver transplant
patient. That record since has been broken, said Mary Stanik, media
relations director for University of Minnesota Hospital.
   Ms. Stanik said the survival rate of most liver transplant
patients improves with time. ``Usually, but not always, doctors
like to say that you are over the hump after five years, but one
can never say never. There are just too many complications,'' she
said.
   Amy died nearly four years and 10 months after her transplant.
She would have turned 6 years old June 1.
   Besides her parents, Amy is survived by two brothers. Funeral
services were set for Monday.

   Memorial services were held Saturday
for James H. Douglas Jr., former secretary of the Air Force.
   Douglas, an attorney and investment banker, died Wednesday at
his home in this northern Chicago suburb. He was 88.
   Douglas, undersecretary and later secretary of the Air Force
under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, presided over planning and
construction of the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   Douglas is credited with persuading the Senate to approve the
design of the academy's chapel, which was controversial at the
time, but which has since been hailed as an architectural triumph.
   The Cedar Rapids, Iowa, native graduated from Princeton
University after serving as an Army officer in World War I. He
later spent a year at Cambridge University in England before
attending Harvard Law School.
   After earning his law degree in 1924, Douglas moved to Chicago.
   Douglas held a high post in the U.S. Treasury Department under
presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He returned to
the Army during World War II.
   By 1945, he was chief of staff of the Army's Air Transport
Command.
   Eisenhower appointed Douglas undersecretary of the Air Force in
1953, and secretary in 1957. In 1959, Douglas began a two-year
stint as deputy secretary of defense. He was awarded the Medal of
Freedom in 1960.
   Survivors include his wife, Elinor, four sons and nine
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   An Oklahoma State Penitentiary inmate
who had armed himself with a screwdriver and took three hostages
gave up late Saturday after he was apparently overpowered by a
hostage staff member.
   Correction Department spokesman Jerry Massie said the hostage
situation ended shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday, more than 12 hours
after it began.
   ``There was some kind of a scuffle'' inside the office where
inmate Robert Taylor was holding two prisoners and a staff
counselor, Massie said. The four men then came walking out.
   ``Everyone seems to be fine,'' Massie said. ``There appears to
be no serious problems.''
   He said the hostages, identified as prison counselor Chuck Ryden
and inmates Robert King and Allen Livingston, were taken to the
prison's medical unit to be examined for injuries.
   ``We don't know exactly what happened yet,'' Massie said. ``It
looks like the officer (Ryden) was able to overpower the inmate.''
   Taylor's only weapon was apparently a screwdriver, authorities
said.
   Linda Morgan, a public information officer at the prison, said
Taylor grabbed Ryden, a correctional counselor, at about 10:20 a.m.
after they went together to an office to discuss a problem.
   ``The other two inmates were out cleaning and painting and
entered the office to get more supplies at which time they became
hostages themselves,'' she said.
   Saturday afternoon, Taylor's request for a pitcher of tea was
granted in exchange for allowing a prison doctor to examine Ryden.
The counselor had his blood pressure checked and ``seemed fine,''
Ms. Morgan said.
   Taylor had demanded that the warden contact the governor's
office and that he be allowed to have an attorney present when he
presented his grievances. Ms. Morgan declined to say what the
grievances were, other than to say that he originally approached
the counselor with a complaint about his prison diet.
   Ms. Morgan said Taylor is serving a 15-year sentence for
second-degree burglary and had been an inmate at the prison since
1986.
   Warden James Saffle had said he wouldn't meet with Taylor or
contact the governor's office until the situation has ended, Ms.
Morgan said.
   Ms. Morgan said that approximately80 prisoners live in the cells
in the section of the prison where the incident took place, and
``all are in their cells.''
   The McAlester penitentiary was the site of an uprising in
December 1985 when inmates protesting prison conditions held seven
hostages for nearly 17 hours before releasing them unharmed. The
institution has been under a 23-hour-a-day lockdown since that
episode, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Eric Arturo Delvalle fled his house
hours after government agents warned him to leave the country, a
relative said. The deposed president later vowed from hiding
Saturday to fight any attempt to expel him.
   Delvalle slipped away on foot ``to protect himself'' _ to avoid
arrest and deportation by military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the ousted president's brother-in-law, Raul Diaz, told
reporters.
   ``I'm going to stay here and I'm going to stick it out. I'm
going to fight it all the way,'' Delvalle later told ABC News by
telephone. ``I want you to let the world to know that I'm in
Panama, that you spoke to me, that I'm not leaving anywhere.''
   He refused to disclose his whereabouts.
   The U.S. State Department also said Delvalle remained in Panama
and had been in contact with U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis.
   ABC News said it had been contacted by the ousted president, and
quoted the State Department as saying Delvalle was not at a U.S.
installation. Panama's canal zone is headquarters to the
10,000-troop U.S. Southern Command, which runs U.S. military
operations in Latin America.
   The National Assembly, with opposition lawmakers boycotting,
ousted Delvalle Friday, a day after he tried to fire Noriega as
Defense Forces chief.
   Noriega, who controls the 15,000-strong military and police and
is the power behind the civilian government, is under U.S.
indictment on drug trafficking charges and claims the United States
was behind the attempt to fire him.
   Diaz said security agents under Noriega's command had on Friday
told Delvalle to leave Panama. Delvalle refused to accept his
ouster. The United States also continued to recognize him.
   Ana Raquel Delvalle, sister of the ousted president, said family
members had visited him and found, ``He is well, calm, in a secure
place and continues carrying out his functions as president of
Panama.''
   Deposed Vice President Roderick Esquivel and his family also
dropped out of sight Saturday. Top officials of his Liberal Party
said they had talked to him by telephone, but said he would not
reveal his whereabouts out of concern for his safety.
   Esquivel was dismissed early Friday along with Delvalle.
   Meanwhile, a national strike called by the main opposition group
got off to a slow start Saturday.
   Soldiers came to Delvalle's house at 8 a.m. and were met at the
door by Delvalle's wife, Mariela. While the soldiers were telling
her they wanted to take Delvalle, the president escaped out a back
door, according to U.S. officials in Washington.
   The State Department sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Delvalle had been in telephone contact with Davis
and that members of his family were at the U.S. Embassy.
   Diplomats said they expected Noriega's government would file
criminal charges against the deposed president.
   Bereft of power, Delvalle told reporters Friday night: ``I don't
have a seat of government, nor military support, but I do have 2
million Panamanians who are tired and bored of living under a
regime that one man has governed capriciously, and because of that
I call for national resistance to paralyze the entire country
starting Monday.''
   He also urged a worldwide trade embargo against Panama.
   The opposition National Civic Crusade called an immediate
general strike. The coalition of 200 groups has been calling since
last June for the ouster of Noriega, who has run the country since
1983.
   Aurelio Barria, president of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said the Crusade hoped to ``totally paralyze'' the
nation by early next week.
   Still, most shops and other businesses were open Saturday
morning, although they traditionally close their doors at noon for
the remainder of the weekend.
   Police threw up barricades Friday and blocked the short street
in Panama City where Delvalle's modest but modern home is located,
refusing to allow Davis and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., to visit
Delvalle.
   Other policemen could be seen in the front yard of the small
house.
   At noon Saturday, the barricades where withdrawn. Diaz then came
out and spoke to reporters.
   Diaz said a police officer called at the Delvalle home Saturday
morning and told family members the former president should leave
Panama.
   Later, he said security agents had also contacted Delvalle
Friday, warning him to leave the country.
   The United States has called for Noriega's removal since he was
indicted in Florida on Feb. 5 on drug trafficking charges. The
indictment says Noriega allegedly let Colombian narcotics
traffickers use Panama as a base for smuggling cocaine and
marijuana into the United States, receiving kickbacks from drug
profits.
   Noriega has blamed protests that began last summer and the
indictment on efforts by U.S. conservatives to prevent transfer of
the Panama Canal to this country by the end of 1999.
   American military personnel in Panama were on alert and
civilians were told to keep a low profile.

<HEAD>Life Support Pulled From Texas Infant With Almost No Brain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas infant born with almost no
brain was taken off life-support equipment that was intended to
help preserve her tiny heart and other organs for transplantation,
a doctor said Saturday.
   ``Baby Evelyn continues to breathe on her own, but shows signs
of gradual deterioration,'' Dr. Joyce Peabody, chief of neonatology
at Loma Linda University Medical Center, said in a statement late
Saturday.
   Evelyn Keys was born with a fatal genetic birth defect known as
anencephaly, in which much of the upper brain and skull are
missing. Loma Linda has developed the nation's first guidelines
using such infants as organ donors.
   However, little Evelyn never met the hospital's criteria for
brain-death since she was born seven days ago, and machine-assisted
breathing was stopped Saturday, with her parents' consent, Peabody
said.
   Although three newborns needing healthy livers had been
identified during the week, the likelihood of a vital organ
transplant dropped to nil, hospital spokesman Anita Rockwell said.
   Baby Evelyn will be allowed to die naturally, she said.
   ``It is highly unlikely that she will be able to donate organs
such as liver and heart, because without continuation of assisted
breathing, oxygen deprivation of these organs will occur prior to
her death,'' Ms. Rockwell said.
   Details about the potential liver recipients weren't disclosed,
but Ms. Rockwell said they weren't at Loma Linda.
   Evelyn was born Feb. 20 in San Antonio, Texas, to Judy Keys, 22,
and Airman Todd Keys, 21, stationed at Lackland Air Force Base. The
infant was flown to Loma Linda that same day to be used in the
donor program.
   Anencephalic babies usually die within days after birth.
   Loma Linda, a pioneer in infant heart transplants, has sought to
establish a practice of sustaining anencephalic babies so vital
organs can be used after brain death is certified by two
independent physicians. Under the hospital's rules, however, no
baby is kept on life-support longer than a week, whether brain
death has occurred during that time or not.
   Loma Linda doctors anticipate that Baby Evelyn's heart valves,
and perhaps corneas will be donated after her heart stops, Ms.
Rockwell said.
   The same day Evelyn was born, another anencephalic baby,
identified only as Baby John, died at Loma Linda after efforts find
a suitable liver or heart recipient were unsuccessful. He had been
declared brain dead two days earlier. In his case, doctors were
able to use a heart valve after he died.

<HEAD>Wanted Sikh Militant Killed In Gunfight With Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHANDIGARH, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sikh extremist wanted in the 1986
murder of former army chief Arun S. Vaidya was killed Saturday in a
gunbattle with police, the United News of India reported.
   The news agency quoted Punjab state police chief J. F. Ribeiro
as saying Surindra Singh was killed after he was challenged by a
police patrol in Chandigarh, the state capital.
   One of the militant's accomplices, identified as Harjinder
Singh, was also killed while another was injured, Ribeiro said.
   Surindra Singh is one of the more than 20 militants believed to
be involved in the Aug. 10, 1986 assassination of Vaidya in Pune,
in western India. Two others, Ranjit Singh Gill and Sukhminder
Singh, were arrested in New Jersey last year and are facing
extradition proceedings.
   Another eight suspects have been arrested in India.
   Vaidya was the army chief when soldiers stormed the Golden
Temple in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in 1984 to dislodge Sikh
extremists who were using it as a base. Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards later in the
year.
   Meanwhile, police in Amritsar, 130 miles northwest of
Chandigarh, blamed Sikh extremists for the killing of seven members
of a Sikh family in a nearby village.
   Amritsar District police chief Izhar Alam said the family was
slain Friday night by six Sikhs armed with automatic rifles. The
killings occurred in Talwandi Chamchuk village, 25 miles west of
Amritsar.
   UNI quoted unnamed police sources as saying the family
apparently refused to pay extortion money to the Khalistan
Liberation Force, one of several Sikh militant groups active in
Punjab.
   In other militant-related violence in the state, a Hindu
policeman was killed by Sikh radicals early Saturday near the town
of Ludhiana in central Punjab, police said.
   The killings raised to at least 304 the numkber of people killed
this year in attacks blamed on Sikh militants. Nearly two-thirds of
the victims have been Sikhs.
   Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1983 for a
separate state in Punjab, which they propose to call Khalistan.
   Last year, more than 1,000 people were killed in Punjab by the
militants.
   Sikhs, whose religion is an offshoot of Hinduism, claim they are
discriminated against by India's Hindu majority. Sikhs comprise
about 2 percent of India's 800 million population but are a
majority in Punjab.

Occupied Lands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ABUD, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab reports said Israeli
soldiers opened fire to quell riots sparked by Jewish settlers who
tried to enter a West Bank village at night. The army on Sunday
confirmed two Arabs were shot to death.
   Meanwhile, Israel's navy sank a boat carrying guerrillas who
were en route from Lebanon to launch an attack on Israel. Lebanese
police said two Palestinian fighters were killed in the incident
Saturday night and three swam to shore.
   Also, three Arab guerrillas were killed in southern Lebanon
early Sunday after they stormed an outpost of pro-Israeli Lebanese
militiamen in Beit Yaoun near Israel's border, the army said.
   The violence came as Secretary of State George P. Shultz arrived
in Cairo for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, continuing his
efforts aimed at starting Arab-Israeli peace talks and helping
restore calm in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But the bloodshed has increased since he arrived Thursday on the
five-day mission. At least 11 Palestinians have been killed and
dozens more wounded in the occupied lands in the period.
   Israel's 24-member Cabinet debated the violence on Sunday, and
Israel radio said Transportation Minister Chaim Corfu proposed
closing the West Bank and Gaza to media coverage. No decision was
reported on the issue.
   Israeli soldiers on Sunday sealed the West Bank village of Abud,
20 miles northwest of Jerusalem, where the two Arabs were killed
Saturday night. They twice turned away a reporter who tried to talk
to witnesses.
   Army spokesmen said the shootings were being investigated.
   The Arab-run Palestinian Press Service said Jewish settlers had
tried to enter the village after nightfall and were turned away by
the 3,000 residents.
   Soldiers arrived about 8 p.m. and clashed with villagers who
hurled stones. They fired flares to provide light and later opened
fire with live ammunition, the agency said.
   Israel radio said Arab demonstrators blocked a main highway
outside the village and stoned Israeli soldiers. It said a number
of Jewish settlers also arrived on the scene. Shots were fired, and
the army was investigating the source of the gunfire, Israel radio
added.
   The Palestine Press identified the two dead as Raed Mahmoud Awad
Barghouti, 17, who was shot in the head, and Ahmed Ibrahim Mustafa
al Barghouti, 22, who was wounded in the stomach.
   The deaths brought to 74 the number of Arabs killed by Israeli
gunfire and beatings since anti-occupation rioting erupted Dec. 8,
according to U.N. figures. Hundreds more have been wounded.
   Before flying to Cairo, Shultz met separately with Shamir and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who told reporters the negotiations
were complicated ``but not hopeless'' despite rejections by Jordan
and Syria on Saturday.
   ``Nothing is dead, and nothing is at a dead end. It is a very
complicated issue. It may take time,'' Peres said.
   Shultz' peace plan envisions accelerationg negotiations on
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel
seized in the 1967 Middle East war, with the eventual goal of
trading land for peace with the Arabs.
   Jordanian and Syrian leaders told Shultz any peace talks would
have to include the participation of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in an international conference. Israel does not
recognize the PLO.

   If you care more about fishing than
living, come to Muskegon.
   Muskegon was second to last in Money magazine's ranking of
places to live in the United States.
   But Field and Stream magazine's special edition, the ``1988
Guide to the Best in Freshwater Sport,'' lists Muskegon Lake and
the Muskegon River together as one of the ``25 Favorite Fishing
Trips for '88.''
   The special edition, which won't go on sale until April, offers
anglers tips and tactics for taking big fish.
   ``Bass (largemouths and smallmouths) and walleyes are two
gamefish species anglers will find in particularly good supply on
Muskegon Lake,'' the article says. ``The Muskegon River ...
features one of the finest river fisheries in the state.''
   An article in the July 1987 issue of Money magazine put
Muskegon, a city of about 40,000 on the western side of Michigan's
Lower Penninsula, next to last among the ten worst cities to live
in the country.
   Most vacationing anglers come to Muskegon after salmon,
steelhead, bass and walleye, Field and Stream says.
   Walleye _ and Muskegon Lake's reputation as a trophy spot for
them _ are fast approaching salmon as the area's top tourist draw,
it adds.
   The Manufacturers Walleye Council, a group of touring
professional anglers, has chosen Muskegon Lake as the site for its
final regular-season points tournament for 1988.
   As many as 200 two-person teams will pay $200 each to vie for
the $7,000 first prize in the Aug. 27-28 tourney, which offers a
purse of $32,000.
   Muskegon professional walleye guide Mark Martin said that last
year he took more than 60 walleyes weighing more than 9 pounds.

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Bishop Donald Wuerl says U.S.
Catholics should help pay the Vatican's $56.7 million operating
deficit.
   Wuerl, named head of the Diocese of Pittsburgh on Feb. 12, said
the deficit was created when Pope John Paul II ``raised salaries
substantially,'' to help employees keep up with the cost of living.
   ``How do we pay for this?'' he said Friday. ``In the past we
have always said to the pope, ``Good Luck.'''
   Considering the size of the church, the deficit is not a large
one and could be paid off with an endowment, Wuerl said.
   Details of the 1986 deficit were made public at the insistence
of U.S. bishops. Wuerl said the bishops told Vatican officials that
Americans must ``see balance sheets'' before they would help pay.
   The bishop also said the Vatican's administration costs have
increased considerably since 1965, when reforms by the Second
Vatican Council added commissions, secretariats and other boards.
Church officials also have increased their missionary work, he said.

   Wayne County has gone to court seeking an order
to seize profit-sharing checks for Ford Motor Co. employees who are
behind in child support payments.
   The suit, filed Friday, would force the company to withhold
profit-sharing checks, averaging about $3,700 per worker, for 3,369
employees who are more than $500 behind in payments.
   The checks are to be handed out March 8.
   ``If we learn of any payments to potential child support payers
who are in arrears, we are going to make every effort to get the
portion that the custodial parents are entitled to,'' said Wayne
County Circuit Court Administrator W. Kent Batty.
   Ford spokeswoman Kim Adler said the company could not withhold
the checks without a court order.
   Circuit Judge Richard Kaufman has scheduled a hearing for
Tuesday on the suit.

<HEAD>Congress Faces New Battle on Contra Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress faces a confusing choice this week
between two rival versions of a plan to help the Nicaraguan rebels.
   A vote is scheduled for Thursday to decide whether the
U.S.-backed Contras will get an aid package drafted by House
Democrats, a similar one drawn up by House Republicans, or nothing
at all.
   Current authority to aid the Contras expires at midnight Monday,
and the rebels are said to be rapidly running out of items like
food, clothing and medicine that the new aid plans would provide.
   Both versions of the new aid package would keep non-lethal
supplies flowing to the rebels at their positions inside Nicaraguan
territory. Neither would provide new weapons. And both would set up
a $14 million program to help war-injured children on all sides of
the conflict.
   But while similar in what they would do for the rebels in the
short term, the two versions set starkly different ground rules for
an impending rematch between the Reagan administration and the
Democratic Congress over military aid for the rebels.
   The Democratic version, which House leaders say they are
confident will pass, holds out the possbility that a new military
aid package could be considered sometime after June 1.
   But the conditions for such consideration are strict: it could
happen only if the Democrat-controlled House Intelligence Committee
certifies that the Contras and the leftist Sandinista government
have not reached a cease-fire and that it is the Sandinistas' fault.
   Then, the proposal would allow _ but not require _ the party's
leadership to bring forth an aid proposal of its own design, and
would allow amendment of the package on the floor.
   The GOP aid proposal would give the president, rather than
Congress, the right to design the military aid package, and would
leave to him the determination whether a cease-fire is in effect,
and whether any failure to reach a truce is the fault of the
Sandinista regime.
   Reagan could make such a request as soon as April 16, and it
would have to be acted on by Congress without delay.
   A similar expedited procedure was followed when the House on
Feb. 3 rejected Reagan's previous aid request, which included
weapons and other military supplies, by a vote of 219 to 211.
   Another difference between the two packages is that the GOP
version would leave authority to deliver the aid in the hands of
the Central Intelligence Agency, which has been supervising a
fairly successful airdrop program.
   Democrats, many of whom are suspicious of the spy agency, would
turn the delivery program over to the Pentagon to supervise,
keeping the same private contractors, planes and crews now doing
the work.
   The showdown over the two competing aid packages was supposed to
have occured last week, but Democrats postponed action at the last
minute, citing confusion among lawmakers over the differences
between the two bills. Republicans said the real reason for the
delay was that the majority feared it was losing supporters to
their competing version.
   Part of the difficulty Democrats have faced is division among
outside peace groups which lobbied hard to defeat Reagan's military
aid proposal earlier this month and were reluctant to now turn
around and support a Contra aid package, no matter how
``humanitarian'' its terms.
   Some groups, including Presbyterians, Lutherans, Quakers and
Catholics, were supporting the Democratic package in hopes it would
lessen the pressure for a future request for Contra weapons.
   But representatives of the Unitarian, Methodist, American
Baptist and Brethren churches wrote lawmakers last week that ``we
believe it is important that no aid in any form be provided that
would assist the Contras in maintaining an armed force to wage war
against the government and the people of Nicaragua.''
   House leaders were meeting with such outside groups to try to
persuade them to unite behind the Democratic proposal before
Thursday's vote, and Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., a supporter the
party's package, expressed impatience with the groups'
all-or-nothing approach.
   ``Any theology student will tell you the first thing you learn
is that the greatest enemy of morality is moralism,'' Obey said.
``If your goal is to save lives and wind the war down, then you
have to have tactics and strategy as well as good wishes. I wish
liberals could count (votes) as well as they can feel.''

   Fad health diets and ``marketplace gimmickry''
are giving Americans a distorted view of the type and amount of
foods needed to help prevent chronic disease, according to a
Cornell University professor.
   In a paper prepared for congressional testimony on Tuesday, T.
Colin Campbell said isolated studies, taken out of context and
promoted by special economic interests, often trigger changes in
the American diet that may actually be harmful.
   ``Too many Americans believe in magic bullets. Too many
corporations believe in profit-rich products with very specific
health claims,'' said Campbell.
   Such ``marketplace gimmickry,'' he said, does not help Americans
avoid the so-called ``diseases of affluence'' of osteoporosis and
heart attack.
   In a paper prepared for the Senate governmental affairs
committee, Campbell recommended that the government establish a
national research center to collect and analyze nutrition
information so Americans can receive more accurate information on
diet and health.
   Campbell directed a massive study of the diet and lifestyle of
6,500 persons in 130 locations in the People's Republic of China in
an effort to determine how nutrition affects such diseases as
cancer and heart attack.
   He said the study is not yet finished, but results so far cast
doubt on some of the popular American beliefs about nutrition and
health.
   Among his observations:
   _American studies have shown that a serum cholesterol reading of
180 milligrams per decaliter can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Yet, another U.S. study showed that a reduction in cholesterol
raises the risk of colon cancer. Campbell said that in China, the
cholesterol levels are far below the typical American level, and
the incidence of colon cancer also is low. This shows, he said,
that the study showing an increase in colon cancer with lower
cholesterol ``is an experimental aberration.''
   _Excess calories may not be the sole cause of obesity, Campbell
said. He said the Chinese consume about 20 percent more calories
than do Americans, yet obesity is rare among the Chinese. He said
Chinese average only about 15 percent of their calories in the form
of fat _ far below the typical American.
   _Some American studies have suggested that an increase in fiber
in the diet may lead to a loss of minerals. Campbell said the
Chinese consume about 34 grams of fiber per day, versus about 10
grams for most Americans, and yet the Chinese show healthy levels
of iron, zinc and magnesium, all important minerals.

   About 1,000 people, trying to buck the Chinese
system of assigned jobs for life, gathered Sunday at the opening of
Beijing's first citywide labor market.
   A mostly young crowd, bundled up in heavy greatcoats, peered at
job description posters lining the street and discussed work
opportunities with representatives of 22 factories and companies
who manned desks inside the ``Labor Exchange Center.''
   The center, said deputy chief Zhao Fenyong, was set up by the
city Labor Bureau to carry out the government policy of allowing
people to find jobs more suitable to their needs and skills.
   Those who pay a fee of 27 cents will have their names placed on
the center's computerized list and receive help in finding a new
job, he said.
   Liu Wanxin, of the Tienma Service Co., which supplies tourist
items to department stores, said many people want to find new work
closer to their homes.
   ``Others just don't like their present jobs,'' he said, adding
that his company found seven prospective new employees Sunday
morning.
   Li Hongjun, 34, said she was applying for a job with a Beijing
wine company because it has night shifts, allowing her to care for
a sick sister during the day. She said she could also take a bus to
the winery, rather than commute by bicycle as she does to her
current job.
   A personnel officer at Qinghua University, which is looking for
nine cooks, electricians, drivers and other workers, said factory
workers are attracted to the school's long summer and winter
holidays. Many, said Wang Jingxiang, also want their children to
attend the excellent kindergarten and primary schools run by the
university.
   Since the 1949 communist takeover, Chinese have had little
choice in determining their career.
   Under a system known as ``fen pei,'' Chinese were assigned a job
for life from which they could not be fired, but neither could they
leave.
   High school and elementary school graduates were assigned work
in local businesses or, if they come from the countryside, were
generally returned to the land to farm with the rest of their
family.
   College graduates, a scarce resource here, were sent anywhere in
the country that needed them. A student, majoring in English
literature at prestigious Beijing University, could, for example,
wind up in barren Qinghai province, teaching English to barely
literate peasants.
   But in recent years, cracks have appeared in China's ``iron rice
bowl'' as the country has sought to speed its economic development.
   The Chinese government has recognized that its traditional labor
system has deadened worker creativity and kept workers from fully
using their talents.
   It also has split families, especially those of the educated
classes. Indeed, it is not unusual for couples with college
educations to be assigned jobs in different provinces, thousands of
miles away from one another.
   As a result, China has begun loosening restrictions on
job-hopping and encouraging the 20 million people who have gone off
on their own to set up small private businesses.
   However, the work units to which each Chinese is assigned still
regard employees as the property of the unit and often refuse a job
transfer or exact compensation for the loss of a worker.
   Engineers, scientists and other trained people in particular
have had difficulty leaving their old jobs because of their value
to the work unit.
   That creates the ironic condition that the better one does one's
job here, the less of a chance one has to leave it for something
better.
   ``It's true that if a person has a position of responsibility it
will be more difficult for him to change jobs,'' said the center's
Zhao. ``But if his work unit refuses to let him go, we will do what
we can to help, including assist in finding a replacement.''
   Similar labor markets have appeared at the city district level
in Beijing, but the center that opened Sunday is the first to cover
the entire city.
   Illegal work markets have also sprung up in Beijing and in
several other Chinese cities. Their purpose generally is not to
help employed people find a new job, but to help unemployed
peasants enter the urban labor force, allowing them to abandon the
difficult life in China's countryside.
   Zhao said the city-wide labor market will also stay open in the
evenings and on Sundays to accommodate people who have difficulty
getting away from their jobs to look for new ones.

<HEAD>Bishop Of Shanghai In China's Independent Catholic Church Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louis Zhang Jiashu, bishop of Shanghai under
China's independent Catholic Church, has died at the age of 96, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.
   Mass was said Saturday for Zhang, who died Thursday, at the
Xujiahui Cathedral in Shanghai, the city's largest, the agency said.
   Among those attending where Zong Huaide, bishop of Jinan diocese
and chairman of the China Patriotic Catholic Association.
   The ``Patriotic'' Catholic Church in China broke with the
Vatican in 1957 after accusing Rome of interfering in China's
internal affairs. The church claims more than 3 million followers
in China.
   Xinhua said Zhang studied in Britain and France for 10 years
before returning to China in 1924. In 1960, he was elected bishop
of the Shanghai diocese, which has an estimated 100,000
parishioners and about 20 churches.
   The report said he was vice chairman of the China Patriotic
Catholic Association, director of the National Administrative
Commission of the Catholic Church and a member of the standing
committee of the national committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
   Shanghai's more famous bishop is Ignatius Kung, who was
imprisoned for 30 years on treason charges stemming from his
refusal to sever his ties with the Vatican. When Kung, then 84, was
released in 1985, he went to see Zhang, kissed his ring and
promised to act under his guidance.

<HEAD>Roman Amphitheater Found In London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists said Sunday they discovered the
remains of a Roman amphitheater 15 feet below London's financial
district in one of the most important finds in Britain this century.
   Historians had been looking for London's amphitheater for 300
years. Amphitheaters were used for weapons training and military
parades, as well as fights with animals and gladiatorial combat.
   Archaeologists from the Museum of London uncovered the eastern
end of the amphitheater's stone walls during excavations going on
since last July, said John Maloney, the museum's excavations
officer, in an interview with The Observer weekly.
   The Corporation of London, which administers London City, gave
the museum $176,000 to dig on the site next to the medieval
Guildhall, where the corporation meets.
   An art gallery and an office building has been planned for the
amphitheater's site.
   The Observer reported that the corporation will talk with the
archaeologists and architects this week to discuss preservation of
the uncovered amphitheater remains.
   A clash could develop if the corporation wants to rebury the
site and proceed with the art gallery and offices, The Observer
said.
   London was founded by the Romans, who called it Londinium. The
Romans stayed in Britain from A.D. 43 to 410.
   The excavators think the amphitheater was built between A.D. 70
and 140, during the heyday of Roman London.
   Corroded coins found on the site may help to date the ruin more
exactly.
   The center of the amphitheater is under the open courtyard in
front of Guildhall. Almost all the area where the seats and walls
would have been is under Guildhall itself, the art gallery site and
neighboring buildings.
   The excavators say the amphitheater was oval shaped, 100 yards
from east to west and 80 yards north to south.
   That is small compared with Roman amphitheaters found in
southern France and Italy, but about the same size as four others
in England _ at Cirencester, Chester, Chichester and Silchester.

<HEAD>India to Halt Military Operations for 48 Hours</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India will halt its military
operations in eastern Sri Lanka for 48 hours because it wants to
persuade two Tamil women to give up a death fast, a senior Sri
Lankan government official said Sunday.
   The women, Anamma David and Nesamma Vadivel, have been fasting
inside a Hindu temple in eastern Batticaloa city for the past nine
days and are reported to be in a serious condition.
   The women have threatened to commit suicide unless India
declares a cease-fire and Tamil separatists agree to discuss a
settlement in their five-year civil war with the majority Sinhalese.
   A statement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most
powerful rebel group, meanwhile, said it was prepared for
``unconditional talks'' with the Indian government.
   The Tamil statement, issued in the southern Indian city of
Madras and addressed to the fasting women, said ``We accept your
appeal in toto and with immediate effect.''
   There was no immediate reaction from the Indian government.
   The Sri Lankan government official, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said the halt in Indian military operations in the
east would go into effect at midnight Sunday.
   A spokeswoman of the Indian High Commission said she had no
information on the cease-fire but added that India had scaled down
operations since the beginning of February.
   More than 45,000 Indian peacekeeping troops are battling Tamil
militants in northern and eastern Sri Lanka to enforce an
Indian-sponsored peace pact.
   The pact was signed last July to end the Tamil separatist war in
the island nation but it has been rejected by the Tigers.
   The peace accord grants some autonomy to Tamil-dominated areas
in the northern and eastern provinces, but Tamil rebels want a
separate nation.
   Jyotindra Nath Dixit, the Indian High Commissioner, last week
appealed to the Tamil women to give up their fast. He said they
were being used and ``instigated'' by the rebels to pressure India.
   Dixit said the Tamil Tigers had the habit of using old women to
fight their battles.
   The Sri Lankan official said arrangements had been made by both
governments to halt the offensive and save the lives of the women.
He said that efforts also were underway to contact Tiger Leader
Velupillai Prabhakaran to persuade him to begin negotiations.
   ``His response is awaited. This is a joint Indo-Lankan move and
it is part of the contacts both governments have been making with
the Tigers,'' he said.
   President Junius R. Jayewardene on Sunday reiterated his general
amnesty offer to both Tamil and Sinhalese extremists, who have
opposed the peace accord.
   ``I am prepared to grant all terrorists amnesty provided they
give up violence,'' he said at the opening ceremony of a pagoda at
Ampara, 126 miles east of Colombo.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They say they are discriminated against by the
Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and the army.
   India, predominantly Hindu, intervened in the conflict largely
under pressure from its own large Tamil minority.

<HEAD>Native Taiwanese Rally To Mark Anniversary Of Riots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Taiwanese rallied peacefully
Sunday to mark the 41st anniversary of anti-government riots and a
crackdown that left an estimated 20,000 dead.
   ``The Nationalist government owes an apology to relatives of
tens of thousands of victims'' of the crackdown, said Chen
Yong-shing, a doctor and activitist who chaired the Peace Day
Committee that planned the memorial.
   Chen told 500 people at a church service in Taipei that the
riots were ``painful history that cannot be forgotten or
covered.''Similar church services were held in three other cities.
   Demonstrators carried banners and listened to speeches by human
rights activists to mark Feb. 28, 1947, when thousands of native
Taiwanese rioted against the fledgling Nationalist government.
Researchers estimate that 20,000 died when the government
suppressed the riots.
   Taiwan came under Nationalist administration at the end of World
War II, when Japan relinquished its 50-year rule of the island
nation between the East and South China seas.
   The country is controlled by the remnants of the Nationalist
government that fled mainland China in 1949 after losing the civil
war to the communists.
   Opposition lawmakers have urged the government to include the
riots in school textbooks.
   In Tainan, 202 miles south of Taipei, about 2,000 members of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party staged a two-hour march,
said party official Chang Kuo-tang in a telephone interview.
   Protesters demanded official condolences to victims of the
riots, Chang said. He said demonstrators would place more than
2,000 floating lanterns on a canals to commemorate the victims.
   President Lee Teng-hui criticized dissidents at a press
conference Monday for using the 1947 riots to ``incite the
public.'' He said it is ``against the principle of love to
repeatedly make the tragedy an annual topic.''
   Lee, the first native Taiwanese to become president, urged the
citizenry to leave the incident to historians and ``remove the dark
shadows from your mind. Have confidence in your country.''
   Experts, however, say the deep divisions are fading with time.
   ``The tension has subdued significantly, especially during the
recent years when the government loosened its political controls,''
said Lai Tse-han, professor of history at the National Normal
University.
   The government has lifted 38 years of martial law and a ban on
new newspapers as part of its move toward democratic reforms.
   Last year, about 13,000 people rallied to mark the anniversary
openly for the first time.
   Researchers say the 1947 rioting occurred after a group of
Taiwanese demonstrated in Taipei to protest Nationalist agents who
confiscated money and belongings of a woman selling untaxed
cigarettes. The Nationalists fired on the crowd and killed a man in
the incident.
   The shooting touched off a series of riots across the island and
the subsequent response by the government.

<HEAD>Justice Changes Account Of Meese's Role In Israeli Spy Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nine months, the Justice Department has
given the impression Attorney General Edwin Meese removed himself
from the Pollard spy case. But now it acknowledges he was briefed
twice about the case and it says he never was excluded.
   In what chief department spokesman Terry Eastland called a
correction, he said Meese is only excluded from the espionage case
against the Israeli Air Force officer who recruited Navy
counterterrorism analyst Jonathan Pollard as a spy.
   Meese is free to be briefed and even to make decisions in the
still-open Pollard case to the extent that they don't involve the
case against Israeli Brig. Gen. Aviem Sella, Eastland said.
   Meese's own lawyer, Nathan Lewin, was unaware of that
distinction as recently as last week even though it was Lewin's
work for Meese and Sella in separate cases that triggered the
exclusion, known as a recusal.
   The turnabout comes as a government source said independent
counsel James McKay is examining another Meese recusal for clues
about his motives in dealing with a Mideast oil pipeline proposal
in 1985.
   Meese hired Lewin last May to represent him in McKay's
investigation of whether the attorney general and his attorney, E.
Robert Wallach, violated or conspired to violate a federal law
barring bribes to foreign officials.
   In May 1985, Meese was recused from all matters involving
Wallach, but arranged for Wallach to meet National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane to promote the pipeline. Investigators say that
examining that Meese recusal might help determine whether the
attorney general was aiding Wallach's plan or, as Lewin argues,
directing it to the proper official.
   At the Office of Government Ethics last week, General Counsel
Donald Campbell explained: ``If you're a federal official and
you've hired a law firm to represent you, you should recuse
yourself, that is, take no action in any matter involving that firm
_ just as a matter of appearances even if you have no financial
stake.''
   For that reason, Eastland said, Meese advised Justice officials
last May: ``I hereby recuse myself from participating in any matter
before the department in which the law firm (of Miller, Cassidy,
Larroca & Lewin) represents any party or is otherwise involved.''
   The Washington Post reported then that the recusal covered the
Pollard affair. The Justice Department did not dispute that.
   Pollard was sentenced last year to life in prison for giving
reams of secrets to Israeli agents. But Justice officials still
pursued the case, in part, because Sella had fled to Israel and has
not been brought to trial here.
   So there was surprise and consternation when the Post reported
Feb. 19: ``After being briefed on the case last month, ... Meese
ordered that the Pollard case be kept officially open so
investigators can pursue their inquiry.''
   Asked by The Associated Press last Monday for an explanation,
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said, ``I have problems
with that account because Meese is recused in Pollard.''
   Russell bucked the question to deputy chief spokesman Pat
Korten. Citing the same problem, Korten bucked it to Eastland, who
was with Meese in California until Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, Lewin said he'd never discussed Pollard with Meese
because ``I think he certainly has recused himself because I am
representing Sella.'' Expressing surprise at the Post account,
Lewin said, ``At the department, they have known all along that it
has been very much up front that he is not involved in Pollard.''
   While Eastland sought an answer, a senior department official,
demanding anonymity, said Wednesday there was no problem because
Meese was merely briefed and made no decisions.
   Some former department lawyers dispute that view. One, who once
worked in the attorney general's office, said, ``A recusal has
always meant a Chinese wall. You are not even kept up to date.''
   A former Justice career lawyer said that, to avoid making a
decision by ``a wink or a nod,'' briefings were restricted to
situations where the information was essential to decisions in
other areas.
   But Friday afternoon, Eastland provided an official explanation
that did not claim an exception for briefings.
   He said the client lists regularly provided by Lewin's firm
``have not included the Pollard case, and so the attorney general
is not recused from Pollard.''
   ``The lists do include the Sella case, and the attorney general
has been very careful to avoid taking any action in that case or in
any other related case where his action might at all affect the
Sella case.''
   Eastland denied Meese kept the Pollard case open. ``He didn't
have to, because it has been open for some time.''
   Eastland acknowledged that last month and on one previously
undisclosed occasion Assistant Attorney General William Weld, head
of the criminal division, had briefed Meese about the Pollard case
``without touching on Sella.''
   Why the turnabout? ``We were confused about the Sella case,''
Eastland said. ``It was an honest error.''

<HEAD>Gephardt Hopes TV Ads Will Provide Super Tuesday Boost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt moves into Super Tuesday
territory with an extraordinarily effective television advertising
campaign that touched raw nerves and won last-minute support among
voters in earlier Democratic presidential contests.
   While critics complain that Gephardt's populist image is an
insider's affectation and his hard-hitting ``Hyundai'' trade ad is
based on bad numbers, there's little disagreement about the impact
of the Missouri congressman's TV campaign.
   The forceful spots, created by political veterans David Doak and
Robert Shrum, are credited with putting Gephardt over the top in
Iowa and South Dakota and enabling him to stop a New Hampshire
slide that could have jostled him out of the second place finish he
needed and got.
   ``Gephardt is the only candidate who struck a chord, and I
suppose he struck it through his TV ads more than anything else,''
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia professor with a
personal collection of 1,600 political video ads.
   ``He had a different message,'' said Gene Mahan, chairman of the
Democratic Party in South Dakota, where Gephardt won his most
recent victory. ``The economy is not good out here. Gephardt
related to a lot of people on that. He was talking to the working
people.''
   In the course of his campaign, Gephardt has used a biographical
spot, folksy ads boosting the family farm, patriotic ads asking
voters to restore America's soul, trade ads promoting his
hard-nosed views, testimonials from other politicians, and negative
ads criticizing his Democratic rivals.
   Most of the spots are accompanying him South this week in
preparation for the Super Tuesday contests on March 8, along with
new commercials a campaign spokeswoman said she could not discuss.
Some ads began over the weekend in Texas; others begin Monday in
states including Florida, Oklahoma, Arkansas, North Carolina,
Georgia and Alabama.
   Undecided voters flocked to Gephardt during the last few days
before the Feb. 23 South Dakota primary, a development analysts are
attributing largely to an aggressive TV campaign against
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   The ad was called ``Belgian'' _ a reference to Belgian endive,
which a naive Dukakis used at the outset of his campaign as an
example of how Iowa farmers could diversify their crops.
   A narrator in the Gephardt ad cites the endive recommendation,
contrasts Dukakis' trade and farm positions unfavorably with
Gephardt's, and calls the governor ``one of the biggest tax raisers
in Massachusetts history.'' In a version designed for possible use
in Super Tuesday states, the narrator concludes: ``Those are some
of the reasons why Southerners are for Gephardt, not Dukakis.''
Pause, then, with dripping sarcasm, ``Belgian endive?''
   ``People don't really like negative advertising, but you'd have
to say it works,'' said Mahan. ``Where Dukakis made his mistake was
in not responding back to him. He just let it sit there.''
   Gephardt's main television weapon in the Feb. 8 Iowa caucuses
was his controversial ``Hyundai'' ad _ 30 seconds of soothing music
taking the edge off a sharp message.
   ``Because of trade barriers, a $10,000 Chrysler K-car costs
$48,000 in Korea,'' Gephardt says as scenes from an auto assembly
plant fill the screen.
   The clean-cut candidate appears onscreen in white shirt, tie and
black overcoat to conclude his message. If the Koreans won't change
their ways, he says, they'll be ``left asking themselves how many
Americans are going to pay $48,000 for one of their Hyundais.''
   Trade experts say the ad is erroneous. They also complain that
it oversimplifies a very complicated issue, but that is precisely
why it works.
   ``It's more in the realm of people's thinking,'' said Phil
Roeder, a spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party. ``It was a good
example for Gephardt to use and it obviously worked here. As far as
what the actual cost might be, in Iowa that's irrelevant because
the caucuses are over.''
   One reason the Hyundai ad and a hay-filled farming ad appeared
to reap such dramatic results for Gephardt was that they built on
the type of grass-roots organization impossible to recreate across
the vast Super Tuesday landscape.
   Gephardt, for example, had worked Iowa exhaustively for more
than a year, spending hundreds of days there, meeting thousands of
activists, shaking countless hands, spending innumerable hours on
the telephone. He was no stranger by the time his ads went on
television after Christmas.
   ``His TV spots would not have had an impact had it not been for
his foundation out here,'' said Roeder. ``It's only at the end that
TV mattered and had any sort of impact at all.''

   President George Vassiliou ushered in his
administration Sunday by promising to seek direct talks with Turkey
to unify this island, split between Turkish and Greek Cypriots for
14 years.
   Vassiliou, leader of 500,000 Greek Cypriots, said shortly after
taking the oath of office that he would pursue a meeting with
Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Oza ``as soon as possible.''
   But Vassiliou also cautioned that ``until we reach a just and
viable settlement, the constant improvement of our defensive
capability is of the higest priority ... so that we may be able to
face the worst eventuality.''
   After the ceremony, Vassiliou, 56, a millionaire businessman won
the presidency Feb. 21 as an independent with communist backing,
announced the makeup of his 11-member Council of Ministers _ nine
of whom are political newcomers.
   Vassiliou said any solution to the Cyprus crisis must include
the withdrawal of an estimated 30,000 Turkish troops and 65,000
settlers on the northern third of the island.
   A settlement also would have to allow 200,000 Greek Cypriots to
return to their northern homes and include international guarantees
against foreign intervention, he said.
   ``The settlement we seek for the Cyprus problem is defined by
the relevant United Nations resolutions ... and is a settlement
that safeguards the independence, sovereignty, territorial
integrity, unity and non-alignment of Cyprus,'' Vassiliou said in
his inaugural address before the 50-seat House of Represenatives.
   The east Mediterranean island has been unofficially partitioned
since Turkey occupied its northern third in 1974. The Turkish
invasion followed a coup by Greek Cypriots and Greek army officers
supporting a union with Greece.
   Vassiliou charged that 14 years after the invasion, ``Turkey is
methodically Turkeyfying our (occupied) land while the occupation
troops increase and are supplied with the latest type of armaments.
   ``The settlers from the mainland are also increasing,
suppressing the Turkish Cypriots and altering the demographic
composition of the population.
   ``We are faced by the worst calamity in our centuries-long
history,'' he said.
   The Turkish Cypriot minority, which makes up 17 percent of the
population of 650,000, proclaimed its own breakaway state in the
Turkish-occupied north in 1983. The state only has been recognized
by Turkey.
   Talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for two years.
Vassiliou's predecessor, Spyros Kyprianou, refused to resume
negotiations until Turkey withdrew its troops and settlers.
   During the campaign, Vassiliou said he would be flexible in
negotiations, but maintained that the issue of troop withdrawal
should be tackled first.
   Addressing the House of Representatives, composed only of Greek
Cypriots since the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities split in
1963, Vassiliou said ``it is sad that the representatives of the
Turkish Cypriot community are absent.
   ``We hope to have the Turkish Cypriots among us again soon, so
that in a democratic, free Cyprus, we shall be able to build a
better, peaceful tomorrow, for the good of the whole people of
Cyprus.
   Vassiliou, who built the largest business consulting firm in the
Middle East, said he supported a free enterprise economy. He also
said Cyprus would remain a non-aligned nation.

<HEAD>Impeachment Process Traces Back To English System Of Removing
Cruel Kings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Arizona Senate opens Gov. Evan
Mecham's impeachment trial Monday, it will embark on a course laid
out in England as a way to remove cruel kings and brought to
America in Colonial days as a way to protect democracy.
   But despite the long and sometimes colorful history of
impeachment, legal scholars say the seldom-used laws are ill
defined. Arizona lawmakers grappling with Mecham's fate have to
make up many rules as they go along.
   ``The Arizona Constitution provides few standards or procedures
for how the Senate is to perform its role,'' said University of
Arizona law professor Robert Glennon.
   Mecham was impeached Feb. 5 by the Arizona House of
Representatives on allegations of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan, misusing $80,000 from a special fund and attempting to thwart
an investigation of an alleged death threat involving a state
official.
   The impeachment amounts to an indictment, and the Senate process
to a trial. The 30 senators will act as both judge and jury for the
embattled Republican governor.
   But an impeachment trial is not a criminal trial _ it's purely
part of the political system. The only penalty the governor faces
is removal from office.
   ``It's basically _ `You're fired,''' Glennon said. ``Impeachment
is a way to get out of office those officials that violate the
public trust.''
   Even before Mecham's impeachment trial begins, political
arguments arising from the legal vagueness have abounded in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
   While setting the rules, the senators have agreed, for example,
that the evidence against Mecham must be ``clear and convincing''
in order to find him guilty. That's not as rigid as the requirement
in criminal trials that guilt be ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' but
it is tougher than the civil standard of a ``preponderance of the
evidence'' _ more than half _ for a verdict.
   ``There is nothing in the constitution about that and the
senators can do whatever they want,'' Glennon said.
   ``It's typical of the constitution to leave things so open. `Due
process' and `equal protection' are very vague words but we have
thousands and thousands of cases that define what they mean. In
impeachment, we have so few cases, it's not always clear,'' he said.
   Senators are constitutionally required ``to do justice according
to law and evidence.''
   Even the definition of an impeachable offense has been argued
through history.
   Former President Richard Nixon, whose Watergate activities were
probed by an impeachment committee in the U.S. House of
Representatives, argued that a misdeed had to be dastardly enough
to deserve a criminal indictment to be impeachable.
   But that's not necessarily true, Glennon said. Impeachment
doesn't have to involve illegal activities _ only ``high crimes,
misdemeanors, or malfeasance'' in Arizona.
   No court in Arizona has specifically defined high crimes and
misdemeanors regarding impeachment, but the Arizona Supreme Court
has said malfeasance occurs if an elected official commits ``an act
which is either positively wrong or unlawful,'' according to
Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank Gordon.
   The trial may look to observers like a criminal trial, but all
30 senators will have a chance to question witnesses, much like a
congressional hearing. A two-thirds vote _ 20 senators _ is
required to convict the governor.
   Gordon, the chief justice, will sit as a referee and be called
the ``presiding officer.'' Five members of the House, through their
attorneys, will sit as the ``Board of Managers'' and handle the
prosecution. Mecham will have his own defense attorneys.
   And there won't be any attempt to have an impartial jury.
   ``It is quite clear that the framers of the U.S. Constitution
(from which the Arizona law is drawn) chose to make the Senate as
judge and jury,'' Glennon said. ``The governor has no right to 12
ignorant lay people in this deal. In impeachment, there is no
intent to have an impartial jury. The framers thought the fact that
the senators would know something about the case was good.''
   Mecham also has been indicted in state district court on six
felony counts involving the $350,000 loan, which amounted to about
a third of his campaign war chest, and faces a criminal trial March
22. He faces a recall election May 17.
   He is the 16th governor to be impeached in U.S. history; six
have been convicted and removed from office. He is the first
Arizona governor to be impeached.
   If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be succeeded by
Secretary of State Rose Mofford, a Democrat who is acting governor
pending the impeachment trial's outcome.

   The death toll from a rockslide that
demolished a squatter's camp climbed to 52 on Sunday, and rescue
workers were searching for more victims beneath the debris,
officials said.
   At least six people were injured, one seriously, when a rock
wall overhanging the camp collapsed about Saturday after a week of
heavy rains.
   Officials said the victims, asleep at the time of the disaster,
included 27 males and 25 females. They did not specify how many of
the dead were children.
   The camp is in an old quarry outside Fez, which is about 125
miles east of the capital, Rabat.
   Several hundred inhabitants of the squatters' camp were
evacuated to emergency centers around the city.

<HEAD>Comatose Man Used As Human Guinea Pig Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMIENS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young man whose body was used for a
medical experiment while he was in a deep coma died on Sunday,
family members said.
   The revelation last Tuesday that an anesthesiologist had
performed an experiment on Pacal Louette, 24, considered at the
time clinically dead, touched off a scandal about the ethics of
using human beings as guinea pigs.
   Louette, injured in an auto accident earlier this year, died
Sunday morning at Amiens North Hospital, his father-in-law, Emile
Collard, said.
   It was not immediately known whether there was a link between
the death and the experiment in which Dr. Alain Milhaud of the
Regional Hospital Center of Amiens placed Louette on a sabotaged
medical device.
   Milhaud was trying to see if the effects would match those of a
similar case which has resulted in a trial of three doctors.
   Last Wednesday, Health Minister Michele Barzach suspended
Milhaud from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital
center.
   President Francois Mitterrand condemned such medical exercises,
saying neither scientific progress nor the search for truth could
justify them.
   Milhaud had told his superiors about the experiment, which he
videotaped.
   It was the second time Milhaud said he had used a comatose human
being for an experiment. In 1985, he experimented on a 20-year-old
comatose man in a chronic vegetative state, setting off a scandal.
That person also died, but no link was established between the
experiment and the death.
   At the time, Milhaud called such patients ``almost perfect human
models, who constitute intermediaries between animal and man.''
   The latest experiment was made public in testimony Tuesday by
Dr. Jean Lassner, a medical expert at a trial in the town of
Poitiers where three doctors are charged in connection with the
1984 death of a 33-year-old woman.
   The woman, Nicole Berneron, died after the removal of a tumor.
She apparently had received nitrogen oxide instead of oxygen during
resuscitation. A report showed that the tubes of the resuscitation
system had been switched.
   Milhaud had informed Lassner of his experiment but has refused
all comment since the court testimony.

   Lisa Carlson borrowed a truck to take her
husband's body to the crematory after he shot himself in 1981. In
the early hours of the morning, she could think clearly enough only
to know she didn't have the money to pay a funeral home.
   His ashes are buried in the garden behind their country home,
the spot marked by a slab of granite on which she etched his name,
John Brackett, with a pocket knife.
   She regrets only that she didn't share the intimate farewell
with her husband's mother and the couple's children.
   Now Carlson has written a book to help other people make their
own funeral arrangements. She began writing it after her current
husband, Stephen, and his three brothers buried their mother in a
pine box atop a ridge.
   ``It's very easy to understand why people give it away to a
funeral home, and indeed, if I had had the money, I would have
given away a very special opportunity,'' Carlson said during a
recent interview at her home.
   Her book, ``Caring for Your Own Dead,'' includes a directory of
each state's laws on funeral arrangements, cremation and home
burial, a glossary of terms and instructions on completing a death
certificate. It also includes a listing of medical schools that
accept body donations.
   ``I really tried to take the mystery out of body disposition,''
Carlson said.
   Many states allow funerals to be handled privately, but Carlson
said there may be obstacles to obtaining needed information on
short notice, including some funeral directors reluctant to offer
prices over the telephone and local officials unaccustomed to the
idea. She credits many in the funeral industry for their help
during her nine months of researching the book.
   She found that anyone in Vermont can do a home burial as long as
technical requirements involving the death certificate are met. If
the burial is to be on private property it must be away from power
lines and water and may be subject to local zoning restrictions.
The town clerk keeps a map of private burial plots.
   According to Carlson, a cremation could cost as little as $130,
including a permit. Transportation and a box would add to the cost.
   ``The professional services and cost of the casket are two of
the major expenses,'' Carlson said.
   In 1987, the average cost of a funeral, including professional
services and a casket, was $2,935, according to an industry
newsletter, Funeral Service Insider.
   Carlson took on her husband's funeral first from financial
necessity. But then she realized that ``not only was it all right,
it became clear to me that I needed to do it.''
   One funeral director whom she had interviewed for the book
called her after his 7-year-old son died.
   ``He didn't realize until afterwards how important it was for
him to be involved personally,'' she said.
   Most states do not limit the family in caring for their dead,
but some prohibit home burial and limit the scattering of ashes,
her book says. About 80 percent of the 500 crematories Carlson
contacted across the country will accept a body from someone other
than a funeral director.
   No state requires a body to be embalmed in every case, but many
require it if a person died of a contagious disease, the book says.
   In Alaska, a body may not be closed after an autopsy. In most of
California, burial must be in an established cemetery. Colorado has
no state licensing requirements for funeral directors, so anyone
may handle a funeral.
   In New England, according to Carlson's book, there are limits on
private funerals and home burial in New Hampshire, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New York.
   Other states where the family's involvement in funeral
arrangements may be limited are Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio and West
Virginia, she says.

<HEAD>Presidential Contenders Take Aim at Flip-Flops on Issues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Presidential candidates from Congress work in
a system where it's hard to avoid some flip-flopping on issues but
when a candidate can't offer convincing explanations, those charges
take root with voters, experts say.
   Two Democratic candidates battling for Super Tuesday votes,
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, have
been the most frequent targets, even trading those accusations
themselves. Both, as legislators, have voted on two sides of
several issues.
   Gephardt has taken fire for moving to the left after deciding to
run for president, on abortion, trade and social issues. Gore has
become more conservative, especially on defense matters.
   Gordon Jones, vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative Washington think tank, said, ``There are a lot of
reasons to vote differently at different times.'' Legislative
strategy means ``sometimes you've got to hold your nose'' and vote,
he said.
   But that doesn't mean voters should dismiss flip-flops lightly,
he said, and the candidates should provide substantial reasons.
   ``The most damaging thing to Dick Gephardt is his response to
why he voted for the (1981) Reagan tax cut'' said Norman Ornstein,
who studies Congress and politics at the American Enterprise
Institute.
   During his campaign, ``first he said he fought it,'' voting for
it only after a Democratic alternative failed, ``then he said he
was proud of it,'' Ornstein said.
   Jones said Gore stumbled when he recently tried to deny voting
for an anti-abortion amendment. Then, Jones said, the question
becomes ``whether he remembers his record right, and if he's
falsifying his record.''
   Few members of Congress can keep their voting records pure.
Often several issues are packaged together with neither side
getting a clear victory.
   For example, the House is scheduled this week to consider a
compromise bill. Liberals might support it because of its general
broadening of legal protections for women and minorities, but to do
so they've got to swallow an anti-abortion provision.
   ``To take an individual vote and say that that means somebody
stood for this or stood for that sometimes takes a lot of
stretching,'' Ornstein said. ``You can't pay a whole lot of
attention to the individual charges being made, not as much as to
the defense being made,'' he said.
   Liberal and conservative groups who release annual studies of
congressional records carefully select votes they believe show the
true stance of a politician. Sometimes, the tallies are on
procedural motions or other technicalities obscure to voters.
   Only a handful of lawmakers get 100 percent ratings from either
the conservative or liberal groups.
   Marc Pearl, national director of Americans for Democratic
Action, a liberal organization, said his group's ratings can help
voters look at the bigger picture rather than individual votes. On
single issues, voters should be most aware of when candidates
abandon long-held positions, he said.
   ``I would define a flip-flop as when a person had a consistent
position for a number of years ... then recently, for whatever
reasons not explained, there has been a change in attitude,'' he
said.
   It might be unfair, for example, to say Vice President George
Bush flip-flopped because six years he praised ousted Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos and now he supports the new government.
   Gephardt was a consistent abortion opponent until he started to
run for president and Gore consistently opposed military aid to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Now they have changed their positions
and ``I think it is legitimate to ask, `Tell us what the change
process was,''' he said.
   ``I don't want my president locked into an ideology,'' he said.
``But I think it's legitimate to ask them what were the reasons
why.''
   Voters are willing to accept changes in position if they believe
they are sincere, he said. ``Ronald Reagan was on the board of ADA
forty years ago _ you want to talk about flip-flopping,'' Pearl
said.
   Bob Canavan, director of the voter education project of the
American Association of Retired People, said his organization
avoids releasing voting-record scorecards on the politically
explosive issues surrounding Social Security.
   ``There are so many other things, such as committee activities,
putting together legislation, which don't show up'' with a vote
tally, he said. The organization also questions whether an
objective scorecard can be produced,
   Candidates, meanwhile, don't always see the inconsistencies in
their own positions.
   ``Politicians don't lie,'' Jones said. ``They just have an
infinite capacity for self-delusion.''

<HEAD>Cigarette Suit Evidence Has A Common Thread: Lawyers Usually Cast
Shadows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   During the first month of a cigarette
liability trial, anti-tobacco attorneys have introduced stacks of
documents and presented 10 witnesses. Through much of the evidence
runs a common thread: lawyers and more lawyers.
   Attorneys for the plaintiff argue that cigarette company
attorneys kept a keen eye on smoking and health research, helped
shape corporate policy and vetoed putting safer smokes on the
market.
   One reason, according to the plaintiff's theory, is because the
companies felt that if they acknowledged the dangers of smoking _
either through public statements or marketing of a less dangerous
product _ they would be open to lawsuits over existing cigarettes.
   The trial of Philip Morris Co., Liggett Group Inc. and Lorillard
Inc., makers of the brands that Rose Cipollone smoked for 40 years
before she died of lung cancer at the age of 58 in 1984, enters its
second month Monday. Her husband, Antonio, is pursuing a suit she
filed before she died and is asking for unspecified damages.
   Attorneys for the tobacco companies say legal concerns did not
dictate research.
   ``Lawyers are involved in decisions of industry all over the
place,'' said Chuck Wall, an attorney for the Kansas City, Mo., of
firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon, which represents Morris and Lorillard.
   He said lawyers need to be familiar with research and scientific
developments because of the rising tide of lawsuits against the
cigarette-makers since the early 1950s and to advise clients on
advertising and testimony before public bodies.
   The evidence so far has addressed three of the plaintiffs'
allegations _ that the defendants knew how to make a safer
cigarette but didn't; knew of potential health hazards from the
1920s through 1940s but did not act enough on the knowledge and
failed to tell consumers; and sought to suppress or shape in their
favor research on the hazards of smoking.
   The jury has heard the testimony of former in-house and external
researchers, top corporate executives and an expert on smoking and
health.
   Testimony during most of last week was from Joseph F. Cullman
III, chairman emeritus and former president of Philip Morris.
   Marc Z. Edell, representing the Cipollone estate, asked Cullman,
for example, if the company's general counsel ``advised'' him on
cigarette smoking and health issues.
   ``He wouldn't advise,'' Cullman said. ``He would monitor them,
I'd say.''
   Several confidential documents introduced into evidence Thursday
appear to indicate the role of lawyers.
   A letter dated April 29, 1974, from the chairman of R.J.
Reynolds to an official of the Council for Tobacco Research,
describes a committee of manufacturers formed to study
industry-funded research programs. The council itself was funded by
tobacco companies.
   The Reynolds executive named the committee's chairman as David
R. Hardy, the named partner in the Shook, Hardy firm handling the
current trial.
   A July 3, 1974, memo to committee members from another Shook,
Hardy attorney speaks of ``gaps in knowledge'' in the
smoking-health field.
   Included is mention of a paper by tobacco council lawyer Ed
Jacob with a section described as ``a summarization and slight
updating of research recommendations.''
   Before Hardy assumed control of the manufacturers' research
study committee, he corresponded with a tobacco council scientist,
another memo showed.
   A Dec. 24, 1969, letter indicates the researcher, Arthur Furst,
had discussed with Jacob the work of a British cancer researcher.
   Furst recommended to Hardy that the British researcher, H.J.
Eysenck, a psychologist at the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley hospitals
in London, be given money for a pilot project. The letter said
Eysenck had a theory that ``there may be a relationship between the
appearance of cancer for some people and their emotional make up.''
   Twelve years later, Eysenck wrote to Jacob to ask for more
research council funding, although it is unclear from the letter,
also introduced last week, what the project involved.

   President Hafez Assad has hinted that
Syria may be able to help free kidnapped Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, a U.S. official said Sunday.
   The official, who spoke in Jerusalem on condition of anonymity,
said Assad told Secretary of State George P. Shultz during his
visit to Damascus on Saturday that he had ``some ideas'' about
Higgins' case.
   The official said Shultz and Assad talked about the situation in
Lebanon but declined to elaborate. ``We can't get into it,'' he
said when pressed for details.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., headed a U.N. observer team
attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon. He was
kidnapped Feb. 17 while returning to U.N. headquarters in Naqoura
from the port city of Tyre.
   The kidnapping brought to 25 the number of foreign hostages held
in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction calling itself the
``Oppressed on Earth'' claimed responsibility for Higgins'
abduction and said he was a CIA spy. U.S. and U.N. officials denied
the accusation.
   In Beirut, a senior militia official said Sunday that Higgins'
kidnapping has imperiled Lebanon's Shiite Moslem sect.
   ``This is the first abduction that has brought the sect's two
giants close to a head-on collision,'' said Abdul-Majid Saleh,
chief political officer of Justice Minister Nabih Berri's
mainstream Shiite Amal militia in south Lebanon.
   The Syrian-allied Amal has been at loggerheads with the
Iranian-backed extremist Hezbollah, or Party of God, for several
years, but the kidnapping has increased tensions.
   Amal has viewed the abduction as a challenge to its dominance in
the Tyre region and has vowed to leave no stone unturned in south
Lebanon to rescue the combat-decorated Vietnam veteran. Hezbollah
praised the abduction and called Higgins a ``filthy American.''
   Saleh told reporters in Tyre that the abduction was ``more of a
peril to the Shiite community than to the United States. It has
been threatening to kindle an intercommunal strife.''
   Saleh said an unidentified third party was currently engaged in
a mediation effort to ensure Higgins' release and head off an
Amal-Hezbollah clash.
   In Damascus, Information Minister Mohammed Salman said Sunday
that Syria had assured Shultz of its continued efforts to gain
Higgins' release.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Salman said Syria's
policy is to work with friendly organizations in Lebanon, in
particular the Amal militia, to obtain the release of the one-time
aide to former U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   Salman said President Reagan had asked Assad for help in
securing Higgins' release.
   Syrian officials noted with irony Reagan's request and the
recent parade of U.S. officials to Damascus. Just two years ago the
United States accused Syria of terrorism, brought its ambassador
home and slapped sanctions against it.
   Salman said he believed the turnabout came when Washington
realized that no Middle East settlement was possible without Syria
and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Last October, U.S. Ambassador William Eagleton returned to his
post in Damacus.
   Salman said Eagleton informed him 10 days ago that another
sanction, restrictions on visas for Syrians tarveling to the United
States, had been lifted.
   Shultz, explaining the U.S. shift, has said Syria had distanced
itself from terrorism.
   Last year Syria closed the Damascus office of Palestinian
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri Al-Banna, split from the PLO
in the early 1970s. He was convicted in absentia in Italy earlier
this month of masterminding a 1985 terrorist attack on a Rome
airport in which 16 people were killed.

<HEAD>Gore, Hopes Staked On South, May Borrow For Super Tuesday Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Al Gore is looking into borrowing money
for extensive TV ads in the Super Tuesday states critical to his
presidential campaign, but a spokesman said Sunday he has taken no
loans yet.
   ``We've been exploring options about borrowing money because we
want to have a comprehensive media buy,'' said press spokesman Mike
Kopp.
   The Tennessee senator is running a son-of-the-South campaign and
has vowed to spend more than any rival campaign on the Super
Tuesday primaries.
   But campaign finance reports through January show Gore was well
behind rival Michael Dukakis in spending.
   Gore began running his commercials three weeks ago on cable TV
nationwide and on local TV in the 14 southern Super Tuesday states,
and a new series of ads begins Tuesday, Kopp said.
   ``To date no loans have been taken,'' he said, but added that,
``Our finance people have talked to banks,'' to line up the
possibilities.
   Aftern ending January, with $2 million in the bank, Gore has
boosted that to more than $3 million through fund-raisers and mail,
Kopp said.
   Campaign finance reports show that Dukakis as of Jan. 31 had
spent more in 13 of the 20 Super Tuesday states than any Democrat
in the race, and close to $1 million in all the Super Tuesday
states. The Massachusetts governor had $4 million in the bank at
the end of January and his campaign says he is now raising $20,000
a day.
   Gore was a distant second, spending only $287,542 by the end of
January.
   That was less even than the $345,280 spent by his cash-poor
Democratic rival Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois who has now decided to
sit out Super Tuesday.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri reported spending $482,697 on
Super Tuesday states through January.
   The figures are from the latest financial disclosure statements
the candidates filed with the Federal Election Commission, covering
the period through Jan. 31.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush had husbanded
his ample resources while rivals Sen. Bob Dole and Pat Robertson
both swept past him in laying groundwork for Super Tuesday.
   Most of the campaigns, with Gore the notable exception, turned
their attention to Feb. 8 Iowa contest and Feb. 16 primary in New
Hampshire, then directed their resources to the Super Tuesday
states in the latter part of this month. Figures for February have
not yet been released.
   Robertson, the former TV evangelist, spent more than anyone in
early Super Tuesday efforts. His total of $3.2 million included
$1.1 million in Texas, which was the biggest allocation reported by
any of the campaigns for a single state.
   Bush, on the other hand, spent $335,743 in his adoptive home
state of Texas, and $1.7 overall in the Super Tuesday states; and
Dole reported $81,645 in Texas expenditures and $2 million overall.
   Aside from Texas, Bush was putting most of his money, $416,449,
into Florida as of Jan. 31. Dole had spent $150,744 in Florida and
Robertson $617,933.
   Super Tuesday spending could spell strategy problems for
Robertson because as of the end of January he had already spent
$17.6 million against the $23 million overall ceiling imposed on
candidates who receive federal matching funds.
   The other Republican candidate, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
whose campaign has rowed through turbulent financial waters,
reported spending of $11,312 in Texas, $8,529 in Florida, and
$819,311 overall. However, $723,027 of his money was allocated to
Massachusetts, where several campaigns bought heavily on Boston TV
stations because that market includes viewers in neighboring New
Hampshire.
   Kemp adviser Charlie Black said last week that the campaign does
not anticipate any new loans, after borrowing heavily against his
federal matching funds last year and in January. Kemp planned to
run TV ads in seven Super Tuesday states.
   The Democrats have raised and spent less money overall than the
Republicans.
   Dukakis, the Democratic leader, had put most of his resources
into Texas, $301,829; Florida, $206,861; and North Carolina,
$146,582.
   Gephardt had spent $482,697 on the March 8 contests, but most of
that, $316,822, was devoted to his home state of Missouri, which
his opponents are virtually ignoring.
   His spokeswoman, Ali Webb, said Sunday that the campaign goal
was to spend $2 million on super Tuesday. Gephardt has targeted six
Super Tuesday states for TV _ Texas, Florida, Oklahoma, Arkansas,
North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia _ and will buy in selected
markets in other states, she said.
   The Gephardt campaign, which ended January in debt, is
``spending money as fast as it comes in,'' Webb said.
   As of Jan. 31, his biggest Super Tuesday state outside Missouri
was Texas, where he spent $69,809.
   Gore's biggest spending was also in Texas, $74,921.
   Simon, who last week announced he would skip Super Tuesday but
stay in the race for later contests, had devoted most of his
$345,280 in Super Tuesday spending to North Carolina, where he
spent $153,582.
   Jesse Jackson had spent less than $10,000 in just three Super
Tuesday states, North Carolina, Maryland and Kentucky. Jackson is
expected to run strongly across the South, where 14 states are
among the Super Tuesday battles.
   He has raised considerably less money than his competitors, but
his campaign concentrates on the free media that he engenders by
virture of his international personality status and his ability to
draw large crowds virtually everywhere he goes.
   Gary Hart, the former senator from Colorado, had spent $37,814
in Texas as of Jan. 31, and just $12,000 in five other Super
Tuesday states.

   Several thousand people marched though
Madrid's main streets on Sunday to protest the failure of police to
protect citizens from petty crime and get drugs out of the schools.
   The rally organized by numerous civic and neighborhood groups
drew 10,000 people, said Enrique Castro, spokesman for the
organizers. Police said the march drew 5,000 people.
   Citizen groups for years have criticized the government of
Socialist Prime Minsiter Felipe Gonzalez for failing to stem a
sharp increase in petty crime and drug trafficking. Last week,
Gonzalez said there were plans to hire more police.
   The marchers protested drug trafficking in schools and said the
government's plans to beef up police ranks were inadequate.
   Police have made several drug sweeps in the nation's schools as
media attention has focused on the problem and on the rise in crime.

   An Allegheny County judge has sentenced a
rapist to 80 to 160 years in prison, calling him ``a walking crime
wave.''
   Millard Bowles, 27, of Bethel Park, who stalked women in grocery
store parking lots, was convicted in January of kidnapping two
women at knifepoint and sexually assaulting them in separate
incidents on March 19 and April 7.
   Bowles forced the women to withdraw cash from automated teller
machines after the attacks, police said.
   Despite the brutality of the assaults, Bowles would leave his
telephone number with the victims or try to telephone them later to
arrange another meeting, police said.
   ``Millard Bowles, you are a walking crime wave,'' said Judge
Robert E. Dauer after handing down the sentence Friday. ``I hope
you serve every moment of it.''

   Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and other religious leaders called Sunday for a sweeping
campaign of defiance against new restrictions on opposition groups.
   Prominent clergy told their congregations that the church would
become more active in opposing apartheid now that the government
has banned political activity by 18 opposition groups. They called
for a church-led campaign against the latest crackdown.
   ``We have no option but to engage in activities that now are
prohibited,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the
South African Council of Churches.
   ``No matter what the consequences, we will continue to seek the
unbanning of democratic organizations and the transfer of power
from the white minority to all the people,'' Chikane told about 200
people at Central Methodist Church in Johannesburg.
   The government on Wednesday banned the 18 black-led groups from
political activity and placed restrictions on the activities of 18
senior black leaders.
   Church groups weren't included in the crackdown and
theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns,
but most forms of peaceful protest still are banned under existing
regulations.
   The outlawing of the country's leading anti-apartheid groups,
most of them affiliated with the United Democratic Front coalition,
is viewed as a clear sign that the government intends to maintain a
hard line against all political opponents.
   Rev. Peter Storey, a prominent white minister and anti-apartheid
activist, compared the crackdown with the government's 1960
decision to outlaw the African National Congress guerrilla group
and the 1977 banning of 18 black political organizations.
   ``To do a third time what has failed twice is rank stupidity,''
Storey said at the Central Methodist service. ``What the government
has done flies in the face of history, exhibits a moral bankruptcy
and is a declaration of war on peace.''
   In Cape Town, Tutu said he would defy government laws he
considers unjust.
   ``Apartheid is evil, apartheid is immoral and apartheid is
un-Christian,'' Tutu told about 200 people at the Bonteheuwel
Anglican Church.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, described the South
African government as ``illegitimate'' and suggested church leaders
would initiate a civil disobedience campaign in coming days.
   None of the church leaders specified what activities they would
engage in, but there are several ongoing resistance campaigns that
were led by groups now restricted. Those include rent boycotts in
black townships, keeping track of dissidents under police
detention, and a push to restructure black education.
   Church services to express opposition the government's measures
also were held in Pretoria and Durban, the country's other leading
cities.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation,
the nation's 5 million whites maintain political and economic
control over 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national
affairs.

<TEXT>
   High maple syrup prices after two abysmal
sugaring seasons have prompted more people to tap more trees as the
sap starts running this year, New Hampshire's agriculture chief
says.
   New Hampshire syrup sells for as much as $43 a gallon, nearly
double the price before back-to-back bad seasons. But demand has
not lagged, said Agriculture Commissioner Stephen Taylor.
   ``What's really kept it up there is packaging in ever smaller
packages. We talk about the price per gallon but nobody ever buys a
gallon of syrup anymore,'' Taylor said in an interview last week.
   The 150,000 gallons of maple syrup sold annually in New
Hampshire, most of it in gift shops and country stores, comes in
jugs as small as a pint or less, Taylor said. But not all of it
comes from New Hampshire.
   ``There's some new production coming out of the woodwork in
Ontario, Ohio, Indiana'' that is sold bulk to packagers in New
Hampshire, Taylor said. ``But we have the aura _ a geographic
chauvinism'' favoring New England maple syrup.
   State law ensures that ``if you call it New Hampshire maple
syrup, it has to be made in New Hampshire,'' he said.
   Taylor estimated there are 400 commercial maple syrup producers
in New Hampshire and 1,000 ``backyard farm-type people.''
   ``We will tap a lot more trees this year, as a result of high
prices,'' he said. ``Sales of equipment and tubing indicate a lot
more people are getting in this year.''
   Sap runs when temperatures dip below freezing at night and rise
to the 40s in the day _ conditions that began to occur in some
places earlier this month.
   New Hampshire produced 100,000 gallons of syrup in its best
year, 1984. But during the last two years, warm weather day and
night predominated, and production was around 30 percent of normal.
   Technology is revolutionizing the sugaring industry, Taylor
said. He estimated more than 80 percent of taps this year will feed
into tubing that carries sap directly to evaporators and other
processing equipment, rather than into buckets.
   Taylor says higher syrup prices staying around for awhile,
regardless of how good this season is.
   ``If we go in with cupboard bare, no carryover syrup from last
season, prices will be substantially higher than previous years,
even with a bumper crop.''
   A co-owner of the state's largest syrup producer, Bascom's Sugar
House in Acworth, said she was puzzled that demand has remained
stable despite the price.
   ``I don't buy maple syrup. I can't explain it,'' Liz Bascom
said. ``We made less gallons at a higher price (last year) and we
came out about the same.''

<HEAD>Brevard County Courthouse Sealed After High Levels of Asbestos
Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TITUSVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Brevard County Courthouse has been
ordered sealed and workers were being relocated to shopping centers
and hotels following the discovery of extremely high levels of
asbestos.
   Brevard Circuit Judge Dean Moxley ordered the closing Saturday
after Asbestos Technologies Inc. reported asbestos levels as high
as 3.642 fibers per cubic centimeter in the office of Judge Gil
Goshorn.
   Levels were as high as 0.182 in hearing rooms used by Goshorn
and Judge Charles Harris, said County Administrator Tom Jenkins.
   The U.S. Occupational Safety and Heath Administration consider
levels of 0.2 to be unsafe and warrant evacuation. Acceptable
levels normally fall below 0.1.
   ``3.642 is absolutely alarming. The courthouse is not fit for
human occupation without protection,'' said Moxley, who moved his
office and staff to a courthouse annex last week after levels of
0.175 were reported in his office.
   ``ATI said it's probably the worst reading they have ever
encountered,'' he said.
   Moxley's order prohibits anyone from removing any items,
including civil and criminal files, and traffic, child support and
land records stored in the courthouse, without going through a
cleansing room. Violators will be held in contempt of court, said
County Commission Chairwoman Sue Schmitt.
   ATI officials planned Sunday to test courthouse records for
asbestos. Test results were expected Monday or Tuesday, she said.
   Meanwhile, officials tried to set up temporary quarters while a
decision is made on what to do with the building.
   The murder trial of Christopher Scott Lawrence, scheduled to
begin Monday before Harris, will be held at the North Brevard
Service Complex, officials said.
   County Judge Peter Haddad planned to set up offices in a board
room at the North Brevard Service Complex and circuit judges Harris
and Goshorn were to be moved to the Titusville Quality Inn.
   The State Attorney's Office was being moved to the Southern Bell
building.
   The Clerk of County and Circuit Courts Office will have a
skeleton crew at the Gibson School Gymnasium to direct other
employees.
   ``The rest of our employees will be furloughed until we see what
is going on. We can't get access to any of our records and that's
our biggest problem,'' said Harry Bennett, chief deputy of the
clerk of county and circuit courts.
   ATI workers will be setting up a ``cocoon'' made of plastic
sheeting on the first and second floors of the courthouse building,
enabling operations there to resume later this week, Jenkins said.
   Brevard-Seminole State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said his staff
would probably remain in the Southern Bell building for up to six
months.

   Two Norwegian soldiers serving with the
U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon were wounded in a mine explosion
in a southern Lebanese village on Sunday, U.N. spokesman Timur
Goksel said.
   He said both soldiers underwent surgery at a U.N. field hospital
in the border town of Naqoura. A Norwegian officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the leg of one of the soldiers had to
be amputated.
   Goksel said the mine exploded at 3:25 p.m. near the soldiers'
position in Blat, in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone. The
zone overlaps with the peacekeeping force's area of operations in
south Lebanon.
   He would not disclose the peacekeepers' ranks or names, pending
notification of their families.
   Norway has an 881-man contingent serving with the nine-nation,
5,800-strong peacekeeping force. They were deployed in 1978 after a
brief Israeli incursion into south Lebanon.

<HEAD>Children Still Think Earth Is Flat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Never mind Columbus. Never mind the globes in
classrooms everywhere. Never mind those pictures from space of
Earth as a big blue marble.
   When you ask children in the early elementary grades what they
really think, most believe what their eyes tell them: the Earth is
flat.
   That, at least, is what Alan Lightman, a Harvard physicist, and
astronomy teacher Philip Sadler say.
   The two, writing in ``Science and Children'' magazine, suggest
that educators are living in a dream world if they assume young
children understand the earth is round.
   ``Nearly 500 years ago, Columbus proved that the Earth was
round. Today's students still don't believe it,'' they write in the
February issue of the science teachers' journal.
   They cite several studies done in the United States, Israel and
Nepal in the 1970s and early 1980s in which school children in the
early grades consistently turned out to be flat-Earthers.
   ``One of the first scientific facts we announce to our children
is that the Earth is round. That flat, flat ground we walk on, ride
on and play on, stretching endless miles in perfect and reliable
flatness, actually wraps around on itself to form a giant ball.
Preposterous, yet a scientific fact,'' they said. But ``if we
expect young children to believe this story, we're wrong.''
   Lightman, a research physicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory and lecturer at Harvard, and Sadler, director of
Project STAR, a high school astronomy curriculum, recently asked 65
elementary teachers to predict how pupils would draw the earth.
   The teachers thought 65 percent of kindergarteners knew the
Earth was round, 85 percent of the first-graders, 95 percent of the
second graders and everyone in third grade.
   Actually, according to past studies, only 5 percent of second
graders know the Earth is round, 40 percent of third graders, 55
percent of fourth graders and 75 percent of fifth graders.
   Even fourth graders who say the Earth is round often ``picture a
flat part where people live in the interior of the ball,'' they
said. ``Others draw the Earth as a giant pancake or as a curved sky
covering a flat ground.''
   The authors offer a solution for enlightening junior
flat-Earthers.
   They recommend teachers buy a big latex weather balloon at an
Army-Navy or surplus store and inflate it to 10 feet.
   While a child holds her cheek against the balloon and looks at
its horizon, ``slowly move a toy ship across the surface of the
balloon toward the child.'' As the ship comes over the horizon, it
is revealed in parts, the top mast first, just as it would be in
the ocean.
   But on the flat surface of a large table, the child sees the
entire ship at once, no matter how far away it is.
   Demonstrating this experiment on the cover of ``Science and
Children'' are Lightman's own 7-year-old daughter, Elyse, and a
classmate at Alcott School in Concord, Mass.
   Lightman acknowledged in an interview that ``there aren't many
flat-Earthers by the fifth or sixth grade.''
   So why bother to disabuse them of the notion at an earlier age?
   ``It's never too early an age to begin appreciating that the
world is not always as it seems,'' said Lightman.

<TEXT>
   Anti-government protesters Sunday
exploded homemade bombs and set vehicles ablaze in the capital to
protest Parliament elections. An opposition leader said three
people were killed.
   Sheik Hasina, leader of the opposition Awami League, blamed the
blasts on ``government intruders'' and said that ``police took away
the three bodies.'' There was no immediate confirmation from the
police.
   After the explosions, helmeted riot police broke up crowds with
tear gas shells and charged with bamboo staves.
   At least 10 people were injured, three critically, including
local reporters and photographers, witnesses said.
   The violence began shortly after Hasina and opposition leader
Khaleda Zia addressed separate rallies at the city's main square.
   The women have led a series of strikes and demonstrations since
Nov. 10 to try to oust President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the
former army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1982.
   Both women have pledged to boycott Thursday's parliamentary
election and have called for a nationwide strike Wednesday and
Thursday to discourage voting. They contend that fair elections
cannot be held while Ershad remains in power.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party and several minor opposition parties have
put up candidates for the 300 elected seats of Parliament.
   Ershad, who has vowed not to resign, has ordered army troops
deployed to allow balloting to be held. Officials say 300,000
soldiers and police will be on duty election day.
   But a big turnout is not expected.
   ``Honestly speaking, I do not even know the names of the
candidates for the Parliament from my constituency,'' said Rafiqul
Islam, a 45-year-old farmer in the village of Konnapara, 15 miles
west of Dhaka.
   ``There is no campaigning by the candidates this time,'' he
said. ``Even the people are not talking about it.''
   More than 80 percent of Bangladesh's 105 million people live in
rural areas. During recent visits to villages in the Savar district
and neighboring Manikganj, the only signs of politicking were stray
posters showing the plow symbol of Ershad's Jatiya Party and the
torch used by a grouping of small opposition parties.
   But a lack of interest doesn't mean the campaign has been
uneventful.
   Three candidates have been shot to death. In cities like Dhaka,
the capital, and Chittagong in the south, homemade bombs have been
thrown and other strong-arm tactics used to disrupt campaigning.
   In addition, the anti-Ershad campaign has led to at least 25
deaths and seriously damaged the already downtrodden economy of
Bangladesh, among the world's poorest nations.
   ``This election is not going to resolve the political and
economic crisis confronting Bangladesh,'' said a senior Asian
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The election will
only accelerate the process of bloody confrontation.''
   On Sunday, about 5,000 people attended the opposition rallies,
which ended peacefully.
   But then some protesters split away in groups of about 20 or 25
and rampaged through the downtown area, hurling bricks at shops and
passing cars, witnesses said.
   The protesters set fire to at least 12 vehicles, some of them
cars and jeeps belonging to the government, they added.
   Demonstrators also damaged and burned some makeshift camps set
up by candidates for their campaign workers.
   A number of homemade bombs were thrown near the city square, and
blasts were also heard around the Dhaka University campus, a hotbed
of anti-government protests.
   The rioters were dispersed by about 300 policemen, who were
stoned near the campus.
   Hasina repeated her appeal to the military and civilian
administration to try to block ``the farcical polls'' called by
Ershad.
   The military has been the driving force in Bangladesh's
politics. In the country's 17-year history, every change in
government has been by coup. After he seized power in 1982, Ershad,
58, was elected president in a 1986 vote that the opposition
boycotted and contends was rigged.

<HEAD>Young Kennedy Works For Father's Re-election, Considers Own
Political Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Casually dressed and moving easily on his
artificial limb, Edward M. Kennedy Jr. greeted Democratic activists
at the core of the Kennedy family's political base, a union hall in
a heavily Irish-Catholic section of Boston.
   The younger Kennedy's first priority is winning re-election for
his father to the U.S. Senate. But as to the inevitable questions
about his own political future, he admitted Saturday he is getting
``good practical experience.''
   Kennedy, 26, resigned his position as head of Facing the
Challenge, Inc., a non-profit group he founded in 1985 devoted to
eliminating barriers for the physically and mentally disabled.
   As co-chairman of his father's fifth re-election campaign along
with his sister Kara, Kennedy spends all his working time at
campaign headquarters or on the road across Massachusetts, meeting
local supporters, drumming up new backers and fighting to get
people excited about a race which to date has only one candidate.
   ``Whether my father draws a strong opponent or a weak opponent,
it's still necessary for him to know what's going on in different
communities and for my father to be able to tell people what he's
done for Massachusetts,'' Kennedy said.
   When news of Ted Jr.'s involvement in the campaign became known
last fall, observers assumed the post amounted to a training ground
for the younger Kennedy to seek political office.
   Kennedy said Saturday he has not decided whether to return to
Facing the Challenge after the Senate campaign concludes. And while
he didn't rule out seeking office, he said he has no specific plans.
   ``If you're asking me, am I going to be involved and active in
my community, the answer is yes,'' said Kennedy, who lives in
Boston. ``I am always going to be active and concerned about issues.
   ``I don't have any plans right now... I'm concentrating on my
father's re-election.'' But he added, ``It is good, practical
experience.''
   Kennedy got some good, practical experience in Boston's
Dorchester section Saturday where he attended a state Democratic
party caucus at Florian Hall, home of one of Boston's firefighters
union locals. Democrats of Irish descent formed the backbone of
John F. Kennedy's political base in the 1940s and the Kennedy
family appears to have held onto that popularity.
   ``Anybody in the Kennedy family has his head on straight,'' said
Camilla Duffy of Dorchester, who is gathering nomination signatures
for the Senator's re-election campaign.
   Many of the roughly 100 Democratic activists recognized Kennedy
from his work for the disabled and greeted him warmly.
   Kennedy lost his right leg above the knee to cancer in 1973. He
has remained active in skiing, swimming and weight lifting.
   ``I'm lucky to be alive,'' Kennedy said. His own return to a
full and active life, he said, was all too exceptional. ``There are
other people who don't have the same opportunities.''
   State Democratic party Chairman Chester Atkins, also attending
the caucus, said Democrats would welcome a campaign by the younger
Kennedy. ``He's been a great campaigner. He cares deeply about
people,'' Atkins said. And as for Kennedy's political career, ``I
have to assume he'll have the opportunity.''
   Joseph Kennedy II gained some attention before running for
office by saying he was unsure of the ability of government to help
people _ a position he modified after his election to Congress. On
that score, Edward Kennedy Jr. said he has no doubts.
   ``I am one who really believes that public service is an
honorable profession. It's what my whole family has believed. I've
had a couple of uncles who gave their lives for public service.
   ``People who think they don't have a say _ I really reject that.
They can, whether in this hall or a parish, a homeless shelter,''
Kennedy said.

<TEXT>
   Actor Bruce Boxleitner, who co-starred
in the television series ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King,'' will receive
the Buffalo Bill Award at the 1988 Nebraskaland Days, officials
said.
   Plans for the June 18-26 celebration were outlined Saturday
night at the annual Buffalo Bill Birthday Dance, one of
Nebraskaland Days' biggest fund-raisers.
   Nebraskaland Days President Kim Baxter said Boxleitner has
western connections through television movies and his interest in
quarter horses.
   ``To be honest, they're not making as many westerns as they used
to,'' Baxter said. ``It lessens the field when you limit it to
people in westerns. We've gone to choosing a person who represents
good family entertainment. But it's good when you can get someone
who has been in westerns.''
   Boxleitner appeared as James Arness' nephew in ``The Macahans,''
which inspired the ``How the West Was Won'' series. He was Kenny
Rogers' co-star in three ``Gambler'' television movies.
   Boxleitner lives in the San Fernando Valley, north of Los
Angeles.
   The annual celebration features rodeo performances, a parade and
many other events with a western theme. Gov. Kay Orr has designated

   Chrysler Corp.'s plans to close a Wisconsin
assembly plant and its admission that it might sell its Acustar
Inc. parts subsidiary are fueling worker anger and distrust as the
two sides head into this summer's national contract talks.
   Chrysler's parts operations were grouped into the subsidiary
last spring, but most of Acustar's 28,000 workers have been with
Chrysler since it battled back from the brink of bankruptcy early
in the decade, when they granted concessions to keep the company
afloat.
   Chrysler workers think the potential sale, now that the No. 3
carmaker is again earning billion-dollar profits, indicates they
won't be able to trust the company in the contract negotiations.
   More than 1,000 workers vented their anger last week outside
Chrysler's Highland Park headquarters, waving signs and shouting
``Strike! Strike!'' at an emotional rally led by United Auto
Workers Vice President Marc Stepp.
   One sign read: ``Concessions In '79, The Shaft In '88.''
   Stepp, who will lead negotiations with Chrysler, said he will
give UAW locals permission to strike on a plant-by-plant basis,
based on local disagreements but because of the Acustar issue.
   Workers also are threatening to stop participating with
management on a variety of joint programs, like quality control.
   The Acustar controversy comes on top of Chrysler's announcement
that it will close its assembly plant at Kenosha, Wis., this year
and idle 5,500 workers. Chrysler acquired the plant last year when
it bought American Motors.
   State and local officials charged that Chrysler had promised to
keep the plant running for five years. Wisconsin's governor
threatened to sue, and last week the UAW went to court on its own
in an attempt to keep the plant open.
   ``Many of these workers gave concessions and made considerable
sacrifices to help the company make it,'' said Harley Shaiken, a
labor and technology expert at the University of California at San
Diego.
   ``They thought they were investing in their future, and Acustar
represents an uncertain future if it's sold. Chrysler
underestimated the strength of the reaction and the fact that it
has spread beyond Acustar workers and affected the entire
company,'' he said.
   One of those workers is Roger Fitzpatrick, a member of UAW Local
1435 at an Acustar machining plant in Perrysburg, Ohio.
   ``Yes, we will strike,'' he said at last week's rally.
``Whatever it takes to keep them from selling it. ...
   ``We're also going to shut down all (quality) meetings, anything
that's joint with management and the union. We will not attend,
none of them.''
   Chrysler Vice President Baron Bates said the company is still
weighing the Acustar sale. He said the workers' anger and their
future under a new owner will be factors in the decision.
   Bates said Chrysler views the bitter responses to the Kenosha
closing and the backlash against the Acustar sale as two separate
issues rather than a snowballing deterioration in labor relations.
   There is also tension over Chrysler's continuing efforts to get
more work out of fewer employees.
   ``What's irritating workers is not simply Acustar. That has
served as a lightning rod for other issues,'' Shaiken said.
``There's a lot of pressure in Chrysler plants.''
   Workers see another threat. With the sale, Chrysler could become
the first Big Three automaker to follow the Japanese model of
treating parts and assembly workers as two distinct classes.
   If Acustar is sold, its workers face lower wages and benefits
and probably won't receive the job protections the UAW won in the
three-year contracts negotiated last fall with Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors Corp.
   Chrysler has until Sept. 14, when its current three-year
contract expires, to sell Acustar and restructure itself as a
Japanese-style maker that builds engines and transmissions,
assembles vehicles and depends on outside suppliers for all other
parts.
   After the 70,000-worker contract expires, Chrysler almost
certainly will have to accept the pattern contract established at
Ford and GM last fall that makes layoffs for reasons other than
slow sales costly and difficult.
   The contract also discourages moving work to outside suppliers.
   The UAW successfully resisted attempts by GM and Ford to
establish separate pay and benefit scales for parts workers last
fall and doesn't want a precedent that would encourage them to try
again in 1990.
   ``The stakes here go well beyond Chrysler,'' Shaiken said.
   The pay of Chrysler workers, who gave concessions from 1979
through 1983, returned to parity with workers at Ford and GM in a
1984 contract that included a base-pay increase in 1987. Auto
workers earn an average $12-$15 an hour in wages and $8-$10 an hour
in benefits.

   Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, should
continue to speak out on controversial issues, according to a
public opinion poll published in The Mail on Sunday.
   The survey of 1,086 adults, conducted by National Opinion Poll,
said 56 percent of Britons believe their future king should speak
out more and only 14 percent believe he should say less.
   More than half, 57 percent, said speaking out on controversial
issues is what Charles should spend most of his time doing,
followed by 23 percent who feel he should be a diplomat or work
full-time for a charity and 15 percent who would limit him to a
purely ceremonial role.
   When asked who they would rather have as prime minister, the
39-year-old Charles or the incumbent, Margaret Thatcher, 38 percent
said Mrs. Thatcher and 31 percent said the prince.
   The poll follows a week in which Charles made news for revealing
he has banned aerosols from his household for fear they damage the
environment.
   He was also quoted as telling newspaper editors he had to fight
royal protocol to develop his role as Prince of Wales and that
sometimes he wished he were Bob Geldof, the Irish rock story who
raised millions of dollars for African famine relief.

   Singer Massimo Ranieri won a yearly
competition of Italian popular music with a song about middle-age
love, despite critics' complaints that most of this year's songs
sounded alike.
   Ranieri, now 37, made his first appearance at the San Remo song
festival when he was 17. He won on Sunday with ``Perdere L'Amore''
(Losing My Love).
   Twenty-six singers competed for the first prize in the four-day
festival, which was broadcast live on state-run RAI television and
ended early Sunday morning.
   The winners don't receive prize money, but some have gone on to
stardom. Domenico Modugno shot to international fame after winning
the song fest in 1958 with ``Nel blu dipinto di blu,'' also known
as ``Volare.''
   Foreign artists such as Paul McCartney, who opened the closing
night with his song ``Once Upon A Long Ago,'' stole much of the
spotlight. Other foreigners who performed included George Harrison,
Ben E. King, Joe Cocker, Bon Jovi, Art Garfunkel, Robbie Robertson,
Bryan Ferry and Belinda Carlisle.
   However, the foreigners came in for criticism because, unlike
the Italian competitors who sang live, most of them lip-synched
their songs.

   Carmel Mayor Clint Eastwood won a
lengthy battle when the state Coastal Commission approved a
two-story commercial and office building on a lot adjacent to the
actor's Hog's Breath Inn.
   Eastwood was on location filming his latest ``Dirty Harry'' film
and couldn't be reached for comment about the action taken Friday,
six years after the project on the 7,500-square-foot lot in
downtown Carmel was proposed.
   Eastwood's fight with city planning officials was partial
inspiration for his entry into politics in a community he
considered hostile to developers, and it provided a plank in his
1985 mayoral campaign.
   He recently announced that he will not seek a second term when
his current term expires in May.
   Eastwood sued the city when planners and the council said his
project was too bulky, then compromised on the design to gain
approval.

   A penthouse once owned by Texas
Gov. John Connally was sold at auction for $225,000 to an
unidentified Dallas buyer.
   The buyer, whose bid came by an audio hookup, gained a penthouse
overlooking the Gulf of Mexico with 3,845 square feet of living
space and 3,405 square feet of tiled balconies.
   The spacious, two-story marble-floored penthouse was once valued
at $1 million, but like the rest of Texas' real estate market,
things have gone soft on this resort island.
   More than 60 units, located on the island and in nearby
Brownsville, went on the block Saturday. None among the
standing-room-only crowd responded to a request for a $250,000 bid
for Connally's penthouse.
   Connally has filed for personal bankruptcy and last month had
his personal property auctioned off, raising $2.7 million to help
pay his creditors.

   Fourteen months afer he grasped his
long-sought prize, the governorship of Arizona, Evan Mecham returns
to the state Capitol from exile Monday for a Senate impeachment
trial which could end his political life.
   In recent days, Mecham has battled to stop the trial. He has
said that his constitutional rights are being violated. He hired
new lawyers who petitioned senators and the state Supreme Court to
halt the proceedings.
   But the Senate would tolerate no delays, and the Supreme Court
said it could not breach the separation of powers doctrine by
interfering in a legislative matter.
   ``The people of this state should be as scared and frightened as
all get-out,'' Mecham, 63, said at a weekend news conference.
``This isn't Ev Mecham's rights we're talking about. This is basic
rights in the state of Arizona.''
   The conservative Republican governor renewed his vow that he
would not take the easy way out and resign.
   ``My resignation would write a bad chapter in the history of
Arizona,'' he said as he stood before reporters in down home
western garb: boots, blue jeans, a powder blue jacket, plaid shirt
and a string tie with a huge silver and torquoise clasp.
   ``That would be giving in to the powers who have schemed and
planned to put so much pressure on me that I would eventually
resign,'' he said.
   Mecham insisted he should be allowed to resolve a March 22
criminal trial before the impeachment trial and its publicity.
   ``As governor of the state, I ask nothing more than is accorded
to any garden variety criminal,'' he said of the due process rights
he demanded. ``I certainly do not think that as governor I should
be accorded anything less.''
   Some members of the Senate suspected that what Mecham really
wanted was to delay the impeachment trial until after his scheduled
May 17 recall election, hoping for an outpouring of support from
constituents who elected him on his fifth try for the office.
   But the 30-member Senate refused to allow any delay.
   ``We've got to get going. The people of Arizona deserve a fair
break and the fair break is that the trial moves forward,'' said
Senate Democratic Minority Leader Alan Stephens.
   To convict Mecham, two-thirds of the senators must find that
Mecham committed ``high crimes, misdemeanors or malfeasance in
office.''
   Upon conviction, the Senate could bar him from ever holding
public office again.
   Although Mecham is best known outside Arizona for a series of
public gaffes and outrageous comments which offended many minority
groups, he is not on trial for those acts.
   Mecham is charged with three misdeeds _ concealing a $350,000
campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund
by loaning it to his car dealership and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official.
   The House of Representatives, which impeached Mecham Feb. 5,
detailed the allegations in 23 articles of impeachment, the
equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case.
   After his impeachment, Mecham was required to step aside as
governor pending outcome of the trial. However, he is still
addressed as governor and draws his regular salary. He set up
offices in suburban Glendale in what he calls his ``government in
exile.''
   Secretary of State Rose Mofford is acting governor in his place.
   Frank X. Gordon, chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court, who
will preside over the impeachment trial, has called it ``perhaps
the most important proceeding in the history of Arizona.''
   ``Clearly these are volatile times,'' Gordon said. ``Perhaps
never in Arizona history have so many of our citizens had such
fervent beliefs on a given subject. We should be thankful that our
system of government is equipped to peacefully and fairly resolve
such a volatile situation. It is up to all of us as citizens to let
the system work.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Continues Personal Involvement in Armenian Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with two prominent
Armenian writers in an unusual personal campaign to allay concerns
of Armenians demanding annexation of land in a neighboring
republic, two activists said Sunday.
   The writers, Silva Kaputikyan and Zori Balayan, met with the
Soviet leader on Friday, said Sergei Grigoryants, a Moscow-based
dissident, and Hovik Vassilian, an Armenian activist and editor of
the underground journal, The Armenian Matter.
   They said the writers met Thursday with Politburo member and
propaganda chief Alexander N. Yakovlev.
   ``Gorbachev said he'd take the matter under his personal control
and see to it that it gets the proper attention,'' Vassilian quoted
Kaputikyan as saying of the meeting with the Soviet leader.
Vassilian spoke in a telephone interview from Yerevan, the capital
of the Armenian republic.
   The official media carried no report on the Gorbachev meeting.
   It was the second time that Gorbachev had become involved in the
sensitive Armenian dispute, which erupted last week into street
demonstrations that witnesses said involved thousands of protesters.
   On Friday, Gorbachev appealed for ``civil maturity and
restraint'' in an address read on Armenian television by a senior
party official. In the address, Gorbachev promised that the
Communist Party Central Committee would review relations among the
Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.
   Until now, the 56-year-old leader had never injected himself
into an ethnic dispute since becoming party general secretary in
March 1985.
   He may have stepped in now as a defense of his policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness on social issues.
   Vassilian said that organizers of last week's massive protests
in Yerevan announced Friday they would hold no more protests until
March 26 so national authorities could have time to review the
dispute.
   The unrest has focused on the Delaware-sized region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, in the Caucasus Mountains. The region is inside
the republic of Azerbaidzhan, but Armenians want it to be annexed
to their republic.
   More than 80 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh's 157,000 residents are
Aremenian.
   The official news agency Tass and central Soviet television on
Saturday tried to calm the population and play down reports of
ethnic trouble by taking up the theme of brotherhood.
   They carried interviews with ethnic Armenians and Azerbaidzhanis
saying they live together in harmony and that it was important for
everyone to return to their jobs.
   The media said some workers in Yerevan even showed up
voluntarily for work Sunday, their day off, to make up for time
lost while they were away from their jobs demonstrating.
   Grigoryants and other witnesses said hundreds of thousands of
Armenians took to the streets of Yerevan last week to press their
demands after the ruling Politburo rejected an annexation proposal.
   The decision to hold off on more protests apparently was a
result of Gorbachev's address and of an Armenian Central Committee
decision to ask for a review of the dispute by national leaders.
   Vassilian said about 150,000 demonstrators gathered Saturday on
Yerevan streets to continue the protest, but he said the city was
calm Sunday.
   Armenian activists have sent a lengthy report to the central
government in Moscow outlining why they believe Nagorno-Karabakh
should be made part of Armenia, Vassilian said.
   Grigoryants said that during a two-day visit to Yerevan, he
learned that ethnic Russians had been brought in to replace the
mostly Armenian local militia force and that 28 planeloads of
soldiers had been flown into the capital to help keep order.
   At one point last week, Grigoryants said, workers at the state
broadcasting authority, Gostelradio, threatened to stop all
transmissions unless soldiers were withdrawn from broadcast studios.
   The workers also demanded the right to broadcast reports on the
demonstrations. Within a day, the soldiers were pulled out of the
studios and reports on the demonstrations appeared on Armenian
television, Grigoryants said.

<TEXT>
   Cream pies flew, old flicks rolled and fans
talked to to an old Three Stooges supporting actor when about 1,000
die-hard fans of the celebrated knuckleheads gathered for a weekend
of _ nyuk, nyuk _ Stoogemania.
   ``I've loved Larry, Moe and Curly ever since I was 5 years
old,'' said Virginia Riviera, 30, who came with two friends from
Salem, Mass.
   They and others swapped memorabilia, threw pies and watched such
films as ``Three Little Pigskins,'' ``All the World's a Stooge,''
``Dizzy Doctors'' and ``Disorder in the Court.''
   ``I'd go anywhere there's a Three Stooges convention,'' said
Riviera, ``as long as I don't have to fly.''
   Curly impersonator David Knight ``was involved in everything,''
Joe Jerrier, one of the convention's organizers, said Sunday.
``When he showed up the place was just jammed.''
   Knight, an iron worker from Palmyra, N.Y., who bears a pate much
like his cinematic hero's, tweaked ears and performed Curly's
outrageous antics to the delight of fans who came from as far away
as San Francisco for the two-day exercise in Stoogery.
   Jerrier said nostalgia has sparked a resurgence of interest in
an act famous for head-knocking, face-slapping, belly-butting
slapstick, pratfalls and endless buffoonery.
   The original Three Stooges, created in the vaudeville days of
the 1920s, were Morris ``Moe'' Horowitz, who later changed his last
name to Howard; his brother Samuel ``Shemp,'' and Larry Fineberg,
a.k.a. Fine.
   By the early '30s, Shemp had left in a pay dispute and Jerome
``Curly,'' another Horowitz brother, took over.
   The Stooges made more than 190 short films and about 50
feature-length films until the '60s, said Jerrier. Moe was the last
Stooge to die, in 1975.
   In one room, Three Stooges postcards, T-shirts, belts, ceramic
masks and hand puppets were displayed on tables.
   Also on display were books, publicity stills, movie posters and
a canceled check from Moe. A Stooge trivia contest was in progress
when the pie fight _ a highlight of the event _ broke out.
   ``I was emcee and I didn't even get a chance to close my eyes,''
said Jerrier, 37, a firefighter from Gardiner, Maine. ``I got four
of 'em.''
   A telephone call was placed to Emil Sitka and fans were allowed
to chat with the man who played a host of older men's roles in more
than 60 Stooge films.
   Sitka, who is in his 70s and now lives in Camarillo, Calif., was
one of the few actors who played alongside Shemp as well as Curly,
said Jerrier, who claims one of the country's largest videocassette
collections of Stooge flicks.
   Jerrier said Shemp quit because each of the Stooges was making
$100 a week while their manager earned $2,000.
   The convention raised more than $4,000 by Sunday afternoon for
cancer research, said Jerrier. Ron Eugley, another organizer, said
at least 1,000 fans showed up.
   In addition to footage from Stooge films, fans were treated to
rare footage of Curly's wedding, Moe barbecuing, the Stooges in
baseball uniforms in the Chicago Cubs dugout in 1938, and on the
Queen Mary in 1939.
   George Likar said he's been a member of the national Three
Stooges Fan Club since 1985.
   ``I got hooked 10 years ago, watching them on TV,'' said Likar,
who flew in from Joliet, Ill. ``The Stooges are great! Curly's my
favorite. He gets to do all the things I wish I could do.''

   Israel's navy sank a boat carrying
Palestinian guerrillas who were planning an attack against Israel,
killing two Arabs on board, police said Sunday.
   An Israeli patrol intercepted the vessel off the southern
Lebanese port city of Tyre shortly after nightfall on Saturday,
police said. Three of the five guerillas on board swam to safety
and were captured, they said.
   Police said the squad belonged to the Libyan-backed Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, which is
based in Damascus, Syria.
   But Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization's mainstream
guerrilla faction, said the guerrillas were Fatah members.
   Fatah sources in Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon,
said the squad had planned to attack the northern Israeli coastal
town of Nahariya to avenge the killing of three PLO officers in
Cyprus two weeks ago.
   The PLO had blamed the Feb. 14 car bombing in Limassol, Cyprus,
on Israel's secret service, Mossad. The victims were identified as
Col. Marwan Kayyali, Lt. Col. Mohammed Sultan and Lt. Col. Mohammed
Buheis.
   Police in Tyre who interrogated the surviving guerrillas quoted
them as saying they belonged to the Popular Front, which is headed
by former Syrian army captain Ahmed Jibril.
   The front claimed responsibility for a Dec. 26 attack on an army
base in northern Israel by a guerrilla who flew a motorized
hang-glider across the border from Lebanon. Six Israeli soldiers
were killed and eight wounded by hand grenades and gunfire before
the attacking guerrilla was shot and killed.
   Israel radio reported Sunday that Palestinian guerrilla
organizations and anti-Israel Lebanese militia groups were
developing small navies to infiltrate Israel. It said guerrillas
receive their training in Arab countries and eastern Europe.
   The Israeli navy carries out routine patrols off the Lebanese
coast, frequently stopping and searching suspicious vessels.
   On Dec. 11, guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Shiite Hezbollah, or
Party of God, organization opened fire on an Israeli patrol vessel,
killing one soldier. The Israeli boat sank the Hezbollah craft, and
four militiamen drowned.
   Three years ago, an Israeli navy vessel sunk a ship carrying 28
guerrillas who the navy said were on their way to attack targets
inside Israel.

   The seeds of this week's summit meeting at
NATO's sprawling headquarters were planted nearly 16 months ago
when President Reagan faced Mikhail S. Gorbachev across a plain
wooden table in a house in Iceland and seemed to forget Western
Europe's interests.
   It was October 12, 1986, and as dusk crept over the windows at
Hofdi House in Reykjavik and the whole world waited, Reagan and
Gorbachev got into a hot negotiation about the possibility of
scrapping all their nuclear missiles.
   They failed. But when details of the talks came out, Western
European allies who had depended on a no-surprise U.S. defense and
arms control style for 39 years wondered if Reagan had forgotten to
take their needs into consideration.
   ``We don't think it's a fair accusation,'' said a Reagan
administration official. ``We've consulted with the allies
assiduously before and after Reykjavik, but there's no denying the
perception is there among Europeans that the U.S. was willing to
make drastic reductions in nuclear weapons, over their heads.''
   ``The summit in Brussels will give them a bully pulpit to get
their views across,'' said the official, one of several U.S. summit
planners who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   ``That's not to say we don't want a summit; we think it's
important to have this meeting at this juncture, for sound,
alliance reasons,'' the official said.
   ``It will let President Reagan show that despite some of the
recent dents in his Teflon shield, he is an active and commanding
presence. But on a scale of one to 100, the Europeans want it 60 or
70 and we want it 40 or 30.''
   The Europeans' aim for the first NATO summit since 1982 is not
just to remind Reagan of their interests as he heads for another
meeting with Gorbachev, in Moscow in the spring.
   It is to talk ``through him'' to whoever replaces Reagan as
president next January and to set the stage for what is likely to
be several years of alliance-wide agonizing over the future of its
internal relationships and its dealings with the Soviet Union.
   The leaders will gather at the sprawling NATO headquarters on
the outskirts of Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday. The public
will be barred from all but a brief opening and brief closing
session and several hours have been devoted to meetings without
large numbers of aides.
   At the end, the leaders will issue a declaration summarizing
their goals and ideals for NATO's future. There also is talk of
issuing a separate statement on conventional weapons.
   Rozanne Ridgway, assistant secretary of state, said Sunday that
two summit issues would be: ``how do we stay strong so that we
don't make the world safe for conventional war or invite it'' and
how to get the Soviets to reduce their now-stronger non-nuclear
forces?
   The Europeans fear that with the possibility of a nuclear-free
world, they may end up with no protection against the superior
Soviet forces. Ridgway, interviewed on Cable News Network's
``Newsmaker Sunday,'' said, however, she believes the NATO alliance
will always have ``a combination of conventional and nuclear
deterrents.''
   On an issue prompted partly by domestic budget pressure on
Reagan, Ridgway said the president will take NATO a message on
``burden-sharing,'' NATO jargon for dividing up the manpower and
financial load of maintaining Western defenses. She did not say
what the message would be but said, ``They can do more. We can do
more.''
   Any private understandings at the meeting will be transmitted to
lower-level groups that have been working for months to provide
answers to some of the questions posed by a new climate of
East-West relations ushered in since Gorbachev's accession.
   The leaders are less likely to dwell on the nuts and bolts of
defense and arms control problems facing the alliance in the short
run.
   NATO has already committed itself to a U.S.-Soviet plan to
reduce long-range nuclear weaponry by 50 percent. Granted, there is
still some haggling within NATO on the pace and scope of
negotiations on short-range nuclear forces, chemical weapons and
conventional forces. But the leaders are not expected to spend much
time on these details, leaving those tasks to other officials and
other forums.
   Nor is Reagan expected to get into a general discussion of
problems the United States is having with some of the allies over
the continuation of American base rights. Talks with those
countries _ Portugal, Spain and Greece _ are being handled
elsewhere.
   Beyond the internal problems, perhaps hovering over them, is the
broadest issue of all: the relevancy of the Western alliance at a
time when the Soviet Union is exhibiting signs of major reform and
appears to be more forthcoming than ever in meeting Western demands
_ like one for a withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The alliance has stuck together for four decades out of fear of
an expansionist and untrustworthy Soviet Union dominated by its
military leaders.
   After nearly three years of Gorbachev and no sign in letup in
the ferment in his country and among some of his allies, NATO
leaders are wondering how their alliance should respond.
   At their summit this week, ``I think it's going to be both a
moment of looking at the success that the alliance has had and
getting down to the hard issues ahead _ the analysis of the current
situation in the Soviet Union, the opportunities it might
present,'' one official said.

   More than 10,000 people crowded a hillside
in this coastal city Sunday to witness an apparition of the Virgin
Mary that never appeared, and some went away with sore eyes.
   People came from all parts of Italy to gather at the foot of a
16-foot high cross and stare into the sun.
   A local woman, Maria Fioritti, claimed that she had seen a
vision of the Madonna each week and invited Italians to join her to
see for themselves. The claim received wide publicity in the
Italian press.
   But the crowd stared in vain and, according to state-run RAI

   The leader of the main opposition Social
Democrat Populist Party stepped down Sunday as party chairman, the
Anatolia news agency said.
   The agency said Erdal Inonu, son of the late President Ismet
Inonu, did not give a reason for his resignation from the party
post. He was elected chairman in May 1986.
   Anatolia said that after Inonu announced his resignation, the
party's secretary-general, Fikri Saglar, announced that he also
would give up his post.
   The agency said that Inonu told reporters that he also would
resign as a member of Parliament. But Hikmet Cetin, deputy head of
the party's parliamentary group, later announced that Inonu
retracted that decision.
   The Social Democrat Populist Party was formed in December 1985
by a merger of the Social Democratic Party and the Populist Party.
It has 99 deputies in Turkey's 450-member Parliament.

   Four Dominican stowaways who were
locked in the cargo hold of a container ship set a fire to get the
crew's attention, but the blaze burned out of control, the Coast
Guard said.
   Coast Guard spokesman Alan Burd said no one was injured in the
fire aboard the 560-foot Nedlloyd Singapore.
   ``When the ship's crew went in to fight the fire, they found
four Dominicans that had stowed away in the ship's last port of
call,'' he said. ``It appears that the four stowaways set the fire
intentionally to attract the crew's attention because they were
locked in this cargo hold.''
   Burd said the Dominicans were rescued unharmed and turned over
to local police.
   One crew member fell while fighting the fire and appeared to
have broken a leg, but no other injuries were reported.
   The Dominicans boarded the ship Friday night in the Dominican
Republic port of Haina, about 10 miles west of the capital Santo
Domingo, a spokesman for the Puerto Rico Police Department said. It
docked in San Juan early Sunday.
   Burd said the fire was first reported around 2:30 a.m. and raged
out of control about an hour later.
   There was no immediate estimate of damages.

   An Ethiopian Airlines pilot trainee
landed a small plane at Khartoum Airport and asked for asylum in

   The source said Gabre Getahon, 22, was handed over to Sudanese
security authorities and the Cessna, which belonged to Ethiopian
Airlines, was under guard at the airport.
   Other sources said Getahon decided to defect to Sudan on
Saturday, while on a training flight in the small aircraft.
   He was quoted as saying that he first planned to land at
ed-Damazin, in southeastern Sudan near the Ethiopian border, but
could not land there because of maintenance operations under way at
the airport. He then followed the Blue Nile to Khartoum Airport,
where he put down the plane.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Getahon is
from Tigre province in northern Ethiopia, where a rebellion has
been going on for years.
   He told Sudanese authorities he fled to escape ``repression'' in
his homeland, the sources said.
   He also reportedly claimed to have made several previous
defection attempts via Kenya before joining the airline but was
caught and returned to Ethiopia.

   The governing body of the Organization of
American States sidestepped a position on political instability in
Panama, refusing in an extraordinary eight-hour session to chose
between two men claiming to be the country's ambassador.
   ``In Panama, there are two presidents _ one who represents
civilian authority and one who represents military power,'' Costa
Rican OAS Ambassador Guillermo Villalobos Arce told the OAS's
permanent council.
   Most of the speakers during the session, which ended at about
midnight Saturday, voiced support for ousted Panamanian President
Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Delvalle sent Lawrence Chewning Fabrega to represent Panama,
while military strong man Manuel Antonio Noriega sent Roberto
Leyton, who has been the envoy. Leyton protested that the
discussion violated the organization's charter and said the
permanent council was an inappropriate forum for an airing of his
country's ``internal affairs.''
   Over the course of the session, the OAS ambassadors heard bitter
recriminations about promises the Nicaraguan Sandinistas failed to
keep, allegations the United States seeks to destabilize Panama,
invocation of the name of the late Panamanian strong man Gen. Omar
Torrijos, and questions about America reneging on its commitment in
two 1979 treaties to completely transfer control of the Panama
Canal to Panama by the turn of the century.
   Just for good measure, Gabriel Lewis, a former Panamanian
ambassador to the United States who is now part of Noriega's
political opposition, had OAS technicians play a tape-recording of
his telephone conversation earlier in the day with a distressed
Mariela Delvalle, wife of the deposed president.
   In it, she told Lewis what she had told military officers who
came looking for Delvalle: ``My husband is not here, nor are you
going to find him.''
   But the council failed to come to grips with the question of
whether to recognize the portfolio of Leyton or Chewning.
   Representatives of several non-OAS countries, seated in a
section for official observers, gave Chewning an ovation when he
briefly entered the mahogany-walled council chamber and conferred
with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who came as an observer.
   But from the time the council meeting was supposed to start, at
4 p.m. EST, until shortly after 9 p.m., the action was away from
the council chamber, as the roughly 30 ambassadors wrangled in
private over whether to seat Leyton or Chewning.
   A carnival atmosphere developed as Lewis, Chewning and Kennedy
alternately met with reporters in the ornate lobby of the OAS
building, while musicians, waiters and waitresses prepared one
floor above for a dinner-dance.
   At one point, the U.S. ambassador to the OAS, Richard T.
McCormack, shrugged his shoulders, and told a reporter, ``I'm
supposed to be up there. I'm the host for that thing.''
   This was just moments before the formal debate began _ and just
after a rumored deal to settle the credentialing problem had
collapsed.
   A member of the U.S. mission, talking on grounds of anonymity,
said the OAS council members had seriously discussed seating
neither Leyton nor Chewning. This official said they came close to
giving the seat to Soraya Cano, a career Panamanian diplomat.
   But Paraguay's Juan Alberto Llanes, chairman of the OAS
permanent council, ruled that for purposes of the debate, Leyton
must be seated _ and he was. And that's when the fireworks began.
   ``The chairman feels it is important and necessary to have a
representative of the sister republic of Panama present,'' he said.
   Given the floor, Leyton declared: ``A precedent is being set
here because the representative of Panama considers that the events
taking place in my country are strictly matters of our own internal
affairs.''
   Guatemala's ambassador, Francisco Villagran, countered with an
assertion that ``we are faced with a historic decision. Will we be
in favor of autocratic governments?''
   McCormack denounced Delvalle's ouster by Panama's National
Assembly.
   ``What we do or do not do ... could have a strong bearing on the
decisions of other generals as they decide whether or not to let
democracies survive,'' he said.
   Nicaragua's Carlos Tunnermann took up for Leyton, saying the OAS
debate could not be allowed ``to serve as a pretext for
interventionist action.''
   Lewis gave the debate its most riveting moments as he came to
the table as a specially appointed representative of the government
of El Salvador.
   When Leyton vehemently opposed Lewis' seating, waving his arms
to emphasize his points, Lewis reminded the Panamanian that ``it
was here, where we condemned (former Nicaraguan strong man
Anastasio) Somoza. He repressed the Nicaraguan people, and now the
Sandinistas take away the right of self-determination.''
   ``We are suffering a new phenomenon _ narco-militarism,'' Lewis
said in attacking Noriega. ``This narcotic-militarism knows no
frontier. It is dedicated to the illicit trade that respects no
borders, no boundaries.''
   Two federal grand juries in Florida accused Noriega of drug
trafficking charges earlier this month.
   This was not the kind of government Torrijos envisioned when he
joined President Jimmy Carter in signing the Panama Canal treaties
in 1979, he said.
   McCormack took the opportunity to say the United States had no
intention of ``backing down'' on the treaty commitments _ as Leyton
had suggested.
   Leyton persisted, nonetheless.
   ``We demand that the government of El Salvador furnish proof of
these allegations,'' he said. Leyton directed his fire at El
Salvador because that country had requested the emergency OAS
session.
   ``This forum is being used like a political circus,'' Leyton
screamed.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz finally
made a little headway Sunday in his uphill fight to gain Arab and
Israeli support for negotiations on a Middle East settlement.
   ``They liked the package,'' said a senior U.S. official after
Shultz outlined his proposal in a three-hour meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo.
   Shultz then flew to Israel to resume his discussions with Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir Sunday night over dinner and with Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres on Monday before flying to Amman for a second
round of talks with Jordanian officials.
   ``We have a package that is promising _ at least we think it is
promising,'' Shultz said after seeing Mubarak. ``Whether anyone
else thinks it is promising is a question.''
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismat Abdel-Meguid, standing alongside
Shultz under cloudy Cairo skies, did not respond.
   But a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity on
Shultz's flight to Jerusalem, said that Egypt had endorsed the U.S.
proposal.
   On Saturday, Syrian and Jordanian officials rejected the plan as
unacceptable.
   Shultz's plan, which he outlined for Mubarak on notepaper, calls
for immediate negotiations to provide some self-rule for the 1.5
million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The second stage would involve negotiations by December on
an overall settlement of the decades-old Jewish-Arab dispute.
   ``What we are seeking is a comprehensive peace in the Middle
East,'' Shultz said after the meeting. ``That means we have to
consider all the countries, security issues, the Palestinian
people, their aspirations, their legitimate rights.''
   Mubarak saw Shultz to the door and shook his hand, but did not
emerge to face reporters and cameras.
   Egypt's attraction to the plan could be based in part on the
fact that Mubarak last month in talks with President Reagan in
Washington pushed very hard for an overall settlement instead of an
interim arrangement on the Palestinian issue.
   Shultz's reference to a comprehensive agreement echoed the
advice from the Egyptian leader.
   Egypt also has had a peace treaty with Israel for nine years and
is in the midst of improving relations with its Jewish neighbor.
   Jordan's King Hussein, on the other hand, has ducked and weaved
for some 20 years on the issue of negotiating with Israel. He has
held back until now because he cannot be sure how much of the West
Bank would be returned to his control. Jordan occupied the
territory from 1949 to 1967, when Israel captured the land in the
Middle East war.
   Syria, meanwhile, takes among the hardest lines towards Israel
in the Arab world and has been reluctant to approve any
U.S.-negotiated initiative. It also is a close ally of the Soviet
Union, which Shultz is not inclined to give a major role in peace
negotiations.
   Indeed, Syrian and Jordanian officials stressed Saturday after
meeting with Shultz that they want the Soviet Union and the
Palestine Liberation Organization to take part in negotiations for
a Middle East peace.
   The United States and Israel want the PLO excluded and Soviet
influence limited.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Saturday the PLO has named a
delegation of Palestinians to meet Shultz. But Shultz was not
expected to meet with the PLO delegation.
   Fifteen Palestinians from the occupied territories of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip earlier rejected an invitation to meet with
Shultz.
   Shultz will return to Amman on Monday to review again the U.S.
plan with Crown Prince Hassan, Prime Minister Zaid Rifai and
Foreign Minister Taher Masri.
   But a final decision is unlikely, at least until Shultz sees
Hussein in London on Tuesday.
   The king has steered clear of Shultz's shuttle, reportedly to
have dental surgery.
   A Shamir aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``It's
a very strong signal that he (Hussein) doesn't want to get
involved.''
   In the meantime, the U.S. official said, ``The chances are still
good that Shultz will return to the Middle East after attending the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting in Brussels on
Wednesday and Thursday.''

   While a charity was collecting money to
help a man keep his electricity flowing, a city worker quietly went
to the power company and paid the bill out of his own pocket.
   ``I went down there to take care of that thing ... and I found
out it was paid,'' Nelson Johnson, who is unemployed, said Friday.
   He said he was told that George Tanner, a deputy city marshal,
had paid the bill Wednesday, the day after a newspaper described
Johnson's problems.
   ``I thought (Johnson) was in need and God has been good to me,''
said Tanner. ``My heart always goes out to those in need,'' he said.
   Johnson's troubles included not only the $63.41 bill, which was
90 days overdue, but the need to keep his 4-month-old daughter on
an electric heart monitor because of seizures and breathing
problems.
   Southwestern Electric Power Co., which had threatened to cut off
Johnson's electricity, had agreed to give Johnson until Friday to
pay the bill.
   Christian Services, which helped him work out the delay, also
collected money to pay the bill.
   Johnson said he would use the gifts to pay for food and medicine
for his wife, 4-year-old son and his infant daughter.

<HEAD>Residents, Business Owners Fight Change from Clarks Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. RIGSBY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CLARKS HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been compared with the colonies'
fight to overthrow King George III. It's the little guy against the
establishment, the underdog fighting for a principle.
   And it's all about Congress, which changed the name of Clarks
Hill Lake to Strom Thurmond Lake, after the veteran Republican
senator from South Carolina, without asking local residents what
they thought of the idea.
   ``I think we should change the Constitution from `We the people'
to `You the Congress.' They could tell us what we need and what to
call everything down here,'' said Dan Elswick, owner of Ridge Road
Bait and Tackle in Appling, Ga.
   Some cite an emotional attachment to the name taken from this
nearby tiny town when the 70,000-acre Army Corps of Engineers lake
was first filled 44 years ago. Others say they've built a business
reputation on the name, bringing national fishing tournaments and
speedboat races and investing in souvenirs.
   Others are upset about the way the name of the lake on the
Georgia-South Carolina border was changed.
   Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., introduced a bill suggesting the
change on Dec. 3, two days before Thurmond's 85th birthday. The
Senate approved a similar measure on Dec. 4, and by Dec. 23,
President Reagan had signed it into law.
   Derrick said he was approached by the chairman of the Clarks
Hill-Russell Authority of South Carolina about changing the lake's
name.
   The eight-member authority was created in 1946 to ``assist,
promote and cooperate'' in the development of the Clarks Hill and
Russell lakes on the Savannah River.
   Chairman John McAllister said the board members, appointed by
the governor, decided amongst themselves that naming the lake after
Thurmond would be a good idea because of all he's done to support
the area.
   He said they didn't seek any public opinion because ``we were
not making the final decision. We had no control over Congress.''
   But when Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., introduced the
measure for the name change in the Senate, the authority's
unanimous support was entered into the Congressional Record.
   ``It was our impression that the local folks in the area were
supportive of the change ...,'' said Dole aide Jim Whittinghill.
   A number of businessmen around the lake have posted petitions
asking for a compromise _ change the name of the lake back to
Clarks Hill and leave the dam and the road across it named after
Thurmond, whose name is already on schools, federal buildings and
streets around the state.
   The petitions are being distributed by a group called ``Keep Our
Lake Clarks Hill,'' led by Roy Giles of Lincolnton, Ga., and
Phillip White of Clarks Hill.
   The two say they have more than 20,000 signatures so far, and
they've taken out newspaper ads, gone on television and radio and
are applying for status as a non-profit agency so they can accept
donations for the fight.
   They realize the compromise also will take an act of Congress.
And they think that will require support from Thurmond.
   Thurmond has said he was deeply honored by the lake's new name,
and he won't comment on the proposed compromise. He said he doesn't
consider the issue a serious problem and ``I do hope the
controversy will subside.''
   It's not the first time the lake's name has been changed. When
it was first created, a typographical error caused the name to
officially go down as ``Clark Hill Lake'' instead of ``Clarks Hill
Lake.''
   It took 26 years before Congress restored the missing ``s.''
   The person who sponsored that legislation was Thurmond.

   The piping plovers and roseate terns due
to arrive in nesting areas here in the coming weeks will be met by
thousands of gulls, renewing a battle blamed for the decline of the
endangered birds off Cape Cod.
   Thirty years ago, piping plovers and roseate terns outnumbered
the gulls nesting on Monomoy Island during the spring and summer.
   But last year just two pairs of piping plovers and seven pairs
of roseate terns nested at the Monomoy wildlife refuge, fighting
for survival against an estimated 70,000 gulls.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which runs Monomoy, this
month released a new master plan for the refuge that permits
poisoning the gulls to protect the endangered birds.
   The gull population explosion has coincided with rampant
residential development on the coast, where garbage in landfills
has given the gulls a new food source.
   ``We're giving them a free, hot lunch every day and the terns
and plovers just aren't adaptable enough to take advantage of that
opportunity,'' said Thomas French, director of the state's
endangered species program.
   ``They are competing for the same piece of land and the gulls
are much more aggressive,'' French said. ``They will eat the terns
for lunch.''
   There will be no poisoning this year because the plan was
released too late to conduct the necessary environmental study
before the migrating shorebirds arrive from winter habitats in the
South.
   But refuge manager Jack Fillio believes the plan will be used
next spring.
   ``I'm of the opinion that the gull population has expanded to
the point where this seems to be the most viable technology to
use,'' Fillio said in an interview last week. ``You could study the
issue until the plovers and terns are gone.''
   Animal rights activists have denounced the plan. But state and
federal environmental officials say they reluctantly endorse it as
a means of restoring balance to the habitat.
   Only one pair of herring gulls was spotted at Monomoy in 1961.
More than 15,000 pairs have nested there since 1980. There were no
black-backed gulls nesting at the refuge 25 years ago, but more
than 5,000 pairs have made it their summer home in recent years.
   Chris Lahey, conservation director for the Massachusetts Audubon
Society, said provisions in the new master plan endorsing gull
poisoning only as a last resort ``sound like a step in the right
direction.''
   Because poison cannot be used this year, Fillio said refuge
staffers will use wire mesh to fence off tern and plover nests and
disrupt gull nests near areas the endangered birds's nests.
   Bradford Blodgett, a state ornithologist, said nature may have
provided an alternative to poison. He said a new barrier island
created last year when a winter storm cut through a huge sandbar
off Chatham has created what could be a gull-free home for terns
and plovers.
   By breaking up gull nests established on the new island, the
terns and plovers could prosper undisturbed if they settle there,
Blodgett said.
   If the new island helps protect the piping plovers and terns, it
will be the second time in 50 years that nature helped the birds in
their fight against man's influence.
   Many species of shorebirds, particularly piping plovers, were
hunted almost to extinction in the latter part of the 19th century.
Their populations began to recover after passage of the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and then rebounded dramatically 20 years
later when a 1938 hurricane reshaped the land and provided new
nesting areas.

<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers and Israeli
soldiers clashed with Palestinians in this West Bank village,
leaving two Arabs dead, the army said Sunday. Israel radio said one
settler was jailed.
   Israeli police released two American teachers jailed overnight
after they were arrested while carrying posters listing the names
of two slain Palestinians.
   Details of the Saturday clash in Abud were sketchy and the army
said it was investigating to find out who fired the fatal shots in
the village 20 miles northwest of Jerusalem.
   Police interrogated three civilians in connection with the
slayings and arrested one, Israel radio reported. The man, from the
nearby Neve Zuf Jewish settlement, was to appear before a judge on
Monday, the radio said.
   The latest fatalities came as U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz pitched his Mideast peace plan, visiting Cairo for talks
with President Hosni Mubarak.
   Shultz's mission is aimed at opening Arab-Israeli peace talks
and halting violence in the occupied lands. But 11 Arabs have died
since Shultz arrived Thursday, and dozens more have been wounded.
   By U.N. count, 74 Arabs have been killed since the unrest began
Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza
Strip.
   Israel's navy sank a boat carrying five guerrillas who were en
route to carry out an attack in Israel, the military said. Lebanese
police said two Palestinians belonging to a Syrian-backed guerrilla
group were killed and the three others jumped overboard and were
captured by the Israelis.
   In another development, a military spokesman said the army has
arrested a soldier on suspicion of killing a Palestinian protester
a month ago. The daily Yediot Ahronot quoted witnesses as saying
the soldier caught a stone-throwing protester in the Gaza Strip and
shot him in the stomach.
   Three Arabs were killed Sunday in southern Lebanon when
guerrillas attacked an outpost manned by pro-Israeli militiamen at
Beit Yahoun near the Israeli border, Israeli military sources
reported. They said four militiamen were wounded.
   According to two Abud residents who did not see Saturday's clash
but said they learned of it from neighbors, about 15 military and
civilian vehicles entered Abud in the evening.
   The two witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they heard gunshots and were told soldiers and civilians were
shooting in the village of 3,000. One Arab was shot in his house
and the other outside, they said.
   Officials in the Ramallah Hospital identified the victims as
Raed Mahmoud Awad Barghouti, 17, who was shot in the head; and his
cousin Ahmed Ibrahim Mustafa Barghouti, 22, who was shot in the
stomach.
   An Arab source, who spoke with a relative of one victim, said
villagers also blamed the settlers.
   In Ramallah, two American teachers were released on bail after
spending a night in jail on suspicion of incitement, said their
lawyer, Jonathan Kuttab. He said police freed the two, Alison
Glick, 25, of Cincinnati, and John Benvenuto, 42, of Boston, after
they refused to sign a confession in Hebrew. No charges were filed,
but Kuttab said police told them they were still under
investigation.
   Glick and Benvenuto, who teach at a Quaker-run school in
Ramallah, carried felt-point pens and a poster with the names of
two Palestinians killed in the violence, Kuttab said.
   They were freed shortly after they were visited by a
representative of the U.S. Consulate in east Jerusalem, said
Benvenuto's mother, Marian Benvenuto of Rochester, N.Y., who said
she spoke to her son following his release.
   Israel's 24-member Cabinet debated the violence. Israel radio
reported that Transportation Minister Chaim Corfu proposed closing
the West Bank and Gaza to the media, but no decision was made.
   At Ein Arik, villagers said six carloads of settlers entered the
village Saturday night, smashed the windows in a van and several
houses, stoned homes and fired guns into the air.
   Touring Halhoul near a village where two Arabs were killed over
the weekend, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin heard complaints from
Arabs about beatings and shootings.
   ``Go to the village, and tell the people that if they will be
quiet, we'll be quiet, too,'' he said. ``As long as there will be
riots, residents will be hurt.''

<HEAD>Amy Hardin, Liver Transplant Recipient As Infant, Dies at 5</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAHOKIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amy Lynn Hardin, who underwent a liver
transplant at the tender age of 11 months thanks to vigorous
community fund-raising, has died at the age of 5.
   ``There will never be another one like her, not like my Amy,''
said her mother, Robin Hardin. ``She's at peace now.''
   Amy died at home Saturday. She would have turned 6 on June 1.
   Amy was born with biliary atresia, in which the bile ducts
malfunction and the liver becomes hard. She underwent surgery when
she was 6 weeks old and again at 3 months, but the operations were
unsuccessful.
   Doctors said her only chance for survival was a liver transplant.
   Amy's health became a cause for community residents, who rallied
in late 1982 and early 1983 to raise more than $260,000 for the
transplant.
   The rock group Kiss performed a benefit concert in 1983 at Kiel
Auditorium in St. Louis. That same year, Amy received a letter of
support from President Reagan.
   ``If it wasn't for the community getting together, we wouldn't
have had five years,'' Mrs. Hardin said. ``She was the joy of our
life. She was very strong. She fought all the way to the end.''
   The transplanted liver Amy received on May 10, 1983, began to
fail around Thanksgiving, Mrs. Hardin said.
   On Dec. 11, the family took Amy to the University of Minnesota
Hospital in Minneapolis, where the transplant had been performed.
She returned home Jan. 16 after doctors said her chances for
recovery were not good.
   ``She couldn't stand it anymore,'' Mrs. Hardin said. ``We made a
promise that we wouldn't take her back to the hospital. We brought
her home and the family took turns being with her.''
   Amy's transplant was termed a success, but her recovery was
hampered by a series of setbacks caused by rejection of the new
liver, viruses and side effects from medication.
   ``Doctors like to say that you are over the hump after five
years, but one can never say never. There are just too many
complications,'' Mary Stanik, spokeswoman for University of
Minnesota Hospital, said Saturday.
   Besides her parents, Amy is survived by two brothers.
   Funeral services will be Monday at Holy Family Church in Cahokia.

<TEXT>
   Missi Broussard says Christ saved her
from a life of drugs, sin and barroom brawling through one of Jimmy
Swaggart's ministries.
   Now Swaggart's fall has shattered her belief in a man she had
thought incorruptible, but she said her faith in God is unchanged.
   ``I had this image built of him (Swaggart). He could do no
wrong,'' she said. ``Now I know differently. He can do wrong, he
has done wrong, and he can do wrong again.''
   Broussard said Swaggart's confession to an unspecified sin
didn't sway her belief in God.
   ``Jimmy Swaggart did not change me. He did not have the power to
do so. Jesus Christ changed me,'' she said.
   She wasn't at church Sunday because she would have had to leave
halfway through the service, but she did go to a service Wednesday.
   Usually, she said, about 1,500 people meet in the Crossfire
building, which will hold about 5,000. ``This past Wednesday night
it was packed. They had to pull out seats for people to sit in.''
   Broussard, 21, said she will continue to attend co-pastor Jim
Rentz's services. But she doesn't know what she will do when
Swaggart, who reportedly paid a prostitute to pose nude for him and
tried to cover up the scandal, returns to the pulpit.
   ``The Lord is the one who led me to the church,'' she said. ``If
he wants to lead me away, I'm open for him to do so. But I'm not
going to sway on my own opinion of Jimmy Swaggart to decide whether
I go or stay.
   ``I really do feel like that speaks to most of the church.
They're looking to God now because they've learned their lesson
looking to a man.''
   Michael and Lisa Sexton never saw Swaggart as anything more than
human.
   ``He's a man, and all men make mistakes,'' said Sexton, who left
his home state of Idaho last year to be closer to Swaggart and his
ministry.
   ``I feel nothing but love in my heart for him and his family,''
said Mrs. Sexton, 21. ``He is a man of integrity for being able to
stand there and confess.''
   The Sextons met about seven years ago at an Assembly of God
youth group in Idaho, where they began watching Swaggart on
television. They began donating to his ministry about four years
ago, and first visited his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge 15
months ago.
   ``I felt the Lord wanted us to relocate,'' said Sexton, 27. He
got a job at the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant in Taft. They
moved last August to Luling and drive 90 minutes every Sunday to
and from Swaggart's church in Baton Rouge.
   Sexton said he was shocked by Swaggart's confession, but thinks
it was a good thing.
   ``It needed to happen. I sense he was somewhat relieved, because
he's going to get the help he needs.''
   And he said the sin doesn't change the good done by Swaggart's
ministries, which feed thousands of children a day and provide
medical care and other services to the poor.
   ``No one will ever know how many lives it (ministry) has
touched,'' he said.
   After Sunday's worship service during which Swaggart thanked the
congregation for their support, Irma Keel voiced faith in her
troubled minister.
   ``I think Brother Swaggart's a great pastor and I think God will
bring him out,'' she said. ``You see, God forgives us for
everything we do. He has the advocate with the father. He's my
brother in Christ.''
   ``You have to forgive and forget,'' said David Wilkerson,
another congregation member. ``You have to go on in the Lord.''

   It has been 10 months since the trial began,
seven months since the first witness appeared and an incredible
five years since the McMartin Pre-School molestation case hit the
courts.
   And there is no end in sight.
   Prosecutors say they will conclude their presentation by July,
but the defense isn't saying how long it may take.
   ``Sometimes it irks me when people talk about how long it's
been,'' says defense attorney Dean Gits, one of the players in this
long-running drama on the 15th floor of the downtown Criminal
Courts Building.
   ``This has to be put into perspective. The case is absolutely
unique,'' he said last week. ``We are dealing with allegations that
cover four to five years. Murders don't take that long; it's a
split second. Rapes and robberies don't take that long.
   ``How do you reconstruct a period of time that happened many,
many years ago and covers four to five years? If people don't
understand that then they don't understand why it's taking so
long.''
   Gits represents Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, who is on trial along
with her son, Raymond Buckey, 29, charged with 100 child
molestations at their now defunct family owned preschool in
suburban Manhattan Beach.
   With time, the case has changed.
   Five teachers originally charged had their cases dismissed for
lack of evidence. The prosecution, which once involved 41 children,
now focuses on 13 youngsters who have grown from toddlers to
pre-teen-agers.
   And the children's sometimes bizarre stories of satan worship,
animal mutilation and trips to remote places have all but vanished.
   ``I sense that they have weeded out those (children) who went
into fantasyland,'' says Gits.
   The latest child witness, a slender, 11-year-old boy, took the
stand last week, telling jurors in 15 minutes what he remembered of
his alleged molestation by Buckey and mentioning briefly that he
once saw Buckey kill a horse.
   In a now familiar pattern, the cross-examination by Gits and
Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, extended for days as the lawyers
tried to elicit details which the prosecution never sought.
   Details of the horse incident, for example, were almost
impossible to extract from the young witness who repeatedly
answered, ``I don't know.''
   But the boy, nervous and embarrassed, told of being fondled and
forced into oral copulation by Buckey and said he felt ``sick and
dirty'' when he drew pictures of the incident for his mother.
   Davis says he sees a pattern of fading memories. But Deputy
District Attorney Lael Rubin, who has guided the case almost from
its inception, says the child witnesses have improved with age.
   ``The children are more articulate. Their memories may not be as
detailed as several years ago, but they're older, more articulate
and less intimidated,'' she says.
   So far the jurors, who have sworn to stick with the trial no
matter how long it lasts, have heard from only five of the
children. Other prosecution witnesses called so far have included
doctors, police officers and parents.
   ``The really important witnesses are the children themselves,''
says Ms. Rubin's co-counsel, Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson.
``And the children have testified very well.''
   The trial's duration has had a personal impact on all
participants.
   The jurors, initially restless, have settled into a routine,
taking copious notes. Many of them carry lunchboxes as if they are
going to work.
   ``They've become part of the case and the commitment is coming
through,'' says Gits.
   Gunson jogs and rides a bicycle to relieve tension. Ms. Rubin
and Davis found that they had enrolled in the same health club, and
they often encounter each other working out in preparation for
their courtroom battles.
   Gits shuns exercise, saying, ``When I want to relax I smoke a
cigarette and drink a cup of coffee.''
   The greatest strain is on the defendants. The gray-haired Mrs.
Buckey, free on bail, sits and knits during recesses, chats with
courtroom spectators or thumbs through a small Bible.
   ``She has her faith and believes very much that God has helped
carry her through this,'' says Gits.
   Her son, who has been jailed without bail for nearly five years,
was granted $3 million bail just before Christmas. In spite of
pledges of property, he has been unable to raise the necessary
$300,000 in cash to gain release.
   But Davis says his client is in ``pretty good spirits,''
sustained by the knowledge he will one day get to tell his side
from the witness stand.
   Perhaps the most powerful figure in the courtroom is Superior
Court Judge William Pounders, who tries every day to move things
along quickly.
   Last November, one year after he took over the McMartin case,
Pounders marked the date by declaring, ``I don't intend to see
another anniversary date. I intend to conclude the case within the
next year.''

   When a small fire broke out above the stage of
the Marquis Theater, ``Me and My Girl'' star Jim Dale kept cool, as
did the full house of 1,600.
   Nobody was hurt in the incident, which interrupted Saturday's
matinee about 15 minutes into the first act of the
Tony-award-winning musical and sparked Dale's sense of humor.
   ``You've got to expect this if you come to see the hottest show
on Broadway,'' Dale told the playgoers after they filed back into
the theater after a 40-minute interruption.
   An overheated cable ignited a piece of rope in the proscenium
arch, out of view of the audience, said stage manager John Bonanni.
   ``There was a smell of smoke during the first scene, and after I
made my exit, I said, `Something's burning,''' Dale recalled Sunday.
   ``Then I heard a commotion, and I thought, `That's not in the
scene, shouting and carrying on.' I looked out, and people were
rushing out, up the aisles.''
   One of the show's managers calmed the crowd, which filed out in
an orderly fashion, Bonanni said. The fire was quickly extinguished
by stagehands.
   After city firefighters made a safety check, the audience was
let back in.
   A few jokes ``got them in a damn good mood,'' and then Dale
recapped the play's action up to the point of the fire and
retreated backstage.
   Dale, who plays a Cockney commoner who lands in the lap of
English aristocracy, said he ``couldn't resist an ad lib'' in a
later scene.
   ``I say to the butler, `You haven't got a cigarette, have you,
mate?' Then I turned to the audience and said, `I promise I won't
light up,''' he said.
   He thinks the incident cast a warm glow over the audience _
figuratively speaking.
   ``They love to be involved in something fresh and new,'' he
said. ``We can't supply a fire every day, though.''

   A swarm of earthquakes shook the desert
on both sides of the California-Mexico border but no damage or
injuries were reported from the late-night tremors, authorities
said Sunday.
   Six quakes measuring between 3.0 and 4.1 on the Richter scale
struck between 9 p.m. Saturday and midnight, clustered 19 miles
southwest of El Centro in the Imperial Valley and 75 miles east of
San Diego, said spokesman Robert Finn at the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena.
   The last three tremors were felt in Mexicali, a Mexican border
town that was shaken by damaging quakes on Nov. 23 and 24, said
fire department Lt. Antonio Makallon.
   ``Many panicked and fearful people called, but only those who
were in their houses felt the tremors,'' he said in Spanish.
   The November quakes caused four deaths, at least 94 minor
injuries and millions of dollars in damage on both sides of the
border. Those quakes registered 6.2 and 6.6 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage.

   Sen. Bob Dole charged on Sunday that Vice
President George Bush condoned trading arms for hostages in the
Iran-Contra affair, saying in a Republican presidential debate,
``We shouldn't do those things.''
   In a key confrontation before the March 8 Super Tuesday
primaries across the South, Rep. Jack Kemp slammed Bush and Dole _
the party's front-runners _ as two moderates who would raise taxes
and end the Reagan revolution.
   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported every
single tax increase over the last eight years,'' Kemp said. ``If
they're nominated, the Reagan revolution is over, gone, dead.''
   Bush and Dole objected, saying they have fought against tax
increases and for the Reagan administration's agenda for the past
seven years.
   They fired back at Kemp for what they contend is his casual
attitude toward the federal budget deficit.
   ``Jack's never met a deficit he didn't like,'' Dole said.
   Bush told the New York congressman, `You don't care about
deficits. You never have, and they're public enemy No. 1.''
   On the recent turmoil in Panama, both Dole and Kemp warned that
the United States will not tolerate instability near the Panama
Canal.
   ``If we've learned anything from Iran-Contra, we ought to give
(military strongman Manuel Antonio) Noriega 30 days to get out of
Panama or tell him we're going to have a trade embargo,'' Dole
said, adding the United States should ``de-recognize'' Noriega's
regime.
   Kemp said, ``If the Panamanians want to keep Noregia, the United
States of America is going to keep the Panama Canal.''
   It was the first debate with all four hopefuls since the New
Hampshire primary and it may be the last one for Bush.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater told reporters that Bush is not
scheduled to do any more debates, including the League of Women
Voters confrontation next Sunday in Nashville, Tenn. Dole campaign
manager Bill Brock said Bush is following a ``front-runner's
strategy'' by skipping the debate.
   Bush tried at one point in the debate to say Republicans should
not be criticizing each other, but that didn't stop Dole from
attacking the vice president for the Reagan administration's
decision to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``We never should trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issue
these reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ the
vice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and say
it's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said, holding
up a report on terrorism that was written by a commission headed by
Bush.
   Bush did not respond directly, but did say ``mistakes were
made'' in the Iran-Contra affair. Asked later if the affair had
occurred on ``his watch,'' Bush replied: ``I think when the
president found out what happened, he took the proper steps.''
   Bush has maintained throughout the affair that he did not know
the arrangement was an arms-for-hostage deal.
   Measures to protect the South's textile industry also caused
sparks, with Kemp accusing Dole and Pat Robertson of changing their
stands to please Southern voters. More than one-third of the
Republican nominating delegates are at stake in contests across the
South and elsewhere on March 8.
   ``Pat Robertson and Bob Dole sound like Dick Gephardt to me on
trade, and George Bush and Bob Dole say the budget deficit is
public enemy No. 1. I want to say I belive the Soviet Union is
public enemy No. 1,'' Kemp said after the debate.
   Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is the sponsor of a
tough trade measure that would require U.S. retaliation against
unfair practices by other countries.
   Kemp claimed that Robertson and Dole had said in Iowa, ``We'll
raise exports of food and grain _ and then go to South Carolina and
say we're going to put up barriers to imports.''
   Robertson retorted that he didn't want American jobs being lost
to workers in China with its Communist regime.
   There were also sharp exchanges on the question of how to reduce
the federal deficit, although each denied that they would raise
taxes as president.
   ``The problem is not revenues. It's spending,'' Kemp said. ``We
have a deficit because we have a Congress who spends too much
money...and interest rates are too high.''
   Bush, outlining his ideas, said: ``I've proposed a four-year
freeze that allows for inflation....that gives the president
flexibility.''
   Dole defended his own voting record, displaying a multi-page
list of what he said were his votes against tax increases since
1975. He complained that some campaign ads distort his record on
taxes _ a reference to Bush ads _ and then hit at Bush directly.
   ``I've been leading the efforts to reduce tax rates,'' Dole
said. ``You don't go the Bush route. It's a four-year
cop-out...We've got to reduce the deficit ... No one in this group
is advocating raising taxes.''
   Later, Bush fired back at Dole, saying the Kansas Republican's
plan for a one-year spending freeze would hurt defense.
   ``It will cut into the muscle on defense,'' Bush told Dole.
   And he defended his own four-year idea: ``I wouldn't call it a
cop-out. It disciplines the spending side.''
   Robertson said the problem is not one of economics.
   ``It's a question of will,'' he said, asking if Congress can
make hard decision to cut spending.
   Robertson, who has spent much of the past two weeks explaining
various statements on missiles in Cuba, hostages in Lebanon and the
source of the expose of problems afflicting fellow TV evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart, said the press is a big problem for candidates.
   ``I know it's very difficult dealing with the press of America
to get the truth out. They love to distort our words,'' Robertson
said. ``We are making it so difficult in our society for anyone to
serve.''
   The debate was sponsored by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
newspapers, moderated by the papers' Washington correspondent John
Mashek and televised live on the Cable News Network. The Democrats
took part in a similar debate on Saturday.
   The newspapers sponsored a similar forum Saturday night for the
six Democratic presidential candidates.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the nation enjoyed sunny skies Sunday, with temperatures
seasonably cool in the Northeast and seasonably mild in many other
sections.
   Light snow fell in scattered sections of Wisconsin and upper
Michigan and rain dampened the southern coast of California and
parts of Nevada. A few patches of dense fog remained along the
Texas Gulf Coast.
   About one-third of an inch of rain fell at Lovelock, Nev., and
Los Angeles during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST. An inch of
snow fell at Houghton, Mich., during the same period.
   At noon, temperatures were in the 30s in much of New England,
the 30s and 40s from the Great Lakes through the upper Missouri
Valley, and the 40s and 50s in the Pacific Northwest. Across the
South, noontime temperatures were in the 60s and 70s across
Florida, the 70s and low 80s in much of Texas and the 60s and 70s
across the desert Southwest and Southern California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 25 at
Jackson, Wyo., and Limestone, Maine, to 84 at Cotulla, Texas. The
low for the nation Sunday morning was 7 below zero at Houlton,
Maine.
   For Monday, snow showers were predicted in the lower Great
Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and upper Michigan, while rain showers
were expected to fall in much of California and be widely scattered
in Idaho and Utah.
   Highs will be in the teens and 20s in northern Maine, upper
Michigan, Wisconsin and much of Minnesota; the 30s and 40s from
southern Maine across Maryland, the remainder of the Great Lakes,
the Ohio Valley, the central Mississippi Valley, the northern half
of the Plains and the northern Rockies; the 70s from southern
Georgia and Florida across the lower Mississippi Valley; and in the
70s and 80s in Texas and the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, the highs
will generally reach the 50s and 60s.

   Iranian warplanes, usually crippled by
shortages of spare parts, bombed three key economic targets in Iraq
on Sunday. Iraq retaliated with air raids on two Iranian cities.
   Baghdad's state radio said Iraqi jets bombed the cities of
Hamadan in eastern Iran and Dezful in the southeast in simultaneous
raids at 9 p.m.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the attacks were in
retaliation for ``recent atrocities and crimes committed by the
charlatans of Iran.''
   Iran did not immediately confirm the Iraqi raids.
   In a separate dispatch, the Iraqi News Agency said Iranian
artillery over the weekend shelled ``purely civilian targets'' in
six Iraqi border towns and cities. It said said several people were
killed or wounded but gave no casualty figures.
   An earlier communique said two women and a child were killed and
several people, including four women, were wounded in Sunday's
shelling. It said seven civilians were killed and 16 wounded in
Basra and al-Qurna on Saturday.
   Tehran's War Information Headquarters said in a statement that
Iranian warplanes bombed a petrochemical plant in the southern port
of Basra, oil installations in Abul Khassib and a bridge linking
Umm Rassas island, in the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway, with
mainland Iraq.
   The tiny island is a forward Iraqi position southeast of Basra
on the southern sector of the front with Iran.
   All Iranian planes returned safely to base from the
``successful'' midmorning raids, said the communique, broadcast by
Tehran Radio and monitored in Nicosia.
   An exchange of air raids that began Saturday have prompted fears
that a new round of the ``war of the cities'' is beginning.
   Thousands of civilians have been killed in Iraq and Iran during
such attacks. Hostilities on population centers generally are
preceded by accusations and warnings similar to those Tehran and
Baghdad exchanged this weekend.
   The Iranian air force was out of action for most of 1987. In
January, Iranian warplanes resumed combat missions against Iraq, an
indication that Tehran had somehow acquired spare parts for its
U.S.-built jets.
   Western military analysts say Iran has about 70 operational
combat aircraft, including F-4 and F-5 fighter-bombers and F-14
interceptors.
   Iraq, with more than 500 Soviet and French warplanes, has
maintained air supremacy in the 7-year-old gulf war.
   The Iranian war communique said the raids Sunday were in
retaliation for Iraqi strikes the day before on civilian targets in
a Tehran suburb and in the town of Saghez, in the northwestern
Azerbaijan Province.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported 25 civilians killed
and an unspecified number wounded in the Iraqi raids Saturday.
   The Iraqi News Agency denied Iraq hit any civilians targets over
the weekend.
   Iraqi air force commander Air Marshal Hamid Shaaban also warned
the Iranians against carrying out their threats.
   ``It is an illusion that Iran believes Iraq will succumb to
threats of attacking the cities,'' Shaaban said in an interview
with Baghdad's official Ath-Thawra newspaper.
   Shaaban said Iraq had drawn plans to ``strike at strategic
Iranian targets and also at the nests, where the rotten heads are
being sheltered.''
   That was a reference to headquarters of Iranian leaders.

   A 77-year-old Soviet Jew who battled for
13 years to leave the Soviet Union embraced his daughter when he
arrived Sunday in Israel.
   ``Some of us managed to get out _ many are still left behind,''
said mathematician Naum Meiman, referring to Soviet emigration
policies.
   Meiman arrived in Israel the same day as another leading Soviet
Jewish activist, electrical engineer Lev Shapiro, who came here
with his wife and two children.
   Meiman hugged his daughter, Olga Plam, 50, of Boulder, Colo.,
after she arrived at Ben Gurion Airport aboard a flight from the
United States. She left the Soviet Union 14 years ago and had not
seen her father since then.
   Soviet authorities said they delayed Meiman's emigration request
because of his ``access to state secrets.'' Meiman had worked in
classified mathematical calculations in 1955.
   Meiman linked his release to the policy of glasnost _ greater
political openness on some topics _ initiated by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It is true that it's easier to breathe in the Soviet Union
nowadays, after glasnost,'' he said. ``However, in essence nothing
has changed.''
   The Soviet Union allowed 8,011 Jews to emigrate in 1987, up from
less than a thousand annually in recent years but still far short
of the more than 50,000 permitted to leave in 1979.
   Meiman was met by representatives of the Weizman Institute of
Science and Tel Aviv University. Both institutions have offered the
scientist opportunities to continue his work in Israel, where
Meiman plans to settle.
   Meiman left Moscow Friday and rested in Vienna Saturday. His
wife, Inna Kitrosskaya, struggled for years for an exit visa for
cancer treatment in the United States. She received permission and
left the Soviet Union last year, but died 15 days later of a stroke.
   Meiman was not allowed to accompany his wife or to attend her
funeral.
   Shapiro, of Leningrad, was accompanied by his wife Leah, 38, his
son Yisrael, 13, and the 9-year-old daughter Naomi.
   The Shapiro family, which had been refused emigration permits
for 11 years, gained international prominence when Naomi wrote a
letter to Gorbachev, saying:
   ``You are known as a kind and good grandfather. Why don't you
let me meet my grandparents who live in Israel?''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and U.S. and French
authorities also intervened on behalf of the Shapiros.

<TEXT>
   Deposed president Eric Arturo
Delvalle stayed in hiding Sunday and defied Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the military strongman who ousted him and ordered him out
of the country.
   The ex-president's whereabouts were a closely guarded secret,
but family members said he was in a ``safe and secure place'' in
Panama, in ``good spirits'' and determined to regain his job.
   ``I am going to stay here (and) stick it out,'' Delvalle told
ABC television in a telephone interview Saturday night. ``I'm going
to fight it all the way.''
   Delvalle did not reveal his hiding place.
   Roderick Esquivel, Delvalle's vice president, also was in hiding.
   Both men were ousted from office early Friday in an action by
the National Legislative Assembly orchestrated by Noriega, the
Defense Forces chief.
   Delvalle ignited the latest crisis in eight months of continuing
civil unrest in Panama on Thursday when he tried to fire Noriega,
who is charged in Florida with corruption and narcotics
trafficking. The United States also has urged Noriega to step down
as military chief.
   On Friday, Delvalle returned to his home in an upper-class
neighborhood. Police surrounded the house Friday evening and
Delvalle's telephones were cut, leaving him incommunicado and under
an undeclared house arrest.
   Sometime that night, he reportedly climbed over a patio wall at
the rear of the house and escaped through a neighbor's yard,
avoiding the policemen who had been posted on the street in front
of his home.
   Raul Diaz, a brother-in-law, and other family members said
military officials had warned Delvalle that if he didn't leave the
country voluntarily he would be arrested and forcibly deported.
   Diaz said Sunday that Delvalle was telephoning leaders
throughout the world seeking their support.
   He said Delvalle was not with his wife and three children, but
that all were safe. ``They are in one place and he is alone in
another,'' Diaz said.
   The U.S. State Department said Saturday some of Delvalle's
children or grandchildren were at the American Embassy or the home
of U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis. The U.S. Embassy declined to
comment Sunday on that report.
   The Panamanian government claimed U.S. officials were hiding
Delvalle at an American military installation in Panama.
   But Gabriel Lewis, a former Panamanian ambassador to Washington,
said Sunday he was ``under the protection of a good Panamanian
family and they will never find him.''
   Cynthia Farrell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy, said she
could not ``confirm or deny anything.'' She said the embassy was
under orders from Washington ``not to discuss the situation.''
   Delvalle's hopes of regaining the presidency suffered a setback
Saturday night when the Permanent Council of the Organization of
American States, meeting in Washington, declined to take any action
on Panama.
   Delvalle and the Reagan administration in Washington had hoped
the OAS would agree to impose trade sanctions against Panama, or at
least approve a resolution condemning the president's ouster by the
military.
   On the eve of a planned nationwide protest strike, priests in
Roman Catholic churches throughout the country read a communique to
parishoners from Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath.
   The communique, first issued two days ago, decried ``corruption
(that has) spread throughout the public and private sectors'' of
Panama and said the events of the past few days ``had deepened the
crisis and damaged the credibility of the government and the
constitutional process.''
   But the archbishop urged his followers not to resort to violence
in an attempt to resolve what he called ``the grave national and
international problems'' facing Panama.
   The strike was called by the National Civic Crusade, a coalition
of about 200 professional, business, labor and political groups
that has been seeking Noriega's ouster since last June.
   Crusade leaders said they hoped to ``totally paralyze'' the
country early this week, but there were indications the strike
would not meet its goal.
   Osvaldo Velasquez, president of the Panama Human Rights
Commission, predicted Sunday that many store owners would open for
business Monday ``out of fear of government repression.''
   He said ``military people'' already had threatened some
businessmen, telling them they would ``kick in their doors'' if
they tried to close Monday.
   Delvalle was dismissed by the Legislative Assembly in a
tumultuous, 10-minute meeting Friday, about seven hours after he
went on national television Thursday afternoon and announced he had
fired Noriega.
   Noriega's followers command a majority of 45 seats in the
67-member assembly. Delvalle's backers boycotted the session,
leaving the outcome a foregone conclusion.

<HEAD>Southern Environmental Assembly Gives Simon Highest Grade On Toxic
Issues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Paul Simon got
the highest rating from an environmental group Sunday, but no
candidate in either party graded better than fair on the Southern
Environmental Assembly's ``Toxics Report Card.''
   Six of the candidates _ all the Republicans and two Democrats _
got ``failing'' grades from the group made up of 10 environmental
organizations from southern states that held a two-day conference
in Atlanta.
   The assembly graded Simon, a senator from Illinois, at 76
percent on issues such as reducing use of toxic chemicals, cleaning
up dumpsites and recycling waste.
   But according to the study released Sunday, that grade only
rates as ``fair.'' None of the Democratic or Republican candidates
scored in the ``good'' or ``excellent'' categories.
   Republican candidates scored much lower than Democrats, with
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas getting the highest score at only 18
percent. Vice President George Bush was next at 8 percent, followed
by Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, 4 percent, and former television
evangelist Pat Robertson, 3 percent.
   Among Democrats, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee trailed Simon
with a rating of 72 percent. Gore and Simon were the only two
candidates to appear at a forum Saturday before the assembly, which
figured into their ratings.
   Jesse Jackson was next at 64 percent, followed by Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri, 60 percent; former Sen. Gary Hart of
Colorado, 50 percent; and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, 47
percent.
   The assembly's report card said the grades were based on a
candidate's ``past voting records, their written responses to our
questions and their personal presentations'' to a toxic prevention
conference.
   Ninety to 100 percent was considered ``excellent,'' 80-89
percent ``good,'' 70-79 percent ``fair,'' 60-69 percent ``poor,''
and below 59 percent ``failure.''
   Patty Frase, an Arkansas Enviromental Congress member who
attended the weekend conference, said the ratings show that the
1988 candidates are not addressing environmental issues.
   ``These candidates debate about many important issues, but they
neglect to address the environment,'' Ms. Frase said. ``How can we
focus on national defense when we can't defend our drinking water
supplies against chemicals that cause birth defects and cancer?''

   An estimated 100,000 people demonstrated
peacefully Sunday to protest an art exhibition in which a print of
Marilyn Monroe's face was imposed on a picture of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint.
   The demonstration was organized by four Roman Catholic religious
organizations and the people gathered in the capital's main Zocalo
Square. They then marched five miles to the Basilica at La Villa,
where an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is enshrined.
   Many marchers carried signs denouncing the Museum of Modern Art
exhibition. The museum is run by the Institute of Fine Arts, an
agency of the Department of Education.
   On Jan. 23, about 1,000 people chanting ``Long live Christ the
king!'' stormed the museum in the city's central Chapultepec Park
and authorities closed the exhibit by painter Rolando de la Rosa.
   The museum director, Jorge Alberto Manrique, resigned last
Thursday at the government's request. Manrique had criticized the
closing of the exhibition.
   More than 100 Mexican artists and intellectuals expressed in a
statement their ``profound indignation'' and called for Manrique's
reinstatement.
   More than 90 percent of Mexico's 80 million people are Catholics.
   In one work, de la Rosa, 36, superimposed the face of the late
actress Marilyn Monroe on an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
   In another, styled after Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper,''
Jesus Christ had the face of the late Mexican actor and singer
Pedro Infante. In ``The Sacred Family,'' the baby Jesus was
replaced by a soccer ball.

   A Welsh nationalist group claimed
responsibility Sunday for four incendiary attacks on offices of
real estate firms that have been selling vacation homes in Wales to
English people.
   Four offices in the English city of Chester near the Welsh
border were damaged in the Saturday night attacks.
   Police said the incendiary devices were placed through the
letterboxes of the buildings.
   A group calling itself Meibion Glyndwr (Sons of Glendower, in
the Welsh language), asserted responsibility in a telephone call to
a journalist, saying speculators and ``collaborators'' must get out
of Wales.
   Named after the 15th century Welshman Owen Glendower who failed
in a bid to win independence from the English, the organization has
previously claimed responsibility for starting fires at
English-owned vacation cottages in Wales.
   No arrests have been made.
   Dafydd Thomas, president of the Welsh nationalist political
party Plaid Cymru and a member of the British Parliament, condemned
the attacks and urged Welsh people to give any information about
extremists to police.

   A British Airways jumbo jet carrying 281
passengers to the United States Sunday returned to Britain and made
an emergency landing because its wing slats malfunctioned, an
airline spokesman said.
   A piece of a wing flap fell from the jet as it landed at
Heathrow airport and two runways were closed temporarily for
inspection but no debris was found, according to Press Association,
the British domestic news agency.
   The Boeing 747 took off just after noon. Shortly into the flight
the pilot found he could not retract the slats on one wing, said
the spokesman.
   Wing slats project at an angle at the edge of each wing. By
increasing the area of the wing, the slats increase a plane's lift.
   The airline spokesman said the pilot dumped the aircraft's fuel
and returned to London about an hour later.
   ``The wing slats would not go back in but the problem would not
have caused any serious control difficulties,'' he said.
   ``The pilot decided to return as a precaution and because he did
not want to fly the Atlantic with a fault on the aircraft. There
was no danger and the aircraft made a perfectly normal landing.''
   British Airways said the passengers would either be flown to the
United States on another one of its aircraft or rebooked on another
airline.
   The plane had been heading to Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush is planning to skip
the League of Women Voters' debate next week in Nashville, his
campaign manager said Sunday, in what one opposing camp called a
``front-runner's strategy.''
   ``At this time, there are no debates on the schedule,'' Lee
Atwater told reporters after a debate Sunday in Atlanta. ``We're
simply at a point where we've got 20 states; you've got to maintain
control of your schedule.''
   Bush was the last Republican candidate to agree to participate
the League's first debate in New Hampshire two weeks ago. He had
not publicly committed to attending the League's debate in
Nashville next Sunday.
   Atwater said Bush had no plans to participate in future debates
but added ``Never say never.''
   The league has also scheduled two debates _ one for the
Republican candidates and one for the Democrats _ later in the
primary season.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole would like to debate Bush
one-on-one, his campaign said after the Atlanta debate on Sunday.
   ``We're looking for a one-on-one debate with the vice president,
'' said Dole campaign manager Bill Brock, ``but I think he's
following a front-runner's strategy.''
   Bush is far ahead in the polls on the primaries to be held on
March 8, dubbed Super Tuesday, when nearly a third of the delegates
to the GOP convention.
   The Democratic League debate is also scheduled next Sunday in
Nashville. The GOP debate was moved by the League from its original
Saturday date to Sunday to accomodate candidates' schedules.
   The South Carolina GOP primary will be held on Saturday.

   Travellers were frustrated Sunday by a new wave of
airport and railway personnel strikes while Italians had few
newspapers to read about their Olympic skiing hero Alberto Tomba.
   Alitalia, Italy's state-run airline, canceled hundreds of
flights to and from Rome's airports because of a 24-hour strike by
ground personnel. It was the latest in a series of walkouts to
protest lack of progress in contract renewal negotiations.
   Alitalia's intercontinental flights and its connections to
Italy's islands operated normally, as did flights by other
airlines. Passengers, however, often had to wait for more than hour
for their baggage.
   New contract talks are set to begin Monday.
   Long-distance train service from Rome's main station suffered
disruptions from a 24-hour strike by railway employees that started
at 9 p.m.
   Italy's major daily newspapers did not publish Sunday as a
result of a 48-hour nationwide walkout by journalists protesting
stalemated contract talks. Only a few regional papers exempt from
the strike came out Sunday.
   Television and radio ran limited news broadcasts Sunday without
film reports. On Monday, television and radio stations are to
cancel all newscasts.
   The journalists' strike prevented most Italians from reading
about the exploits of Tomba, who won his second Olympic gold medal
Saturday in alpine skiing.
   Paese Sera, one of the dailies exempt from the strike, ran a
front-page headline saying ``Alberto Tomba Is Already a Legend.''

<HEAD>Report: Senators Who Accepted Contributions From Company Met With
Regulators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five U.S. senators who accepted a total of
$297,000 in contributions from an Arizona company and its employees
met with federal bank examiners investigating one of its
subsidiaries, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Within three months of the meeting, examiners backed off and
ultimately cleared the subsidiary, Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of Irvine, Calif., of wrongdoing, The Detroit News
quoted unidentified sources as saying.
   The thrift is owned by Phoenix, Ariz.-based American Continental
Corp. Executives of the company and its subsidiaries made the
donations over the past several years, the newspaper reported.
   Those accepting the contributions and the amounts, according to
the News, were: Alan Cranston, D-Calif., $41,900; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., $43,000; John Glenn, D-Ohio, $34,000; John McCain,
R-Ariz., $112,000; and Don Riegle, D-Mich., $66,100.
   Riegle said there was no connection between the contribution
toward his 1988 re-election campaign and the April 9, 1987, meeting
in which he and the four other senators discussed the investigation
with Federal Home Loan Bank Board examiners.
   ``If there was the slightest suggestion or hint that somehow
somebody was going to contribute in return for some kind of
favorable consideration, we don't want that money,'' Riegle said.
``I wouldn't accept it.''
   Aides to the other senators said none was available to comment
late last week, the newspaper reported.
   The banking investigators were looking into high-risk
investments made by Lincoln that could threaten its solvency, the
News said.
   The contributions were permissible under federal election laws.
Riegle's campaign chairman, Kevin Gottlieb, said the timing of the
donations and the meeting with regulators was ``an interesting
coincidence.''
   Riegle told the newspaper he attended the meeting because he is
a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee and wanted to
ensure Lincoln Savings received a fair review.
   He said he was invited to the meeting by the other senators and
was concerned Lincoln was being harassed.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying that after
the meeting, the probe changed direction.
   San Francisco bank examiners ``were ready to ask for an
enforcement action against Lincoln,'' an unidentified California
bankig official was quoted as saying. ``But that has changed. The
scope of the examination has changed.''
   American Continental spokesman Andy Baer characterized the
events differently.
   ``I wouldn't say (the examiners) backed off; I would say there
is a new spirit of cooperation,'' Baer said.
   The final bank examiner's report recommended no sanctions
against Lincoln, said Robert Kielty, American Continental's
corporate counsel.

   A Midway Airlines 737 flying from Tampa
to Chicago made an unscheduled landing here Sunday after its pilot
reported an electrical problem that produced smoke in the cockpit,
authorities said.
   Flight 793, with 119 passengers and five crew members aboard,
landed safely at Gainesville Regional Airport about 1:20 p.m. with
no injuries reported, said Federal Aviation Administration shift
supervisor V.H. Steed.
   ``It was a precautionary measure,'' he said. ``None of the
passengers were ever in danger.''
   Gainesville Fire Department spokesman Stew Schwartz said the
pilot asked that fire crews be ready because of an unusual odor and
some smoke in the cockpit.
   Midway spokeswoman Sandra Allen in Chicago said smoke apparently
came from an electrical problem.
   ``At this point, we don't know exactly what caused the smoke,''
she said. ``Two of our mechanics from Miami are being sent to
Gainesville to inspect the plane.''
   The passengers waited in the airport's terminal for about two
hours until another Midway plane was flown in and the flight
resumed, Ms. Allen said. The Boeing jet will remain in Gainesville
until the mechanics declare it fit to fly, she said.

   One of two American hostages released Sunday after their arrests
by Israeli authorities in the occupied West Bank said the most
frightening part of the ordeal was being denied access to U.S.
authorities or an attorney.
   ``It was confusion and of course fright, because when you're
denied access to a lawyer and you're denied access to your own
government, it's frightening to realize that you're cut off from
any sort of legal protection,'' Alison Glick, 25, said in a
telephone interview with WCPO-TV in Cincinnati.
   Ms. Glick said the arresting authorities didn't tell the two why
they were being held.
   Israeli officials allege that Ms. Glick, of North College Hill,
Ohio, and John Benvenuto, 42, of Boston were carrying posters
bearing the names of slain Palestinians in Ramallah, a West Bank
city. They were arrested Saturday on charges of incitement.
   Benvenuto's mother, who talked to her son by telephone Sunday
morning, said she was relieved that the two were unharmed during
the ordeal, which lasted more than 24 hours.
   ``He said if he hadn't been an American, they would have beaten
him,'' said Marian Benvenuto of Rochester, N.Y. She said her son
had written to her of Israelis beating Palestinian protesters.
   Mrs. Benvenuto said her son told her the two were not
demonstrating at the time of their arrest, though she said her son
has been involved in past demonstrations against the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank.
   Benvenuto and Ms. Glick teach at a private school in of Ramallah.
   Israeli police tried to make Benvenuto, an art teacher, sign a
confession in Hebrew that he was guilty of incitement, said Mrs.
Benvenuto. However, she said, her son doesn't speak Hebrew fluently
and refused to sign.
   Authorities didn't allow the two to consult a lawyer or American
officials until early Sunday, when David Goode, a representative of
the U.S. Consulate in east Jerusalem, was permitted to see them,
said Mrs. Benvenuto. The two were released shortly afterward.
   The Israelis have been trying to quiet three months of protest
against their 20-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
More than 70 Palestinians have been reported killed by Israeli
forces during that time.
   Benvenuto and Ms. Glick were arrested in a street near the
Friends Girls' School, a Quaker-run facility in Ramallah, Mrs.
Benvenuto said.
   ``He was just walking down the street, he and this other
teacher, going home for lunch,'' she said. ``Soldiers (from the
Israeli army) stopped them and searched them and then turned them
over to the police in Ramallah.
   ``He said he and this girl each had a plastic shopping bag and
inside the bag, he had pieces of cardboard with names of different
Palestinians who had been killed (allegedly by Israeli occupation
forces).''
   She said she wasn't sure if the names were intended for use in a
protest, but that the two were not protesting at the time.
   ``He was in different protest marches, he's been tear-gassed,
and obviously they have a picture of him,'' she said. ``The
American consul (Goode) told me it was a warning to John to back
off and mind his own business.''
   Mrs. Benvenuto said her son believed press coverage of the
arrests prompted the Israelis to release the two Americans early.
He was initially told he would be detained for 48 hours.

   The Associated Press incorrectly reported Sunday
that Lula E. ``Tiny'' Oslund, 91, who died here Thursday, was
silent screen star Blanche Sweet.
   Ms. Sweet, who worked with filmmaker D.W. Griffith, died Sept.
6, 1986, in New York.
   Mrs. Oslund's son, Wilman F. Oslund, said Sunday that he had
honored a request from his mother that her obituary identify her as
Ms. Sweet. ``In her mind, she was Blanche Sweet,'' said Oslund, 55.
   Oslund said his mother had always told him she was the silent
screen star who played heroines for Griffith in such films as ``The
Lonedale Operator'' (1911) and ``Judith of Bethulia'' (1913).
   Oslund said he saw no harm in complying with his mother's
request. He said that he believes his mother worked as a stand-in
for Ms. Sweet and that Mrs. Oslund closely resembled the actress.
   Author Joseph F. Clarke identified Ms. Sweet as Daphne Wayne in
his 1977 book ``Pseudonyms: The Names Behind the Names.''

   Albania has allowed its first group
of Yugoslav tourists into the secluded and closely guarded Eastern
European nation, Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency reported
Sunday.
   The weekend trip by 130 tourists, organized by a Slovenian
travel company and Albantours, included visits to the Albanian
capital of Tirana as well as Durres, Elbasan and Shkoder.
   The communist nation of 2.8 million has permitted very limited
tourism and trips by a few foreign journalists since the late
1940s, but the nation's attendance of a meeting of Balkan foreign
ministers in Belgrade last week was seen as the latest sign of
Albania's slow abandonment of isolation.
   At last week's meeting, Foreign Minister Reis Malile of Albania
became the first Albanian government minister to visit neighboring
Yugoslavia since World War II.

<TEXT>
   The Democratic presidential candidates debated
the problems of the South on Sunday _ minus front-runners Michael
Dukakis and Richard Gephardt.
   It was the Democrats' second debate in two days, with one more
talkfest on the schedule Monday.
   ``Apparently, they don't care much about Texas and the South,''
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart said of the missing contenders.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. also criticized the two absent
candidates at the first opportunity.
   ``Maybe they didn't enjoy the debate last week in Dallas,'' Gore
said. ``We miss them and I want them to know they're missed,'' he
added.
   Simon, who announced last week he would not campaign actively in
the Super Tuesday states, said his presence Sunday proved he was
not writing off the South.
   ``I need and want and care for your votes,'' he said after the
debate. He said there were no winners or losers in the debate
``with the exception'' of Dukakis and Gephardt.
   The Massachusetts governor and the Missouri congressman have
been trading victories in the early contests. Gephardt won Iowa;
Dukakis won New Hampshire. Gephardt won South Dakota; Dukakis won
Minnesota. On Sunday, Dukakis won Maine's Democratic caucuses.
   Jackson was the only candidate who did not criticize Gephardt
and Dukakis for not coming to Houston.
   ``I do not know why they chose not to be here. I do not think it
reflects a lack of interest or lack of integrity. They simply made
other priorities,'' he said.
   Debate spokeswoman Dee Shoup said Gephardt and Dukakis cited
scheduling conflicts.
   About 800 people attended the debate at the George R. Brown
Convention Center, and the forum was televised.
   Former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite hosted the debate, but he
did not question the candidates. Television journalist Linda
Ellerbee was the moderator.
   Several of the candidates described themselves as providing
leadership to the rest of the field.
   ``My presence has influenced the other leaders,'' Jackson said.
``You now hear Gephardt saying we must challenge the multinational
corporations _ that's Jesse Jackson. When you now hear Congress
saying stop the drug flow _ that's Jesse Jackson. When you hear
other candidates talking about South Africa for the first time _
that's Jesse Jackson.''
   Hart, too, said he was showing the way for the rest.
   ``I'm the only one who has put out a budget, although I see each
of these people gradually creeping towards that inevitability that
I think they are going to have to face.
   ``The fundamental point here is that Paul talks about his
programs, Jesse talks about his programs, and Al talks about his.
I'm the only one who puts out a budget to tell Americans the
truth,'' he said.
   On another subject, Gore said he supports a national energy
policy that includes a price floor, incentives for domestic oil
production and discouragement of oil imports.
   ``We have got to have a national energy policy,'' he said.
   The candidates appeared before the National Association of
Television Program Executives.

<HEAD>Group Forecasts Growth in World Trade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   World merchandise trade grew more quickly last
year than in 1986 and, barring economic upheavals, should expand at
least as quickly this year, a report by a world trade group said
Monday.
   The crash of world stock markets last October does not appear to
``have had an immediate adverse impact'' on global commerce, said
the Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Early estimates show the volume of world merchandise trade rose
by 4 percent last year compared to 3.5 percent in 1986, the world
trade agency's analysts said.
   ``Barring a further major upheaval in financial markets or a
serious recession in the United States, it should grow at least as
rapidly in 1988,'' they said.
   Last September, GATT had predicted only about 3.5 percent growth
for 1987.
   The report expressed concern about trade imbalances among the
world's largest economies. Also, Third World debt and protectionist
pressures still burden the world economy, it said.
   But consumer and investor confidence has survived the stock
crash better than analysts forecasted immediately after the crisis,
the report said.
   ``The improvement in the outlook for trade in recent months
means that, all other things being equal, the risk of a recession
in 1988 is smaller,'' GATT chief economist Richard Blackhurst said.
   The value of merchandise exports rose 15.5 percent in 1987 to a
new record of $2.45 billion, partly reflecting the depreciation of
the U.S. dollar and higher prices for crude oil and other
commodities, the report said.
   Manufactured goods led the expansion with a 5 percent rise in
volume, up from 3.5 percent in 1986. Farm exports rebounded to an
estimated 4 percent rise after a decline of 1 percent, the report
said.
   Reduced petroleum trade helped push trade volume in mining
products down 1 percent.
   Imports by industrialized market economies remained the
strongest force in world trade expansion, though growth slowed to 5
percent from 8.5 percent in 1986, the report said.
   Another factor cited was fast growth in Asian economies such as
Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. These countries have
become significant buyers of manufactured goods on world markets as
well as exporters, GATT said.
   Export growth in developing countries slowed to 6 percent from 9
percent in 1986, but remained more vigorous than in other parts of
the world.
   The report noted improved trade performance by a group of 15
heavily indebted countries, including 10 in Latin America.
   State-controlled economies like China and the Soviet bloc
expanded their trade less than other countries, particularly
because they squeezed imports to adjust to lower export revenues
from fuels and debt service requirements, the report said.
   The GATT includes about 100 member nations and was set up after
World War II. It is both an agreement and a forum for removing
trade barriers and ensuring the free movement of goods around the
world. It is administered by a permanent commission by the same
name in Geneva.

<HEAD>America's Showing Worst In 52 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when
the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent
Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed
skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
   The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games
showing in 52 years. Two of the six were gold medals, won by Brian
Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating. Blair
also won a bronze in speed skating, making her America's only
double winner.
   The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closing
ceremony before 60,000 people in McMahon Stadium. The 250 figure
skaters who performed included past and present medal winners as
well as young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992
Winter Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer
Games.
   Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches, and
banners reading ``Until We Meet Again'' in eight languages were
draped along the top of the stands.
   Earlier Sunday, Rushlaw and his three team members missed
winning the first U.S. bobsled medal in 32 years when they was
beaten by .02 seconds for the bronze.
   Van Gennip took more than six seconds off her own world record
in the 5,000 meters to win her third gold medal. American Mary
Docter was 22.87 seconds behind. East Germans finished 2-3 in the
race.
   Finland won the hockey silver medal, handing the Soviets their
first loss of the Games, 2-1. The Soviets clinched the gold medal
Friday night, and America finished seventh for the second straight
time.
   In 1936, America won just four medals, but only 51 were
available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.
   The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medals, with
11, and total medals, with 29, a record for the Winter Olympics.
East Germany's athletes won nine golds, 25 overall; while
Switzerland's team came in third in both gold medals, five, and
overall medals, 15.
   Four other teams also bested the United States in terms of
overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
   Bow-tied drivers in refrigerated vans are
rushing prime rib and triple-layer carrot cake to upscale homes
here to test the water for home-delivered gourmet meals in an
industry dominated by pizza.
   The creation of ``The Order Inn,'' an experimental division of
food giant General Mills Inc., was spurred by some compelling
demographics, industry analysts say. The secretive test targets
affluent singles and professional couples.
   ``What we're seeing is the beginning of an escalating delivery
war, not just with pizza but with all kinds of home-delivered
food,'' said Charlie Henderson, vice president of marketing for
Godfather's Pizza, an Omaha, Neb.-based division of Pillsbury Inc.
   ``People are time-short and dollar-rich,'' said Henderson, whose
company is shrinking sit-down areas in its new restaurants and
mobilizing larger road forces. ``They don't want to eat out.
They're more than willing to pay to have it brought to their houses
and I don't see it ending.''
   The explosion of convenience food in all its frozen and
home-delivered variations can be traced to two late-'80s phenomena,
said Stephen Carnes, managing director of research for the
brokerage firm of Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood.
   Carnes said his company's research shows 65 percent of U.S.
homes now have microwave ovens and 55 percent of all married women
work. Households typically are short on time for cooking and long
on money to pay others to do it.
   But restaurants have shortcomings as an alternative to kitchen
toil, Henderson and others note. Costs can be high and there's
usually a wait.
   Moreover, food industry analysts say that, in an age of VCRs,
staying at home _ ``cocooning,'' as it's been dubbed _ is becoming
an end in itself.
   Grocery stores around the country have scurried to meet the
demand with wider offerings of prepared and semi-prepared dinners.
The choices range from macaroni and cheese on the low end to London
broil and rattlesnake at the top.
   Even a drive to the grocery store can sometimes be too strenuous
for the work-weary, said Peter Flatow, president of the New York
market research company BrainReserve, Inc.
   The goal is delivering a nice dinner to them; the challenge is
overcoming high cost and logistics.
   ``Domino's Pizza has done it. Now all you've got to do is get
veal marsala there and you've got it,'' Flatow said. ``The need is
there. Nobody has fulfilled it yet.''
   A General Mills spokesman would not discuss the Order Inn
venture, citing competitive factors. Local analysts say it has been
under way for roughly six months.
   Industry watchers describe it as a logical step for General
Mills, which also owns the Red Lobster, York's and Olive Garden
restaurant chains. Based in Golden Valley, a Minneapolis suburb,
the company also has takeout experience. It recently sold its chain
of Leann Chin's Chinese restaurants, which offered both sit-down
and eat-at-home meals.
   Order Inn menus being dropped off at Twin Cities homes in recent
months promise free delivery, usually in less than 20 minutes. Both
lunches and dinners are available, seven days a week.
   The menu offers four selections in the appetizers and salad
section, including chilled shrimp and popcorn chicken. Two
sandwiches are available and five entrees, ranging from $5.75 for
lasagna to $10.95 for prime rib. White-chocolate macadamia nut
cheesecake highlights the three dessert choices.
   The menus include detailed instructions on reheating in a
microwave or oven,. and a questionnaire asking what was ordered and
how the food and service ranked.
   No verdict is in sight on the Order Inn, but experts say General
Mills seems to have the right idea.
   ``I don't think there's any question there will be more to
follow,'' said Craig Carver, senior vice president of the
Minneapolis brokerage firm of Dain Bosworth.
   A chief obstacle to success is keeping costs under control. With
pizza, for example, gasoline, drivers, insurance and other costs
take a $3 to $4 slice out of a $10 pizza, Godfather's Henderson
says.
   An extra hurdle for Order Inn is the daily gamble on how many
orders will be placed for each item. Leftovers must be disposed of
at day's end, General Mills spokesman Craig Shulstad confirmed.
   Whatever the future of the experiment, industry watchers predict
scratch cooking will become ever more a recreational, weekend
pastime. And restaurants, they say, should beware.
   ``It's really a fight for share of stomach,'' Carver said.

   Angolan rebels claimed they
killed 172 government soldiers and captured three Soviet-built
tanks in recent fighting, the independent South African Press
Association reported Sunday.
   The guerrillas destroyed three Angolan military units Friday in
a battle east of Cuito Cuanavale in southeastern Angola, the news

headquarters in Jamba.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
also claimed its guerrillas killed 10 Cuban soldiers and destroyed
seven Soviet-made T-55 tanks, the report said.
   The statement said five rebels were killed and four were wounded
in Friday's battles.
   Both Angola's Marxist government and the U.S.-  and South
African-supported rebels have reported heavy fighting around Cuito
Cuanavale in recent weeks.
   UNITA said in January that it forced government troops to flee
Cuito Cuanavale and guerrilla forces encircled the vacated town.
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has been predicting his rebels would
defeat the remaining government in the area and then move into
Cuito Cuanavale.
   The town was used as a government base in annual dry-season
offensives against UNITA strongholds in the southeast.
   Angola gained its independence from Portugal in Novermber 1975,
and UNITA lost to the Marxist forces in the civil war that
followed. Government forces are backed by some 40,000 Cuban troops
and more than 1,000 Soviet military advisers.
   Also Sunday, South Africa announced that two of its soldiers
were killed in Angola. The military statement said the troops were
slain Thursday by ``indirect enemy fire.''
   South Africa announced in November that it had intervened
militarily in southern Angola on behalf of UNITA. A month later
South Africa said it had begun to withdraw its troops, but it
remains engaged in the fighting.
   South Africa has announced the deaths of more than 30 South
African military personnel since November, but has not disclosed
the extent of its involvement. Angola claims 9,000 South African
troopers are in Angola.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese dissident arrested trying
to board a flight to Taiwan with a false passport said Monday he
agreed to leave the Philippines and would depart for the United
States.
   Hsu Hsin-Liang said he would leave Monday aboard a Korean Air
flight for Seoul, South Korea, and would travel on to Hawaii.
   Hsu, who edits The Taiwan Times newspaper in Los Angeles, was
banned from Taiwan in 1979 for political activity.
   Immigration officials said Hsu agreed to self-deportation,
meaning he would be free to return to the Philippines. Philippine
authorities had offered to accept him as a political refugee but he
declined, saying he wanted to return to Taiwan.
   Hsu was arrested Feb. 11 while preparing to board a flight for
the Taiwanese capital of Taipei.
   Taiwanese officials refused to allow him to return to Taiwan
because people charged with sedition are not allowed to enter the
country under the National Security Law, which replaced martial
rule last July.
   Taiwan had been under martial law since 1949, when the
Nationalist Chinese lost a mainland civil war with the Communists,
fled to the island and established a government.
   Hsu was charged with sedition for his alleged involvement in an
anti-government riot in Taiwan's southern port of Kaohsiung in
1979. The riot occurred two months after Hsu had left for the
United States, but Taiwanese officials said he helped organize it.
   In September 1986, Hsu organized a U.S.-based Taiwanese group,
the Democratic Progressive Party Overseas that is affiliated with
Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party.

<HEAD>Penn, In Rare Interview, Talks About Marriage To Madonna</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Madonna's divorce plans were created by the
press, says her husband, Sean Penn, who vowed in an interview
published Sunday to ``refocus'' himself to avoid outbursts like the
one that landed him in jail.
   Penn, filmdom's bad boy, discussed the strain of being married
to the darling of American pop in a Chicago Tribune interview
billed as the first since he was jailed for 32 days last summer
after striking a movie extra.
   ``I feel uncomfortable commenting about my family situation
because I'm no expert on the subject. Obviously making any family
work is an endless job that's hard enough even when the family
isn't public,'' Penn said.
   Madonna filed divorce papers in Santa Monica, Calif., on Dec. 4,
citing irreconcilable differences. Two weeks later, she asked to
withdraw the petition and the court granted the request the same
day, court records show. No reason was given in the court papers
for her change of heart.
   But Penn, 27, said nevertheless that talk about the possibility
of divorce ``was more People magazine than reality. My attitude
with the press right now is that I hope they've had their share of
me. They've been very busy trying to find or make dirt. I'd like to
get back to acting.''
   Penn said his reported marital problems with Madonna, 29, stem
from her fans' view of him as less-than-ideal marriage material.
   The couple were married Aug. 16, 1985, in a lavish ceremony on a
Malibu, Calif., bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, while news
helicopters buzzed overhead.
   ``She belonged to them, to the public,'' Penn said. ``And if
anybody took her, I think they thought it should have been someone
more acceptable, like Donald Trump.
   ``The public is very possessive about rock stars,'' Penn said,
``and about her in particular. They don't want to share their
love.''
   Penn may not be able to shed his reputation, but he said he
plans to try to avoid future confrontations.
   ``Certainly I've thought about it,'' he said. ``I just have to
refocus myself in another direction.''
   Of his California jail experience, Penn said he was never afraid.
   ``I was in a jail with all the big shots, one person to a cell _
solitary confinement for 24 hours. So afraid, no. But bored, yes.
After about two weeks of that kind of boredom, I think I would have
preferred some fear.''
   Penn spoke with the Tribune after dinner. He had fettuccine with
shrimp. Madonna ``had a Caesar salad,'' he said. ``She always has
Caesar salads.''

<HEAD>Body of Man Slain at Army Checkpoint Exhumed for Autopsy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONAGHAN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of a 23-year-old Northern
Ireland man fatally shot at a British army checkpoint was exhumed
Sunday for another autopsy in Ireland.
   Aidan McAnespie's family requested the new autopsy. They said he
had been harassed at the border and disputed the army statement
that the bullet that struck him while he was near the border
checkpoint at Aughnacloy, in Northren Ireland, on Feb. 21 was fired
accidentally and ricocheted.
   An 18-year-old soldier has been charged with unlawful killing in
the death and is being held on bail in military care.
   The British and Irish governments are conducting separate
investigations.
   McAnespie's body was buried Tuesday in Clara, County Monaghan,
in the Irish Republic across the border from Aughnacloy following
an autopsy by British medical examiners.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland on Saturday approved
the exhumation after receiving a request from the family.
   An overnight police guard was placed at the cordoned-off grave,
and after the exhumation the coffin was transferred to Monaghan
General Hospital for the autopsy.
   The dead man's sister, Eilish McCabe, claimed Sunday that her
brother had received a number of death threats from British
soldiers.
   She said in an an Irish radio interview that her brother
received ``continuous harassment'' during border crossings from his
Northern Ireland home to his job in the Irish Republic.
   Haughey is to make a statement on the incident to the Dail,
Ireland's parliament, Tuesday.
   Northern Ireland is a British province. Guerrillas of the mainly
Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army have been fighting since 1969
to unite the province, where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2,
with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, claiming a solid victory Sunday in Maine's
Republican presidential caucuses, was attacked by chief rival Bob
Dole on the Iran-Contra affair, while Rep. Jack Kemp blasted the
two GOP frontrunners on taxes.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the Maine Democratic
caucuses, scoring another victory on his New England home turf, and
Jesse Jackson scored a surprisingly strong second, followed by an
uncommitted bloc.
   ``Today our message continued to shine,'' the Massachusetts
governor said in a statement. ``Today's victory gives our national
campaign another push toward success on Super Tuesday.''
   The state Republican party provided no official count, but
various campaigns agreed Bush, who makes his summer home in Maine,
was far ahead, with former television evangelist Pat Robertson
next, followed by the uncommitteds.
   ``I am delighted with what appears to be an overwhelming victory
in the Maine caucuses, assuring my campaign of all 22 national
delegates,'' Bush said from Washington.
   The Maine caucuses pick delegates to the parties' state
conventions this spring, where national convention delegates are
chosen.
   Four of the six Democrats, meanwhile, gathered for a debate in
Houston, where the absentees _ Dukakis and Rep. Richard Gephardt _
came under fire for skipping the event.
   At a Republican debate in Atlanta _ the first full-scale GOP
face-off of the Southern campaign _ Dole took aim at Bush for the
Reagan administration's decision to trade arms for hostages in the
Iran-Contra affair. That, he said, was a big mistake.
   ``We never should trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issue
these reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ the
vice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and say
it's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said, holding
up a report on terrorism that was written by a presidential
commission headed by Bush.
   Bush did not respond directly, but did say ``mistakes were
made'' in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Kemp, whose campaign has been faltering after poor showings in
early contests, accused Bush and Dole of supporting tax hikes.
   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported every
single tax increase over the last eight years,'' the New York
congressman said. ``If they're nominated, the Reagan revolution is
over, gone, dead.''
   Dole hit back, saying: ``Jack's never met a deficit he didn't
like.'' And Bush told the New York congressman: `You don't care
about deficits. You never have, and they're public enemy No. 1.''
   Bush is planning to skip the League of Women Voters' debate next
Sunday in Nashville, his campaign manager said.
   ``At this time, there are no debates on the schedule,'' Lee
Atwater told reporters after the Atlanta debate. ``We're simply at
a point where we've got 20 states; you've got to maintain control
of your schedule.''
   The GOP contest was sponsored by the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution newspapers, which also organized a Democratic
face-off on Saturday. There, Dukakis made stinging attacks on
rivals Gephardt and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee.
   Gore, who largely bypassed early contests in New Hampshire and
Iowa, is pinning his hopes on a strong showing on Super Tuesday,
March 8. On that day, 20 states, mostly in the South, will hold
primaries or caucuses.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, who disappointed many Democrats when
he decided to sit out the presidential race, said Sunday he still
hasn't decided whether to lend his backing to his fellow Southerner.
   ``I like Al Gore,'' Nunn said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Meet
the Press.'' ``I like what he says on national security.''
   But, he said, ``I also like Dick Gephardt. ... I'm not ducking
it. I just haven't decided who I'm going to vote for yet. I like
Gore and I like Gephardt.''
   Gephardt and Dukakis, responsible for the sharpest sparring
among the Democrats lately, did not attend Sunday night's
Democratic debate in Houston. Gary Hart attacked the absentees.
   ``Apparently they don't care much about Texas and the South,''
the former Colorado senator said. Those who did attend the debate,
however, admitted they're getting a bit tired of such gatherings.
   ``We really are kind of trapped in these 90-second sound bites
trying to say a thing that makes a difference,'' said Jackson.
   ``There really is a problem in these debates, in that we have to
answere in 60 seconds, or 90 seconds, and in some debates 30
seconds,'' said Paul Simon.
   Dukakis campaigned Sunday from the deck of a fire boat in
Baltimore's harbor, and pledged to make affordable housing a
priority if elected. Maryland is one of the states voting on Super
Tuesday.
   Jackson, in Tampa, Fla., visited a crime-ridden neighborhood and
decried the despair and frustration that has led to clashes between
residents and police.
   Jackson has pledged to raise the minimum wage, provide long-term
health insurance for all Americans and to make fighting drugs his
top priority.
   ``The Sandinistas are not threatening the streets of Tampa this
morning,'' he said. ``The No. 1 threat is coke, crack and heroin.''
   In another development, a poll published Sunday suggested
Dukakis and Gephardt have the lead among Democrats in Texas, the
biggest Super Tuesday state. On the Republican side, Bush had a
clear lead, with Dole a distant second.
   The poll was conducted for the Houston Chronicle and the Dallas
Morning News.
   Among 301 likely Democratic primary voters surveyed, Dukakis had
22 percent; Gephardt 21 percent; Jackson 12 percent; Gore, 10
percent; Hart, 8 percent; and Simon 1 percent.
   Among Republicans, Bush had the support of 60 percent of the 298
likely Republican primary voters surveyed. Dole had 14 percent;
Robertson 8 percent; and Kemp 3 percent. Fourteen percent were
undecided.
   The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 6 percentage points.
It was conducted by University of Houston political scientist
Richard Murray through the university's Center for Public Policy.

   Chrysler Corp.'s plans to close a Wisconsin
assembly plant and its admission that it might sell its Acustar
Inc. parts subsidiary are fueling worker anger and distrust as the
two sides head into this summer's national contract talks.
   Chrysler's parts operations were grouped into the subsidiary
last spring, but most of Acustar's 28,000 workers have been with
Chrysler since it battled back from the brink of bankruptcy early
in the decade, when they granted concessions to keep the company
afloat.
   Chrysler workers think the potential sale, now that the No. 3
carmaker is again earning billion-dollar profits, indicates they
won't be able to trust the company in the upcoming contract
negotiations.

counterterrorism analyst Jonathan Pollard as a spy.
   Meese is free to be briefed and even to make decisions in the

   Presidential candidates from Congress work in
a system where it's hard to avoid some flip-flopping on issues but
when a candidate can't offer convincing explanations, those charges
take root with voters, experts say.
   Two Democratic candidates battling for Super Tuesday votes,
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, have
been the most frequent targets, even trading those accusations
themselves. Both, as legislators, have voted on two sides of
several issues.
   Gephardt has taken fire for moving to the left after deciding to
run for president, on abortion, trade and social issues. Gore has
become more conservative, especially on defense matters.

   Rep. Richard Gephardt moves into Super Tuesday
territory with an extraordinarily effective television advertising
campaign that touched raw nerves and won last-minute support among
voters in earlier Democratic presidential contests.
   While critics complain that Gephardt's populist image is an
insider's affectation and his hard-hitting ``Hyundai'' trade ad is
based on bad numbers, there's little disagreement about the impact
of the Missouri congressman's TV campaign.
   The forceful spots, created by political veterans David Doak and
Robert Shrum, are credited with putting Gephardt over the top in
Iowa and South Dakota and enabling him to stop a New Hampshire
slide that could have jostled him out of the second place finish he
needed and got.

Sakakawea.
   The 200-mile-long reservoir drove the Indians onto higher, less

<HEAD>Volcker Ends Self-Imposed Silence _ But Who Is Listening?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Does anyone pay attention to a 6-foot-7
kibbitzer who used to be the second most powerful man in Washington?
   Paul Volcker is beginning to find out.
   The former chairman of the Federal Reserve recently broke a
self-imposed vow of silence to resume offering opinions on
deficits, taxes and the health of the economy.
   He seemed to show a little of the old magical influence last
Thursday when stock and bond prices sank soon after he called for a
tax increase and predicted that interest rates would rise.
   But some skeptics said the markets' behavior had nothing to do
with what Volcker said.
   ``He's not even associated with the Fed anymore,'' said
Hildegarde Zagorski, a market strategist at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``When you get a day like (Thursday), everybody tries to say
what killed the market and they drag out every news item that would
have passed unnoticed,'' she said.
   So is Volcker capable of moving the market? ``No. Not at all,''
Ms. Zagorski said.
   Volcker still has not settled down to a new job since his
departure from the Federal Reserve last August, when he was
succeeded by Alan Greenspan. But Volcker is expected to announce
his career decision within the next few weeks.
   Meanwhile, he is borrowing an office on Wall Street and heading
a Washington-based commission on how to improve the quality of the
nation's civil service.
   Speaking on the lecture circuit helps pay the bills and gives
Volcker a forum to express his views on the need to cut the federal
budget deficit.
   The forum for his remarks Thursday was a luncheon meeting in San
Antonio of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks.
   The night before, Volcker had spoken in Peoria, Ill., at the
Washington Day banquet of the Creve Coeur Club.
   In Peoria, Volcker was chosen as a contrast to the 1987 speaker,
Bob Hope.
   ``We certainly know it's difficult to upstage a Bob Hope, so we
said let's go back to something that's not comparable,'' said Henry
Allovio, the club's vice president.
   According to those who believe in Volcker's continuing
influence, his remarks in San Antonio triggered a selloff in the
bond market, which scared owners of stock-index futures, which in
turn dragged down stock prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been up as
much as 33 points, ended up with a loss for the day of 22.38
points, most of it in the final hour of trading.
   ``I have deep respect for Paul Volcker and in my opinion there
is not a single more influential economist in this country,'' said
John V. Sebastian, executive vice president and chief economist of
Clayton Brown & Associates in Chicago.
   But can Volcker influence trading decisions even without the
control over the nation's money supply that he once had? Yes,
Sebastian said.
   As an example, he mentioned Henry Kaufman, a prominent economist
for the giant Wall Street investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
whose outlooks used to move interest rates in the bond market. In
December Kaufman announced plans to start his own consulting firm.
   ``Henry Kaufman in his heyday had no authority and yet he was
able to influence the markets,'' Sebastian said.

   More than 5,000 automotive engineers will meet
this week to talk about everything concerning the life of a
vehicle, from computerized conception to disposal on the junk heap.
   The Society for Automotive Engineers 1988 Congress and
Exposition also will be attended by more than 700 industry
suppliers, who will display their latest developments in automotive
plastics and other materials, lubricants, design systems and
maintenance. They'll occupty 167,000 square feet of exhibit space
at Detroit's downtown Cobo Hall from Monday through Thursday.
   The convention's theme is ``Engineering for the '90s _
Imagination, Innovation.'' Among featured speakers will be General
Motors Corp. President Robert Stempel and Anthony Rudd, deputy
chairman of Lotus Engineering.
   Special sessions include a panel's look at the growing problem
of disposing of automotive plastics as their use expands
internally, in the engine and passenger compartment, and
externally, as more and more body parts are composed of stronger,
reinforced plastic substances.
   The engineers also will discuss efforts to reduce release of
ozone-depleting chloroflourocarbons, or CFCs, used in production.
Automaking has been the main source of CFC emissions since the
United States ended CFC use in aerosol sprays in the 1970s.
   Ford Motor Co. Vice Chairman Harold Poling will be honored
Monday at a luncheon hosted by Automotive Industries magazine,
which named him its Man of the Year for 1988. The trade magazine
noted Poling's stabilizing, corporate-wide strategy of cost-cutting
and balanced production while focusing on quality and cooperation
with workers, dealers and suppliers.
   The strategy has allowed Ford to run factories at profitable
levels, introduce attractive innovations and eliminate most plant
closures, the magazine reported in a cover story on Poling.
   As a result, Ford outearned GM, the much larger industry leader,
in 1986 and 1987 and is expected to remain the biggest money-maker
in the industry in 1988, while GM is still fighting to cut costs
and balance a huge modernization and new products program.
   Described as the largest vehicle engineering conference, the
gathering will include engineers from Ford, GM, Chrysler Corp.,
Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. as well as hundreds of
suppliers including Allied Automotive, Borg-Warner, DuPont
Automotive, General Electric, United Technologies and Dow Chemical.

<HEAD>Irving Bank, Target of Hostile Takeover, Predicts Bitter Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Irving Bank Corp., target of a $1.08 billion
hostile takeover proposal by Bank of New York that was sanctioned
last week by government regulators, said Sunday it would brief
shareholders on why they should reject the bid and predicted a
bitterly fought battle for their votes.
   ``Irving plans to bring to the attention of its shareholders all
the factors they should consider regarding the offer, as well as
questioning exactly how Bank of New York intends to meet the
numerous conditions to which its offer is now subject,'' the bank
said in a press statement.
   It was Irving's first official reaction to the approval given
last Thursday by the Federal Reserve Board and New York State
Banking Board Bank of the Bank of New York's hostile $60 a share
bid in cash and securities.
   The takeover fight has attracted attention because hostile
acquisitions are unusual in the normally staid banking world. Some
analysts have said government approval portends hostile takeovers
of other banks.
   Fed and state officials dismissed the unfriendly nature of the
bid as irrelevant and said they saw no competitive threat to a
merger of the two New York Banks, which would create the nation's
12th largest banking company with assets of nearly $42 billion.
   Nevertheless, the Fed imposed one important condition of
approval by requiring Bank of New York to sell additional stock to
replenish the $264 million cash portion of the takeover. In
addition, the Fed said at least 60 percent of that amount must be
raised before the transaction can be completed.
   Although Bank of New York officials expressed confidence they
could meet the condition, Irving called it significant hurdles
because it will dilute the stock's value and must be approved by
Bank of New York shareholders.
   The Bank of New York's offer depends on receipt of two-thirds of
Irving's shares. The offer could encounter more difficulty because
of a New York law that impedes hostile takeovers.
   Irving said the Fed's approval ``clearly opens the way for a
bitterly fought proxy battle.''
   Proxies are written statements authorizing others to vote stock
on the behalf of shareholders, a normal arrangement in publicly
held companies. Management routinely solicits shareholder proxies
but they are also used by others attempting to win control away
from management.
   ``The Fed's approval does not change the nature of the proposal,
which continues to make no business sense and is not in the best
long-term interest of Irving,'' said the Irving statement.
   It said the bank ``is fully committed to continue opposing this
grossly inadequate and highly conditional proposal, which the
corporation's unanimous board is convinced is not in Irving's best
interests.''
