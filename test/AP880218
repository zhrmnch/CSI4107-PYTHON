   About 60,000 demonstrators gathered Thursday
night in the main Zocalo plaza to protest the government's new
inflation-fighting program which has sparked higher prices
throughout the economy.
   The protesters demanded that the government place controls on
prices, nearly triple the minimum daily wage and halt payments on
its foreign debt of $105 billion, the second highest in the
developing world after Brazil.
   There were no reports of arrests or violence.
   Ignacio Betancourt, who spoke on behalf of the National
Resistance Front, said the government of President Miguel de la
Madrid has ``stabbed the people by implementing the (Economic
Solidarity) Pact.''
   He said de la Madrid's Cabinet should be fired because it ``has
brought the country to disaster.''
   The resistance front represents the opposition Revolutionary
Workers Party, the Workers Union of the National Autonomous
University of Mexico and a dissident wing of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who left the governing party to run as the
presidential candidate of small opposition parties, was among the
protest leaders.
   The Economic Solidarity Pact was put into effect in
mid-December. As part of the plan, the government boosted prices on
a variety of regulated goods and services by an average of 78
percent. The minimum daily wage was boosted 38 percent and now
stands at 7,765 pesos, about $3.40.
   On March 1, the government will begin an indexation plan that
will increase wages and prices a certain amount each month based on
projected inflation.
   The government's aim is to reduce the monthly rate of inflation
to 1 percent to 2 percent by year's end. Consumer prices soared
15.5 percent in January.
   Prices rose a record 159.2 percent last year.
   Private analysts estimate that workers have lost half their
purchasing power since 1982.
   De la Madrid said Wednesday that inflation is ``the most serious
problem we face'' and will be managed ``in a prudent, sensible and
realistic way.''
   De la Madrid spoke during an appearance in Toluca, 45 miles
northwest of Mexico City.
   Despite the government's efforts, some private analysts predict
that inflation will be in the range of 150 percent to 200 percent
this year.
   Labor leaders are threatening massive strikes in March unless
major salary increases are granted.

<HEAD>Two California Women Detained, Released In El Salvador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Thursday detained and
questioned two American women working in a resettlement camp then
turned them over to the U.S. Embassy, officials said.
   An Episcopal minister, the Rev. Donald Lewis of San Marino,
Calif., identified the two as Kathleene Hoy and Mary Parmenter of
Pasadena, Calif. He claimed their detention was a part of increased
harassment of U.S. ecumenical workers by Salvadoran authorities in
recent months.
   The two California women were detained ``for entering restricted
areas without authorization,'' said agent Orlando Ramirez of the
Treasury Police, whose jurisdiction includes investigations of
customs and immigration violations.
   Ramirez said they were apprehended at the Copapayo camp near
Suchitoto, about 25 miles northwest of San Salvador. Guerrillas
frequently carry out operations in the area.
   He said the women, along with seven Salvadorans, were detained
Thursday morning and brought to the capital. The two U.S. citizens
were released into the custody of U.S. Vice Consul Mark Schall
after several hours of questioning, he said.
   U.S Embassy spokesman Jacob Gillespie said the Privacy Act
prevented him from confirming the women's names or details of the
incident. But he agreed with the Treasury Police report that two
American women were detained and later released.
   Lewis, chairman of a diocesan task force for Salvadoran
resettlement, said he was informed of the detention by telephone by
a U.S. Embassy official in San Salvador.
   He said the military has been harassing Americans providing
humanitarian assistance in El Salvador since about 20,000
Salvadoran refugees in Honduras decided to return to their homeland
last fall.
   ``Since then, the government nervousness and harassment of
ecumenical workers has increased ... Our concern is that this kind
of caseworker harassment has happened to others who are strictly
down there for humanitarian reasons,'' he said.
   Guerillas from five leftist groups have been fighting since 1980
to overthrow the U.S.-backed government.

   History buffs organizing re-enactments
of major Civil War battles this summer are running into the same
problem Gens. Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee faced 125 years
ago _ not enough Billy Yanks and Johnny Rebs to go around.
   ``There are so many re-enactments planned that you could stay
busy just about every weekend,'' said Charles Sullivan, a member of
``Stanford's Mississippi Battery.''
   But the Civil War fanatics who dress up in blue or gray to camp
out and charge through fields in battlefield re-enactments have a
manpower solution that was not available in the Civil War _ fight
for both sides.
   ``Sometimes you have to hastily reorganize your loyalties if you
want to be part of something,'' said Sullivan, who in more sedate
moments is chairman of the social studies department at Mississippi
Gulf Coast Junior College.
   ``This summer is an especially busy period because two of the
key battles of the Civil War _ Vicksburg and Gettysburg _ occurred
at virtually the same time,'' he said.
   Gettysburg activities will take place in the weeks leading up to
the 125th anniversary of the battle, which was fought July 1-3,
1863, while the Vicksburg re-enactment is planned for the July
Fourth weekend, when that Rebel stronghold on the Mississippi River
fell to Grant's army.
   Last year more than 40,000 people watched as 6,000 buffs
recreated the bloody battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, where
Confederate troops surprised Grant's troops on April 6, 1862. The
Rebels were defeated in a two-day battle.
   Thousands of re-enactors belong to groups of Civil War buffs,
but demand has been so intense that several events, including an
annual re-creation of the Battle of Champion Hill, have had to be
rescheduled.
   Champion Hill was fought on May 16, 1863, and paved the way to
Vicksburg for Union troops. It will be observed in March this year
because it would have conflicted with preparations for the
Gettysburg event.
   Sullivan said that to deal with changing demands, many
re-enactors carry two sets of uniforms so that at a moment's notice
they can march as either a Rebel or a Yankee.
   Leyland French, operator of an antebellum tour home here, said
that by staging Vicksburg activities immediately after those at
Gettysburg, ``It may be possible for more people to make both
events.''
   ``We've talked with representives of 41st Illinois Infantry who
plan a weekend encampment and we had a call this week from a
gentleman in Missouri who wants to bring a group,'' said Lenore
Barkley, executive director of the Vicksburg Convention and
Visitors' Bureau.
   While Gettysburg is perhaps the best-remembered clash of the
Civil War, the fall of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, was a vital
strategic loss to the South, leaving the Confederacy almost cut in
two and giving control of the Mississippi to the North.
   The siege began May 18, 1863, and ended when Confederate Gen.
John C. Pemberton, out of food and water, surrendered on July
Fourth.
   The battle, fought in trenches, enventually involved 100,000
men, some 50,000 fewer than marched into battle at Gettysburg,
where Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania was turned back.
   Sullivan said that despite the expense of uniforms, equipment
and the time and travel, most re-enactors were anxious to
participate in as many events as possible.
   ``We are talking about salesmen, bookkeepers, teachers, truck
drivers, doctors, and lawyers _ all united by a common love of
history,'' Sullivan said.
   ``It's like a time machine, providing a feeling of history you
can't get any other way,'' he said.
   He said many buffs, both from North and South, preferred to
march as Confederates, perhaps because of the romance of the Lost
Cause.
   ``Re-enactors were used when they made the television movie
North and South, and just about everyone wanted to be a
Confederate, including most of the Yankees,'' he said. ``In the
end, they had to make our group go in as Union troops.''

   ESL Inc., the Silicon Valley defense
contractor whose offices were the scene of a deadly shooting
rampage, is best-known for a product dubbed Guardrail, a light
plane modified with radio eavesdropping equipment.
   The TRW subsidiary was the sixth-largest Santa Clara County
defense contractor in 1986 with $89.8 million in government
contracts.
   On Tuesday Richard Wade Farley, 39, of San Jose, surrendered to
police after a six-hour siege which began when he allegedly entered
a building with four guns and began shooting. He apparently had
been spurned by a woman who was an engineer there. Seven people
were killed and four hurt in the attack.
   The company employs about 2,800 people, working on radar-jamming
hardware and software and intelligence-gathering equipment.
Customers include the Army and the National Security Agency.
   ESL stands for Electro-Magnetic Systems Laboratories. Founded in
1964, it was purchased by giant Redondo-Beach, Calif.-based TRW in
1978.
   ``Of all of TRW's divisions, they keep the lowest profile and do
very little in the way of advertising and public relations,'' Dave
Boutacoff, managing editor of Defense Electronics magazine, told
the San Francisco Chronicle.
   Security at the company is reportedly tight, with a guard at the
front door checking identification badges.
   However, Lenny Siegel, director of the Pacific Studies Center, a
defense watchdog organization, said it's not like an airport.
   ``They don't necessarily check everybody's belongings or frisk
anybody,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dragon Still Important Symbol For Chinese</HEAD>

   As China enters the Year of the Dragon, the
symbol of good fortune is everywhere in the capital _ in neon and
plastic, on posters and in newspapers _ despite the official
communist line against superstitious beliefs.
   The dragon is considered the most auspicious of the 12 animals
in the Chinese zodiac, and it continues to be China's favorite
symbol of luck, power and grandeur.
   The Chinese, who call themselves ``descendents of the dragon,''
regard the dragon year as lucky for marriage, birth and business.
   Throughout Beijing, neon dragons beam from atop buildings,
plastic dragons twine around pillars, and the character for dragon
is on signs welcoming the new year.
   Red banner headlines in Chinese newspapers Wednesday hailed the
start of the new lunar year and devoted extensive space to articles
on the dragon's history, development and significance.
   Even the state-run Beijing Review linked the dragon to hoped-for
economic success this year. On the cover of the authoritative
magazine's Feb. 15 issue, the headline read, ``Coastal Areas: Boom
expected in Year of Dragon.''
   The dragon's role in Chinese culture dates back as early as the
New Stone Age. A dragon made of shells was discovered last year in
a tomb from the 7,000 year-old Yangshao civilization unearthed in
Henan province.
   In dynastic times, the yellow dragon was the symbol of the
emperor, and anyone found using the motif was punished severely.
   It is said that no mortal has ever seen the dragon, but ancient
writers described the dragon as having the antlers of a deer, the
head of a camel, the eyes of a ghost, the neck of a serpent, the
belly of a sea snake, the scales of a carp, the claws of an eagle,
the paws of a tiger and the ears of a bull.
   Artists portrayed this fantastic creature in a variety of ways,
but most dragons look something like reptilian serpent with four
sharp-clawed feet and a horse-like head with sharp horns.
   The dragon is one of the most prominent figures in Chinese art,
architecture, clothing and even furniture, and it remains an
important symbol to the Chinese.
   A pair of red dragons flying amid clouds dominated the top
corner of the Wednesday edition of the official People's Daily,
mouthpiece of the Communist Party.
   Other national newspapers published photographs of dragon dances
and spectacular dragon lanterns.
   A five-hour Spring Festival television special Tuesday night
showed dragon ice sculptures in Harbin, Heilongjiang province,
China's northeasternmost major city, and fiery dragon dances in
Canton.
   A 10-part TV series on the dragon will be shown across the
nation.
   The Forbidden City, formerly the imperial palace, is holding a
Dragon Art Exhibition, and a display at Beijing's Nationalities
Museum shows how the dragon is depicted in the folk art of the Miao
minority people from southern China.
   In China's major cities and tourist centers, dragons of all
sizes and shapes adorn doorways to hotels and tourist shops,
grinning from signs welcoming tourists.
   Special dragon-related activities are planned throughout the
year, which officials have designated The International Year of
Tourism. Visitors will be treated to events ranging from a dragon
kite show in Weifang, Shandong province, to traditional dragon boat
races in several major cities.

   China's controversial family planning policies
have failed for the second straight year. The growing willingness
of couples to defy the one-child limit threatens to send the
population zooming out of control.
   China has estimated that to hold its population within the
planned limit of 1.2 billion in 2000 and 1.5 billion in 2050, it
must keep the birth rate below 1.5 percent.
   But the birth rate hit 2 percent in 1986 and stayed there in
1987. If that pace is maintained, China's 1 billion people will
become 2 billion by 2030, according to a recent estimate by the
U.N. Fund for Population Activities.
   In a recent front-page commentary, the official People's Daily
declared the family planning situation was ``out of control'' in
some provinces.
   ``One false move may lose the game,'' it said. ``China's
continuously growing population is in fact facing a crisis.''
   The surge is fueled largely by newly prosperous peasants who
have enough money to pay government fines for breaking the
one-child limit and incentives under the new economic reforms to do
so.
   Since the breakup of communes in the early 1980s, families have
been responsible for farming their own plots of land. More children
to help plant and harvest means more profit.
   Even urban residents, who surveys indicate are less eager than
peasants to have large families, envy the ease with which newly
rich peasants have been able to ``buy'' extra children.
   Fines vary from region to region but generally amount to about
$270 per year for five years. The amount isn't prohibitive if
several family members chip in.
   The average rural income is about $270 per couple, but annual
family incomes of several times that amount are increasingly common.
   City residents face not only fines but suspension from work for
one or two years for having a second child.
   Officials responded to the high 1986 birth rate with calls for
better birth control education. But when the 1987 figures came out,
the family planning minister, Wang Wei, was sacked.
   The government also announced measures to tighten local
enforcement of the one-child limit by linking it to officials'
paychecks.
   At an urgent meeting of family planning officials early this
year, acting Premier Li Peng ordered that officials be rewarded or
punished based on how well they enforce the one-child policy.
   But Chinese authorities, sensitive about past U.S. congressional
charges of coerced abortions, said at a recent news conference that
officials will not be rewarded for high numbers of abortions in
their jurisdictions.
   ``Efforts are to be made to raise the use of birth control and
contraceptive methods and reduce the number of abortions,'' said
Liang Jimin, director of the Family Planning Commission's general
office.
   He insisted that only ``education and persuasion'' would be used
to encourage abortions when families already have a child.
   In an apparent reflection of the new tough attitude, medical
workers in Beijing said hospitals recently have begun refusing
admission to women about to give birth to a second or third child.
   Family planning authorities also have gotten tougher on migrant
worker families who have taken advantage of their roving status to
flout the one-child limit.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said some migrant couples have
as many as five or six children.
   In the northeastern city of Shenyang, officials ruled in January
that employers must issue ``planned birth cards'' to all migrant
workers so their family sizes can be recorded and monitored.
   Family planning education programs have been stepped up. Almost
the only propaganda posters still seen in China are those touting
the one-child policy.
   China Central Television, mindful that half of all Chinese homes
have televisions, broadcast weekly programs on family planning last
year.
   But a combination of demographics and superstition make it
likely births will increase rather than drop in 1988.
   The population of child-bearing women increased by 7 million in
1987 and will grow by 8 million this year, to 297 million, as the
products of China's baby boom of the 1960s reach maturity.
   Furthermore, 1988 is the year of the dragon in China's
traditional 12-year astrological cycle. The dragon is a symbol of
good luck and power, and many young couples are expected to try to
have their one child this year.
   The official Workers' Daily recently tried to debunk traditional
beliefs about lucky ``dragon babies.'' If birth control limits are
ignored, it warned, ``the dragon year will not be lucky for an
over-populated nation.''

<TEXT>
   Comedian Red Skelton and singer Mary
Martin were among the friends who gathered to remember composer
Frederick Loewe as a man who could make life laugh and sing like
the Broadway musicals he helped create.
   ``The tragedy of my life is that I never did get to do a musical
with him,'' Miss Martin, stage star of ``South Pacific,'' and ``The
Sound of Music,'' told about 75 friends and fans at an outdoor
memorial service at Loewe's estate here Wednesday.
   Skelton, a friend for 32 years, called Loewe's music ``the pomp
and splendor of life _ a celestial sound that inspires happiness.''
   Loewe, who combined his music with the words of Alan Jay Lerner
to create such Broadway classics as ``Brigadoon,'' ``My Fair
Lady,'' ``Paint Your Wagon'' and ``Camelot,'' died Sunday of heart
failure. He was 86.
   The two-time Tony Award winner and co-writer of memorable tunes
like ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' ``If Ever I Would Leave
You,'' and ``Thank Heaven for Little Girls'' was buried after a
private graveside service in nearby Cathedral City.
   At the public gathering, Skelton recalled flashes of Loewe's
humor: His responding to a compliment that the music in ``Gigi''
grew on people by calling the show ``a musical fungus,'' and
quipping that the best thing about rock music was that a listener
couldn't tell if his record was scratched.
   ``Life was truly a feast for him,'' said friend Gloria Greer,
``and he wanted to enjoy and savor every bit of it.''
   Dorothy Hart, sister-in-law of composer Lorenz Hart, said Loewe
had a flair for the extravagant even before he made it big.
   ``If he had $90 to his name, then he'd buy $90 worth of
caviar,'' Ms. Hart said.
   Loewe grew up in Vienna, Austria, in a musical family and came
to the United States in his 20s. His marriage of 26 years to the
former Ernestine Zerline ended in divorce, without children.

   The overall percentage is still tiny, just 4.7.
But that represents a big increase, of 33 percent, in the number of
black children attending private schools over a decade and a half.
Black enrollment in Catholic schools was even more remarkable,
growing from 4.8 percent in 1971 to 8.5 percent in 1985, according
to the National Association of Independent Schools. Two stories
report on such schools in Georgia and in Arkansas.

   Happy noises hum down the halls of the
Progressive Christian Academy and filter into the paneled office.
Principal Betty Tolbert stops her paperwork to listen attentively.
   A substantial, gray-haired woman, she seems frozen in her swivel
chair as she strains to catch the sounds coming from the
classrooms, a buzz of song, recitation and prayer.
   Relaxing after a moment, she nods approvingly. A smile melts the
concentration that had creased her forehead.
   ``Yes,'' she says. ``It's a good sound, the sound of children
learning.''
   A bell rings and the halls are filled with children. The girls
are immaculately dressed in green plaid jumpers and white blouses.
The boys wear green pants, white shirts and black ties.
   The children have something in common besides the uniforms: All
482 have dark skins.
   ``Welcome to the Progressive Christian Academy, the only
large-scale, all-black, private Christian school I know of,'' said
Mrs. Tolbert, the 53-year-old founder and driving force behind the
school. ``Our motto is `All things are possible within the Lord.' ''
   The non-profit academy is housed in a one-story brick building
atop a hill near downtown Macon. Until 1983, the building was a
public elementary school. Progressive Christian is leasing it with
an option to buy.
   ``You're looking at a miracle here,'' Mrs. Tolbert said proudly
as she walked down the hall, past photographs of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., Diana Ross and Bill Cosby. ``This place was a
total wreck when we moved in 18 months ago. Now we're a family.
We're also a vital education center that is serving the needs of
black children.''
   Mrs. Tolbert said she came to perceive those needs in the 18
years she was a public schoolteacher and principal.
   ``It was clear to me that the public school system wasn't
providing the moral guidance, the loving discipline and the
positive self-image reinforcement that many children need in order
to flourish,'' she said.
   In the summer of 1985, Betty Tolbert took the plunge with
$50,000 in savings and loans. She opened a trial summer school at
the Progressive Baptist Church, where her husband is pastor.
   ``We had 75 children and taught remedial reading and math with
an emphasis on Christian principles and the development of positive
self-esteem,'' she said. ``It was incredible. I began to see a
change in those children on a daily basis and so did their parents.
They kept telling me their kids were so excited about the school
that they didn't even have to get them up in the mornings.
   ``That fall I quit my job (as principal of an integrated public
magnet school) and opened this school, which goes from K4
(pre-kindergarten) through the eighth grade. We started with 175
students. By the summer of '86, we had 400 students enrolled and
had to move out of the church. Now, with 482 students and 38
employees, we've got cramped quarters once again.''
   The Progressive Christian Academy is one of four mostly black
private schools, including a tiny class run by Seventh-day
Adventists, in Bibb County. Some 5,000 of the county's 30,000
school-age children attend private schools, most of them white.
   ``Most of our children came to us from the public schools, where
many were doing poorly,'' she said. ``They were developing poor
self-images and their parents were afraid their children were going
to be lost.''
   Kendall Reid, a sixth-grader, feels he was one such student.
   ``I was a little mouse. I was so scared I just couldn't speak
up,'' he recalled of his three years in public school. ``I had a
white teacher in the first grade who told my parents I was
retarded. She and the kids used to make fun of me. Now I'm on the
honor roll, and I know I'm not retarded.''
   Other students said they had to work harder at Progressive
Christian and had fewer social and athletic activities yet still
preferred their private school to public classrooms.
   ``The kids here aren't as mad as they were in public school,''
said Latonya Raines, an eighth-grader. ``And the teachers really
seem to care about you here.''
   Bibb County Commissioner William Randall, who worked to
integrate the county's schools two decades ago, said he found the
present situation ironic.
   ``I've got two grandchildren in Mrs. Tolbert's school, including
a grandson who wasn't doing well in public school,'' Randall said.
``My grandson is doing much better now that he's in the private
school.''
   Mrs. Tolbert said her school, in addition to providing a
Christian atmosphere, gives the children positive role models.
   ``They get to see black people in charge,'' she said. ``We also
strive to instill in them the belief that everybody is somebody
special. We stress the worth of the individual.''
   She said her school also accommodates the students' special
needs and schedules.
   ``For one thing, she said, ``we're open from 6 a.m. until 6
p.m., which especially helps single parents. We provide a warm,
loving atmosphere, but we also stress academics and have volunteer
tutors for high-risk failures. Then, too, we supervise the homework
of those students who stay after school.''
   She said the parents pay $30 a week for one child and $50 for
two or more. They must provide books, uniforms and lunches for
their children.
   Several mothers, interviewed as a group, agreed they were
thrilled with the school even though tuition money is hard to spare.
   ``My little boy is happy now. There hasn't been a day he hasn't
gotten up and gotten himself ready for school. Morning can be an
especially tense time for a single parent, and I simply can't tell
you how much this means to me,'' said Natalie Coggins, a Social
Security claims examiner with two children at the school.
   Mrs. Tolbert said parents of eighth-graders want her to offer
high school classes so children won't have to return to public
school.
   ``I'm also getting requests from parents outside the area to
start a boarding school,'' she added. ``I'd like to do that, but
first we need to raise enough money to pay off our bills and
complete our library, which we need to do to be fully accredited.''
The school now has provisional accreditation and plans a library
fund-raising drive.
   ``I feel certain these things will all come in time. Meanwhile,
I must be doing something right. It's all I can do, when I go out
in the hall, not to get knocked down by all the hugs I get.''

<HEAD>Purported `Energy Machine' Inventor in Patent Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inventor who claims he has devised a
machine that produces more energy than it uses says he will appeal
a judge's refusal to force the government to give him a patent for
his invention.
   ``I am pleased the judge has finally ruled because I am counting
on getting up to the higher court,'' Joseph W. Newman said
Wednesday after U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
rejected his lawsuit against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
   ``I was very certain he was going to be consistent and rule
against me,'' said Newman, 51, of Lucedale, Miss.
   Jackson upheld the Patent Office's refusal to grant a patent for
the device, saying there was insufficient scientific evidence to
support Newman's claim the machine converted matter into energy.
   Patent examiners rejected Newman's application after ruling that
such a machine would violate the second law of thermodynamics. That
law of physics holds that energy is inevitably consumed by any
mechanical process so that a machine cannot produce more energy
than is used to power it.
   The same law rules out the existence of similar, so-called
``perpetual motion'' machines that some inventors have claimed at
various times to have produced.
   Newman and his attorney, John Flannery, contended that Jackson
had improperly rejected the findings of court-appointed expert
William Schuyler, himself a former patent commissioner, that the
machine worked as Newman claimed it did.
   ``We have an expert ... who agrees with our view and we have a
district court judge's opinion that differs with that,'' Flannery
said. ``So I think we will have to go the Court of Appeals for a
tie-breaker.''
   Ruling on the five-year-old lawsuit, Jackson said Newman had
only produced evidence to support his theory that was ``anecdotal
and largely qualitative rather than quantified measured data.''
   Nor had Newman, the judge found, rebutted the findings of the
National Bureau of Standards, which tested the machine and
concluded: ``The device did not deliver more energy than it used.''
   Newman, who has demonstrated his motor to a congressional
subcommittee, claims that it converts matter he calls ``gyroscopic
particles'' into energy.
   But the judge found that ``aside from Newman's own somewhat
metaphysical writings which appear at multiple points throughout
his patent application there is no evidence whatsoever ... from
which to find the existence of such `gyroscopic particles,' their
observable (or measurable) `release' or `reaction' within the
device.''
   Newman's machine resembles an ordinary electric motor except for
a large coil of wire used to create an electromagnetic field when
powered by batteries.
   ``At best,'' the judge said, ``the evidence supports a finding
that Newman's device will operate, for reasons not explained at all
but must be merely guessed at, on dry cell batteries for longer
periods of time than others which may or may not be comparable.
   ``But such a device is not the one for which Newman seeks a
patent,'' Jackson said in his 20-page opinion. ``He is unequivocal
in his insistence that the device he has tendered as patent-worthy
produces more useable energy output than the energy required to
power it. The court finds the evidence of it insufficient.''
   The bitterly fought lawsuit included a 1986 episode when
Flannery was cited for contempt of court for pressing Newman's
demand that Jackson disqualify himself from the case because he was
biased.
   ``I have had just about enough of your insolence in this case,''
the judge told Flannery. Jackson later withdrew the contempt
citation.

<TEXT>
   Government officials and businessmen
say charges they enriched themselves on U.S. foreign aid are false
or misleading and were timed to embarrass Costa Rica before
Congress voted on rebel funding.
   U.S. Embassy sources and several other businessmen say some of
the accusations are true.
   Local officials are reacting angrily to a U.S. State Department
memo which charges that U.S. Embassy officials in Costa Rica
misspent and mismanaged millions of dollars in foreign aid,
including providing college scholarships for children of
influential citizens and creating a development agency that largely
benefited politicians.
   A Costa Rican government spokesman, who agreed to be interviewed
only on condition of anonymity, said no formal response was planned
until the memo can be clarified.
   ``When something like this hits the public, people have the
right not only to feel angry but to feel extremely angry,'' he said.
   The memo said actions by U.S. officials and wealthy and
influential Costa Ricans who helped distribute the aid ``closely
approach criminal conduct.''
   Portions of the memo first were disclosed in a story written by
the Scripps Howard News Service and published in several U.S.
newspapers in late January, just two weeks before Congress voted on
an aid proposal for rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government. The Associated Press carried a lengthy story on the
memo last week from Washington.
   Congress rejected the Contra rebel proposal in early February.
But Costa Rican officials say release of the memo before the vote
was designed to muddy the image of the country and its president,
Oscar Arias, who has been an influential opponent of the Reagan
administration's Contra policy.
   Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize last fall for a Central American
peace plan that forbids foreign funding of rebel groups in the
region and calls for a negotiated political settlement to the
area's conflicts.
   The peace plan has, at least temporarily, pre-empted the Reagan
administration policy of using military pressure on the Sandinistas.
   The confidential memo was written Oct. 9, 1987, by the State
Department's inspector general, Herbert L. Beckington, to Alan
Woods, administrator of the Agency for International Development,
known as AID, that distributes the money.
   In the memo, Beckington claimed the former AID director in Costa
Rica, Daniel J. Chaij, personally approved loans and grants that
benefited some of the country's most prominent business and
political figures.
   Most of the alleged activities took place before Arias was
elected in 1986.
   After the memo was first published Jan. 20, Costa Rica's
ambassador to Washington, Guido Fernandez, questioned ``why
confidential reports supplied more than four months ago should be
leaked to the press at this particular time.''
   Costa Rica's finance minister, Fernando Naranjo, told reporters
that the story was ``a complete unmitigated lie.''
   Both Fernandez and Naranjo were identified as beneficiaries of
AID programs.
   Several sources in the Costa Rican government and private sector
say they believe some of the accusations are valid.
   ``There was some poor judgment used in how they decided some of
these projects,'' said one U.S. Embassy source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Other officials said parts of the memo were false and written in
inflammatory language to make legitimate activities appear illegal
or questionable.
   They said a second audit exonerated many of the people mentioned
in the Oct. 9 memo, but the audit has not been released.
   Jack Harris, a Costa Rican business executive also named in the
memo, said some of the facts in it appear to be true, but were
``mischievously distorted and given sinister and malicious
interpretations.''
   Harris and others said one example is a charge that a small
group of Costa Ricans set up a system by which they were able to
evade local taxes on money earned from AID contracts.
   They said the memo made the practice seem illegal, although it
is a legally established tax shelter system in Costa Rica.
   ``It is not done this way in the United States, but in Costa
Rica it is,'' Harris said. ``It's a shelter _ legal, decent, upheld
by law. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, but the
insinuations made in the memo are insidious.''
   Legislators in Costa Rica and the United States are planning
investigations into how AID money was used in Costa Rica. The Costa
Ricans say they also will look into why the critical memo was
leaked to the press.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration and the oil industry
have narrowly bested the environmentalists in Round 1 of their
intense fight over petroleum development in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.
   The administration's victory came Wednesday as the Senate Energy
Committee voted 10-9 to open the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain to
oil rigs, a controversial step that the Interior Department and Big
Oil have been urging on Congress for a year.
   Under the committee's plan, drilling rigs could join the caribou
and musk oxen on the refuge's frigid tundra as early as 21 months
after enactment of a law repealing the current prohibition against
development in the refuge.
   The issue has become a major battleground. The environmental
lobby is trying to protect the fragile ecosystem from any
development. The other side says the area's potentially huge
reserves could rival those of nearby Prudhoe Bay, which accounts
for about 20 percent of domestic oil production.
   Drilling foes like Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., said that even
though the committee was readying legislation for the full Senate,
they think they can hold their ground this year in hope that the
next president will oppose development.
   In fact, Wirth said, Senate action in 1988 may be academic:
``Nothing's going to happen this year in the House _ zero. The
Interior Committee isn't going to bring it up.''
   Syd Butler, conservation vice president of the Wilderness
Society, said that while he was disappointed in the committee
action, ``I'm real happy with the division: a 10-9 vote is not a
clear mandate for opening ANWR.''
   The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's lobbying
arm, said in a statement that ``the committee has taken a step
toward ensuring the future energy security and economic well-being
of our country. ... The time has come to proceed with the
legislation. We urge the Senate and the House to move
expeditiously.''
   Wirth and his allies tried to persuade the committee to defer a
decision on drilling until the administration could study the
nation's long-term energy needs and formulate a policy to meet them.
   But Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, the point man for the
development forces, told the committee in a letter that new oil
from the Arctic is needed under any scenario, including increased
conservation.
   Hodel criticized the direction being taken by the committee as
it continues work on the refuge legislation. He objected to
proposals for detailed environmental safeguards and a 10-year
stretchout in the oil-tract leasing process.
   Hodel was also critical of a decision made two weeks ago by the
committee to earmark 80 percent of the federal revenues from refuge
oil to conservation and species protection programs, with only 20
percent available for general use.
   ``ANWR's resources belong to all Americans,'' Hodel said.
``Federal revenues generated by an ANWR leasing program should go
to the Treasury where they can benefit all taxpayers and serve
national priorities.''
   Bob Walker, an Interior spokesman, said he did not know whether
Hodel's problems with the bill could lead to a recommendation that
it be vetoed. Walker said Interior officials were pleased by
Wednesday's vote because ``we're still moving in the general
direction we want to go.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan Budget Reveals Hoped-for Legacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The budget President Reagan sent to Congress
today isn't likely to survive long but it embodies a philosophy of
government that he hopes will be a legacy of his administration.
   It also demonstrates some changes in approach that the president
has either embraced or had thrust upon him since he took office
more than seven years ago.
   The budget makes a strong pitch for Reagan's long-held position
that government should not perform functions which, in his
conservative view of things, can be done better by private
organizations.
   It proposes, for instance, the ``complete privatization'' of
military housing and construction of waste water treatment plants.
It also calls for a new private entity to mediate disputes that now
choke the U.S. Tax Court.
   In line with his firm belief in an economy governed by market
forces, the president reiterates proposals to cut back federal
programs that prop up commodity prices and protect farmers' incomes.
   And, as he so often has, he calls for the elimination of federal
programs that he says are unneeded. This time he lists nine of
them, ranging from the rural housing insurance fund to
discretionary grants for urban mass transit.
   Notable by its absence, however, is the idea, which he put
forward in 1982, of abolishing the Department of Education.
Instead, the president proposes an increase of $650 million over
the current appropriation of $16.2 billion for the department's
discretionary programs.
   Adopting arguments of Secretary of Education William Bennett,
Reagan now says education and training are one of the highest
priorities of the federal government.
   Under a compromise worked out with Congress, the president
agrees to a slowdown in the military buildup that has been a
hallmark of his administration. But he pointedly says in his budget
message that he wants the full $229.5 billion compromise figure
appropriated, declaring, ``I have kept my side of the bargain and
trust that Congress will keep its side.''
   As he enters the twilight of his presidency, Reagan has
increasingly expressed his commitment, most recently in a speech to
conservative political activists last week, to making what has been
called the ``Reagan revolution'' of restrained government a
permanent feature of American life.
   However that may be, the particulars of his budget blueprint
undoubtedly are in for drastic alteration by a Congress, controlled
in both houses by the opposition party, facing a president whose
political clout is weakened as he nears the end of his tenure.
   In his budget message, the president says that ``the budget
process has so degenerated in recent years that the presidential
budget is routinely discarded'' after it arrives on Capitol Hill.
   What the president calls degeneration many in Congress would
describe as a healthy assertion of their constitutional power over
the purse strings.
   Either way, however, it makes the president's budget more of an
outline of goals and philosophy than a map of actual spending for
the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1 and last for more than eight
months after Reagan leaves office.

   Leftist guerrillas have struck 20 times
in the past five weeks at the lifeline of the nation's oil industry
_ a 500-mile pipeline that runs through some of the most rugged
terrain in Colombia.
   The attacks have raised the question of whether this South
American nation will be able to maintain its oil exports.
   The National Liberation Army has blown up parts of the pipeline
13 times since Jan. 12, temporarily shutting down the line and
forcing Colombia to suspend its 137,000 barrels a day of oil
exports.
   Another seven attacks did not damage the pipeline, according to
sources with Occidental Petroleum Co. who asked to remain anonymous
for security reasons.
   The pipeline carries oil from the Canon Limon field in the
northeast state of Arauca to Puerto Covenas on the Caribbean coast.
   The field is owned half by the state oil company Ecopetrol and
half by Occidental and Royal Dutch Shell.
   Canon Limon, discovered four years ago by Occidental, was one of
the world's biggest oil discoveries in a decade. With a billion
barrels of reserves, it was hailed as Colombia's economic salvation.
   At the time, the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN,
appeared to be a ragtag band of rebels. The series of attacks has
shown that the ELN has grown considerably in strength and that the
army is incapable of defending the pipeline.
   The bombings have caused 100,000 barrels of oil to be spilled,
much of it into rivers and streams.
   The pipeline was put into service Dec. 7, 1986, allowing
Colombia to export oil for the first time since 1972.
   The Canon Limon field is capable of producing 300,000 barrels of
oil a day, but Ecopetrol initially limited production to 180,000
barrels a day. That limit was increased to 215,000 barrels in
December.
   An Ecopetrol source said the limit will be raised to 300,000
barrels a day sometime this year. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity because all information about the pipeline is supposed to
come from the Defense Ministry, which refused to comment.
   Between December 1986 and December 1987, there were about 40
dynamite attacks on the pipeline. Many bombs didn't go off. The few
that exploded did little damage, and the pipeline would be out of
service for only a few hours.
   But between Jan. 12 and Jan. 29, the ELN attacked the pipeline
every day. On Jan. 12 there were two explosions that caused a spill
of 27,200 barrels of oil and forcing Ecopetrol to close down the
pipeline.
   The army and President Virgilio Barco said army patrols along
the pipeline would be increased.
   The line was opened again Feb. 5. Barely enough pressure had
built up to begin full pumping when an attack on Feb. 9 destroyed
120 feet of pipeline.
   Ecopetrol was forced to close the pipeline again. It reopened
Wednesday, and Colombia resumed its oil exports, according to a
news release issued by the Minister of Mines, Guillermo Perry.
   Crews in helicopters have little chance of spotting guerrillas
in the dense jungles through which the pipe runs.
   The rebels initially just tried to blow up pipe, but more
recently they have started keying on the line's big valves, which
cannot be repaired or replaced quickly.
   The ELN first emerged in 1960, shortly after Fidel Castro's
triumph in Cuba. It was organized by a Roman Catholic priest,
Camilo Torres, who was later killed in a battle with troops in 1966.
   The army estimates that the ELN has fewer than 500 combatants.
There are believed to be a total of about 7,000 armed rebels in
Colombia's five leftist rebel groups.

   Actor David Rasche, who plays Sledge Hammer
in the ABC-TV comedy series of the same name, told high school
drama students that persistence and fate are the keys to acting
success.
   Rasche, whose mother-in-law teaches at West Albany High School,
stopped by the school Tuesday and was swarmed by teen-age fans.
   Rasche, 43, plays a macho, trigger-happy police detective in the
series, which is a parody of police shows. ``Sledge Hammer!'' is in

   He said he has been plugging away at acting since the first
grade, when he played George Washington in a school play.
   ``I was good. I was very, very good,'' Rasche said.

   A man who actor Sean Penn accused of
intruding on his property and punching him pleaded innocent to
misdemeanor charges of prowling and assault.
   Richard Barcelo, 20, of Chino entered the pleas Wednesday in
Municipal Court, where Judge Lawrence Mira ordered him to return
March 8 for pretrial motions.
   Penn and his wife, pop singer Madonna, told authorities they
discovered Barcelo and two 17-year-old boys at their estate when
they returned home from the grocery store shortly after midnight
Jan. 20.
   Penn, who plays a policeman in his latest movie, ``Colors,''
subdued Barcelo by striking him on the head with a newly purchased
bottle of salad dressing, sheriff's deputies said.
   The star of ``Bad Boys'' and ``The Falcon and the Snowman'' has
had several brushes with the law for scuffles in bars and on movie
sets, but reported being the victim twice last month. An Anaheim
man allegedly crashed his pickup truck through Penn's gate Jan. 7,
and is scheduled for a Feb. 24 court appearance.
   Prosecutors withheld details of the two juveniles' court cases.

   Actor Matthew Broderick, who had faced up to
five years in prison for his role in a fatal car crash in Northern
Ireland, defended a magistrate's decision to fine him for the
lesser charge of careless driving.
   ``I'm glad the court decided that there was no basis for
charging me with reckless driving,'' Broderick said in a statement
Wednesday. ``There was never any evidence for that charge. They
also determined that the details of the accident will never be
fully known. However it happened, it was a tragedy.''
   John Gallagher, whose wife, Anna, 28, and mother-in-law,
Margaret Doherty, 60, were killed in the crash Aug. 5, denounced
the decision reached Monday in Enniskillen, which amounted to a
$175 fine.
   Publicist Wendy Morris said Broderick, who was allowed to remain
in New York while his lawyer entered his guilty plea, planned to
try to speak with the victims' family, ``but he doesn't think now
is the right time.''
   The 25-year-old star of the movies ``War Games'' and ``Ferris
Bueller's Day Off'' suffered a broken leg in the collision. His
passenger, actress Jennifer Grey, was not hurt.

   Prince Charles took the oath of allegiance to his
mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in the House of Lords, a formality
allowing him to speak if he wants to during the current session of
Parliament.
   Apart from state occasions, Wednesday was the first time Charles
had gone before the unelected upper house since 1975, when he spoke
about voluntary service. Members of the royal family are
automatically in the House of Lords but rarely go there and

   After swearing his allegiance, the crown prince signed the Test
Roll, confirming he accepts the queen as head of the Church of
England.
   The 50 or so lords and ladies present of the 1,200 entitled to
sit there cried, ``Hear, hear,'' _ the customary words of approval
_ as the popular prince shook hands with the lord chancellor, Lord
Mackay of Clashfern, and left the chamber.

<HEAD>Big Companies Endorse Active Role in AIDS Education</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty employers, including some of the nation's
biggest corporations, on Wednesday endorsed a 10-point ``bill of
rights'' on AIDS in the workplace formulated by a citizens group.
   The companies committed themselves to taking an active role in
educating their employees about AIDS and protecting job rights of
AIDS sufferers.
   Among the principles formulated by the Citizens Commission on
AIDS for New York City and Northern New Jersey is a statement that
people with AIDS or its virus ``are entitled to the same rights and
opportunities as people with other serious or life-threatening
illnesses.''
   In addition, it states, AIDS victims ``do not pose a risk of
transmission of the virus to coworkers through ordinary workplace
contact.''
   Another principle is that ``employers should provide employees
with sensitive, accurate and up-to-date education about risk
reduction in their personal lives.''
   Requiring workers or job applicants take blood tests for the
virus is specifically rejected, as is divulging medical information
about an employee.
   IBM was the first company to endorse the principles, said John
Zucotti, co-chairman of the commission.
   Others endorsing the principles included AT&T, Time Inc.,
Johnson & Johnson, Warner-Lambert, ITT, Dow Jones, Chemical Bank,
the City of New York and the teachers' unions of New York City and
Newark, N.J.
   Also, United Jersey Banks, Shubert Organization, Times Mirror
Co., Atlantic Industries; Ms., Atlantic, Sassy and U.S. News and
World Report magazines; Rubenstein Associates, Rockefeller Brothers
Fund and the National Urban League.
   Also, the Girl Scouts, Salvation Army, Red Cross of Greater New
York, New Jersey A. Philip Randolph Institute, Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund, Fund for the City of New York, Wildcat Services
and Archie Comics.
   Zucotti said the commission would pursue other employers and
umbrella organizations of business and labor to endorse the
principles.
   A number of businesses have asked for time to study the
principles and a few rejected them, on grounds they might open
themselves to lawsuits, said Zucotti.
   Zucotti declined to identify the rejecting companies, but a
commission member, Thomas Stoddard, executive director of the
Lambda fund for gay rights, said he thought the companies feared
stigma more than lawsuits.
   State and federal statues prohibit discrimination against people
who have AIDS but can work, so the principles require no more of a
company legally than laws already on the books, Stoddard said.
   ``Those companies that have subscribed to these principles have
been very courageous,'' said Stoddard. ``They have been willing to
take the heat because they understand the gravity of the problem.
We will continue to have the problem of stigmatization until all
companies subscribe to these principles.''
   Proposing and promoting the principles were the first public act
of the 15-member commission, which was established in July and
funded by 17 local foundations.
   Zucotti said the commission's mission was to marshal information
and mobilize effort to improve care for AIDS sufferers, promote
prevention and education about the fatal disease and address its
social impact.

<HEAD>Democrats' Contra Aid Package Maintains Current Funding Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new package of purely ``humanitarian'' aid
being drafted by House Democrats for Nicaragua's Contra rebels will
continue supplying the resistance at the current rate of about $1.8
million a month.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright said Wednesday that other crucial
questions about the aid package, which is scheduled to come to the
House floor next week, remain unanswered.
   Unresolved are such difficult issues as how the aid will be
delivered, its duration, and what kinds of incentives might be
offered to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government to encourage
compliance with a regional peace accord.
   ``It is taking shape,'' Wright, D-Texas, said of the proposal. A
group of House members, primarily Democrats, has been meeting daily
to work out details of the bill, which was promised as an
alternative to the administration's $36.2 million aid package
rejected on Feb. 4.
   In contrast with the administration's package, which included
$3.6 million for ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles and millions
more for non-lethal military supplies, Wright's proposal would be
limited to food, clothing and medical supplies and assistance.
   The $1.8 million monthly figure does not include transportation
costs, which currently are costing a like amount each month but
could be lower if the aid were delivered by an international,
neutral organization such as the Red Cross.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who is leading the drafting
sessions, said the bill also will include a program to aid children
injured during the six-year civil war.
   Wright said under consideration as well is a possible lifting of
trade sanctions against Nicaragua and economic aid to other
countries in the region, contingent on fulfillment of promises of
democratization made in the five-nation peace agreement.
   But he emphasized that such moves could be made only with the
``enthusiastic'' backing of the administration, which would be
charged with carrying them out. So far, the administration and
Republican congressional leaders have declined to participate in
drafting the legislation.
   Wright said the bill will seek to provide ``balanced
incentives'' to encourage both the Contras and the Sandinistas to
work out a cease-fire and live up to the peace agreement signed
last Aug. 7.
   Both Wright and Bonior appeared cool to the idea, mentioned
earlier by House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., that the
legislation would include a ban or restriction on fund-raising for
the Contras by private U.S. citizens.
   ``I know of no provision contemplated,'' Wright said when asked
about the issue.
   Meanwhile, a congressional opponent of aid to the Contras asked
President Reagan to strengthen assurances that U.S. government
personnel will not again become mired in private fund raising for
the rebels as it did in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., also asked that Reagan clarify the
tax-exempt status of a fund the Contras have established to solicit
private contributions from U.S. citizens.
   Last week, White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. and
national security adviser Colin L. Powell issued a memorandum
directing that ``no administration official'' provide aid to
private fund-raising efforts for the Contras.
   But because the memorandum was not issued by the president
himself and was addressed only to White House and National Security
Council staff members, Contra opponents have questioned whether the
directive contained an important loophole.
   Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations foreign operations
subcommittee, noted that federal law prohibits such activity and
that all federal officials, including those at the State Department
and CIA, should be covered by the White House prohibition.
   He also raised questions about the Contras' fund-raising arm,
the Nicaraguan Resistance Education Foundation. Contributions to
the fund are tax-deductible.
   Obey noted that the fund had been created last October simply by
changing the name of another organization that already had
tax-exempt status, the John Davis Lodge Foundation for
International Studies.

<HEAD>Shultz Unlikely To Set Summit Date In Moscow Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is unlikely to agree on a
date for the next superpower summit meeting until the Senate
ratifies a treaty to ban intermediate-range nuclear missiles, a
senior U.S. official says.
   ``I really think the Soviets probably would wait for the INF
ratification,'' the official said Wednesday. ``Don't ask me why.
But I just sense it's going to be important to them to have this
process that was started by the signature at the Washington summit
completed.''
   The official, whose identity was shielded under briefing rules
at the State Department, referred to the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty to scrap about 2,700 U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles.
   It was signed by President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in December and is before the Senate for ratification.
   In the meantime, Secretary of State George P. Shultz will hold
talks in Moscow next Sunday and Monday on preparations for their
next summit meeting. It is to be held in Moscow, possibly in late
May or early June.
   The centerpiece of that fourth and final meeting between the two
leaders is supposed to be a more ambitious treaty to reduce by 30
percent to 50 percent the overall U.S. and Soviet arsenals of
long-range bombers, land-based missiles and submarines.
   But the official said negotiations in Geneva had slowed down for
several reasons. The Soviets are trying to restrict Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, the program to develop a space-based
shield against ballistic missiles, and the United States is
resisting various restrictions on cruise missiles.
   Shultz will meet on Sunday with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and on Monday with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze. He is
due to fly to Brussels on Tuesday to brief the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization allies on the results.
   Meanwhile, Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman,
announced Shultz also will meet with Andrei D. Sakharov, the noted
Soviet dissident, while he is in Moscow.
   ``Human rights is high on his agenda,'' Redman said Wednesday.
``Mr. Sakharov obviously is a person well-placed to talk about
these kind of issues.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway, in a U.S.
government telecast to Western Europe, said human rights has
``pride of place'' in Shultz' plans.
   Other key items are the slowed-down negotations in Geneva to
produce a new arms control agreement, the prospective withdrawal of
120,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan and U.S. efforts to arrange
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Sakharov, winner of the Nobel peace prize in 1975, is a
physicist who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s.
His subsequent outspoken support for human rights and opposition to
the Afghanistan invasion led to his banishment to the closed city
of Gorky in 1980.
   He remained there until 1986, when he was permitted to return to
Moscow amid Gorbachev's liberalization policy.

<HEAD>Authorities: Stories Of Sex On Ice May Be Fish Tales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARRISON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stories abound that prostitutes
frequently visit ice fishing houses on Mille Lacs Lake, where as
many as 10,000 men gather on winter weekends, but authorities say
they may just be fish stories.
   ``Personally, I've never run across the hooks, but I remember
they were supposed to be working the lake back in the '60s,'' said
Jerry Anderson, a fishing guide on the large central Minnesota lake
whose shoreline includes this town.
   ``At least it makes a nice story. January and February can be a
real boring time of year up here,'' he said.
   But Jim Forbord, a state conservation officer who has worked the
lake for nine years, said he wouldn't be surprised if truth is
found in one of two theories: Prostitutes peddle their wares
fishhouse door to fishhouse door, or they do business in their own
fishhouse.
   ``When you check houses you run into everything under the sun,''
he said. ``You don't know if they're girlfriends, boyfriends, wives
or what. Sometimes I have to let them pull on a blanket before I
come in.''
   Authorities say no arrests or prosecutions on prostitution
charges have been made in any of the three counties that include
parts of the lake.
   Last fall, however, an Aitkin County sheriff's deputy
investigated a report that two local women were operating as
prostitutes on the southeast shore, said Sheriff Bill Sobey. The
report seemed credible, but there wasn't enough evidence to make an
arrest, he said.
   ``I used to always figure it was just talk,'' Sobey said. ``I've
never had a fishhouse myself, so I've never had a chance to find
out.''
   He believes authorities would know if prostitutes were active in
the area. ``You'd hear something. People talk,'' he said.
   Crow Wing County Attorney Stephen Rathke said, ``I'd heard of it
for years and I guess I've always assumed it was true because it's
so logical. You know, literally thousands of men in these little
fish houses.''
   This winter, there are nearly 4,000 fish houses on the lake,
giving the frozen lake a bigger population than any of the cities
on its shore.
   ``You've got to realize you get a real rowdy crew out there,''
said Anderson. ``There's gambling, seeing who can drink the most.
Maybe that's how the stories start.''
   Forbord has his own theory about the stories: ``Fishermen like
to talk a pretty good brag. When you spend all weekend staring at a
bobber, you start thinking about something else to do.''

<HEAD>Historian Says U.S. or U.K. Could Have Records on Commando Murders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A historian on the panel that investigated
President Kurt Waldheim's wartime past said Britain or America
could have missing records that show whether Waldheim was involved
in the executions of six British commandos.
   Historian Gerald Fleming, who is pressing U.S. archivists about
the German army records, spoke Wednesday, a day after Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher ordered a new investigation into
Waldheim's alleged connection with the executions.
   The commandos were captured in the Balkans in 1944 and
interrogated by the German army unit in which Waldheim was an
intelligence officer.
   ``We need to know who signed the interrogations and who
initialed them ... The honor of this country is at stake,'' said
Fleming in an interview.
   ``This will give us that final stone in the large mosaic on
which the commission labored,'' said Fleming, the only British
member of the international commission that investigated Waldheim.
   The commission's report, released last week, questioned
Waldheim's moral integrity, saying he was ``in close proximity'' to
Nazi atrocities when he served as a lieutenant in the German army
during World War II.
   The panel left open the question of whether Waldheim committed
war crimes, but it concluded that Waldheim tried to cover up his
involvement in the war.
   It also found that Waldheim knew of Adolf Hitler's orders for
the ``merciless extermination'' of captured Allied commandos.
   The Austrian government appointed the commission in 1986 after
the U.S. Justice Department banned Waldheim from the United States,
placing him on a ``watch list'' of undesirable aliens.
   Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing during the war.
   In Vienna, meanwhile, a session of the conservative national
leadership was called today to discuss the negative impact of the
historians' report.
   The conservative tabloid Kurier today quoted unidentified
sources as saying the meeting of People's Party leaders would
``reconsider'' its defense of the president.
   Waldheim, who is not a member of the People's Party, has enjoyed
unqualified support from its senior oficials. But recently several
prominent conservative politicians have criticized the president.
   In Britain, Mrs. Thatcher ordered the commando investigation
reopened under pressure from a British legislator, Robert Rhodes
James, who was on Waldheim's staff while Waldheim was U.N.
secretary-general from 1972-82.
   Rhodes James claims the Soviet Union knew at the end World War
II that Yugoslavia accused Waldheim of being a war criminal. He
also contends that Britain and America also may have covered up
facts when Waldheim became U.N. chief.
   Yugoslavia dropped its charges against Waldheim but never has
explained why.
   In the interview, Fleming dealt diplomatically with questions
about a possible Anglo-American cover-up of the commando incident.
   ``I incline to the view ... they (the interrogation records) are
in the hands of some military authority or government authority
over here or in America.
   ``If they do exist it would seem extraordinary that they have
not come to light up to now,'' he said.
   Fleming said he has had no reply to a letter he sent Jan. 23 to
Robert Wolfe, head of the U.S. Modern Military Archives in
Washington, asking about the interrogation records.
   Fleming, who has written again, said the silence is unusual when
contrasted with prompt responses he has received previously.
   A raiding party of Greek partisans and seven British commandos
was captured in a small boat off the German-occupied Greek island
of Alimina.
   One commando divulged military secrets and survived. The rest,
who refused to talk, were handed over to ``representatives'' of
Waldheim's immediate superior, Lt. Col. Herbert Warstorff, British
Foreign Office records show.
   Fleming said German military documents of the capture, known as
the Alimina file, lack records of the second interrogation of the
commandos by Waldheim's unit, before they faced firing squads.
   Attached to the Alimina file was a note scrawled in English
saying, ``Do not film this sheet. Interrogations reports removed
because of security classification.''
   Some of the British Foreign Office and Defense Ministry
documents about the commandos have been destroyed. The Foreign
Office said the files were shredded in 1978 in routine
housecleaning.
   A 1986 inquiry based on remaining British government records did
not link Waldheim to the executions.
   But Rhodes James pressed this week for another inquiry following
the historical commission's investigations.
   ``The role of successive British governments must be examined,''
Rhodes James, a member of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party, told
reporters Tuesday. ``There is a consistent pattern of a cover-up.''

Origin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Anatomically modern humans lived in Israel
92,000 years ago, scientists said today in a study that pushes back
the earliest known reliable date for the ancient humans by some
50,000 years.
   The finding supports the hypothesis that anatomically modern
humans evolved in Africa rather than independently in several
places, and weighs against the idea that they descended from
Neanderthals, scientists said.
   The study, reported by scientists from France and Israel, is
``very important for the study of the human evolution,'' said David
Pilbeam, anthrolopology professor at Harvard University.
   The work appears in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Researchers reported that 20 burnt flints found along with
ancient human remains in the Qafzeh cave in lower Galilee were
about 92,000 years old, give or take 5,000 years. So the ancient
humans lived there that long ago, researchers said.
   That means some anatomically modern humans occupied southwest
Asia before Neanderthals arrived, a sharp challenge to the view
that they evolved from Neanderthals, wrote Chris Stringer of the
British Museum (Natural History) in an editorial accompanying the
report.
   Neanderthals lived in Europe and Asia from about 150,000 or
200,000 years ago until about 35,000 years ago.
   Harvard's Pilbeam said the Israeli finding more than doubles
``what was previously accepted as a really good age for modern
humans,'' which was 35,000 to 40,000 years.
   Eric Delson, anthropology professor at Lehman College in New
York, said some fossils from Africa suggests ages of 90,000 years
and even older for modern humans, but that the evidence for those
dates is not firm.
   In a telephone interview, Delson said the new finding supports
the view that modern man arose in Africa because it provides an
early date for their living near that continent. The theory holds
that more than 100,000 years ago, modern humans split into a group
that stayed in Africa and another that went to Europe and Asia.
   The humans in the Israeli cave may well have been members of
early Eurasian stock, different from any living race but near the
common ancestor of non-Africans, Delson said.
   Stringer, in his editorial, said the early date for the Israeli
population poses some questions, such as why modern humans took
another 50,000 years to register their presence in Europe and the
Far East.
   Perhaps the environment to the north was too unsuitable, or the
Neanderthals too well established, to allow a migration until all
that time had elapsed, he said. Or perhaps they did migrate
earlier, and their fossil remains have yet to be discovered,
Stringer wrote.

   The U.S. dollar drifted lower against the Japanese
yen in trading in Tokyo Thursday, while stock prices rallied.
   The dollar's close matched its opening of 130.00 yen, but it was
0.41 yen lower than Wednesday's closing of 130.41.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 84.29 point-winner Wednesday, climbed 245.41
points, or 1 percent, to close at 24,675.36.
   A currency dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the dollar ``was drifting lower,
despite no major negative news.''
   The dollar's current level against the yen is within 0.2 yen of
the 129.85 yen-level where it was trading early last Friday, before
the release of U.S. trade figures which showed a decline in
December's trade deficit.
   The modest rally on the stock exchange was fueled by strong
interest in Japanese consumption-related issues, said an analyst at
Wako Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``What stands out particularly is strong interest in financials,
such as banks and trusts, and ... stronger demand for supermarkets
and department stores resulting from growing spending for
consumption,'' he said.
   Despite the dollar's gradual slide since the release of the
trade figures last Friday, Japanese blue chips were generally
strong, and some traders said they believed the Ministry of Finance
and major Japanese brokerages were cooperating to maintain share
prices.
   Trading was thin. Volume at the end of the morning session was
estimated at 350 million shares, down from 400 million shares
during Wednesday's morning session.

<HEAD>Labor, FRA Disagree Over Whether Drugs, Faulty Equipment Main
Fault</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rail labor unions say the Federal Railroad
Administration is focusing too much attention on drug testing of
train operators and too little on enforcing regulations covering
faulty equipment.
   The federal railroad administrator countered that the criticism
was ``an obvious diversionary tactic'' to shift attention from the
drug-use issue.
   At a news conference Wednesday, the Railway Labor Executives'
Association, a rail labor umbrella group, said the focus on drug
testing and alleged drug use by rail employees has ``clouded a much
deeper problem surrounding rail safety - lax, ineffective
enforcement of existing rail safety laws.''
   James Kennedy, the labor group's executive secretary, said that
the federal railroad agency's failure to level fines against
railroads for defective equipment, defective track and its failure
to enforce other rail safety laws has resulted in an ``enforcement
gap'' in the industry.
   ``Clearly the (rail) carriers have no incentive to comply with
safety laws or regulations. ... There is no incentive for
preventing action by the carriers to avoid hazardous conditions for
employees and the public,'' said Kennedy.
   The issue of drug use by rail employees came to the fore last
year when 16 people died in a collision near Baltimore between an
Amtrak passenger train and a string of three Conrail diesel engines.
   On Tuesday, Conrail engineer Ricky L. Gates pleaded guilty to
manslaughter and admitted he had been smoking marijuana shortly
before the accident. Tests also showed the presence of marijuana in
a Conrail brakeman.
   Last week, a federal appeals court in San Francisco declared the
federal drug testing requirement after railroad accidents
unconstititutional. The ruling, hailed by the rail unions, is being
appealed by government.
   The labor group said that in 1986 FRA inspectors found 314,886
safety defects at the nation's railroads, but that only 6,497
resulted in safety violation reports being filed and even fewer
resulted in civil penalties against the railroads.
   Federal railroad administrator John Riley called the statistics
misleading because many of the safety defects were minor. ``We
prosecuted more than 99 percent of all violations that our
inspectors sent to us for prosecution,'' he said.
   Riley said that while accidents due to track, equipment, signals
or hardware have declined by more than 75 percent in the past
decade, the accidents involving human performance have ``climbed
dramatically.'' He said virtually all the fatal accidents last year
were linked to human performance.
   ``Those numbers speak for themselves,'' continued Riley. He
called the criticsm from rail labor ``an obvious diversionary
tactic (and) ... an attempt to erect a fig leaf to distract
attention away'' from the drug issue and attempts by his agency to
get enforcement authority over rail workers.
   Congress is considering legislation that would allow the FRA to
take action directly against a railroad employee instead of only
that person's employer as now is the case.
   Kennedy said the unions no longer oppose the FRA getting such
authority, but that in return a train engineer should be able to
refuse to take a train from a rail yard if he has safety concerns.

   Here is a list of some the worst mass murders in recent U.S.
history:
   JULY 18, 1984 _ Twenty-one people are fatally shot in a
McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif., by James Oliver
Huberty, an out-of-work security guard. Huberty himself is killed
by a police sharpshooter.
   DECEMBER 1987 _ Sixteen people, including 14 members of one
family, are killed. The mass slaying is discovered after R. Gene
Simmons Sr. is arrested Dec. 28 in the killings of two people in
Russellville, Ark. A search of his home near Dover uncovers the
remains of 14 family members, who authorities say were killed by
Simmons just before Christmas. He remains at a state hospital in
Little Rock, undergoing psychiatric evaluation.
   AUG. 1, 1966 _ Sixteen people are killed in Austin, Texas, by
Charles Whitman. Most are hit by sniper fire after he climbs to the
top of a campus tower at the University of Texas. Whitman is killed
by police.
   AUG. 20, 1986 _ Fourteen people are shot to death at a post
office in Edmond, Okla., by Pat Sherrill, 44, a postal worker who
authorities say was about to be fired. After police sharpshooters
arrive, Sherrill kills himself.
   FEB. 19, 1983 _ Thirteen people are fatally shot in the head
during a robbery at a gambling club in Seattle's Chinatown section.
Willie Mak and Benjamin Ng are later convicted of murder.
   SEPT. 5, 1949 _ Thirteen people are fatally shot in 12 minutes
in Camden, N.J. Howard Unruh, who told police, ``I'd have killed a
thousand if I'd had enough bullets,'' was found insane and
committed to a mental institution.
   SEPT. 25, 1982 _ Twelve people, including five children, are
killed in Wilkes-Barre and Jenkins Township, Pa. George Banks, 43,
is later convicted on 12 counts of murder and sentenced to death.
   MARCH 30, 1975 _ Eleven people, including eight children, are
killed at a family gathering in Hamilton, Ohio, on Easter Sunday. A
relative, James Ruppert, is convicted of two killings and found
innocent by reason of insanity in nine others.
   APRIL 15, 1984 _ Ten people, including eight children, are
killed in a Brooklyn, N.Y., apartment on Palm Sunday. Christopher
Thomas is convicted of first-degree manslaughter, the judge citing
``extreme emotional disturbance.''
   JULY 14, 1966 _ Eight student nurses are stabbed or strangled in
a Chicago dormitory. Richard Speck, 24, is convicted of murder.
   FEB. 15, 1988 _ Seven people are killed and five others are
wounded at ESL Corp., a Silicon Valley defense contractor. A former
employee, Richard Wade Farley, 39, of San Jose, Calif., is arrested
and held at the Santa Clara County Jail. Authorities said he was
fired for harassing a woman employee. The woman was among those
injured.
   SEPT. 25, 1987 _ Seven family members, four of them children,
are shot to death on two Elkland, Mo., farms. Accused killer John
Schnick, who police say tried to divert blame for the killings to
his 14-year-old nephew, one of the victims, has pleaded innocent to
seven charges of first degree murder but has not yet been tried.

<HEAD>ATV Agreement Deadline Is Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and manufacturers of
all-terrain vehicles are taking about three extra weeks to work out
details of an agreement settling a lawsuit over the safety of the
off-road machines.
   James Lacy, general counsel of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, said Wednesday that the court has been asked to extend
the effective date of the agreement to March 7.
   ``Everything is moving along fine, we just needed additional
time to work out technicalities,'' Lacy said.
   Announced Dec. 30, the agreement was originally scheduled to
take effect after 45 days, the middle of this month.
   The agreement was worked out by the Commission, the Justice
Department and the makers of ATVs, principally Honda, Yamaha,
Suzuki and Kawasaki.
   It calls for an end to sales of three-wheel ATVs, those most
often blamed for the accidents which have claimed more than 900
lives and 7,000 injuries in the last five years. Manufacturers are
switching to four-wheel versions of the machines.
   In addition the agreement would provide for free safety training
for riders, improved warning labels on machines and for the makers
to refrain from marketing to people aged 16 and under.
   Consumer groups have been critical of the settlement, contending
that the three-wheeled ATV's should have been recalled for safety
reasons.

<HEAD>Pakistani Tells Shultz Afghans Need Interim Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Pakistani official told Secretary of
State George P. Shultz his government attaches high priority to an
Afghan peace settlement that includes replacement of the existing
Soviet-backed regime in Kabul.
   In a meeting Wednesday with Shultz, Zain Noorani said peace and
stability can return to Afghanistan if a proposed Soviet troop
withdrawal is accompanied by the creation of an interim government
that includes ``all component parties'' in Afghanistan, including
rebel forces.
   The meeting took place against a background of Shultz's visit to
the Soviet Union early next week to discuss Moscow's plan for the
withdrawal, under certain conditions, of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan starting May 15.
   Noorani, minister of state for foreign affairs, said there are a
``lot of similarities'' in the Pakistani and American positions on
Afghanistan.
   But in their past statements, the two sides have indicated a
difference of priorities.
   The United States has emphasized the need for an early
withdrawal of Soviet forces. Pakistan has stressed the importance
of an arrangement that will include both a Soviet withdrawal and
the safe return of 3 million Pakistan-based Afghan refugees. This
stand was reiterated Wednesday by Noorani in his comments to
reporters.
   Pakistan's insistence on the creation of a transition government
in Kabul has drawn criticism from the Soviet Union, which has
accused Pakistan of obstructing an end to the war.
   Noorani said the United States is ``not averse to the idea'' of
establishing an interim government.
   His visit is part of a flurry of diplomatic activity since
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced his plan last week for
the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops.
   He said that Moscow is prepared to start the pullout May 15 if
Pakistan and Afghanistan agree to a United Nations-sponsored
agreement by March 15. The withdrawal would be phased over 10
months.
   Afghan and Pakistani authorities are scheduled to resume their
talks, through U.N. mediators, on March 2 in Geneva.
   ``I'm confident that given a few days one way or the other, it
would be possible to have an agreement and an interim government
both by the middle of March or the end of March,'' Noorani said.
   Pakistan is under heavy pressure to agree to Gorbachev's
proposal. A Pakistani rejection could leave it vulnerable to
charges that it blocked the most promising initiative for the
withdrawal of Soviet forces since they were sent to Afghanistan in
December 1979.
   But an Afghan guerrilla leader, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, said
Wednesday it would be a ``historic blunder'' for Pakistan to sign
an agreement to end the civil war if the present government in
Kabul is not replaced.

<HEAD>Military Malpractice Bill Awaits Senate Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House-passed bill that would allow
active-duty military personnel to sue the federal government for
medical or dental malpractice is heading for an uncertain fate in
the Senate.
   The measure, approved 312-61 by the House on Wednesday, is
opposed by the Reagan administration which says it would limit a
longstanding Supreme Court doctrine that the government is not
liable for service-related injuries.
   The House approved a virtually identical bill by a 317-90 vote
in 1985, but the Senate never acted on the measure.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the
bill would cost the government about $25 million a year if it
passes Congress. The government paid about $50 million in
malpractice settlements in fiscal 1986 to military dependents and
retirees.
   The latest bill, sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., was
passed by the House after voice votes approving a $300,000 ceiling
on government liability and rejecting a proposal to make the bill's
provisions retroactive to Jan. 1, 1986.
   The House bill would cover deaths or injuries resulting from
malpractice at permanent military hospitals, but would exclude
treatment at field hospitals or hospital ships and claims arising
from combat.
   The measure also would prohibit claims for mental or emotional
disabilities unless they resulted from a physical injury, and would
bar lawsuits for damage to a military person's status or duty
assignment as a result of negligent faulty diagnosis or malpractice.
   Although active-duty servicemen represent about one-third of
those treated at military hospitals, they are the only patients who
cannot sue the government for medical malpractice.
   The federal government generally is immune from being sued
unless it gives its consent. Under a 1946 law, the government can
be sued for acts of negligence by its employees while on official
duty, but the same law protects the government from legal claims
stemming from wartime combat operations.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1950 that the law bars active-duty
military personnel _ but not their dependents or military retirees
_ from suing the federal government for damages arising from
government action or inaction.

<HEAD>More Automobiles Adding Rear-Seat Shoulder Belts, DOT Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chevy Nova or Chrysler Colt hatchback need
not take a back seat to the Jaguar or Maserati when it comes to
protecting passengers in that part of the automobile, the
government says.
   The Transportation Department said Wednesday these cars are
among the rapidly increasing number of vehicles with rear-seat
shoulder harnesses as standard equipment beginning with the 1988
model year. Within two years virtually all cars will have the
improved safety belts, the department said.
   The Department, under criticism from some auto safety advocates
for not requiring shoulder harnesses for rear-seat passengers,
released a survey Wednesday of manufacturers showing their plans
for installing the equipment.
   The push to make shoulder belts available in the rear gained
widespread attention last year after the National Transportation
Safety Board suggested that in some accidents lap-only belts may
harm rear-seat occupants. Momentum was added by a series of
successful lawsuits.
   The department said a proposed regulation to require rear-seat
harnesses in all cars is still under review.
   Twenty-four of the 29 manufacturers listed reported that they
had the rear-seat shoulder belts in all or some of their cars this
model year. The exceptions were the Ferrari, Isuzu, Subaru, Suzuki
and Yugo automobiles. Isuzu provides them as an option on 1988
models.
   General Motors Corp. reported it has the rear-seat shoulder
belts as standard equipment on 12 car models this year ranging from
the compact Chevrolet Nova to three types of Cadillac models. It
will put them in all domestic cars next model year, according to GM
spokesman Bill Noack.
   The Ford Motor Co., which has the belts in its Lincoln
Continental, Merkur and Taurus@Sable cars this year, will have it
in nearly half its cars in the 1989 model year, said Ford spokesman
Winston Leavell.
   Chrysler Corp. plans to have the shoulder belts in all its cars
by the 1990 model year, but has them only in the Colt Vista, Colt
hatchback and Eagle Medallion this year.
   Toyota has the rear-seat harnesses in its Cressida and Camry
this year, but offers them as an option in other models. Nissan has
them only in its Maxima this year, but plans them in all models by
1990; Honda has them in all Honda and Acura cars; and Mazda has
them in the 323, 626, MX-6 and 929 models, according to the
department.
   The rear-seat harnesses also are available this model year in
the Volkwagen Golf, Jetta, Quantum, and four-door Fox; Mitsubishi
Galant and Sigma; and all models of the Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin,
Audi, BMW, Jaguar, four-seat Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot,
Porsche, Rolls-Royce, Sterling and Volvo.
   The GM cars that have the harnesses this year are the Buick
LeSabre and Riviera; Cadillac Eldorado, Brougham and Seville;
Chevrolet Beretta, Corsica and Nova; Oldsmobile Delta 88 and
Toronado; and the Pontaic LeMans and Bonneville, the department
said.

<HEAD>DEA Official Says Cocaine To Panamanian Police Was Properly Used</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration says 52
pounds of cocaine taken by police working for Panamanian strongman
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga was destroyed using proper police
procedures.
   David Westrate, assistant administrator for operations at DEA,
defended the arrangement under which the special Panamanian police
narcotics force took a portion of 752 pounds of cocaine flown from
Bolivia to the United States by way of Panama as part of an
undercover investigation.
   The relationship of DEA agents and Panamanian authorities is
under criticism in Congress after Noriega's indictment by grand
juries in Florida on charges of drug trafficking and racketeering.
   ``It's our understanding and belief that the cocaine left with
the Panamanians was appropriately disposed of,'' Westrate said
Wednesday in an interview. ``My understanding is that it
subsequently was destroyed in a regular destruction exercise they
had there.''
   After the Panamanians received the 52 pounds in April 1986, the
remainder was reloaded onto a DEA plane and flown to the United
States. It was used as evidence in a federal trial that year in
Roanoke, Va., where 10 people were convicted, including reputed
Bolivian cocaine dealer Gerardo Caballero.
   Caballero has since said that Noriega set him up as a favor to
Colombian cocaine lords who wanted him out of their way.
   The cocaine left in Panama was to have been used in a potential
prosecution in that country which didn't materialize, said Westrate.
   ``We do utilize a reverse undercover technique where agents are
sellers rather than purchasers,'' said Westrate. The 52 pounds of
cocaine ``was retained in Panama for that purpose.''
   Under such operations, drug enforcement agents offer drugs to
suspected dealers, then confiscate the dealers' cash after making
arrests.
   The DEA official said ``it's not unusual'' for countries
involved as transit points in the ``controlled movement'' of
narcotics to retain portions of the narcotics for use in
investigations.
   During the trial in Roanoke, DEA agent Thomas Telles testified
under questioning from defense attorney Jonathan M. Apgar that the
agency arranged for the cocaine to be flown from Bolivia to Panama.
   Telles disputed the notion that the cocaine was a payment for
the Panamanians' assistance in rounding up Caballero and another
man convicted in the Roanoke case, Luis Tang-Fortaleche.

<HEAD>Committee Clears Bill Requiring Businesses To Offer Medical Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pioneering health insurance bill requiring
most businesses to offer medical plans survived what its sponsor
called ``a long, tortuous journey'' to committee approval, with
more rough traveling in store.
   The ``minimum health'' bill, approved 10-6 Wednesday by the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, would require coverage
for up to 23 million of an estimated 38 million workers and
dependents now going without it.
   ``This has been a long, tortuous journey,'' committee chairman
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said at the start of the meeting.
   Kennedy said after the vote that he detected ``a very positive
attitude,'' but there were signs that the bill would continue on a
rocky path.
   It heads to the floor facing deep-seated opposition from the
business community, the Reagan administration and conservative
lawmakers. And some prospective supporters were withholding favor
until their specific problems with the bill could be resolved.
   Under the bill, employers would have to offer a minimum package
including hospital care, doctor care, diagnostic and screening
tests, pre-natal and well-baby care and limited mental health
treatment. The policies would cap out-of-pocket catastrophic costs
at $3,000.
   Coverage would have to be offered to employees working 17.5
hours a week or more, and their dependents.
   Citizen Action, a community group operating in two dozen states,
called the Kennedy measure ``desperately needed'' as more people
are forced to accept jobs without health benefits and other workers
find their benefits eroding.
   In an attempt to accommodate employers, the bill temporarily
exempts small family farms and permits new firms to phase in
coverage over two years. Businesses of five or fewer people would
have five years to phase in benefits. Special regional pools would
reduce costs to small businesses.
   But critics were not mollified.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce denounced the bill in a statement
as ``a cruel hoax'' destined to disappoint those it professes to
help.
   ``All the committee did was pay lip service to the problem
without putting forward a workable or affordable solution,'' said
James Klein, the group's manager of health care policy.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., a co-sponsor of the bill, said
insurance companies and small business groups helped draft it, and
he charged that they had acted in bad faith.
   ``When it was all over, they said `thanks a lot for letting us
be part of the process, and we're against it,''' Weicker said.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates new coverage under the
Kennedy bill would cost $27 billion, with $12 billion of that
offset by reductions in administrative costs, charity care and
other outlays. CBO also says about 100,000 jobs could be lost but
could be offset by growth in the health sector.
   The cost and scope of the bill, as well as the potential for
layoffs and job losses, were criticized by Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis Bowen and conservative lawmakers.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called it a $30 billion solution to an
$8 billion problem and likened it to ``using a sledge hammer to
crack an egg.''
   Bowen, in a letter Tuesday to Kennedy, said the bill would
``impose an unduly intrusive and centralist solution.'' He
recommended sharply focused state action instead.

   Congress plans this year to shorten by half a
budget process that in 1987 took an entire year to play out. But
while there's a better chance than usual for speedy action,
pitfalls remain.
   Congressional leaders pledged last year that deadlines would be
met. But the fiscal 1988 budget bills weren't finished until nearly
Christmas, three months into the fiscal year.
   This year, there's cause for optimism because of the deficit
reduction agreement reached last November between President Reagan
and congressional leaders.
   The agreement functions as a budget over the budget. Although it
lacks the legal force of legislation, both the White House and the
Democratic leaders in Congress say they'll obey its overall targets
for military, domestic programs, and foreign aid.
   ``I believe that the spirit of bipartisan cooperation between
the Congress and the administration will carry over from last
year's budget summit to this year's budget process,'' said Rep.
William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   Both the House and Senate budget committees have scheduled
hearings beginning today on Reagan's proposals, followed by
meetings next month to draft budget proposals of their own.
   Even though Reagan's budget was received nearly six weeks late _
due to last year's extended stalemate _ House and Senate leaders
say Congress should meet its April 15 deadline for adopting a
budget resolution.
   The resolution then serves as a guideline for fiscal
legislation, mostly in the form of appropriations bills.
   The process calls for 13 separate bills covering virtually all
government operations for the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But
in the past two years, none have been enacted separately. Instead,
the president has been sent humongous catchall spending packages.
He vowed in his State of the Union address never to sign another.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has announced that the House
will try to send all 13 bills to the Senate by the end of May. With
a promise of speedy consideration in the Senate, the speaker said
completion of the task before Congress' extended Labor Day recess
was the target.
   That would nearly meet the official deadline of July 30, at
least close enough for congressional work.
   The on-time scenario, however, depends on all sorts of things
going right _ not all under Congress' control.
   The deficit-reduction agreement is based on White House
estimates which could turn sour if the economy falters. Simply
obeying the agreement might not bring the fiscal 1989 deficit down
to the levels prescribed by the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   In August, the president's Office of Management and Budget is
required to assess whether legislation has been enacted to bring
the deficit down to within $10 billion of the $136 billion target
for fiscal 1989.
   If not, additional legislation would be required to bring things
into line _ or across-the-board spending cuts take effect. Neither
of those options would be very attractive in an election year, and
a renewed struggle could ensue.
   And while the pact between the White House and Congress sets
overall targets, cutting up the limited-size pies in both domestic
and military accounts could prove difficult. Even before the budget
arrived, House Democrats were attacking administration assertions
that more cost-cutting was needed in the Medicare program.
   ``It is much easier to agree to them in the abstract'' than to
agree on the details, says Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.

<HEAD>Stocks Continue Climb In Japan; Dollar Slides Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices rallied for the sixth consecutive
trading day following an overnight gain on Wall Street, while the
dollar slid against the Japanese yen in quiet trading today.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 84.29-point gainer on Wednesday, added another
245.41 points or 1 percent to close the day at 24,675.36.
   ``Stabilizing foreign exchange rates and New York's Dow Jones
Industrial Average, which topped the 2,000-point level, made
investors confident,'' said Yoshio Ogawa of Nikko Securities. Share
prices were higher almost across the board in heavy trading. Volume
totaled 750 million shares.
   ``The overall environment of the market is becoming favorable,''
Ogawa said, adding that influential big-name stocks, including
steels and shipbuildings, were gaining strength.
   Securities issues scored strong gains, while
distribution-related shares and construction stocks also rose.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
130.00 yen, unchanged from its opening but down 0.41 yen from
Wednesday's close of 130.41. It traded in a narrow range of 129.97
to 130.16 yen.
   Taeko Kobayashi of the Bank of Tokyo said no major news that he
was aware of affected dealing today. If U.S. trade figures for
January show improvement when they are released next month, the
dollar will stabilize at current levels for some time, she said.

<HEAD>Gephardt Seeking Pre-Super Tuesday Wins In South Dakota, Wyoming</HEAD>

   Democrat Richard Gephardt, temporarily
putting aside the Super Tuesday primaries of the South less than
three weeks away, says he is hoping to pick up a victory sooner in
the smaller-delegate states of South Dakota and Wyoming.
   After stressing opposition to higher taxes in New Hampshire for
the past week, Gephardt returned Wednesday to the familiar theme of
attacking what he said were unfair trade practices by Japan and
other countries as he campaigned in South Dakota and Wyoming.
   ``They take our technology and make a like product, and bring it
to the United States and put our workers out of work,'' Gephardt
said after touring an electronics assembly plant in Rapid City, S.D.
   ``This administration has been asleep at the switch on trade,''
Gephardt said.
   Gephardt flew on to Casper for an evening rally with Wyoming
supporters before flying back to South Dakota, which he will have
visited on six of the seven days leading up to next Tuesday's
primary in that state.
   While his chief rivals were fanning out across the South in
advance of the pivotal March 8 primaries throughout the region,
Gephardt was gambling that he could score a win in South Dakota
next week and on March 5 in Wyoming's caucuses that would send him
into Super Tuesday with the aura of a recent winner.
   ``I think I can do well here,'' said Gephardt, who won Iowa's
caucuses 10 days ago and finished a distant second in New Hampire's
lead-off primary. ``In order to do that, I have to get my message
across and see people.''
   Gephardt strategists said they decided not to compete in three
other states holding contests during the next three weeks - Vermont
and Maine, where Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis figures to be
strong, and Minnesota, where Dukakis and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon
are contesting.
   Gephardt has purchased $40,000 worth of television commercials
in South Dakota, a significant amount in the state of just 700,000
people. Gore and Dukakis are already on the air here.
   Moreover, a victory in South Dakota would be just for show. It's
primary is a ``beauty contest'' in which voters will state a
preference but no delegates will be awarded with the votes.
   Gephardt's strategists contend they can campaign in South Dakota
and Wyoming and still attract attention in the process in the
Southern states, where huge numbers of delegates are at stake.
   More than one-third of the Democratic nominating delegates are
up for grabs on that day, with primaries in 20 states including
every state of the South save South Carolina.
   Gephardt was joining the other Democratic candidates in Dallas
for their debate this evening, and also planned trips into Arkansas
and Oklahoma while returning to South Dakota nearly every day for a
week and to Wyoming three days.
   At the Rapid City plant of Anderson Scientific, which
manufactuers satellite receivers for home television viewing,
president Joe Massa told Gephardt the company had been forced to
lay off nearly its entire work force of 150 people and seen its
gross revenues decline from $4.5 million to less than $1 million in
three years.
   He accused Japanese competitors of stealing patented technology
and dumping their products at a loss to gain U.S. sales.
   With TV cameras rolling, Gephardt toured the factory to
underscore his call for tough trade sanctions against unfair
foreign competitors and he pointed to the company as an example of
imports coming into the United States while Asian markets are
largely closed to U.S. goods.
   Massa acknowledged, however, that the company's troubles were
also due in part to a decline in the home satellite TV business
because some major satellite broadcasters have scrambled their
signals to prevent home viewers from watching without paying.
   Founder Keith Anderson told Gephardt he supports the Missouri
congressman's trade sanctions legislation and said his company
might fail ``unless you pass your trade bill and we can have a 200
percent duty put on.''

<HEAD>Robertson Forces Said To Be On Move As Nevada Republicans Caucus</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Stands for item listed on digest as GOP Caucus</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Nevada Republicans scheduled caucuses
and a presidential straw poll this evening, with mainstream GOP
leaders wondering how many Pat Robertson supporters will turn out.
   The non-binding straw poll is first of its kind for the state's
Republicans and the first in the West this election year.
   Republican State Chairwoman Sally Vitkus-McKinney said she
wouldn't predict a winner in the Nevada polling, adding that
backers of George Bush, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp and Robertson all had
been working hard to get supporters of their candidates to the
caucuses.
   Ms. Vitkus-McKinney said she has heard reports that backers of
Robertson, a former television evangelist, would try to pack the
caucuses, expected to draw several thousand of about 123,000
Republicans registered to vote in Nevada.
   Organizing drives by Robertson backers have proven highly
successful in several states. Robertson finished a surprisingly
strong second in last week's Iowa caucuses, and his supporters in
Hawaii nearly doubled the ranks of registered Republicans in
advance of a straw poll in the state.
   Steve Wark, state coordinator for Robertson, denied his group
was involved in any caucus-packing, adding that his coordinating
efforts were no different than those of coordinators for other
candidates.
   ``We're probably the only campaign that isn't packing,'' added
Wark. ``The others are. That's their strategy.''
   National GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., a former Reno
lawyer, downplayed the significance of the Nevada presidential
straw polling, saying he didn't think it would indicate
presidential preferences of Republicans in the West.
   ``It focuses all the attention on who cranks out the most people
and who gets the most people to the caucuses, which really may not
be representative of the entire Republican Party of any particular
state,'' said Fahrenkopf.
   But Fahrenkopf also said the winner of the straw poll ``will be
trumpeting it.'' He said the top vote-getters can use the results
in their money-raising efforts and to generate more support for
their races in advance of the March 8 ``Super Tuesday'' primary
balloting around the nation.
   Ms. Vitkus-McKinney, who pushed for the straw poll, said the
polling has ``brought a lot of excitement to politics here in
Nevada'' and will bring out four or five times the number of people
who usually attend GOP caucuses.
   The straw poll was developed last summer, before former Nevada
Sen. Paul Laxalt announced in September that he wouldn't seek the
GOP presidential nomination. He would have been the probable Nevada
poll winner had he stayed in the running, Ms. Vitkus-McKinney said.
   She also said the straw poll results will reflect views of
Republicans in many states in the West, adding, ``We normally vote
for the person and we are a conservative state. The results will be
used by the winner for momentum going into Super Tuesday.''
   The chairwoman also said steps are being taken to guard against
any caucus participation by people who aren't properly registered.
She said anyone who votes illegally could be subject to later
prosecution.
   ``This is our first go at this, so we're trying to cover any
loopholes,'' she said. ``If they lie, it's a gross misdemeanor.''

   The nation's labor leaders are making
like a duck this year in presidential politics _ calm on the
surface and paddling furiously underneath to position themselves
appropriately with whomever emerges as the Democratic nominee.
   Delegate slates in the eight states whose filing deadlines have
expired show Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, Massachusetts Gov.
Micahel Dukakis and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri all sharing
close to an equal number of union political activists wanting to
get to the Democratic National Convention on their tickets.
   Jesse Jackson is a close fourth, outpacing Sen. Albert Gore in
all eight states, including Alablama and Georgia, which border on
Gore's home turf of Tennessee.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, winding up the AFL-CIO's annual
winter meeting today, said the 14.3-million-member labor federation
is no closer now to making a presidential endorsement than it was a
year ago when all of the Democratic candidates but Gore and Dukakis
were here appealing for union support.
   ``The essential criteria is the same, at least a two-thirds
consensus,'' he said. ``But I'm not going to force it, and I'm not
going to invent it.''
   William Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union, the AFL-CIO's third largest with 1 million members,
doubts there will be an endorsement.
   ``We can't change the fact that no individual has emerged as a
favorite,'' he said. ``Our Iowa locals got together and endorsed
Dukakis, but it wasn't a very strong endorsement. I would bet that
Jesse Jackson got a lot of UFCW votes in Iowa.''
   The AFL-CIO's early endorsement of Walter Mondale in 1984 helped
save his campaign after he lost the New Hampshire primary that year
to then Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado. But it also enabled Mondale's
opponents to tag labor as a ``special interest'' and created a
backlash among many union members.
   Exit polls showed only betwen 53 and 57 percent of voters from
union households pulling the lever for Mondale in the general
election _ far short of the two-thirds majority support that the
AFL-CIO claimed that its endorsement represented. Union leaders
here are intent on avoiding a repeat of that.
   ``We're damned if we do and damned if we don't,'' said Richard
Kilroy, president of the Transporation Communications Union and
head of a coalition of 15 rail unions.
   A top AFL-CIO political official also doubts that the federation
will make an endorsement before the Democratic Convention in
Atlanta in July.
   While the federation's policy this time of encouraging union
members to become convention delegates for any candidate of their
choice is bringing more rank-and-file workers into the process, it
also is yielding labor fewer delegates, he said.
   Individual union political chiefs speculate they will eventually
get a total of between 10 and 15 of Iowa's 52 convention seats
based on how well labor delegate candidates fared in last week's
Iowa caucuses. But one federation official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said not a single labor representative won
a seat in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
   ``Kirkland is playing it just right, both in '84 and '88,'' said
Frank Greer, a veteran political consultant who is not working for
any of the presidential candidates this year.
   ``The idea of Kirkland and George Meany (Kirkland's predecessor)
was to prevent somebody unacceptable from getting the nomination.
All of these guys are acceptable.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, the winner of the New
Hampshire Democratic primary, set the stage for a debate with his
rivals tonight by talking tough on military policy and promising a
hard line on terrorism.
   Dukakis traveled south Wednesday, touting positions aimed at
satisfying more conservative voters. And he tossed a few pointed
barbs at Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, who has staked his entire
campaign on doing well in the South.
   The governor was to spend part of today back at the
Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston, and travel to Dallas for a
faceoff with the other Democrats.
   Facing the inevitable question about whether he is too liberal,
Dukakis said at a news conference, ``I don't understand these
labels. I'm a guy who's supposed to be a liberal from the
Northeast. I've balanced nine budgets in a row ... I've cut taxes
five times in the last four years. We've cut crime.''
   In Atlanta, Dukakis said he wanted to strengthen the nation's
conventional forces and crack down on terrorism. He challenged his
Democratic rivals to out-do him on ``toughness.''
   ``I don't yield on toughness to Al Gore in any shape or
manner,'' Dukakis said.
   Later in Florida, Dukakis fired another shot across Gore's bow
when told that Gore had accused his opponents of being alienated
from the electorate.
   ``Mr. Gore left Iowa, virtually left New Hampshire,'' Dukakis
said. ``I don't know who's alienated.''
   The governor's message was not entirely hard-line. In the
Clearwater press conference he stated flatly, ``I'm not going to
cut social programs ... I, for one, am not going to balance the
budget on the backs of poor people.''
   He also said he would keep the defense budget at about its
current funding. To cut the federal deficit he said, as he has
throughout the campaign, that he would institute an aggressive tax
collection program.
   Florida is of critical importance to the Dukakis campaign.
Dukakis said it may offer his best opportunity to win one of the
southern states on Super Tuesday.
   Speaking to about 600 cheering supporters in this Gulf coast
community, Dukakis said, ``If, three weeks from now, with your
help, we can do well in Florida, we're going to be on our way to
the White House.''
   The idea that the South is politically different from the rest
of the nation is false, Dukakis said.
   ``There's a mythology about the South as if it's some kind of
foreign country. It's nonsense,'' he said.
   Campaign aides say Dukakis will focus his economic opportunity
message on states with the most electoral votes. And he will drive
home his points with the biggest campaign war chest of any of the
Democratic candidates.
   Former Kentucky Gov. Martha Lane Collins and former New Orleans
Mayor Dutch Morial endorsed Dukakis in his Atlanta appearance.
   Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington, Florida and Maryland
are states where Dukakis is expected to do well on March 8. Others,
like Alabama, Texas, Kentucky, South Carolina and Georgia, won't
come to the Dukakis fold as easily as New Hampshire, his aides
acknowledge.
   Boston-based political consultant Michael Goldman said Dukakis
campaign sources tell him the governor will spend between $3
million and $4 million in the South.

   A man who posed for two years as an envoy from

charges, police said.
   The man, Vicenzo Tremoto, 68, was recently arrested in Lima
after a routine check into the backgrounds of foreigners in Peru
found he was wanted in Italy on tax evasion and criminal conspiracy
charges, police Col. Esparza Urbina said. The check also discovered
that Tremoto's passport had been falsified.
   Tremoto had been posing as a commercial attache for Malta, but
Urbina said the government of that Mediterranean nation denied ever

   The would-be envoy, who also operated a Lima bingo parlor, will
probably be expelled from Peru, Urbina told The Associated Press.

<HEAD>Kohl To Voice Concerns About Short-Range Nuclear Arsenal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German concerns about plans to modernize
NATO's short-range nuclear arsenal were being conveyed to Secretary
of State George P. Shultz and congressional leaders today by
visiting Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The importance of the weapons with ranges below 315 miles has
loomed larger in recent months in planning by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for its defenses once intermediate-range
nuclear forces are eliminated under a treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Short-range missiles are of particular concern to the Bonn
government because Germany would be the battleground if they are
used.
   The West German government says the upgrading of short-range
missiles should be linked to an overall reduction in the number of
the weapons and to progress in efforts to reduce the Soviet
superiority in conventional weapons in central Europe.
   The West Germans say NATO first must develop an overall arms
strategy and iron out differences within the alliance before
embarking on missile modernization programs.
   ``(West Germany) sees no need for an isolated decision on
modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear weapon systems at
this point,'' Friedhelm Ost, chief government spokesman, said this
week.
   Kohl arrived Wednesday and planned to meet with President Reagan
on Friday.
   U.S. officials said before Kohl's arrival that West Germany had
gone along with the modernization decision when it was made in 1983
and reaffirmed that support two months ago, and that the Soviets
benefited from the new concerns.
   ``No alliance allows its forces to defend itself... with weapons
from yesteryear,'' said Rozanne Ridgway, assistant secretary of
state for European affairs.
   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``It is unfortunate ... the Soviets have managed somehow to jump
right into the middle of all this and to suggest that there is
somehow disarray in the alliance, a crisis in the alliance on the
question of modernization.''
   The chancellor also is expected to renew calls for quick Senate
ratification of the U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles _ those that have a range of 315 to
3,000 miles.
   The accord, which calls for reductions in the next three years,
was signed in Washington in December.
   West German officials said Kohl also is likely to press for a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons.
   In a related development, government spokesman Herbert
Schmuelling denied news reports that Kohl would travel to Moscow
this fall.

<HEAD>Meese Makes Seventh Appearance Before Iran-Contra Grand Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra
affair again heard testimony from Attorney General Edwin Meese III
after appearances in recent weeks from other members of Meese's
staff.
   Meese's appearance Wednesday before the grand jury was his
seventh. The panel is believed to be focusing on Meese's Nov.
22-23, 1986, investigation that uncovered the diversion of
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand jury
appearances, but the Justice Department says he is cooperating with
the investigation being conducted by independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh and is not a target.
   The grand jury recently heard testimony by Assistant Attorney
General William Bradford Reynolds, who found a memo revealing the
diversion in National Security Council files, and Assistant
Attorney General Charles J. Cooper, another member of the team.
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who was
present when President Reagan ordered Meese to conduct the
investigation and when the attorney general reported his findings,
has also testified recently.
   Meese's investigation was criticized by congressional committees
that held hearings last summer on the Iran-Contra affair. The
panels faulted Meese for not recruiting Justice Department lawyers
with more experience investigating criminal cases and for failing
to take notes during interviews with top administration officials
after he learned about the diversion.
   The congressional committees said Meese's failure to secure
National Security Council files allowed documents to be shredded by
then-national security adviser John M. Poindexter, NSC aide Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North and others.
   Poindexter resigned and North was fired after Meese announced
that arms-sale profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels.
   Poindexter and North are targets of the Walsh investigation.
Indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks.
   Meese also has testified six other times before a different
grand jury investigating his financial dealings with a former
officer of the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.

<HEAD>Screening For AIDS Common Among Health Insurers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance companies have reported that many
AIDS-related claims were based on physical conditions that existed
before the policies went into effect and therefore should be
restricted or denied, a survey says.
   The report released Wednesday by the Congressional Office of
Technology Assessment also determined that screening of health
insurance applicants to detect the AIDS virus is common among
insurance companies and health maintenance organizations.
   The OTA report said that while the number of AIDS cases reported
by various companies ranged up to 3,000, most insurers had
reimbursed no more than 10 AIDS-related cases.
   Twelve commercial insurers and three Blue Cross plans reported
that 10 percent or more of their AIDS-related cases were linked
with a ``pre-existing condition'' for AIDS.
   Two of the 12 commercial insurers reported that more than half
their AIDS-related claims were based on pre-existing conditions.
Almost half the commercial insurers surveyed _ 21 out of 44 _
reported no pre-existing AIDS-related cases among their AIDS claims.
   Forty-five of the 61 companies surveyed reported having AIDS
claims.
   A pre-existing condition is one that exists before an insurance
policy goes into effect and which would cause an ordinarily prudent
person to seek diagnosis, care or treatment.
   The issue is being thrashed out in the courts, the study said.
   ``At present, there are several court cases pending relating to
what comprises a pre-existing condition for AIDS and the alleged
refusal by insurer(s) to pay for AIDS-related claims based on a
policy's pre-existing condition provision,'' it said.
   OTA said its survey of commercial insurers, Blue Cross and Blue
Shield plans and HMOs found that most insurers ask AIDS-related
questions on applications and require health histories from an
applicant's physician.
   The report said 51, or 86 percent, of the 62 commercial insurers
who responded to the survey either screen or plan to screen
individual applicants for infection with the AIDS-causing HIV virus.
   Forty-one already do and another 10 plan to start the tests.
Eleven of 15 Blue Cross plans surveyed either screen or plan to
screen, as do eight of 16 responding HMOs.
   Thirty-one of the 62 commercial carriers said they routinely
test applicants for HIV antibodies, while one of the 15 Blue
Cross@Blue Shield plans did and two of the HMOs did.
   The survey found that there is a difference, however, in how
insurers judge someone to be at risk of AIDS as opposed to being at
risk of contracting other diseases. In addition to evaluating
medical criteria, 18 of the 62 commercial insurers said they
consider sexual orientation in determining risk of contracting
AIDS, as did four of the 16 HMOs surveyed.
   As of Jan. 25, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 51,916
Americans, of whom more than half, or 28,965, have died since 1979,
according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. No one is
known to have recovered from AIDS.

   Foreigners seeking to remain in the
Philippines for more than six months will be required to obtain
medical certificates showing they are free of the AIDS virus, the
immigration commissioner said.
   The new regulation, which takes effect April 18, will also apply
to the 40,000 U.S. troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents stationed here, Commissioner Miriam
Defensor-Santiago said on Wednesday.
   Foreigners who plan to remain less than six months need not
produce an AIDS-free certificate but must do so if they extend
their visas.
   Fewer than 100 carriers of the fatal disease have been
identified in the Philippines. Most are women who work in bars and
nightclubs located near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and the Subic
Bay naval base.
   Mrs. Defensor-Santiago said U.S. and Philippine authorities
would work out guidelines for implementation of the order for
American military personnel.
   Last year, health officials complained that U.S. authorities
were slow in responding to requests for information on AIDS
screening of U.S. troops.
   Health officials had asked for guarantees that troops found with
the virus would not be posted to the Philippines.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a
virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible
to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

   U.S. participation in an international

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday unanimously

50 percent by 1999.
   CFCs, used as refrigerants, aerosol can propellants and

   Two masked gunmen robbed 70-year-old Lady Anne
Oxford of her jewels in her bedroom while her husband cooked
pancakes in the kitchen.
   Julian, the Earl of Oxford and Asquith, had cooked his own
dinner on Shrove Tuesday _ Pancake Day for Britons _ and was
unaware of the robbery.
   ``He is fond of pancakes and had made himself some to eat
downstairs,'' Lady Oxford, who was uninjured, told London's Evening
Standard.
   The earl, 71, is a grandson of the late Sir Herbert Henry
Asquith, Liberal prime minister in 1908-16.
   The countess said she went to bed early with a stomach ache at
their southwest England manor house near Frome, Somerset. She said
the thieves must have seen her husband when they broke in through a
ground-floor window.
   ``I woke up to find two men at the bottom of my bed pointing two
guns at me,'' the countess told the newspaper. ``It wasn't very
nice.''
   The masked men threatened to shoot her if she didn't give up her
gems and warned they had tied up and gagged her husband and would
kill him if she moved.
   Neil Thompson, a police detective inspector, said he had no
immediate value for the stolen jewelry and ``very little to go on.''

<HEAD>Mecham Faces More Than 75 Possible Recall Opponents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Socialist and a saxophonist are among
the dozens of Arizonans _ 77 at last count _ lining up for the
chance to run against Gov. Evan Mecham in a May 17 recall election.
   Only two, Democrat Carolyn Warner and former U.S. House minority
leader John Rhodes, a Republican, are given any real chance by
political observers of unseating the impeached GOP governor.
   But some of the lesser-knowns still insist their candidacies are
worthwhile.
   Dave Colosimo of Phoenix, a former teacher and a saxophone
player in local bands, said he is working full-time on the race.
   ``If I didn't think I could win I wouldn't run,'' Colosimo said.
``If I can run a household with five children and a wife, then I
think I'd be pretty able to balance the books when I got into the
office.''
   However, Colosimo acknowledged his candidacy so far is a
``one-man show.'' He has never sought public office before but
said, ``I was president of my senior class _ that's a joke.''
   Meanwhile, the state Senate on Wednesday granted Mecham a
one-week delay of his impeachment trial originally set to begin
Monday, but defeated two motions for further delay offered by the
embattled governor's attorney, Murray Miller.
   The Senate rejected Miller's request that the trial be put off
until criminal charges accusing Mecham of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan are tried. The lawyer had contended that an
impeachment trial would prejudice the criminal trial jury.
   Arizona Chief Justice Frank Gordon, who will preside at the
impeachment trial, told the Senate a one-week delay would
ultimately save time by allowing some issues to be settled
beforehand.
   If Mecham is convicted in his impeachment trial, lawmakers could
vote to bar him from holding any future political office.
   At this point, Mecham will automatically be placed on the recall
ballot. All other would-be candidates in the winner-take-all vote
must file at least 3,336 valid petition signatures of registered
voters by March 18.
   The secretary of state's office said 77 people had picked up
packets to collect petition signatures by Wednesday. Wednesday was
the first day for candidates to file petition signatures, but none
did.
   Among the earliest to pick up packets were Mrs. Warner, the
former state schools superintendent who lost to Mecham in a
three-way race in November 1986, and Rhodes, who has said he will
announce Friday whether he will run.
   Other potential candidates range from Republican national
committeeman Jack Londen, who said he was considering running ``to
preserve the conservative alternative'' if Mecham is barred from
running, to Bernie Senter, a meatpacker who ran for mayor of
Phoenix last fall as the Socialist Workers' Party candidate.
   Senter conceded that he can't win but said he also wants to
provide voters with an alternative.
   ``I'm against everything that he (Mecham) stands for,'' Senter
said, citing the governor's cancellation of a state holiday
celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
   Mecham, who also has been criticized for making remarks that
have angered blacks, homosexuals, Jews, women and the Japanese, did
not return telephone calls seeking comment on the number of
potential candidates.
   Democratic Secretary of State Rose Mofford, who is acting
governor pending Mecham's impeachment trial, has no plans to run in
the recall election, said her spokeswoman, Athia Hardt. If she
does, state law will probably force her to resign.
   Further complicating matters, Attorney General Bob Corbin has
issued an opinion saying that if Mecham is removed from office
before the recall vote, Mrs. Mofford, as the new governor, would
have to face the recall herself.
   ``It's all messed up, it really is,'' Ms. Hardt said.
   The Senate is considering a bill that would cancel the recall
election if Mecham resigns or is removed before the ballot is
printed.

<HEAD>Inmates Take Over 12 Dormitories at Rikers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 550 inmates used beds and other
furniture to barricade themselves inside a dozen jail dormitories
on Rikers Island early Thursday in an apparent protest over
searches, authorities said.
   Early reports indicated that no hostages were taken and no
injuries were reported, said city correction department spokeswoman
Ruby Ryles.
   The inmates took over the dormitories at the Anna M. Cross
Center, the city's maximum-security jail, around midnight
Wednesday, Ms. Ryles said. The center houses mainly convicted
felons awaiting transfers to state jails, as well as some prisoners
awaiting trial.
   The inmates ``barricaded doors and entrances and exits so they
are not allowing'' correction officers in, she said.
   Negotiators with the mutual assistance team, ``a team of
officers trained to handle disturbances of this sort,'' made
contact with the prisoners around 2 a.m., and extra guards were
deployed at the facility, Ms. Ryles said.
   ``The security staff is apparently talking with the inmates in
an attempt to resolve the disturbance peacefully,'' she said.
``They are also trying to determine what their complaints and their
problems are.''
   Although it was not immediately known what sparked the uprising,
inmates had strongly protested searches conducted by guards
Wednesday, Ms. Ryles said.
   Inmates at the center, which houses 2,400 inmates in all, are
kept in dormitories _ large rooms filled with beds _ rather than
cells, she said. A head count was conducted.
   The city's prison system is currently at slightly more than 100
percent of capacity with more than 15,000 prisoners _ more than
11,000 at Rikers, Ms. Ryles said.
   The inmates had been calling news organizations to say that they
had taken over the entire facility, Ms. Ryles said, but the claim
was not true.

<HEAD>Thor Heyerdahl Returns Stone Figure To Easter Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Explorer Thor Heyerdahl has returned to
Easter Island an ancient carved stone torso he took away to his
native Norway 30 years ago, a local press report said.
   Heyerdahl and the 530-pound object arrived by plane this week at
the tiny island, a territory of Chile 2,230 miles west of the
mainland, according Wednesday's editions of the Santiago daily El
Mercurio.
   Heyerdahl, 74, was greeted by the island's Council of Elders
who, wearing body paint and tribal clothing, unloaded the
5-foot-tall carving and blessed it at the airport. The somber
ceremony quickly gave way to ``a happy street party,'' the
newspaper said.
   The explorer and anthropologist sailed in replicas of primitive
crafts across the Pacific (1947), the Atlantic (1970) and the
Persian Gulf (1977) to seek evidence that ancient cultures could
have been diffused by transoceanic travelers. He described these
voyages in books called ``Kon Tiki,'' ``The Ra Expeditions'' and
``The Tigris Expedition.''
   Easter Island is home to nearly 400 massive, brooding stone
figures carved several hundred years ago and called moais.
   The moai returned by Heyerdahl is unique, in that it represents
the body of a woman. All others were made to resemble men.
   Heyerdahl discovered the torso in 1958, bought it for an
unspecified price and carried it off for display in his Kon Tiki
museum in Oslo, Norway, the report said. It said he decided to
return it when the moai's head was found about a year ago in the
crater of an extinct volcano, Rano Kau.
   The head and torso will be reunited and put on display at the
island's own museum, El Mercurio said.

<HEAD>Convicted Red Brigades Member Applies For Greek Residency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted Italian terrorist who was
released from prison when Greece refused to extradite him to Italy
has applied for residency in Greece, his lawyer said.
   Maurizio Folini, 34, a member of the Red Brigades organization,
was freed Tuesday after Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas
overturned a Supreme Court extradition decision.
   ``We went and applied for permission and I am sure it will be
granted. After he gets a residence permit we will ask for political
asylum,'' Folini's lawyer, Nikos Constantopoulos, told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
   Koutsogiorgas said Folini was released because ``many of his
punishable offenses have either been written off or are not
punishable under Greek law.''
   ``Others refer to the fact that Folini tried to violently
overthrow the economic and social institutions of the Italian
state. That is to say offenses that were clearly political,''
Koutsogiorgas said.
   Folini was convicted in absentia by an Italian court in 1986 on
terrorism charges. He was arrested in Athens on June 22, 1987,
after entering Greece on a false passport. Italian authorities
immediately asked for his extradition.
   Last September, the Greek Supreme Court upheld a lower court
decision ruling that Folini should be extradited. But he had
remained in jail in Athens pending Justice Ministry confirmation of
the decision.

   In a bid to reduce vandalism, the city

   For one year beginning next month, the city will give $120
rewards to people who help police catch vandals, according to
Finnish newspapers and English-language ``wanted'' posters seen in
downtown Helsinki this week.
   ``We chose English for the posters because `wanted' is such a
well-known word,'' city spokesman Pertti Mustonen told The

Swedish.
   Mustonen said the defacement or destruction of telephone booths,

<TEXT>
   J.C. ``Pete'' Sebastian, who served the
likes of Winston Churchill and Cary Grant at his store outside the
gates of Hearst's Castle in the 1930s and 1940s, has died at the
age of 81.
   Sebastian died Wednesday at Twin Cities Hospital of a heart
attack, said his daughter, Mary Sebastian Hansen of Boca Raton, Fla.
   In addition to running the store bearing his name, he served the
tiny, rolling hills community of San Simeon as its postmaster,
notary public and registrar of voters.
   The general store, which included gas pumps, a coffee shop and
post office, is registered as a state historical monument, Ms.
Hansen said.
   Sebastian worked as a landscaper around San Francisco publisher
William Randolph Hearst's art-bedecked mansion in the 1920s. Now a
museum run by the state Department of Parks and Recreation, the
sprawling home is one of the most popular tourist attractions in
California.
   Hearst, founder of the newspaper chain that carries his name and
model for Orson Welles' classic movie ``Citizen Kane,'' often
entertained celebrities and business and government notables at the
hilltop mansion.
   Churchill, Grant and playwright George Bernard Shaw were among
the many prominent visitors to the store Sebastian took over from
his father in 1933. He sold the shop in 1971 and retired, said Bob
Buddell, the store's present owner.
   Sebastian told an interviewer in 1986 that he always considered
the Hearsts neighbors, dating back to the pre-castle days when they
stayed in the Hotel Bayview next to his family's store.

   Academy Award winners will be
announced next month, but Hollywood's orgy of self-congratulation
has already started with several top organizations naming their
favorites, while one group cited the worst of 1987.
   The Los Angeles Film Critics, New York Film Critics, National
Board of Review and Golden Globe Awards generally agreed with the
nominations announced Wednesday by the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences, while the National Society Of Film Critics was
on its own wavelength.
   Only the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation, which announced its
nominees this week, concentrated on the worst. It will disclose its
losers on April 19.
   The Los Angeles and New York Film Critics, National Board of
Review and Golden Globes all followed the pattern of choosing a
movie and its director for the two top categories.
   The National Board of Review picked one movie and another
director. All five groups chose a different movie for best picture.
   New York and Los Angeles critics liked Holly Hunter of
``Broadcast News'' for best actress; Jack Nicholson of ``Ironweed''
also won on both coasts.

   National Society Of Film Critics: Best picture, ``The Dead;''
best director, John Boorman, ``Hope and Glory;'' best actress,
Emily Lloyd, ``Wish You Were Here;'' best actor, Steve Martin,
``Roxanne.''
   National Board of Review: best picture, ``Empire of the Sun;''
best director, Steven Spielberg, ``Empire of the Sun,'' best
actress, Lillian Gish, ``The Whales of August;'' best actor,

Bertolucci, ``The Last Emperor;'' best actress (drama) Glenn Close,
``Fatal Attraction,'' (comedy-musical) Cher, ``Moonstruck;'' best
actor (drama) Michael Douglas, ``Wall Street,'' (comedy-musical)

   Gov. Evan Mecham won a one-week delay in his
impeachment trial, but the Senate rejected his effort to have it
postponed until after he faces criminal charges of concealing a
campaign loan.
   The governor's attorney, Murray Miller, would not say after the
votes Wednesday whether he would follow through on an earlier
threat to take the issue to court if the Senate did not grant a
delay.
   ``We will do whatever we think is appropriate to protect all the
governor's rights,'' Miller said.
   Miller's motion to delay the trial until 20 days after the
resolution of the criminal case lost on a voice vote, and a motion
to delay the Senate proceeding a flat 90 days went down 24-5, with
five Republicans supporting the governor.
   Mecham was impeached Feb. 5 for allegedly concealing a $350,000
campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund
by loaning it to his auto dealership and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official.
   In addition, at least 77 people are considering challenging
Mecham in a recall election May 17, including a former congressman
and a former state school superintendent beaten by the Republican
in a three-way race in 1986.
   The Senate agreed to delay the start of its trial from Monday to
Feb. 29 after state Chief Justice Frank Gordon advised that a
one-week postponement would actually save time because both sides
could settle some issues beforehand. Gordon is the presiding
officer in the impeachment trial.
   Miller has contended that holding the impeachment trial before
the end of the criminal trial, which is scheduled to begin March 9,
would prejudice the criminal trial jury and harm the governor's
right to a fair decision.
   But Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, a Republican, warned,
``There is an ongoing fear ... that this will be the beginning of
lots of motions for continuations'' by Miller.
   Senators also refused to drop or revise a rule adopted last week
that allows the Senate to hold closed meetings during the
impeachment trial.
   Lawmakers said last week the meetings could be held to consult
with lawyers, discuss what questions could be asked or which
witnesses to call and make final deliberations on whether to
convict Mecham.
   The idea of closed meetings was sharply criticized by the media,
and 11 senators boycotted a brief closed meeting held during
Tuesday's session. Sen. Greg Lunn, a Republican, said that keeping
the closed meetings could be ``feeding the worst suspicions of
those in the public who are distrustful of our motives.''

   Cease-fire talks between the Nicaraguan
government and the Contra rebels will not succeed until the
Sandinistas make more democratic reforms at home, a Contra delegate
to the negotiations said.
   Fernando Aguero and six other Contra delegates arrived in
Guatemala City for talks today aimed at achieving a cease-fire in
the six-year war between the rebels and Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   In another development,the foreign ministers of five Central
American countries met Wednesday in San Salvador, capital of El
Salvador, to discuss a way to verify compliance with a regional
peace plan.
   The ministers _ from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa
Rica and Honduras _ did not come up with a verification plan but
agreed to meet again by March 15 in Guatemala City.
   Regarding the truce negotiations, the Contra delegates said in
Guatemala City on Wednesday they still want to expand the talks to
include representatives of the internal Nicaraguan opposition and
to cover political issues.
   ``Our position has not changed, and it will not change,'' Aguero
said. ``There can be no cease-fire unless the Sandinistas first
agree to democratic reforms in Nicaragua.''
   Nicaragua's government has insisted on limiting the discussions
with the U.S.-supported Contras to the mechanics of working out a
30-day truce that could lead to a permanent cease-fire.
   The Sandinistas say they will talk about political changes in
Nicaragua only after the Contras have accepted an amnesty, laid
down their arms and resumed civilian life within the country.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, the Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister, is
heading the Sandinista delegation to the peace talks, scheduled to
end Saturday.
   Jaime Morales Carazo, a former Managua banker, leads the Contra
group. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of
Nicaragua, is mediator.
   The first direct talks between the warring sides were last month
in San Jose, Costa Rica, a week before the U.S. House of
Representatives voted down President Reagan's request for $36.2
million in Contra aid.
   Negotiators for the rebels and the Sandinistas offered sharply
contrasting proposals at the two-day session in January, which was
noted both for its cordiality and lack of progress. Diplomatic
observers suggested neither side wanted to rock the boat before the
congressional vote.
   At that session, the Sandinistas offered a slightly revised
version of a negotiating position first outlined by President
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua on a visit to Washington last Nov. 13.
It called for a truce from March 15 to April 15.
   The Sandinistas said at the time that the army would halt
offensive operations on March 1 to give the Contras time to move
into three cease-fire zones in the northern, central and southern
parts of Nicaragua.
   Once inside the zones, the Contras would be permitted to retain
their weapons and receive food, medicine, clothing and other
humanitarian supplies from the International Red Cross or any other
recognized international relief agency.
   At the end of the truce period, the Contras would be expected to
hand over their arms to an international commission, accept amnesty
and return to civilian life with full constitutional guarantees.
   The Contras have asked the government to agree to 17 changes in
Nicaragua's constitution, including a prohibition on presidential
succession, electoral reforms, limits on presidential power, and
separation of the army from the governing Sandinista party.
   The talks are being held in accordance with a Central American
peace plan signed last August by the five countries whose foreign
ministers met in San Salvador.
   At the meeting, Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto of Costa
Rica told reporters the officials must discuss certain issues in
more detail and at greater length.
   In a joint statement, the ministers said they would seek help in
verifying compliance with the regional peace plan from other
countries and organizations ``of recognized impartiality and
technical capability that have shown their desire to cooperate with
the Central American peace process.''
   The foreign ministers form the peace plan's verification panel.
The presidents of the Central American countries decided last month
to dissolve an earlier, more extensive commission in favor of the
panel of foreign ministers.
   The peace plan calls for cease-fire talks between the
governments and rebels in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua as a
first step toward democratic elections. It also urges political
amnesties and a ban on all outside military assistance to rebel
groups.

   The main opposition party urged
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to dismantle some nuclear missiles before
the new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty is ratified, as the Kremlin has
done.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN reported that Soviet
SS-12 missiles in Waren, an East German site northwest of Berlin,
were dismantled, put in crates and were ready for transport back to
the Soviet Union.
   The SS-12s are part of the U.S.-Soviet agreement last December
to eliminate medium-range and shorter-range missiles within three
years. The treaty applies to nuclear missiles with a range of 300
to 3,000 miles.
   Hermann Scheer, disarmament expert for West Germany's opposition
Social Democrats, told reporters that Kohl's government should
respond to the Soviet move with the early scrapping of West
Germany's 72 Pershing 1A missiles.
   ``Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust in
disarmament which the leadership in East Berlin has been working
toward with the Soviets,'' Scheer said, speaking on behalf of the
party.
   East German newspapers praised Soviet plans for early removal of
the SS-12 missiles from Waren.
   ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR (East
Germany). Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlier
than expected,'' the Communist party's official newspaper, New
Germany, said in banner headlines Wednesday.
   ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when
they would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Soviet
soldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12
rockets.''
   ``With this step we can make an important contribution toward
disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and
the Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN said.
   The East Berlin-based newspaper Berliner Zeitung said Wednesday:
``Removal of missile troops from the DDR (East Germany) starts
earlier than expected.''
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the superpower treaty in Washington last December. Kohl had
announced beforehand that West Germany would scrap its Pershing 1A
missiles if a treaty was agreed upon.
   West Germany owns the Pershing 1A missiles, but the United
States controls the nuclear warheads for the rockets.
   Three U.S. Senate committees are debating the treaty and
ratification may come this summer. The Supreme Soviet, the Soviet
Union's parliament, is expected to approve the accord.
   East German leader Erich Honecker said in January that Soviet
intermediate-range rockets based in his country could be removed
ahead of schedule, but at the time he gave no specific timetable.
   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22
rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice
missiles were stationed at the Waren site, which holds the largest
numbers of SS-12s in East Germany. There are three other SS-12
rocket sites in the country.
   The city of Waren is 90 miles northwest of Berlin.

   Two former executives of the Beech-Nut
Nutritional Corp. face substantial prison terms and fines after
being convicted of selling flavored sugar water labeled as apple
juice for babies.
   Former Beech-Nut president Neils L. Hoyvald and a former vice
president, John F. Lavery, were charged with hundreds of violations
of federal food and drug laws along with conspiracy and mail fraud.
   Lavery was convicted Wednesday of all 448 counts in the
indictment, said federal prosecutor Thomas Roche.
   Hoyvald was found guilty on 351 counts of violating federal food
and drug laws; the jury, however, could not reach a verdict on
about 80 other counts against him, including conspiracy and mail
fraud, Roche said.
   The maximum penalty for conspiracy is five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine; for mail fraud, five years and $1,000; and for food
and drug law violations, three years and $10,000, Roche said.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas C. Platt did not set a date for
sentencing, but it should be within six to eight weeks, Roche said.
   Roche said both Hoyvald and Lavery, who were allowed to remain
free on bail until sentencing, face ``substantial prison terms and
substantial fines.'' It is likely, however, that they would serve
concurrent sentences.
   Lawyers for both men declined to comment on the verdict but said
they would appeal the convictions.
   Roche called the result of the three-month trial ``an important
victory for consumers.
   The corporation, which also was named in the November 1986
indictments, pleaded guilty last year, a fact the judge withheld
from the jury.
   Beech-Nut, a subsidiary of Nestle Inc. and based in Fort
Washington, Pa., agreed to pay a $2 million fine, and also settled
a class-action suit by agreeing to set up a $5 million cash fund
for consumers and to provide $2.5 million in Beech-Nut and
affiliated products to retailers.
   The indictment charged that Beech-Nut shipped adulterated juice
throughout the United States and overseas from 1978 to 1983. No
evidence was presented that the juice caused any health problems.
   Hoyvald's attorney, Brendan Sullivan Jr., urged the jury not to
believe the testimony of two key prosecution witnesses who work for
Beech-Nut that they had repeatedly warned executives that the
concentrate used to make the produce contained little or no apple
juice.
   Steven Kimelman, Lavery's attorney, said his client was ``a man
who had nothing to gain by committing a crime.'' Lavery was in
charge of manufacturing at the Canajoharie plant in western New
York, where the product was bottled.

   Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms extended from
southwest Texas into northwest Louisiana late Wednesday night. Rain
was falling elsewhere from eastern sections of Texas and Oklahoma
across the lower Mississippi Valley.
   Some parts of northeast Texas received over 2 inches of rain
Wednesday. Six-tenths of an inch fell in 20 minutes at Waco.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 a.m. EST
included three-quarters of an inch at Waco, two-thirds of an inch
at Dallas Naval Air Station, and a half-inch at Longview, Texas,

   Snow was mixed with rain over southeast New Mexico, and a snow
advisory was posted for parts of the state for up to 4 inches.
   Dry weather prevailed over the rest of the country. Only
scattered light snow showers extended across the northern Rockies
and northeast Nevada. An inch of new snow fell at Mullan, Idaho,
Wednesday evening.
   A dense fog advisory was issued until midmorning over the middle
Texas coastal region.
   Late night temperatures were near or above normal across most of
the nation. The coldest temperatures occurred across the central
Rockies and the upper Great Lakes region, where readings in the
teens were common.
   Today's forecast called for light snow across northwestern
sections of Texas and Oklahoma, with rain elsewhere from the
southern Plains across the lower half of the Mississippi Valley to
northwest Florida, Georgia and the western Carolinas; showers and
thunderstorms from south Texas across the central Gulf Coast
region; and snow showers in the northern and central Rockies.
   Much of the nation will have highs in the 40s or 50s. Highs will
be in the upper 20s and 30s in the northern and central Rockies,
and from northeast Montana across the Great Lakes region into
northern New England; and in the 60s and 70s in California and
southern Arizona, southern Texas and much of South Carolina,
Georgia and Florida, hitting the low 80s in south Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 2 below
zero at Craig, Colo., to 70 at Brownsville, Texas.

<HEAD>U.S. Receives Two Boxes Of MIAs Remains From Laos</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Laos has given U.S. officials two boxes
of remains it believes to be those of American servicemen missing
during the Indochina war, an American official in Bangkok said
today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
number of remains would not be known until they are analyzed by the
U.S. Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu. The
remains are to be flown from Bangkok to Honolulu Friday, he said.
   The official said the Laotians on Wednesday also turned over
identification cards of three men on the official U.S. list of 555
Americans missing in action, or MIA, in Laos.
   Ross Petzing, the spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
it was the first time since August 1978 that Laos unilaterally had
made MIA remains available to the Americans. A number of remains
were retrieved when the two sides jointly excavated warplane crash
sites in 1985 and 1986, however.
   A statement from the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane, the capital of
Laos, said the mission's charge d'affaires, Harriet Isom, and
military officials received the remains at a ceremony in Vientiane
airport.
   The Laotians also handed over pieces of aircraft wreckage they
excavated in December and January, said the statement, which was
dated Wednesday.
   The official Laotian radio on Wednesday said the remains were
retrieved during excavations in Savannakhet and Saravane provinces.
Both are in Laos' southern panhandle area, between Thailand and
Vietnam.
   ``The Lao side's positive response to the U.S. humanitarian
question shows the sincerity of the ... government in improving
relations with the United States,'' Laotian radio said. A text of
the broadcast was obtained today from a Western embassy in Bangkok.
   Laos' communist government agreed last August to resume efforts
to account for MIAs after apparently having suspended them since a
crash-site excavation in February 1986. In return, the United
States has pledged to respond to Laos' calls for humanitarian
assistance.
   Many of the MIAs in Laos were airmen shot down on missions
against the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which North Vietnamese communist
forces used to ferry men and supplies to South Vietnam.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan asked Congress today to
scratch dozens of programs from the military wish list and for the
first time in his presidency to make significant cuts in the size
of American forces.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in a lengthy annual report
to Congress accompanying the president's fiscal 1989 budget
proposal, said the administration was living up to the bargain it
made with Congress last November setting new military spending
limits.
   Carlucci said the Pentagon believes the limits will force it
``to accept greater risks than we think wise.''
   ``We have done our best to apportion reductions in ways that
minimize those risks. We will reduce the size of our forces, but
the units we do field will have what they need to perform the tasks
entrusted to them.''
   Carlucci said the combined active-duty forces of the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marine Corps will be reduced gradually this year to
2,138,000 and then held at that level throughout fiscal 1989 _
which begins on Oct. 1.
   That will represent a cut of about 34,000 active-duty positions
compared to the 2,172,000 that Congress authorized for this year,
and a cut of 46,000 compared to the fiscal 1989 force the Pentagon
had planned.
   ``Reductions will be accommodated through attrition and reduced
accessions (recruiting),'' Carlucci said.
   The Air Force will diminish by roughly 23,000 to about 576,000.
The Army will lose about 8,600 soldiers, dropping to about 772,000,
while the Marine Corps will lose about 2,900 to about 197,000. The
Navy will hold steady at about 593,000.
   In addition, the defense secretary said more than 10,000
civilian jobs would be cut in fiscal 1989 _ leaving a total of
1,102,000 worldwide _ but reserve strength would hold steady at
1.17 million.
   The administration's priorities are unchanged, Carlucci
continued.
   The Pentagon wants $4.55 billion for the Star Wars missile
defense system compared to $3.55 billion this year; wants to
continue work on a rail-mobile version of the MX missile; is
requesting $1.4 billion for another Trident nuclear submarine, and
wants servicemen to receive a 4.3 percent pay raise instead of the
2 percent planned for civilian government workers.
   On the other hand, Carlucci said the Army will deactivate a
motorized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis, Wash., and cancel the
scheduled activation of two light infantry battalions in Alaska;
the Navy will forego plans to stand up a 14th air wing at the
Miramar, Calif., Naval Air Station and retire ships it wanted to
keep, and the Air Force will deactivate two fighter wings.
   The fiscal 1989 budget totals for the Pentagon have been known
for three months _ ever since the White House and Congress reached
agreement on a two-year, deficit-reduction package.
   Under that compromise, $299.5 billion will be authorized for
military programs in fiscal 1989 and $294 billion actually spent in
outlays. The difference represents authorized funding for long-term
projects and weapons buying in future years.
   The fiscal 1989 total is an increase over the $291.4 billion in
budget authority approved for this year but is unlikely to
compensate for inflation. Carlucci complained that fiscal 1989 will
be the fourth consecutive year of ``negative real growth'' in
military spending.
   The Pentagon had asked for authority to spend $332.4 billion in
fiscal 1989 before the deficit compromise was adopted _ meaning
dozens of military programs had to be revised.
   According to Carlucci, the result was that:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Army will retire 450 aging utility helicopters and 170
scout copters; cancel the Aquila surveillance drone program and
stop production of Copperhead laser-guided artillery shells; cancel
development of the Anti-Tactical Missile, and develop only one new
light helicopter instead of two.
   _The Navy will give up its goal of reaching a 600-ship fleet in
fiscal 1989, settling for 580. It will retire 16 frigates early;
deactivate one Poseidon missile submarine that had been scheduled
for overhaul; kill its new blimp program, and cancel development of
a new model of the Intruder attack jet, the A-6F.
   _The Air Force will deactivate the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old boy doused himself with
rubbing alcohol and set himself on fire imitating a scene he had
seen in a rock music video, authorities said.
   Bryan Tucker was in fair condition today at Memorial Hospital
with second-degree burns on his legs, abdomen and chest.
   The boy, a fan of heavy-metal music who takes electric guitar
lessons and wears an earring in the shape of a cross, said he was
inspired by a member of the band Motley Crue performing in a
television video.
   ``He just lit his legs on fire, and nothing happened to him,''
the sixth-grader said.
   Fire Inspector Tom Wolf said the boy poured isopropyl alcohol
over his body and set it afire with a match.
   ``He dropped to the ground and rolled around,'' Wolf said, but
the fire would not go out.
   The youth ran to the bathroom and got in the tub, which was
filled with water from a bath he had taken earlier.
   ``Fortunately, the tub was not emptied,'' Wolf said.
   Bryan's mother was away at buying medicine for the boy and his
14-year-old sister, who had both stayed home from school with the
flu, Wolf said.
   The video the boy had seen was of the group performing the song
``Live Wire'' from the video ``Motley Crue Uncensored,'' Wolf said.

<HEAD>Shock Wave Machine Safe and Effective for Gallstones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful blast of shock waves can smash
gallstones inside the body and may someday replace surgery for more
than 100,000 Americans each year, experts say.
   The procedure, called lithotripsy, has already become the
standard treatment for kidney stones. Research published today
suggests it will also be useful for many people with gallstones,
which are four times more common.
   Doctors in West Germany showed that the procedure is ``a safe
and effective treatment in selected patients'' with gallstones.
Their work is the first large-scale examination of the therapy for
people with this problem.
   More than 150 hospitals in the United States already have shock
wave machines for smashing kidney stones. Since its approval in
1984, this therapy has become routine for many of the 120,000
Americans who once required kidney stone surgery each year. An
estimated 475,000 Americans undergo gallstone surgery annually.
   ``Most of us think that at least 20 percent and maybe even a
third to half of the (gallstone) patients in the United States
within three to five years could be treated by this means,'' said
Dr. Randolph B. Reinhold. ``A significant number of people who are
treated with surgery could be treated without surgery.''
   Reinhold, a researcher at New England Medical Center in Boston,
is among U.S. experts who plan to begin testing the shock wave
machines, called lithotriptors, next spring.
   Lithotriptors use shock waves to smash stones still inside the
body. Instead of requiring major surgery and about six weeks of
recuperation, patients are sent home within a day or two and often
don't require general anesthesia.
   The German study was conducted by Dr. Michael Sackmann and
colleagues at the University of Munich. A report on their first 175
patients was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   ``It's the only really good study that's been done in the world,
and it's very optimistic data by a very good group,'' said Reinhold.
   As currently set up, kidney stone lithotriptors cannot be used
to treat gallstones. Kidney stones are made largely of calcium, and
the machines are equipped with X-rays to produce images of them.
But most gallstones are made of cholesterol, which doesn't show up
on X-rays. So gallstone lithotriptors use ultrasound to make their
pictures.
   Lithotriptors designed to smash gallstones are being installed
in 10 U.S. hospitals for experimental use.
   In the German study, only about a quarter of all gallstone
patients were allowed to try the treatment. Many were excluded
because they had more than three stones or especially large ones.
   The treatment pulverized their gallstones, leaving only a trace
of fine sand or sludge. The patients took bile acid drugs for three
months to dissolve the debris. Within a year or so, this residue
was gone completely in more than 90 percent of the patients.
   The therapy failed to break up a stone in just one case. That
patient was the only one of the 175 who required surgery.
   Lithotriptors like that used in West Germany cost $1.2 million
or more.
   Gallbladder surgery typically costs between $6,000 and $7,000.
Reinhold said that initially, patients treated with lithotripsy
will be kept in the hospital for two days, and their treatment will
cost $4,000 to $5,000. However, this price will probably go down as
doctors gain experience and begin sending patients home a few hours
after the procedure.

   The U.S. dollar was mostly lower, but firming, in
early European trading today. Gold prices rose slightly.
   A foreign currency dealer at a large American bank in Frankfurt
said there is active interest in buying from East bloc banks, among
others.
   Traders predicted activity would ease later today amid a
continued lack of market-moving news.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar slid against the Japanese yen, closing at 130.00 yen,
down 0.41 yen. In later London trading it was quoted at 130.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7040 West German marks, down from 1.7065
   _1.4033 Swiss francs, up from 1.4030
   _5.7587 French francs, down from 5.7635

   _1,255.75 Italian lire, down from 1,258.75
   _1.2685 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2656
   In London, it cost $1.7490 to buy one British pound, unchanged
from late Wednesday.
   Bullion dealers said the gold market was sluggish and lacked
direction, but some light buying from Switzerland helped lift
prices.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $445 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $446. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$446.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was .446.20, up from $446 late
Wednesday.
   Hong Kong financial markets were closed for the Chinese New Year
holiday.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.43 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $6.42.

<DATELINE>USULUTAN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boom startled the sentries,
shattered the tropical pre-dawn calm and cut off all the lights at
the Salvadoran Cotton Cooperative Ltd. outside this provincial
capital.
   The attack was part of the biggest guerrilla offensive this
year. The coordinated strike included a raid on the 6th Infantry
Brigade base in Usulutan, 5 miles east of the cooperative, and the
blowing up of two bridges and more than a dozen utility poles.
   In San Salvador, about 60 miles to the northwest, foreign
ministers of five Central American nations met to assess progress
in implementing a regional peace accord signed last August.
   Army officers said the attacks early Wednesday by 600 insurgents
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front left at least 18
people dead. Fourteen people were wounded.
   An entire family _ the five young Hernandez children and their
parents _ perished when a guerrilla mortar fell short of the 6th
Brigade compound and hit their one-room brick and adobe home in a
poor neighborhood.
   Five soldiers of the brigade died, as did at least five
guerrillas, said the brigade commander, Col. Inocencio Montano. He
said about 300 rebels took part in the strike on the base.
   Montano said four of the 55 U.S. military advisers stationed in
El Salvador were at the base when the assault began at 12:10 a.m.,
but none was in danger.
   Pvt. Rodolfo Marinero Montoya slouched on the steps of the
cooperative's makeshift barracks, exhausted after many hours of
combat.
   After the mortar barrage, he said, the guerrillas ``attacked
from all sides.'' He said a mortar round scored a direct hit on one
of the open-sided, zinc-roofed warehouses behind the barracks,
igniting stacked bales of cottonseed.
   Marinero said he did not know if the other warehouses caught
fire from the heat of the first blaze or if the dozens of rebels
that penetrated the cooperative burned them.
   Seven of the 15 warehouses were destroyed. Members and officials
of the cooperative did not have a dollar estimate of the damage. A
cottonseed oil factory next to the cooperative also was attacked
and damaged.
   By midday, tired firefighters with soot-streaked faces took
turns training a stream of water on the only warehouse fire that
still threatened to spread.
   Rebels fighting an 8-year-old war against the U.S.-supported
government contend economic targets, especially farms or storage
facilities for coffee, cotton and sugar, are valid military
objectives.
   The three products account for 80 percent of El Salvador's
foreign exchange.
   Lt. Jose Mejia Henriquez, commander of the cooperative's
permanent 30-man police detachment, said the attackers numbered
about 300.
   The guerrillas demolished a utility pole down the road from the
big communal enterprise then fired 60mm mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades for about 15 minutes.
   ``Then they attacked shouting like Indians,'' Mejia said on the
porch of the cooperative's offices. ``They shouted at us to
surrender, calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist.''
   His troops held the guerrillas off at the front of the
cooperative, he said, but many rebels breached the defenses from
the sides and rear and infiltrated the cooperative. Julio Campos of
the National Police was killed.
   The rebels blew up the Palo Seco and Vado Marine bridges just
west and east, respectively, of Usulutan. The city, 70 miles
southeast of San Salvador and home to 70,000 people, is the capital
of Usulutan province on this country's hot, scrub- and palm-studded
coastal plain.
   Mejia said the battle at the cooperative lasted nearly four
hours, about an hour longer than fighting around the 6th Brigade.
   He said he could not say categorically that the attackers
suffered losses, but said reinforcements that arrived after dawn
found at least two places around the cooperative with ``pools of
blood'' and first-aid refuse that indicated casualties.
   The foreign ministers of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Guatemala and Costa Rica ended 10 hours of talks Wednesday in San
Salvador without agreeing on the mechanisms for determining
compliance with provisions of the regional peace plan.
   They said they would meet again next month in Guatemala.
   Salvadoran Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo Peralta opened the
session by urging the signatories to comply with the peace plan's
injunction against providing aid to insurgents in any Central
American country. The call was apparently directed at Nicaragua,
which El Salvador claims backs the FMLN.
   El Salvador, a Massachusetts-sized country of 5 million people,
last year received more than $600 million in U.S. aid, most of it
military or war-related.

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes In Tehran, 2 More Defused</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded on a Tehran
expressway today, wounding two people, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   It also said two other ``powerful bombs'' were defused ``in the
last several days'' in north Tehran's Vanak Square and a gasoline
station in Ormieh, capital of West Azerbaijan province in northwest
Iran, close to the Iraqi border.
   The expressway bombing was the second in Tehran this week.
   IRNA reported that 10 people were wounded Tuesday when a car
bomb exploded in a residential quarter in the northern part of
Tehran
   That blast happened five days after Iranians celebrated the
ninth anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic
Revolution that toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
   IRNA said today's explosion damaged cars and shattered windows
of nearby stores. It gave no other details in a terse report.
   It blamed the bombing on ``agents of world arrogance,'' a
revolutionary epithet for the United States and its European allies.
   Iran includes Iraq, with which it has been fighting since
September 1980, among America's allies.
   Last September, IRNA said a car bomb exploded in a north Tehran
street. The agency did not mention any casualties in that blast.
   Iran's official media reported last month that four people
identified as terrorists were hanged in public for planting car
bombs in Tehran and the western city of Bakhtaran last year.
   The reports said the four had smuggled cars from Iraq before
packing them with explosives.
   Thirty-tree people were killed and more than 200 wounded in car
bombings in Tehran and the the holy city of Qom, 110 miles south of
the capital, in August 1986. Several people were later executed.
   Iran has blamed the bombings on the leftist Mujahedeen Khalq, or
People's Warriors, the main opposition group seeking to oust the
fundamentalist government. The Iraq-based Mujahedeen have
repeatedly denied those charges.

<TEXT>
   The University of Massachusetts'
chancellor says he has ``great admiration'' for minority students
who ended their six-day takeover of an academic building after they
were promised remedies for campus racism.
   Chancellor Joseph Duffey said the negotiations were conducted
cordially with representatives of the more than 150 students, who
filed out of the New Africa House with their fists raised in a
victory salute Wednesday afternoon.
   ``I ordered Chinese food and I hunched over one word processor
and they were at another,'' Duffey said. ``They were a very lively,
interesting, wonderful group of young people. We had a good time.
We also had serious differences.''
   Segun Eubanks, 25, a UMass senior and a member of the protest
group, was one of the few students who remained in the
Afro-American studies and cultural center, where the only evidence
of the protest was a sign outside reading, ``Thanks for Your
Support.''
   ``Basically, I think this is the beginning, this is the easy
part,'' said Eubanks. ``I feel like we've won the first major
battle.''
   The five-page agreement between Duffey and nine of the
protesters was reached late Tuesday night following nearly four
hours of negotiations. It included a promise to change the school's
student conduct code to allow suspension of students who commit
acts of racial violence or harassment.
   Duffey also promised extensive renovation of the New Africa
House and funds for educational and cultural activities for
minority students. And he agreed to increased funding to recruit of
minority students and teachers, but rejected a demand for student
involvement in hiring faculty. No amounts of funding were
negotiated.
   Duffey also consented to the formation of a student committee to
monitor progress of the pact.
   Prior to Tuesday's negotiations, protesters dropped their
demands to suspend or dismiss five white students accused of
beating two blacks Feb. 7 and suspend campus police officers
accused of forming a line-up of blacks the same night in a search
for men who allegedly harassed a female student. The protesters
said they were satisfied the university or courts would deal with
the incidents properly.
   ``The nature of this event had to do with a group who wanted to
show the world their apprehenson, concern and fear,'' Duffey told
reporters. ``I have great admiration for the students' leadership,
concern and courage.''
   Duffey, however, blamed the Feb. 7 incidents more on alcohol
abuse than racism.
   The 150 students, many of whom remained in the New Africa House
during the takeover, said they broke an early-morning deadlock and
debated the administration's response until just before noon
Wednesday.
   ``I feel like I'm going to faint _ I haven't been able to sleep
and I haven't been able to eat,'' said Joella Costello, 24, a
junior who burst in to tears after the vigil ended. ``But it was
all worth it.''
   About 200 spectators, including Amy Carter, daughter of former
President Jimmy Carter, watched the end of the takeover, which
began Friday morning. Miss Carter, 20, was among 14 people arrested
in November 1986 at UMass during a protest of CIA recruitment on
campus. She was later acquitted of trespassing and disorderly
conduct charges.
   Duffey discouraged a call by students for a moratorium on
classes Tuesday and Wednesday to protest racism, sexism and other
forms of oppression.
   Protesters claimed the present climate at UMass began with a
clash between blacks and whites following the 1986 World Series.

<TEXT>
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi denied
involvement in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner, according to
testimony today at the kidnapping trial of his brother, Abbas Ali
Hamadi.
   Abbas Hamadi is accused of kidnapping two West Germans in
January 1987 in a bid to force the West German government to reject
a U.S. extradition request for Mohammed Hamadi.
   The contents of several letters Mohammed Hamadi wrote to
relatives in Beirut after his arrest in West Germany last year were
read into the court record today.
   West German federal criminal officers seized the letters before
they could be smuggled out of the Frankfurt prison where Mohammed
Hamadi is being held.
   In a letter dated Jan. 21, 1987, Mohammed Hamadi wrote to his
parents: ``I found out today about the United States' allegations.
I am being accused of something that I had nothing to do with.''
   In another letter to another brother, Abdul Hadi Hamadi,
Mohammed wrote: ``I only ask that the kidnappers take good care of
the hostages. They're just people being held like me.''
   On Wednesday, federal investigator Klaus Pruefer said an
acquaintance of Abbas Hamadi's, Hamsa Kassim, told police the
defendant informed him in a telephone conversation that West German
businessman Rudolf Cordes had been kidnapped.
   Kassim quoted Hamadi, who was calling from Beirut, as saying:
``We have kidnapped a West German,'' according to his statement to
police.
   Excerpts of Kassim's statement to police were read into the
court record on Wednesday. Cordes was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987,
shortly after Hamadi's brother, Mohammed, was arrested in Frankfurt
and later accused of the TWA hijacking.
   In one excerpt read into the court record, Kassim, who lives in
Saarland state, said Abbas Hamadi told him that Mohammed Hamadi was
arrested because ``he was one of the kidnappers of the American
TWA'' jetliner.
   Kassim also told police that Abbas Hamadi made the remarks on
Jan. 14, 1987, one day after his brother Mohammed was arrested at
Frankfurt airport carrying explosives.
   Abbas Hamadi is accused of kidnapping the two West Germans in
Beirut in a bid to force the West German government to reject a
U.S. request to extradite his brother. West Germany turned down the
extradition request, but has since charged him in this country.
   Last week, former West German hostage Alfred Schmidt testified
that Hamadi was not among the initial gunmen who kidnapped him from
his Beirut hotel room Jan. 20. He said Hamadi was older and taller
than the men who abducted him.
   Schmidt also said he did not think a man who questioned him in
German in Beirut was Hamadi. Abbas Hamadi lived in West Germany and
speaks fluent German.
   Federal officers have testified that Abbas Hamadi's fingerprints
were found on a letter Schmidt wrote to family members during his
captivity.
   Schmidt was released in September in what his kidnappers said
was a good-will gesture. Cordes is still being held.
   West German authorities last week charged Mohammed Hamadi with
murder and air piracy in connection with the 1985 hijacking of the
TWA jetliner to Beirut. He faces the same charges in the United
States. A U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans were held for
17 days in the hijacking ordeal.
   A trial date for Mohammed Hamadi, 23, has not yet been set. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   He remains in investigative custody in Frankfurt.
   A third West German citizen, Ralph Rudolf Schray, was kidnapped
in Beirut three weeks ago in an apparent attempt to increase
pressure on West Germany to release the Hamadi brothers.
   No one has claimed responsibility for that kidnapping.

   Denver may have the highest per-capita level of
education in the nation, but you might not know it from an
advertisement boasting that fact in Business Week magazine.
   The full-page ad reads, ``It's really very simple: Smart people
perfer to live'' in the Mile High City.
   Perfer?
   Richard Fleming, president of the Greater Denver Chamber of
Commerce, which paid for the ad, said he was unaware of the
typographical spelling error until a reporter asked him about it.
   The typo ``certainly doesn't change the fact that Denver has the
highest per capita level of education in the country,'' Fleming
said recently.
   The ad claims that 81 percent of Denver's adult population are
high school graduates and 26 percent are college graduates.
   ``Don't overlay this,'' he said. ``I know it's kind of unique.
But it's not the stock market crash or World War III.''
   It's also not the first incident in recent weeks that has piqued
Denver's pride. Last month, city officials and residents were
angered when a CBS News correspondent, reflecting on Denver's
second straight loss in the Superbowl, called it a town ``that's

   One hundred furry little creatures are
starting to make the guest lists of hundreds of parties and
conventions throughout the Midwest.
   The star-struck rodents are participants in a mouse-racing act
that has turned into a good living for Ron Penland of Kansas City,
Mo., and is quickly becoming a popular alternative to traditional
forms of party entertainment.
   Penland, 38, has been taking his 100 mice on the road for 11
years, and the going rate now to set up the race track in Kansas
City is a minimum of $350.
   The self-described ``Mouse Man'' set up his 16-foot race track
in Springfield on Tuesday as conventioneers attending a meeting of
the Illinois Grain and Feed Association cheered on six of the
racing rodents.
   The mice scurried through the tiny doors at the starting gate
and scrambled to the finish line. They crawled over hurdles and
passed pictures of cats along the way.
   Penland says he doesn't encourage gambling, but just in case, he
posts the career winnings of the mice in each race on a nearby
posterboard.

   An American serviceman crossed the
border today, one of more than 20 Americans who remained on the job
in south Lebanon despite the kidnapping of Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins a day earlier.
   U.N. spokesman Timor Goksel said there were no plans to change
U.N. regulations that restrict Americans to the border and
headquarters areas for most duties and require armed escorts for
travel beyond those areas.
   Higgins told U.N. officials he had full authority from the
American government to travel wherever he wished, according to
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Goksel said 16 American servicemen and a half-dozen civilians
continued to work in Lebanon, most of them staying overnight at
headquarters in Naqoura to follow the search for Higgins.
   One officer who identified himself as an American working for
the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) was seen crossing
into Lebanon. But he refused to give his name or answer a
reporter's questions while waiting for Israeli guards to open the
blue steel gate at the border checkpoint.
   Other American personnel reached by telephone at U.N.
headquarters in Naqoura and in Jerusalem referred reporters to the
Pentagon, saying they were not permitted to speak.
   Higgins, 43, a Marine officer from Danville, Ky., was new on the
job, taking up his post Jan. 8 as commander of 75 unarmed observers
from 16 nations. He was kidnapped Wednesday while returning from
the southern port city of Tyre where he met with a Shiite Moslem
political leader.
   Asked why Americans were still working in southern Lebanon in
view of recent abductions, Goksel said American observers had been
under a travel ban since 1985. ``Higgins felt he couldn't abide by
these restrictions. ... He assured us there would be no problems,''
Goksel said.
   ``Higgins felt that as chief, he should be out with his men and
know what they are doing,'' he said, noting Higgins commanded a
force made up largely of non-Americans.
   Goksel indicated the Americans were safe because ``they are not
serving the United States but under the U.N. flag.''
   The border area is also more friendly for Americans because it
is controlled by Israeli troops and allied Christian militiamen.
But Higgins was traveling outside this zone when he was taken.
   In general, Goksel said, Americans in the observer corps have
been doing headquarters duties and working in observation posts
along the Lebanese side of the border with Israel.
   Goksel said one of the main functions of the observer group was
to maintain contacts with local leaders, and Higgins' visit to Amal
representatives was an initial courtesy call arranged through the
Tyre U.N. office.
   ``Until now, we have always felt safe in Tyre,'' Goksel said.
   Higgins, the first U.N. peacekeeper to be kidnapped in Lebanon,
was traveling alone and unarmed in a U.N. vehicle, following
another U.N. vehicle with two observers, a Dane and an American.
   Goksel said U.N. troops from Fiji, Ghana, Ireland and Finland
were leading the search for Higgins.
   He said the mainstream Shiite militia Amal was heavily involved
in searches outside the U.N. zone. ``They are reporting to us, but
we are not coordinating with them,'' he said.
   U.N. officials said they were encouraged by the fact that the
militia was involved, noting there had been no active searches when
Westerners had been abducted elsewhere in Lebanon.

   A son and a nephew of the late President
Gamal Abdel Nasser are among 20 people indicted in connection with
four attacks on U.S. and Israeli diplomats in Cairo, Egypt's chief
prosecutor announced today.
   Prosecutor General Mohammed el-Guindi said he was seeking the
death penalty for 11 of the defendants, including Khaled Abdel
Nasser, eldest son of the late president.
   El-Guindi said he wants prison sentences up to life for the
other nine, among them Nasser's nephew, Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser,
a physician.
   Both Nasser relatives are fugitives outside Egypt. Family
members say the son is living with his wife and children in
Yugoslavia and the nephew in London.
   El-Guindi's indictment accused the first 11 defendants of
forming a group called Egypt's Revolution to assassinate foreign
diplomats, aiming to disrupt relations between Egypt and several
countries and to destabilize security within Egypt.
   The indictment also charged the 11 with murder and attempted
murder in the attacks, which occurred one a year between 1984 and
1987. Two Israelis died and six Israelis and two Americans were
wounded in the attacks.
   Egypt's Revolution was financed from abroad, el-Guindi told
reporters, but he said investigations had not shown which country
or countries were involved.
   The nine defendants for whom lesser penalties are being asked
were accused of complicity in the alleged conspiracies.
   ``Under the name Egypt's Revolution, these men assassinated and
attempted to assassinate diplomats with the aim of destabilizing
the security situation in Egypt and spoiling relations between
Egypt and those countries,'' el-Guindi said.
   ``There was no aim to overthrow the government.''
   The defendants included two former military officers and a
former corporal.
   Nine of the 11 for whom el-Guindi is seeking the death penalty
had been arrested and ordered released by the courts. El-Guindi
said they would be re-arrested.
   Large numbers of bombs, ammunition and weapons including machine
guns were discovered with the defendants, he said.
   ``The financing came from abroad, but the investigation has not
showed from where,'' el-Guindi said.
   The indictment said Khaled Nasser, 38, formed Egypt's Revolution
along with Mahmoud Nour el-Din el-Sayed Ali Suliman, 47, a former
administrative employee at the Egyptian Embassy in London, and
Ahmed Essam el-Din el-Sayed Ali Suliman. The Sulimans are brothers.
   Mahmoud Suliman was the leader and fired weapons in each attack,
the indictment said, and Nasser handled the group's financial and
material supplies.
   El-Guindi said the international police coordination agency
Interpol would be asked to help bring Khaled Nasser back to Egypt.
   Neither Yugoslavia nor Britain, where Gamal Shawki Abdel Nasser
is reported to be, has an extradition treaty with Egypt.
   Egypt's Revolution first surfaced in 1984, when an Israeli labor
attache was wounded. Its communiques claiming the attacks indicated
a pan-Arab philosophy comprising the ideas of Gamal Abdel Nasser,
republican Egypt's first president.
   Nasser was revered throughout the Arab world and died in
September 1970.
   Investigators said the group described itself in a letter to a
magazine editor wounded in an attack by an underground Moslem
fundamentalist group as ``Nasserite ... with weapons training,
aiming to end the official presence of Israelis in the country.''

   A woman wounded by a spurned admirer in
a shooting spree that left seven people dead says she was so afraid
of the man she moved three times and sought a court order of
protection.
   Laura Black, 26, who police say was the target of Tuesday's
shootings at ESL Inc., was haunted for four years by unwanted
advances from Richard W. Farley, a former co-worker, her lawyer
said. Black was one of four people injured in the siege.
   Black had asked a court to order Farley, 39, to never bother her
again, but she was shot and seriously wounded in her office the day
before her hearing, authorities said.
   ``I have been afraid of what this man might do to me if I file
this action,'' she said in her filing with the court. ``However, I
am now at the end of my rope.''
   In the filing, Black said she obtained an unlisted phone number
and moved three times, but Farley continued calling her at work,
driving by her house and following her to softball games.
   San Jose Family Court Commissioner Lois Kittle, who issued a
temporary order against Farley on Feb. 2, made it permanent
Wednesday.
   ``This was a consciousness-raising incident,'' she said from the
bench in tears. ``It shows pieces of paper do not stop bullets.''
   Charges were being prepared against Farley, who was being held
in the Santa Clara County jail in San Jose, prosecutor Alan
Nudelman said Wednesday. Police Capt. Al Scott said he expected
them to include multiple counts of homicide, attempted murder and
assault with a deadly weapon.
   A portrait of Farley as a man with a deadly obsession but no
apparent criminal background or pattern of job problems emerged
from comments by authorities, neighbors and former employers.
   When police searched a motor home owned by Farley, they found a
stockpile of guns and ammunition, along with cans of gasoline,
Scott said.
   ``He had a lot of guns and a lot of gun knowledge _ apparently a
lifetime hobby,'' the captain said.
   Police say Farley was a Texas native who never married, served
11 years in the Navy with an honorable discharge, and started at
ESL, a Silicon Valley defense contractor, in November 1977. It was
there that he met Black.
   When Farley failed to get dates with Black, he began living in a
fantasy world, Black's attorney, Mary Bird, said. Farley took
pictures of Black and used them to ``document'' their make-believe
life, Bird said.
   Neighbors said Farley, who lived in a dilapidated cottage with
peeling paint, was a loner who never said hello to anyone.
   Farley was fired in May 1986 from his $36,000-a-year job as a
software development engineer after sending a letter threatening
Black's life, said Jerry DeRuntz, a company manager.
   The attack, said Scott and Lt. Ruben Grijalva, who negotiated
the gunman's surrender, was Farley's way of ``making a point'' that
he wouldn't tolerate being spurned by Black or laughed at by other
ESL employees.
   ``He was in love with her from the first moment he saw her,''
said Grijalva. ``It was her smile.''
   After being fired, Farley found other computer industry jobs,
and his current employer, Sunnyvale-based Covalent Systems,
released a statement Wednesday saying his work was satisfactory and
there was ``no indication whatsoever of problems.''
   At ESL, which does such work as outfitting military spy planes,
president Robert Kohler met with about 2,000 grieving employees
outside the plant Wednesday. He said the deaths were ``like losing
members of your own family.''
   The company said the shootings did not result from any lapse of
security. Scott agreed, noting that Farley gained access by
blasting his way through a computer-controlled door.
   The building where the shootings took place was closed
Wednesday, but other buildings at ESL were open.
   Black suffered chest, shoulder and spine injuries in the
shooting.
   Killed were Joe Silva, 43, of Sunnyvale; Buddy Williams, 23, San
Jose; Glenda Moritz, 27, Sunnyvale; Ron Reed, 26, Sunnyvale; Helen
Laparter, 49, Sunnyvale; Lawrence J. Kane, 46, San Jose; and Ron
Doney, 36, Manteca.
   Injured in addition to Black were Richard Townsley, 44, of San
Jose, wounded in the chest, arm, leg and hand; Gregory Scott, 39,
of San Jose, shrapnel wounds to the face; and Patty Marcotte of San
Jose, who broke her forearm trying to break a window to escape.

   Lots of folks head for the top of the Empire
State Building when they visit New York.
   But Australian Craig Logan, who took his first trip to the top
on Wednesday, did it the hard way. He ran.
   ``It wasn't too bad, really,'' said Logan, a 26-year-old pastry
chef from Melbourne after he won the 11th annual Empire State
Building Run-Up. Still, he said, ``It gets a bit boring, going
around and around and around.''
   Logan, who was married three weeks ago, said he won the chance
to compete in the Empire State Building Run-Up by winning a similar
event last August in a 56-story hotel in Melbourne.
   ``That one felt harder,'' he said. He attributed his victory in
part to being the first man into the stairwell _ no small
advantage, considering the crunch of bodies that followed him.
   Logan, who finished in 11 minutes, 29 seconds, led a field of 79
men and 27 women who thundered up the stairwell to the top of the
102-story building for glory, fitness and the first-place prize of
a computer.
   Eleven minutes after Logan crossed the finish line, along came
Navy airman William Savage, No. 77 of the 79 men. Savage ran and
walked to the top.
   ``I didn't feel bad,'' he said, assessing his race afterward.
``I was just dying.''
   Savage, who is assigned to the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy
in Norfolk, Va., said he grew up in Cold Springs, Ky., where the
tallest building is about four stories ``and that's a barn.''
   So it was quite a thrill to be at the top of the Empire State
Building, with all of New York spread out beneath hazy blue skies.
Savage, 29, is no neophyte to athletic competition or to New York
City _ he competed last year in the New York Marathon and runs 140
miles a week.
   ``But I was still dying,'' he said, grinning wildly in defeat.
   Winner Logan finished just a few yards ahead of Joseph Kenny, a
U.S. Air Force physician from Cheyenne, Wyo.
   The top women's finisher was Olympic marathon hopeful Janine
Aiello of San Francisco, whose time of 13 minutes, 43 seconds, was
28 seconds off her women's record in the event, set in 1985.
   Ms. Aiello interrupted her Olympic training to compete for the
fifth time in the Empire State Building event. ``It feels great,''
she said. ``My mom was here, my aunts from New York. It was just so
great to see their faces.''

   An 81-year-old widow in failing health has
pleaded guilty to wounding her retarded son in a bungled mercy
killing attempt she said was necessary because she loved him too
much to leave him behind.
   ``Sometimes, a mother's love puts people in strange
situations,'' Circuit Judge William D. Block said before sentencing
Geraldine M. Sagel of Ingleside to 30 months of probation.
   Ms. Sagel is required to live in the Round Lake Beach nursing
home that has been her home since her arrest in October, but she
will be allowed supervised visits with her son, Block said.
   Her son Jack, 51, lives at the Waukegan Developmental Center.
Authorities said Ms. Sagel's bullet went through his shoulder
instead of his heart.
   ``I am very sorry that it ever happened,'' the wheelchair-bound
widow said before her sentencing on a charge of aggravated battery
Wednesday. ``I didn't want to leave him behind. I was going blind,
and my health was failng by the day, and I was afraid that being
the way he is, that he would be at the mercy of the world.
   ``I didn't want that, Your Honor,'' she told the judge. ``I love
him too much for that. I think you can understand that.''
   ``Oh, I think anyone with children can understand that,'' Block
replied.
   Ms. Sagel could have been sentenced to a maximum of 53 years in
prison.
   A grand jury declined to indict her on the more serious charge
of attempted murder, which carries a mandatory prison sentence of
six to 30 years.
   ``I don't think society can condone what she did,'' said
Prosecutor Michael J. Waller said. ``But you can empathize with her
feelings. I don't have any qualms about the outcome.''
   Ms. Sagel was a race-car driver in the 1920s, a dancer at the
1934 Chicago World's Fair and says she was the first woman to
skydive from a bi-plane. She said she spent most of her life caring
for her son because she did not trust anyone else.
   The state is paying for her son's care now, and Ms. Sagel will
live on money from the sale of her small house, her lawyer said.

<HEAD>Inflation to Trim US Military, Diplomatic Ranks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers and diplomats will face leaner
times next year under what President Reagan today called ``an
essential minumum program'' for national security.
   The trillion-dollar budget Reagan sent to Capitol Hill today
will require the Pentagon to thin ranks and scrap some weapons,
like the Midgetman missile now under development and 16 frigates
already at sea. The State Department may be forced to close some
overseas missions, but those have not been announced yet.
   The budget calls for a $294 billion ceiling for military
outlays, up from 1988 outlays of $285.4 billion, but the increase
is less than half the estimated 4.3 percent inflation rise this
year.
   State Department spending is proposed to rise 2 percent above
1988 levels, to $1.74 billion. But a weaker dollar and inflation
abroad have raised the costs of diplomacy, meaning the government
may lay off personnel as some foreign outposts are shut.
   ``The proposals for national security contained in this budget
represent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe and
honoring our commitments to our friends and allies,'' Reagan said
in a statement.
   ``Anything less would jeopardize not only our national security
_ and that of our friends and allies _ but also would dim the
prospects for further negotiated agreements with our adversaries,''
Reagan said.
   The budget plans stand in sharp contrast to the military buildup
of the first two years of the Reagan administration, when defense
spending increased by 12 percent and 13 percent.
   Reagan repeated his assertion that a mightier military
strengthened his hand in diplomacy, as well.
   ``Weapons systems have been modernized and upgraded. We are
recruiting and retaining higher caliber personnel. The readiness,
training and morale of our troops have been improved
significantly'' since the beginning of the Reagan administration in
1981, the president said.
   ``Because we are stronger, enormous progress has been achieved
in arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Austerity in the proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning
next Oct. 1 is forcing the Pentagon to plan on reducing the number
of men and women under arms by 34,000, to a force level of
2,172,000, according to the budget. Reserve strength will remain at
1.7 million.
   The Air Force will bear the brunt of the personnel cuts, losing
23,000 airmen, with the Army losing 8,600 soldiers; the Marines,
2,900.
   The Pentagon will drum out an additional 10,000 civilians from a
worldwide staff of 1,102,000, according to the documents.
   The cuts are expected to save $1.4 billion in personnel costs.
More personnel savings could be realized if Congress torpedoes a
planned 4.3 percent pay increase.
   America's nuclear muscle may sag some. Pentagon planners want to
cancel development of the single-warhead mobile Midgetman missile.
But many in Congress prefer deploying the Midgetman to devising a
way to move the MX missile by rail as a means of reducing Soviet
ability to hit it in a first strike.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci is expected to ask for between
$100 million and $200 million to keep the Midgetman just barely
alive. Air Force generals argue they can save more than $2 billion
next year and $39 billion in the future by canceling the Midgetman,
according to administration officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Pentagon also is expected to save $786 million by canceling
its anti-satellite missile program; Congress already has banned
tests of the device for three years.
   The Navy's hopes for a 600-ship fleet may be pushed beyond the
horizon as that service readies mothballs for 10 frigates of the
Garcia class and six frigates of the Brooke class built in the
early 1970s. Sailors from those ships will go to other vessels,
saving the Navy from personnel cuts, except for the Marine Corps.
   On the diplomatic front, the State Department may be headed back
to the straits it faced last September, when a revenue shortfall of
$60 million prompted Secretary of State George P. Shultz to
forecast the elimination of 1,270 jobs and the closing of more than
a dozen embassies and consulates abroad.
   Congress gave the State Department an extra $60 million for the
current year.

<TEXT>
   Inmates angry over the conduct of searches at
the Rikers Island city jail ransacked a dormitory, but surrendered
peacefully this morning after guards using tear gas and batons
forced one group out.
   Four inmates and four guards were injured, but not seriously,
said Richard J. Koehler, city commissioner of correction.
   The riot in the Anna M. Kross Center, which houses 2,700
inmates, started at midnight and was over by 3:30 a.m., he said.
Most of the 550 inmates involved were state prisoners in jail for
parole violations, Koehler said.
   The inmates heavily damaged 12 dormitories, which house about 50
inmates each, and 350 state inmates will have to be transferred out
of the city. They are being held in the gymnasium and other common
areas until they can be moved.
   The inmates shattered chairs, tore apart doors and ripped beds
from the walls, using the pieces of broken furniture to smash all
the lights, he said.
   ``We lost about 600 beds,'' Koehler said at a news conference in
a trailer outside the prison gates. He could not estimate the cost
of the damage and said it would take several days to repair it.
   The riot apparently was sparked by a weapons search Wednesday
morning, during which seven state inmates had to be taken out of
the dormitories ``because they objected to the search and
interfered,'' Koehler said.
   Those inmates were returned Wednesday night to the dormitories,
where tensions were already high due to a stabbing earlier in the
day.
   At midnight Wednesday, inmates in the four dormitories on the
top floor began piling their beds and lockers against the door,
keeping guards out. Inmates in the four dormitories on each of the
other two floors followed suit.
   No hostages were taken, but when Supervising Warden James T.
Garvey Jr. arrived to discuss the prisoners' grievances they
refused to talk and began breaking out of the dormitories into the
facility's hallways. At that point, Garvey decide to use force,
Koehler said.
   Tear gas was fired into one dormitory. Then 200 officers armed
with batons and wearing plastic helmets and padded jackets moved
into the room and began physically removing the inmates. The
inmates fought bac with chair legs, broken glass and other weapons
made from the shattered furniture, Koehler said.
   After the fight, the inmates in the other 11 dormitories agreed
to talk to the warden and the barricades came down around 3:30
a.m., he said.
   Inmates complained that guards are using unnecessary force in
weapons searches, Koehler said.
   Koehler and Robert Kasanof, chairman of the city Board of
Correction, blamed the state prison system for the disturbance.
   ``This is in my view a state riot which has been exported to the
City of New York,'' Kasanof said. ``These are long-term prisoners
for the most part, for whom the city prisons are ill-designed and
for whom the state prisons are well-designed.''
   The city's prison system is currently at 101 percent of capacity
with more than 15,000 prisoners, about 11,000 of them at Rikers,
Koehler said.

   Presidential hopefuls looking to recover
from poor showings or to get ahead going into Super Tuesday are
stumping in Minnesota and South Dakota, which offer the next big
contests before the March 8 cluster of primaries and caucuses.
   For Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, Minnesota's precinct caucuses and
South Dakota's primary could make or break his Democratic
presidential bid, although Simon backed off from a statement that
he would drop out if he lost in both states.
   ``If I don't win either Minnesota or South Dakota, I'm going to
drop out of the race. I don't want to just continue indefinitely
running second or third,'' Simon had said early Wednesday. But he
later told reporters, ``We're now hedging on that because of the
reaction we've been getting from around the country.''
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp, in desperate need of a showing above
third place, also headed for Minnesota Wednesday.
   Democrat Richard Gephardt left New Hampshire and flew straight
to South Dakota Wednesday in an urgent search for a primary victory
to make good his claim that his party's race is a two-man contest
between him and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Dukakis, the top Democratic vote-getter in New Hampshire, has
waged the most aggressive campaign of the Democrats in Minnesota
and has a strong campaign in South Dakota.
   ``It gives us a tremendous shot in the arm,'' Dukakis' Minnesota
campaign director Pat Forciea said of the New Hampshire win.
   But Simon was staking his claim too.
   ``The place where my natural roots are is right here in Hubert
Humphrey land,'' Simon said.
   Hamilton Thompson, Simon's Minnesota campaign manager, said his
campaign's polling shows that 30 percent to 40 percent of
Minnesotans who have attended caucuses in the past are undecided.
   Additionally, he said, the polling suggests Simon is the second
choice of many Jackson supporters, and he expects some could come
over to Simon if they decide Jackson can't win the race.
   Gephardt, who spent the most time campaigning in South Dakota,
and Dukakis were believed to have the best chances in that state,
according to state party leaders. Simon also was considered to have
strong support in South Dakota, party officials said.
   Kemp has one of the best-organized Republican campaigns in
Minnesota. While his state campaign chairwoman, Evie Axdahl,
expressed confidence that he'll do well, she acknowledged that his
showing could be affected by ``wild card'' Pat Robertson, the
former television evangelist who has fared well in earlier caucus
states.
   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas campaigned extensively in
both states, while Vice President George Bush made at least nine
appearances in South Dakota but didn't campaign at all in Minnesota.
   Prior to the Iowa caucuses, Republican insiders said they
expected Dole and Kemp to run a close 1-2 in Minnesota. But
Robertson's surprise second-place showing in Iowa raised his
supporters' expectations _ and his opponents' fears _ that he could
do better than expected in the state.
   Dole and Dukakis have spent substantially more than their
opponents in the two states, according to reports filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
   The Democratic events in both states are occurring earlier than
national party rules allow, and the states were embroiled for
months in a heated dispute with the national party.
   Under an agreement with national party officials, South Dakota's
Democratic primary results are officially non-binding. However,
state party officials say the delegates selected at a March 12
statewide caucus will be be apportioned according to the popular
vote.
   The agreement Minnesota Democrats reached with the national
party requires that a presidential preference poll taken at the
precinct caucuses be kept secret until 5 p.m. on March 8.
   However, Minnesota Secretary of State Joan Growe plans to report
caucus-night results from both the Democratic and Republican events.

   ``The Last Emperor'' garnered nine Academy
Award nominations, but this year's list of Oscar contenders is a
diverse lot of epics, comedies and dramas, hardly a one-picture
sweep.
   The comedy-romance ``Broadcast News'' received seven nominations
Wednesday, and the wartime drama ``Empire of the Sun'' showed up
six times in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences list.
   The six nominations also received by the psycho-thriller ``Fatal
Attraction'' and the offbeat love yarn ``Moonstruck'' reflect the
Academy's orientation toward commercial hits rather than domination
by artsy movies.
   ``Fatal Attraction'' took in $129 million at the box office and
``The Untouchables,'' with four nominations, brought in $76 million.
   At the same time, the good showing by ``The Last Emperor''
indicates the academy looks beyond what succeeds commercially, said
the film's director, Bernardo Bertolucci.
   ``It's fantastic to have with me all my people, my collaborators
who shared with me the Chinese adventure,'' said Bertolucci, who
noted his associates on the movie, the life story of China's last
emperor, were a mixture of Italians, Britons and Chinese.
   ``What I think is a great satisfaction for me today is to see
that Hollywood has given this recognition. ... The nomination
already tells that there was for Hollywood a great proof of
non-chauvinism. .. None of these nominated (for best director) is
from Hollywood,'' he said today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning,
America.''
   Best director nominee Adrian Lyne said he ``finds it tough to
believe'' people really liked his movie, ``Fatal Attraction.''
   ``I got up early, fearing and trembling, watching the live thing
on CNN,'' Lyne said. When the movie came up in category after
category, ``I was bouncing up and down with my wife and the dog.''
   ``Broadcast News,'' set in a television news bureau, brought
nominations for stars William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks.
   ``I'm on my way out to see the movie again to see what they are
talking about,'' Brooks said.
   James Brooks was nominated for producing the picture and for
writing it, but, startlingly, not for directing it.
   The nominations for ``Empire of the Sun'' also didn't include
one in the directing category for Steven Spielberg, who has yet to
win an Oscar for best director despite being the top moneymaking
director of all time.
   His film also was not among the best picture nominees:
``Broadcast News,'' ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Hope and Glory,'' ``The
Last Emperor'' and ``Moonstruck.''
   Two-time winners Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep were nominated
for their roles as Depression-era low-lifers in ``Ironweed.''
   Best actor nominees also included Michael Douglas for ``Wall
Street''; Hurt, ``Broadcast News''; Marcello Mastroianni, ``Dark
Eyes,'' and Robin Williams, ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
   ``It made me not only proud of our film `Wall Street,' but it
reminded me of what a wonderful part Oliver Stone created,'' said
Douglas.
   Joining Miss Streep in the best actress list were Cher,
``Moonstruck''; Glenn Close, ``Fatal Attraction''; Miss Hunter,
``Broadcast News;'' Sally Kirkland, ``Anna.''
   Sean Connery, who never was nominated in his many appearances as
James Bond, placed among the nominees for supporting actor for his
role as the steely Chicago cop in ``The Untouchables.'' Others in
the race: Albert Brooks, ``Broadcast News''; Morgan Freeman,
``Street Smart''; Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck''; Denzel
Washington, ``Cry Freedom.''
   All of the supporting actresses were first-time nominees: Norma
Aleandro, ``Gaby _ A True Story''; Anne Archer, ``Fatal
Attraction''; Olympia Dukakis, ``Moonstruck''; Anne Ramsey, ``Throw
Momma from the Train''; Ann Sothern, ``The Whales of August.''
   ``Like my cousin, I'm in the running and now I'm waiting for
`Super Monday' in April,'' said Dukakis, referring to the April 11
Academy Awards ceremonies. Hours earlier, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis won the New Hampshire Democratic presidential
primary.
   None of the five best-director nominees are from the United
States: Lyne and John Boorman, ``Hope and Glory,'' from Great
Britain; Bertolucci, ``The Last Emperor,'' from Italy; Norman
Jewison, ``Moonstruck,'' from Canada and Lasse Hallstrom, ``My Life
as a Dog,'' from Sweden.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the outspoken former protege of
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was ousted from the ruling
Politburo today, Tass reported.
   Two rising stars in the Communist Party hierarchy were named
non-voting Politburo members, the official Soviet news agency said.
   The policy-making Central Committee made the changes after
Gorbachev told the party leadership that his efforts to modernize
the economy and Soviet society did not constitute a retreat from
socialism.
   ``We are not retreating one step from socialism,
Marxism-Leninism, everything which has been won and created by the
people,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   ``We are striving in the present conditions to revive the
Leninist look of the new system, to rid it of the accumulations and
deformations, of everything that shackled society and prevented it
from realizing the potential of socialism in full measure,'' he
said.
   Tass said the Central Commiittee meeting ``freed Comrade B.N.
Yeltsin from his duties as a candidate member of the Politburo.''
   Yeltsin, 57, was brought into the ruling body by Gorbachev in
February 1986 and named Moscow party boss. But he fell from favor
last fall when he complained to the Central Committee at its last
meeting that an entrenched bureaucracy had stalled Gorbachev's
efforts to modernize Soviet society.
   Yeltsin earlier had been removed from his party post in the
Soviet capital but was given a ministerial job in the government's
construction bureaucracy, leaving his political future in doubt.
   The move to drive him from power was seen as an indication the
party remains unwilling to tolerate criticism in key areas, despite
Gorbachev's program of ``glasnost,'' or openness, which has
encouraged freer expression of ideas.
   He said his program is, instead, designed to root out dogmatism
and bureaucracy.
   Tass said Georgy Razumovsky, 52, a Gorbachev protege who has
been handling party personnel matters for almost two years, would
take a seat as a non-voting member of the Politburo. He has been a
secretary of the Central Committee, a key post in the Communist
Party apparatus.
   Also named to candidate, or non-voting, membership was Yuri
Maslyukov, 50, who this month was named chairman of the State
Planning Committee, the body that historically has controlled the
nation's planned economy.
   The party chief acknowledged that his program of
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, has caused some confusion.
Perestroika seeks to decentralize control of industry and make
plant managers responsible for their own products in an effort to
streamline production, improve quality and make consumer goods
available to the Soviet public.
   The Tass account said some people have questioned whether ``the
new, unaccustomed forms of economic management and social life''
actually constitute a revision of fundamental Marxist-Leninist
teaching.
   ``The awareness has been established now that perestroika is an
objectively necessary stage of the development of Soviet society,
whose essence is a transition to its new qualitative state,''
Gorbachev said.
   On Wednesday, Yegor K. Ligachev outlined plans for an overhaul
of the country's school system, saying the rigid and centralized
Soviet bureaucracy must ease its control over schools to allow more
flexibility at the local level.
   Ligachev is considered to rank second behind Gorbachev.
   Western reporters are not allowed to attend the meeting of the
more than 300 members of the policy-making body. The committee is
composed of top national officials, regional and local party
bosses, and Communists from the armed forces, government
ministries, industry and agriculture.

<HEAD>Seven People Treated for Cyanide Exposure After Youth Commits
Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLADAY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old chemistry student committed
suicide by injecting a homemade cyanide solution into his veins,
and seven people became ill after apparently handling the chemicals
or breathing fumes, police said.
   The youth mixed up a substance like that used in execution
chambers, said Lt. Calvin Latsis, Salt Lake County fire hazardous
materials officer. ``He knew exactly what he was doing.''
   Sheriff's Deputy Dan Haggen was listed in serious condition at
St. Mark's Hospital today. Fire officials said Haggen's illness was
compounded by an allergic reaction to a cyanide antidote.
   Three other sheriff's officers also became ill several hours
after going to the teen-ager's home Wednesday morning. They and the
deceased youth's parents and a 10-year-old sister were treated and
released.
   The deputies apparently did not recognize the youth had died
from cyanide, and had no idea they were in danger while in the room
with his body, Latsis said. About four hours later they began
experiencing headaches, nausea and tightness of the chest, said Tom
Bogle, fire battalion chief.
   Cyanide poisoning can occur from either breathing fumes or
absorption through the skin. Gas had permeated the home when
deputies arrived, but they and others in the home may also have
handled some of the chemicals, the fire officials said.
   The 17-year-old, whose name was not released, was an advanced
chemistry student at his high school. He died after creating a
lethal dose of cyanide from several chemicals and injecting it into
his veins, Latsis said.
   Sheriff's deputies said the youth left a note indicating that he
was not getting out of life what he was putting into it.
   When cyanide was suspected in the illness of the deputies,
family members were evacuated.

<TEXT>
   John Demjanjuk's wife and children shouted
``You're liars'' to prosecutors today after the defense rested in
the former Ohio autoworker's Nazi war crimes trial.
   Demjanjuk's daughter, Irene Nishnic, son John Jr. and wife,
Vera, walked onto the stage of the converted movie theater where
the year-old trial was held and shouted at the prosecutors.
   Security guards quickly ushered them out of the courtroom. The
sobs of the women could be heard, followed by an angry expletive by
John Jr.
   Demjanjuk, 67, appeared surprised, but did not otherwise react.
The Ukranian-born Demjanjuk is accused of being ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed
850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in
1942 and 1943.
   He was stripped of his U.S. citizenship in 1981 and was
extradited to Israel to stand trial for war crimes. Demjanjuk
insists he is innocent and a victim of mistaken identity.
   The three-judge panel is expected to issue its verdict in April.
   The emotional outburst came after defense attorney John Gill
ended his final arguments and prosecutor Michael Shaked rose to
respond to accusations that the prosecution withheld from the
defense documents that would exonerate Demjanjuk.
   Shaked said the prosecution had provided all material to the
defense ``on a silver platter,'' and even translated it.
   John Jr., 22, rose angrily from his front row seat, walked onto
the stage, turned and said: ``You're a liar.'' He was followed by
Mrs. Nishnic, 28, who shook her fist and tearfully cried: ``You're
lying.''
   Mrs. Demjanjuk then rose, and in a heavily accented voice
shaking with emotion, shouted: ``You're a liar! You liar. Shame on
you. Shame on you. You have no heart _ nothing!'' She was pulled
from the stage by two security guards.
   After the family's outburst, presiding Judge Dov Levine told
Shaked and the three-member defense team: ``You both ought to do
away with this bitterness because ... we believe there was fair
treatment.''
   Demjanjuk's family said, however, they did not believe Demjanjuk
had received a fair trial.
   ``It's all been lies from beginning to end,'' Mrs. Nishnic told
The Associated Press tearfully after the trial, her hands shaking.
   ``We just didn't expect the trial to end like that, to close
with statements that aren't true. The defense should have been the
ones to have the last say,'' she said.
   John Jr. said the family believed statements from 21 camp
survivors who did not identify Demjanjuk as ``Ivan,'' had been
withheld by the U.S. Justice Department and the prosecution had not
intervened to help.
   ``It's been a set-up from begining to end,'' he said.
   Resting the defense case, Gill called on judges to recognize the
prosecution had not ``presented the proof necessary to convict this
innocent man.''
   ``Your honors, John Demjanjuk's life is in your hands,'' Gill
said. ``I leave you with an Irish blessing: May God hold you in the
palm of his hand while you deliberate the fate of my client, John
Demjanjuk.''
   Levine said the judges would give the date of a verdict 10 days
before it was to be announced. A separate sentencing hearing will
be held about one month after the verdict if he is convicted.
   Demjanjuk faces a maximum penalty of death.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's budget
message to Congress.
   To the Congress of the United States:
   As we consider the state of our nation today, we have much cause
for satisfaction.
   Thanks to sound policies, steadfastly pursued during the past
seven years, America is at peace, and our people are enjoying the
longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's history.
   By reordering priorities so that we spend more on national
security and less on wasteful or unnecessary federal programs, we
have made freedom more secure around the world and have been able
to negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength.
   By pursuing market-oriented economic policies, we have uncorked
the genie of American enterprise and created new businesses, more
jobs, improved production, and widespread prosperity.
   And we have done all this without neglecting the poor, the
elderly, the infirm, and the unfortunate among us.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SEVEN YEARS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Let me note a few of the highlights from our administration's
record of accomplishment:
   _The current expansion, now in its 63rd month, has outlasted all
previous peacetime expansions in U.S. history. Business investment
and exports are rising in real terms, foreshadowing continued
economic growth this year and next.
   _Since this expansion began, 15 million new jobs have been
created, while the unemployment rate has fallen by 5 percentage
points _ to 5.7 percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade. By
comparison, employment in other developed countries has not grown
significantly, and their unemployment rates have remained high.
   _Inflation, which averaged 10.4 percent annually during the four
years before I came to office, has averaged less than a third of
that during the past five years.
   _The prime interest rate was 21.5 percent just before I came
into office; it is now 8.5 percent; the mortgage rate, which was
14.9 percent, is now down to 10.2 percent.
   _Since 1981, the amount of time spent by the public filling out
forms required by the federal government has been cut by hundreds
of millions of hours annually, and the number of pages of
regulations published annually in the Federal Register has been
reduced by over 45 percent.
   _Between 1981 and 1987, changes in the federal tax code,
including a complete overhaul in 1986, have made the tax laws more
equitable, significantly lowered earned income tax rates for many
individuals and corporations, and eliminated the need for 4.3
million low-income individuals or families to file tax forms.
   _At the same time, real after-tax personal income has risen 15
percent during the past five years, increasing our overall standard
of living.

   The manufacturers of about 60,000
high-efficiency gas furnaces sold nationwide will inspect and
repair units that may have become corroded, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said today.
   The repairs are being offered by Arkla, Inc., of Shreveport,
La., and Preway Industries of Evansville, Inc., the commission
said. The furnaces made by the two companies have been sold under
several trade names. Those in the repair program include Century
Reclaimer I and Comfort-Aire Reclaimer I sold by Heat Controller
Inc.; Elite sold by Trane CAC Inc.; Elite sold by General Electric;
some Arcoaire units sold by Arco Comfort Products Inc.; some
Comfortmaker furnaces sold by Climate Control Products, and
Recuperative I sold by Arkla Industries.
   Arco Comfort Products and Climate Control Products are part of
Snyder General Corp.
   The companies have received 387 complaints of corrosion in the
furnaces. Such corrosion could permit the escape of carbon
monoxide, an odorless gas that can cause illness or death in large
amounts, the safety commission warned. Signs of carbon monoxide
poisoning include flu-like symptoms of headache, nausea, stomach
upset and drowsiness.
   The furnaces have been found to be susceptible to corrosion when
exposed to chlorine, fluorine, salt, paint stripper, fabric
softeners, water softeners, bleach and adhesives.
   The commission said that the two companies will inspect the
furnaces at no charge and, if necessary, retrofit them with
upgraded components or replace them on a pro rata basis.
   Consumers needing more information can call Preway toll-free at
1-800-237-5207 or the safety commission at 1-800-638-2772.

   _The outburst of spending for means-tested entitlement programs
that occurred in the 1970s has been curbed. Eligibility rules have
been tightened to retarget benefits to the truly needy, and
significant progress has been made in improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of these programs.
   _We have begun the process of putting other entitlement programs
on a more rational basis. This includes Medicare, which was
converted from cost-plus financing to a system that encourages
competition and holds down costs.
   _Federal spending for domestic programs other than entitlements
has been held essentially flat over the last five years, while
basic benefits for the poor, the elderly, and others in need of
federal assistance have been maintained. This is a dramatic
improvement over the unsustainably rapid annual growth of these
programs that prevailed before 1981.
   _The Social Security system has been rescued from the threat of
insolvency.
   _Our defense capabilities have been strengthened. Weapons
systems have been modernized and upgraded. We are recruiting and
retaining higher caliber personnel. The readiness, training, and
morale of our troops have been improved significantly. Because we
are stronger, enormous progress has been achieved in arms reduction
negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   _Federal agencies have undertaken a major management improvement
program called ``Reform '88.'' This program has two main
objectives: to operate federal agencies in a more businesslike
manner, and to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in government
programs.
   _Some functions of the federal government _ such as financing
waste treatment plants _ are being transferred back to state and
local governments. In other instances _ such as water projects _
state and local governments are bearing a larger share of costs,
leading to more rational decision-making in these areas.
   _Finally, we have made real progress in privatizing federal
activities that are more appropriate for the private sector than
government. Notable examples include the sale of Conrail, the
long-term lease of National and Dulles Airports, and the auction of
billions of dollars in loan portfolios.
   _Related to this shift away from the federal budget are our
achievements on cost sharing and user fees, shifting the cost of
projects and programs where appropriate to non-federal sources.
   While we have reason to be proud of this record of achievement,
we must be vigilant in addressing threats to continued prosperity.
   One major threat is the federal deficit.

   If the deficit is not curbed by limiting the appetite of

   A Soviet deputy foreign minister said today that
the superpower arms talks in Geneva had deteriorated and that the
United States was blocking agreement on cuts in intercontinental
nuclear arms.
   ``It is difficult to forecast with a sufficient degree of
certainty how these negotiations will proceed further,'' Vladimir
Petrovsky said in a speech to the 40-nation Conference on
Disarmament.
   He said the Soviet Union hopes that the visit of Secretary of
State George Shultz to Moscow next week ``will provide the
necessary clarity as to the further intentions'' of the U.S. side
regarding the arms talks in Geneva.
   The two sides have said they are trying to conclude a treaty on
reducing their intercontinental, or strategic, nuclear forces by 50
percent in time for an expected U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in May
or June. But both sides have said a summit could be held even if a
treaty were not ready for signing.
   Petrovsky said the Soviet Union is ``convinced'' that a treaty
could still be prepared in time for signing at a summit in the
first half of this year. But he said, ``A whole set of rather
difficult issues remains to be solved.''
   He reiterated the Soviet position that the main issue still to
be resolved is the question of compliance with the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Senior U.S. arms control adviser Edward Rowny said Monday in
Boston that the Soviets were using delaying tactics at the Geneva
talks. He said the Soviets could speed up progress on strategic
arms reductions by abandoning their efforts to link such reductions
to U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative research.
   Petrovsky said the U.S. position at the talks ``impedes reaching
agreement on the reductions in strategic offensive arms.'' For
example, he said, the United States was refusing to include limits
on sea-launched cruise missiles because they say such limits would
be difficult to verify.
   ``This being so, the situation at the space and nuclear talks
has now noticeably deteriorated,'' said Petrovsky.
   Petrovsky also suggested that the Conference on Disarmament, the
world's only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, start
negotiating on eliminating nuclear weapons in all countries which
possess them.
   At a press conference, he said ``the time has come'' to take
into account the nuclear arsenals of China, Britain and France, as
well as of the United States and Soviet Union, which are already
negotiating reductions in their forces.
   ``The Soviet Union suggests to start immediately identifying in
practice the substance of possible multilateral measures in this
field,'' he said.

<HEAD>$8 Million Missing From Federal Reserve Shipment To Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As much as $8 million from a $52 million U.S.
currency shipment to Argentina was lost as the bags of cash were
being transferred from a jet to an armored Brink's Inc. truck in
Brazil, the Daily News reported today.
   Two 6-foot-long sacks of cash, believed to contain $4 million
each, were reported lost, the newspaper said. The cash was being
shipped by the Federal Reserve Bank. Neither it nor Brink's, which
was providing security, would identify the customer.
   Thirteen sacks were loaded aboard a regularly scheduled Varig
Airlines 747 at Kennedy International Airport on Feb. 4., the
newspaper said. Varig is an Argentine carrier.
   The bags were lost after the jet landed at Rio de Janeiro
International Airport, and the money was being loaded into an
armored truck which was to transfer it to a flight to Argentina,
the News said.
   ``The loss is under investigation in the United States, by
Brink's here and in Brazil, and by airlines security and the police
in Brazil and Argentina,'' said Marvin Moss, a Brink's spokesman at
the company's Darien, Conn., offices. ``In reality, we don't know
where the loss occurred.''
   He put the loss at ``more than $5 million,'' but the News said
sources told it the loss was $8 million.
   Bart Sotnick, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, would say
only that ``we gave an amount of money for transportation for a
bank customer.''
   The Fed deals with ``our counterparts,'' central banks of other
nations and international banking institutions, Sotnick said.
   According to the newspaper, the money went by Brink's truck from
the Fed office in Manhattan to Kennedy airport. It was loaded into
the bulk cargo hold of Varig Airlines Flight No. 861 with security
by Brink's.
   In Rio de Janeiro, four of the bags were placed on a cart that
somehow was wheeled into a baggage room, said sources who were not
identified by the newspaper. When the cart was found, two of the
sacks, which are so heavy they require two men to lift one, were
missing.
   The rest of the money was shipped to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

   Sen. Paul Simon will skip tonight's Democratic
presidential debate in Texas to devote ``complete attention'' to
Minnesota and South Dakota ahead of caucuses and primaries in those
states next Tuesday, an aide said today.
   The debate in Dallas is the first major event on the calendar
prior to the pivotal Super Tuesday round of contests.
   Though Simon edged away from his statement Wednesday that he had
to win either Minnesota or South Dakota to stay in the race, it is
apparent the Illinois senator is banking his future hopes on good
showings in those states.
   Simon concentrated on raising money Wednesday night and
Thursday, picking up about $150,000 in Chicago and moving on to St.
Louis this morning.
   Aide David Carle said Simon collected $250,000 last week and
hoped to gather another $400,000 in a series of fund-raisers this
week.
   Carle said Simon has already made 10 trips to Texas and saw no
need to attend tonight's debate.
   Simon began Wednesday telling television interviewers that he
had to finish first in Tuesday's Minnesota caucuses or South Dakota
primary to stay in the contest for his party's nomination.
   Later, addressing an airport rally _ at which about 100
supporters greeted him with signs urging ``Hang Tough, Paul'' _
Simon said he was disappointed in his second-place finish in the
Iowa caucuses Feb. 8 and in his third-place finish in New
Hampshire's primary Tuesday.
   Those losses, he said, came by a total of fewer than 6,000 votes.
   ``It's like getting on the one-foot line, and you don't quite
score that touchdown,'' he said, adding, ``I have to win next
Tuesday in either Minnesota or South Dakota.''
   By late Wednesday night, however, he was telling reporters at a
series of fundraisers, ``We're now hedging on that because of the
reaction we've been getting from around the country.''
   He also said he planned to run in his home-state Illinois
primary March 15.
   As for Minnesota, Simon said he was optimistic about his
chances. He told a St. Paul news conference that ``the place where
my natural roots are (is) right here in Hubert Humphrey land.''
   So far, Simon said, he has 35 delegates in the race for the
Democratic presidential nomination. Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
has 38 and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has 48, he said.
   Simon finished second in Iowa behind Gephardt, and third in New
Hampshire, behind Dukakis and Gephardt.
   ``In terms of delegates, it's almost a three-way tie right now,
but you can't continue to run second and third indefinitely _
that's part of reality,'' he said.
   Aides said Simon's campaign has debts of about $500,000, with
about $200,000 on hand, and expects to raise $300,000 to $400,000
this week, including about $150,000 at fundraisers in Chicago and
St. Louis before heading back to Minnesota today.

   The Reagan administration today issued an
economic forecast any Republican presidential candidate could run
on with pride, predicting a record sixth year of peacetime economic
growth with no increase in inflation.
   The administration, which in the past has been derided for its
``rosy scenarios'' of future economic activity, presented an
optimistic view that the current expansion will continue into the
indefinite future. And it derided initial recession fears from the
October stock market crash as ``greatly exaggerated.''
   ``Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices, however, the real
economy has shown few signs of serious damage,'' the budget
forecast stated.
   While the economic assumptions that underpin the president's
1989 budget are more optimistic than the predictions made by the
Congressional Budget Office and most private forecasters, they are
not as far from the general consensus as in previous years.
   Indeed, the administration boasts that its economic forecast a
year ago, which was also above the general consensus, turned out to
be closer to right.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew 3.8
percent in 1987, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986. The
administration had predicted 3.2 percent growth.
   ``Most forecasters failed to anticipate the magnitude of the
improvement in the manufacturing sector just then getting under
way,'' the budget stated.
   For 1988, the administration predicts manufacturing will remain
a source of strength with export sales continuing to rise because
of the weaker dollar.
   The administration predicts the overall economy will expand at a
2.4 percent annual rate this year with much of that growth coming
from the improving trade deficit.
   This compares to a CB0 growth forecast of 1.8 percent. The CBO
forecast is the same as the consensus view of 51 top economists
surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an investment newsletter.
   Among the economic assumptions, the administration predicts:
   _GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay
above 3 percent through 1993.
   _Consumer inflation, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise
by 4.3 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four
years to a 2 percent rate in 1993.
   _Unemployment, because of the modest growth, will show no
improvement this year, remaining at 5.8 percent at the close of the
year, matching the current level. However, the jobless rate will
begin declining modestly in future years, dropping to 5.5 percent
in 1989.
   These assumptions provide the basis for the administration's
hopes of making further progress in getting the federal budget
under control.
   The 1989 spending plan, Reagan's eighth submission to Congress,
has a valedictory quality about it, reviewing in detail the
president's economic goals when he took office in 1981 and trying
to explain the reasons for Reagan's biggest economic failure, the
string of record budget deficits.
   The administration, as it has in the past, put much of the blame
on Congress for failing to enact its domestic spending cuts. But
the budget also says the 1981-82 deficit played a large role,
adding $112 billion to the deficit in 1983 alone.
   The new budget calls for reducing the federal deficit to $129.5
billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, down from an
actual budget deficit of $150.2 billion in the 1987 fiscal year and
an estimated deficit of $146.7 billion for the current fiscal year.
   The 1987 deficit was originally put at $148 billion but was
revised in today's budget document.
   The 1989 budget estimate is below the target of $136 billion
called for in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, but the
administration concedes that its estimates in the past have fallen
victim to worse-than-expected economic performance.
   Those pitfalls could derail the current plan as well, the
administration says, noting that if GNP growth is just 1 percent
lower than the administration is forecasting over the next five
years it would add $6.3 billion to the 1989 deficit and $66 billion
to the 1993 deficit.
   A minority of economists is predicting an even worse outcome for
this year, forecasting the economy will fall into an actual
recession.
   If growth is slower than the administration forecasts, or in a
worst-case scenario, the country does enter a recession, then that
would mean smaller federal tax revenues and higher spending for
such programs as unemployment benefits.
   The current economic recovery began in December 1982, following
the worst recession since the Great Depression, and is now in its
63rd month, surpassing the old record for a peacetime recovery of
59 months set between 1975 and 1979.

   The Congress acknowledged the pressing need to reduce the
deficit when, in December 1985, it enacted the Balanced Budget and
Emergency Deficit Control Act, commonly known for its principal
sponsors as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (G-R-H) Act.
   This act committed both the president and the Congress to a
fixed schedule of progress toward balancing the budget.
   In 1987, the budget deficit was $150 billion _ down $71 billion
from the record level of $221 billion reached in 1986.
   This was also a record decline in the deficit.
   To some extent, however, this improvement represented one-time
factors, such as a high level of receipts in the transitional year
of tax reform.
   Economic forecasters predicted that without action the 1988 and
1989 deficits would be higher than the 1987 level.
   In order to prevent this, and to preserve and build upon the
1987 deficit-reduction progress in a realistic fashion, last fall
the Congress modified the G-R-H Act.
   Specifically, it required that the 1988 deficit target be $144
billion and the target for 1989 be $136 billion.
   Last year, members of my administration worked with the leaders
of Congress to develop a two-year plan of deficit reduction _ the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement.
   One of the major objectives of the budget I am submitting today
is to comply with that agreement _ in order to help assure a steady
reduction in the deficit until budget balance is achieved.
   The Bipartisan Budget Agreement reflects give and take on all
sides.
   I agreed to some $29 billion in additional revenues and $13
billion less than I had requested in defense funding over two years.
   However, because of a willingness of all sides to compromise, an
agreement was reached that pared $30 billion from the deficit
projected for 1988 and $46 billion from that projected for 1989.
   In submitting this budget, I am adhering to the Bipartisan
Budget Agreement and keeping my part of the bargain.
   I ask the Congress to do the same.
   This budget does not fully reflect my priorities, nor,
presumably, those of any particular member of Congress.
   But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction
must be paramount.
   Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our
economic progress and burden future generations.
   This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is
possible without abandoning tax reform, without cutting into
legitimate social programs, without devastating defense, and
without neglecting other national priorities.
   Under the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, progress toward a
steadily smaller deficit and eventual budget balance will continue,
but this projected decline rests on two assumptions: continued
economic growth, and implementation of the agreement.
   If the economy performs as expected, and if the Bipartisan
Budget Agreement reflected in this budget is adhered to, the
deficit should decline to less than 3 percent of GNP in 1989.
   For the first time in several years, the national debt as a
proportion of GNP will actually fall.
   Reducing the deficit and the debt in this manner would bring our
goal of a balanced budget and a reduced burden on future
generations much closer to realization.
   Moreover, adherence to the agreement, as reflected in this
budget, will ensure the achievement of additional deficit
reductions in future years, because in many cases the savings from
a given action this year will generate deficit savings in
subsequent years.
   Given the good start made in 1987, we have an opportunity this
year to put the worst of the deficit problem behind us.

   The $950,000 parsonage where Jim and Tammy
Bakker lived while at PTL will be among eight residences sold to
raise money for the ministry.
   PTL also will hold a fund-raising telethon Feb. 29-April 1, or
Good Friday, PTL's bankruptcy trustee said at a hearing Wednesday.
   Trustee David Clark told Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds: ``We
are making good progress in many areas. I am very, very
optimistic.''
   Among eight residences PTL will sell at an April 16 auction are
the former Tega Cay home of the Bakkers, appraised at $950,000, and
the former Lake Wylie home of former PTL President Richard Dortch,
appraised at $575,000.
   Clark said he hoped the telethon would generate $4 million. He
also estimated the Christian television ministry and theme park
near Fort Mill will net about $5.2 million from selling off other
property.
   Clark also told the judge the PTL is negotiating its tax status
with the Internal Revenue Service.
   Reynolds said: ``Let's jump to the bottom line. There is no
money in the bank to take care of the closing'' of the Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Reynolds advised Clark of ``the importance of doing everything
possible'' to save the ministry financially. PTL needs about $4.2
million in May and $5.2 million in August to meet requirements of
its reorganization.
   At the hearing, Clark introduced a new executive vice president
of finance and operations, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, a certified public
accountant and former mayor of Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Benton said PTL made nearly $3 million during five weeks through
the end of January. But while the ministry was pulling in $85,000
per day, it was spending $100,500 per day. In the two weeks ending
Feb. 13, PTL was bringing in $110,000 a day in revenues but
spending $127,000 per day, Benton said.

   The investigation into the case of a black
teen-ager who claims she was sexually assaulted by six white men
has again reached an impasse with lawyers for the victim saying
they will not cooperate with prosecutors.
   Representatives of the victim met with state Attorney General
Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor investigating the case, for
12 hours Tuesday and Wednesday but failed to secure a pledge from
Abrams that he would personally handle several key aspects of the
case.
   Without that, ``we are unable to give him the cooperation that
he is demanding of us,'' Alton Maddox Jr., an attorney representing
Tawana Brawley and her family, said at a news conference after
Wednesday's meeting.
   ``There is no way that we can agree that we have, instead of a
special prosecutor, a case manager,'' he said. ``We are looking for
a special prosecutor to personalize this case.''
   Abrams said in a statement that he was committed to personal
participation in, as well as overall responsibility, for the case.
But he said it was too early to make the specific tactical
decisions demanded by Maddox, attorney C. Vernon Mason, and
activist Al Sharpton.
   Abrams said the investigation will continue without the
cooperation of Miss Brawley or her attorneys.
   The two sides have no immediate plans to meet again, said
Abrams' spokesman, Timothy Gilles.
   Miss Brawley, 16, of Wappinger Falls, claims she was repeatedly
raped and assaulted last November by six white men, one of whom
flashed a police badge. She was found four days after her
disappearance in a daze, wrapped in a plastic bag. Racial epithets
had been scrawled on her body.
   This week's talks followed a meeting Feb. 11 between Miss
Brawley's representatives and Gov. Mario Cuomo, which appeared to
break a stalemate that had stymied the investigation.
   Previously the representatives had refused to allow Miss Brawley
or her family to cooperate in the probe, saying they didn't think
John Ryan, the aide Abrams had picked to head the investigation,
had sufficient experience in civil rights matters.
   The attorneys later said they had been assured by Cuomo that
Abrams would be ``personally involved'' in the investigation.
   In the meetings this week the representatives made Miss
Brawley's cooperation conditional on Abrams personally conducting
certain aspects of the case, including grand jury presentation and
direct examination of several witnesses, Abrams said.
   ``I have indicated that I do not rule out performing any or even
all of these roles myself,'' said Abrams. ``However, we are far
from any trial here, we are far from even solving this case, and
these are questions of trial tactics that I and my staff of
prosecutors feel cannot in good conscience be made at this time.''

   North Korean soldiers fired machine
guns in the demilitarized zone dividing the Korean peninsula, the
United Nations Command said. No injuries were reported.
   The command said the North Koreans opened four rounds of
machine-gun fire across the border in the eastern part of the DMZ
near Cholwon Wednesday night. The state-run television network,
KBS, said North Korean soldiers used loudspeakers to declare the
shooting was accidental.
   ``It was not a provoked firing,'' said command spokesman Bill
Fullerton. ``There were no casualties.''
   South Korean soldiers did not return fire, Fullerton said. He
said a joint investigating team of U.S., British and South Korean
officials had been dispatched to the site. The area is about 70
miles northeast of Seoul.
   South Korean officials could not be reached for comment today as
government offices were closed for the lunar New Year.
   Shooting incidents are occasionally reported along the DMZ, a
strip of territory that divides communist North Korea from the
capitalist South. The two Koreas have never signed a formal peace
treaty since an armistice ended the Korean War in 1953.

<HEAD>MEETING NATIONAL PRIORITIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In formulating this budget, I have endeavored to meet national
priorities while keeping to the terms of the Bipartisan Budget
Agreement and the G-R-H Act.
   In essence, the agreement limits the 1988-to-1989 increase in
domestic discretionary program budget authority to 2 percent.
   To address urgent national priorities insofar as possible within
this overall 2 percent limit, my budget proposes that some programs
_ such as those for education, drug enforcement, and technology
development _ receive larger funding increases, while others are
reduced, reformed, or, in some cases, terminated.
   High-priority programs must be funded adequately.
   One of our highest priorities is to foster individual success
through greater education and training oppoortunities.
   For example:
   _I propose an increase of $656 million over the $16.2 billion
appropriated for 1988 for discretionary programs of the Department
of Education. Although state and local governments fund most
educational activity, federal programs provide crucial aid for the
poor, the handicapped, and the educationally disadvantaged.
   _I have proposed reform of our overcentralized welfare system
through state experimentation with innovative alternatives. In
addition, my initiative would overhaul current employment and
training programs for welfare recipients, and strengthen our
national child support enforcement system.
   _By emphasizing housing vouchers, I would provide housing
assistance to 135,500 additional low-income households in 1989 _ 8
percent more than the 125,000 additional households receiving
housing subsidies in 1988.
   _Ineffective programs to assist dislocated workers would be
replaced by an expanded $1 billion worker readjustment program
(WRAP) carefully designed to help those displaced from their jobs
move quickly into new careers.
   In addition, I am proposing funds to strengthen U.S. technology
and make America more competitive.
   For example:
   _I propose a continued increase in federally supported basic
research aimed at longer-term improvements in the nation's
productivity and global competitiveness. This budget would double
National Science Foundation support for academic basic research,
increase support for training future scientists and engineers, and
expedite technology transfer of government-funded research to
industry.
   _I would provide $11.5 billion for space programs, including:
essential funding for continued development of America's first
permanently manned space station; increased support for improving
the performance and reliability of the space shuttle; a major new
initiative, the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, for space
science; further support to encourage the commercial development of
space; and a new technology effort, Project Pathfinder, designed to
develop technologies to support future decisions on the expansion
of human presence and activity beyond Earth's orbit, into the solar
system.
   _I also recommend $363 million in 1989 to initiate construction
of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), including $283 million
for construction and $60 million for supporting research and
development. The SSC as currently envisaged will be the largest
pure science project ever undertaken. It will help keep this
country on the cutting edge of high energy physics research until
well into the next century.

<HEAD>Southern Leaders Outline Issue Agenda For Presidential Candidates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUB 3rd item on Robertson to add Texas to Austin dateline</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the presidential candidates head South from
Iowa and New Hampshire, Southern political leaders are predicting
that Super Tuesday will broaden the presidential debate into a
discussion of issues of national concern.
   To help focus that debate, the Sunbelt Institute and the
Congressional Sunbelt Caucus released a report Wednesday outlining
a series of issues important both in the South and in the nation as
a whole.
   The report urges the presidential candidates, for example, to
explain how they would combat illegal drugs, eradicate illiteracy,
promote energy independence in the face of rising oil imports,
reform the welfare system and develop impoverished rural areas.
   Former Virginia Gov. Chuck Robb told a news conference that
Super Tuesday will shift the campaign ``from retail to wholesale
politics'' by forcing the candidates to address such national
issues rather than the more narrow agenda of New Hampshire and Iowa

<HEAD>D'Amato: If Kemp Quits Presdential Race, He Should Challenge
Moynihan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Jack Kemp's presidential campaign is
reacting with amusement to the suggestion by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., that Kemp consider running against Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y, when _ and if _ he drops out of the race for the nation's
top job.
   ``Really?'' Kemp spokeswoman Mary Brunette laughed Wednesday
when told of D'Amato's brainstorm. ``Well, that's interesting.''
   Then, more soberly: ``Congressman Kemp has absolutely no
intention of quitting the presidential race. ... We're in it to the
end.''
   She said the campaign was gaining momentum, ``and I think it's
kind of absurd for Sen. D'Amato to make that suggestion, although
we appreciate his support.''
   D'Amato said he wasn't suggesting that Kemp quit, only that if
he did, he could win in New York, which he has served from the
House since 1970.

   Republican presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson, who last month threatened a lawsuit over the state GOP's
ballot petition forgery scandal, now says he won't take the issue
to court.
   ``It came down to Pat deciding he just didn't want to get
involved,'' Richie Martin, Robertson's Texas campaign manager, told
the Houston Chronicle.
   The deadline for initiating a challenge passed this week, and
Martin said, ``It would have taken much more of an effort than Pat
was willing to make. We're going to let it slide and let bygones be
bygones.''
   Robertson, during a campaign swing through Texas in late
January, said his staff was researching a legal challenge to the
state Republican Party's decision to leave the names of all six
presidential candidates on the ballot despite allegations that four
had submitted petitions with some forged signatures.
   The party OK'd petitions submitted by Robertson and Vice
President George Bush. The FBI and other authorities have been
investigating the other petitions.

<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three supporters of political extremist
Lyndon LaRouche _ including an Illinois congressional candidate _
face charges after being arrested outside New Hampshire primary
polling places, police said.
   Arrested were George Laurence, 48, of Romeoville, Ill., a
Democratic candidate for congress; Janice Hart, 32, of Chicago, who
embarrassed the Illinois Democratic party by winning the nomination
for secretary of state two years ago; and Judy Hodgkiss, 36, of
Manchester.
   Ms. Hart and Laurence were charged with disorderly conduct,
criminal trespass, obstructing government operations and disobeying
a police officer, police said. Ms. Hodgkiss was charged with
disorderly conduct.
   Police said one of the LaRouche supporters was using a public
address system outside a polling place and refused requests of
election officials to stop.
   Laurence is running for the Democratic nomination for Congress
from Illinois' 4th District against former state Sen. George
Sangmeister, who was defeated by a Larouche supporter in his March
1986 bid for lieutenant governor.
   LaRouche, a Rochester, N.H., native and perennial presidential
candidate, received 186 votes out of more than 119,000 cast in
Tuesday's leadoff Democratic presidential primary, according to
final but unofficial results.

   The financial challenge of waging a
simultaneous campaign in 20 states has presidential campaigns fresh
from New Hampshire scheming about where to get money for the
expensive Super Tuesday contest.
   Most campaigns are close-mouthed about how much they want to
spend on the March 8 series of Super Tuesday primaries, which
include all the Southern states but one.
   But the only one who is already on the air with commercials in
the South, _ Sen. Al Gore, Jr. of Tennessee _ said he will spend up
to a minimum of $3 million on television ads alone.
   ``You could spend an infinite amount'' running ads in all 20
states, said Bill Carrick, campaign manager for Democratic
contender Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   Gephardt has just enough money to meet his $200,000 in
outstanding bills, said Carrick. But he has no bank debts at this
point, and hopes to raise $2 million through fund-raising events in
the next three weeks.
   One Democratic contender, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, said
Wednesday that he'll be out of the race unless he can find more
money.
   One the other hand, another Democrat, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, has $4 million avspent $9.5 million against it by the end
of 1987.
   Well-funded campaigns must budget carefully so they can spend
enough on the later states without going over the $27 million limit.

   City officials stockpiled water in reserve
tanks today after about 100,000 gallons of a toxic chemical leaked
from a ruptured Sun Co. pipeline, threatening water supplies for
22,000 people and forcing 500 to be evacuated.
   The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency warned officials of
this northwest Ohio city to plan to stop drawing water soon from
the Sandusky River because some of the toluene had flowed into the
river near Tiffin, nearly 20 miles upstream.
   About 300 people in the town of Old Fort were ordered to
evacuate their homes today as the spill moved downstream, said
Seneca County Sheriff Weldon Neff. About 200 residents in an
18-square-mile area along the Sandusky River were evacuated
Wednesday night.
   Three people were treated for exposure to toluene. A firefighter
inhaled the fumes, and two other people fell into ice-covered
contaminated water.
   Fremont's reserve tanks have been filled. They hold about 4
million gallons, about one day's normal supply, said Gary
Rathfelder, assistant superintendent of the water plant. He said
the city will close the water intake valves just before the spill
reaches the city.
   The spill was about 12 miles upstream from Fremont and would
reach the city in about two days, he said this morning.
   Don Higgins, environmental coordinator for the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency, said officials are not sure how
much toluene had leaked into Sugar Creek, a tributary of the
Sandusky River. Earthen dams were built on the creek to block
further movement of the chemical into the river.
   ``It's not the kind of stuff you want in a river,'' he said.
``It won't kill you, but you don't want to be around it for too
long.''
   Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or
poisonous gases, according to an emergency response guidebook
published by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The chemical is
used as an octance enhancer.
   Forrest Brokaw, spokesman for the Tulsa, Okla.-based Sun Pipe
Line, said he learned late Wednesday that some of the chemical
spilled into the river and could affect Fremont's water supplies.
Sun Pipe Line is a division of the Sun Co.
   ``We'll naturally begin something to make sure they get
emergency water supplies,'' he said.
   Brokaw said the spill was caused by a split in the line that
might be connected to a 20-gallon leak earlier Wednesday. The
pipeline runs from a Sun refinery in Toledo in northwest Ohio to a
refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa., south of Philadelphia.
   Workers have not pinpointed the leak, however, said Bob Arnet,
an environmental safety coordinator for Sun Pipe Line. ``It's been
shut off, but it's still leaking,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Asks Increases to Fight AIDS, Boost School Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan asked Congress today for
major spending increases to fight the spread of AIDS and to boost
support for schools and colleges.
   Most social programs showed at least modest gains in Reagan's
election-year budget for fiscal 1989, as the president abandoned
perennial proposals for cuts that Congress has largely ignored in
previous years.
   The most striking increase was the $1.3 billion request for
research and education on the deadly AIDS virus, up by $349
million, or 38 percent, from the current level. Reagan said,
``Addressing the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic is
the highest public health priority of the administration.''
   The government also estimated that its cost of paying welfare
and Medicaid benefits for AIDS victims will soar in the year ahead
to $736 million from $461 million. That makes the total federal
costs more than $2 billion.
   One year after he sought to cut nearly $5 billion from the
Department of Education's budget, Reagan asked Congress to raise
its spending by $1.5 billion, or nearly 8 percent, to $20.3 billion.
   The biggest education gain would be in the Pell Grant program
for needy college students, which would climb by $590 million to
almost $5 billion. Reagan would raise the maximum grant to $2,300,
a $100 increase, and award 247,000 more grants. The program now
helps 3.15 million college and trade school students.
   Disadvantaged children in elementary schools would be helped by
two budget increases: a $238 million increase to $4.6 billion for
the Chapter 1 remedial education program, and a $43 million boost
to $115 million in aid for magnet schools. Reagan wants to make the
magnet school aid available more freely, and not just for school
desegregation.
   Carrying through on an initiative announced in the State of the
Union address, Reagan said he will propose legislation to allow
low- and middle-income families to earn interest tax-free on
savings bonds for college.
   The Department of Health and Human Services' budget would grow
by 5.8 percent, from $375.1 billion to $396.8 billion, including
Social Security and Medicare.
   Social Security's old age and disability programs alone are
expected to grow by $14 billion, or 6.4 percent, to $233.8 billion.
``The administration proposes no changes in Social Security
benefits,'' Reagan said. Thirty-eight million people receive
benefits, and the average retired worker and spouses will draw
$10,500 in 1988, an increase of nearly $3,700 over the 1981 level.
   Medicaid grants, which help states provide health insurance for
25 million poor people, will cost the federal government $32.7
billion in 1989, up 7 percent from $30.7 billion currently. Under
the recent budget agreement with Congress, Reagan proposed no
Medicaid cuts for 1989.
   Medicare spending, for 33 million elderly or disabled workers,
is projected to rise to $84 billion from $78.9 billion, and Reagan
proposed $1.2 billion in cuts to meet the deficit-reduction targets
that Congress and the administration agreed to in December.
   The budget proposes to limit Medicare payments for durable
medical equipment, reduce payments for radiology and anesthesiology
services, ``close a loophole in payments for home dialysis
treatment for end-stage renal disease,'' intensify screening of
physician claims by program contractors, and make permanent a
requirement that Medicare Part B monthly premiums _ now $24.80 _
cover 25 percent of the program costs.
   The budget proposes phasing out the low-income energy block
grant over four years, starting with a $300 million cut to $1.2
billion for 1989.
   It would also reduce the community services block grant by $57
million to $349 million, and eliminate funds for the $93 million
Work Incentive Program for welfare families.

<HEAD>Authorities Investigating Alleged Mulroney Assassination Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian authorities are investigating a report
that an American was offered the job of assassinating Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, a spokeswoman said.
   ``We are aware from press reports of the allegations that John
Wayne Hearn was approached in 1984 to assassinate the prime
minister,'' Constable Danielle Poirier of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said Wednesday.
   ``We are actively pursuing an investigation of this allegation
with U.S. authorities. We have no further comment at this time.''
   Hearn is serving three life terms in Florida for murder. His
classified ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine led to a $22.5 million
suit against the publication by the family of a Texas woman. They
claim the 1984 ad led to the woman's murder.
   Hearn said in a deposition read in federal court Wednesday that
responses to his advertisement for ``high-risk assignments''
included one seeking the assassination of the president of Canada.
   The deposition, given Oct. 13 and read in a Houston court, did
not go into detail about the Canadian assassination request and did
not mention Mulroney by name.
   Hearn also has claimed that Canadians financed the aborted
overthrow of the president of French Guiana to the tune of $100,000.
   Hearn said in a deposition that the Guianese president was
terrorizing the population with murderous hit squads. But French
Guiana is a protectorate of France and has no president.
   Hearn alleged that he and 11 others trained in Tennessee for
about six weeks before setting out for the South American country.
They aborted the ``mission'' when they developed engine trouble
while flying over the Gulf of Mexico, he said.
   The suit against Soldier of Fortune magazine stems from the
death of Sandra Black, of Bryan, Texas, whom Hearn admitted
shooting in 1985. Her husband, Robert, is on death row for paying
Hearn $10,000 to carry out the killing.
   Marjorie Einmann, Mrs. Black's mother, and Gary Black, the
victim's 18-year-old son, contend in their suit that Hearn's ad
brought him to the attention of Robert Black.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the nation's biggest corporations have
endorsed a so-called workplace bill of rights, pledging to actively
educate workers about AIDS and protect the rights of employees who
have the deadly disease.
   The pledge unveiled Wednesday by the Citizens Commission on AIDS
for New York City and Northern New Jersey says people with AIDS or
exposed to the suspected AIDS virus ``are entitled to the same
rights and opportunities as people with other serious or
life-threatening illnesses.''
   The pledge endorsed by 30 employers adds that they ``do not pose
a risk of transmission of the virus to coworkers through ordinary
workplace contact.''
   Requiring workers or job applicants take blood tests for the
virus is specifically rejected, as is divulging medical information
about an employee, it says.
   But, it said, ``Employers should provide employees with
sensitive, accurate and up-to-date education about risk reduction
in their personal lives.''
   IBM was the first company to endorse the principles, John
Zucotti, cochairman of the commission, said at a news conference.
   Others are AT&T, Time Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Warner-Lambert,
ITT, Dow Jones, Chemical Bank, the city of New York, the teachers'
unions of New York City and Newark, N.J., United Jersey Banks,
Shubert Organization, Times Mirror Co., Atlantic Industries; Ms.,
Atlantic, Sassy and U.S. News and World Report magazines;
   Rubenstein Associates, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the National
Urban League, the Girl Scouts, Salvation Army, Red Cross of Greater
New York, New Jersey A. Philip Randolph Institute, Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, Fund for the City of New York, Wildcat
Services and Archie Comics.
   ``Those companies that have subscribed to these principles have
been very courageous,'' said Thomas Stoddard, executive director of
the Lambda fund. ``They have been willing to take the heat because
they understand the gravity of the problem. We will continue to
have the problem of stigmatization until all companies subscribe to
these principles.''
   The 15-member commission was established in July and funded by
17 local foundations. Zucotti said its mission is to marshal
information and mobilize effort to improve care for AIDS sufferers,
promote prevention and education about the fatal affliction and
address its social impact.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. There is no known cure.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that AIDS will
strike 270,000 Americans and kill 179,000 by the end of 1991. The
CDC already has received reports of more than 28,000 deaths of
people with AIDS.

   This budget also reflects my belief that the health of all of
our citizens must remain one of our top priorities:
   _I continue to urge enactment of an affordable self-financing
insurance program through Medicare to protect families from
economic devastation caused by catastrophic illness.
   _To attack the scourge of AIDS, I propose $2 billion for
additional research, education, and treatment in 1989 _ a 38
percent increase over the 1988 level and more than double the
federal government's effort in 1987. This includes $1.3 billion in
funding for the Public Health Service.
   _Building upon the nation's pre-eminence in basic biomedical
research, I seek a 5.1 percent increase for non-AIDS research at
the National Institutes of Health.
   Our fight against drug abuse must continue, as well as our
efforts to protect the individual against crime.
   _For expanded law enforcement, including efforts targeted at
white collar crime, organized crime, terrorism and public
corruption, I propose $4.5 billion _ an increase of 6 percent over
1988.
   _For drug law enforcement, prevention, and treatment programs, I
propose $3.9 billion in 1989, a 13 percent increase over the 1988
level.
   _To relieve prison overcrowding and adequately house a growing
inmate population, I would provide $437 million _ more than double
the $202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988.
   Other areas of federal responsibility receive priority funding
in this budget:
   _For the Federal Aviation Administration to continue its
multiyear program to modernize the nation's air traffic control
systems, I would provide $1.6 billion _ a 44 percent increase over
the level of 1988.
   _To improve coordination of federal rural development programs
and to redirect funding toward needy rural areas and program
recipients, I propose a rural development initiative to be
coordinated by the secretary of agriculture.
   _To carry out the joint recommendations of the U.S. and Canadian
special envoys on acid rain, I recommend total funding of $2.5
billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projects
over the period 1988 through 1992.
   _I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanup
efforts, with an increase in Superfund outlays of some $430 million
in 1989.
   _To continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at
the current rate of 50,000 barrels per day, I would provide $334
million in 1989. Contingent upon the enactment of legislation
authorizing the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserves (NPR), I would
provide an additional $477 million to bring the fill rate up to
100,000 barrels per day, and an additional $208 million to
establish a separate 10 million barrel defense petroleum inventory
to offset the disposition of the NPR.
   _To improve the speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand
information services provided to taxpayers, I would provide a $241
million increase for the Internal Revenue Service. These funds are
designed to assure smooth implementation of the 1986 tax reforms.

   A Soviet delegation hopes to get a sense
of the way people live in Utah and perhaps see the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir as it studies the area for colleagues who could be
stationed here if the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty is
ratified.
   Igor Khripounov, first secretary at the Soviet Embassy,
Alecsandr Zobkov, an assistant military attache, and Vladimir
Sadovnikov, director of the Soviet city of Votkinsk's Industrial
Organization, arrived Wednesday and planned to leave Friday, said
Carey Cavanaugh, a representative from the State Department's
office of Soviet Union Affairs.
   The delegation is here ``just to get a general feel of the Salt
Lake area,'' Cavanaugh said.
   The delegates toured the Mormon Church's Temple Square in
downtown Salt Lake City on Wednesday and planned to visit mountain
canyons today.
   A three-member American delegation is in Votkinsk, about 600
miles east of Moscow in the Ural Mountains, for a simultaneous
visit.
   ``Both areas were identified on the Intermediate Nuclear Forces
treaty as areas where monitoring for the inspection of INF sites
could take place,'' Cavanaugh said.
   Both cities had previously been closed to diplomats from either
country.
   ``This is a very important treaty,'' Khripounov said when he
arrived at Salt Lake International Airport. ``We hope to look
around and see how people live. We'd like to see the cultural side
_ perhaps the world famous (Mormon Tabernacle) choir.''
   The delegation also planned to visit Magna, a suburb of 8,500
west of Salt Lake City and site of the Hercules Inc. Bacchus West
plant. The facility developed motors for the Pershing II missiles,
banned under the treaty, from 1979 to 1987.
   Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a compound near the
plant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty, signed Dec. 7 by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

   Maintaining peace in a troubled world is the most important
responsibility of government. Fortunately, during the past seven
years, our defense capabilities have been restored toward levels
more consistent with meeting our responsibility to provide an
environment safe and secure from aggression. Specifically, combat
readiness has been improved, and our forces have been modernized.
   The proposals for national security contained in this budget
represent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe and
honoring our commitments to our friends and allies. Anything less
would jeopardize not only our security _ and that of our friends
and allies _ but also would dim the prospects for further
negotiated agreements with our adversaries.
   As called for in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, my budget
requests defense funding of $299.5 billion in budget authority and
$294 billion in outlays for 1989. It also provides for about 2
percent real growth in these programs in future years. Also, as
called for in the agreement, my budget requests $18.1 billion in
budget authority for discretionary spending for international
affairs. This includes $8.3 billion in security assistance to
allied and friendly countries where the United States has special
security concerns.

<HEAD>NEEDED PROGRAMMATIC REFORMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Incentives: It is essential to continue to change the incentive
structure for many domestic federal programs to promote greater
efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This budget proposes to create
such needed incentives.
   Many federal programs offer payments without sufficient regard
for how well taxpayers' money is being spent. For example, farm
price support programs, under the Food Security Act of 1985, are
much too costly. I plan to continue pushing for the elimination of
artificially high price supports, thereby reducing the need for
export subsidies. In particular, I plan to propose amendments to
the act to modify the counterproductive sugar price support program
that currently poses significant problems in the areas of trade
policy, foreign policy and agricultural policy. The importance of
agricultural trade to the economic health of the farm sector and
the nation as a whole mandates increased reliance on free markets,
not government largess.
   The budget proposes certain reforms in the Medicare program in
order to achieve the savings agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget
Agreement. First, as justified by the results of several
independent studies, I propose to reduce the add-on payment for
teaching hospitals under the prospective payment system (PPS) for
indirect medical education from 7.70 percent to 4.05 percent, the
best estimate of the added costs incurred historically by teaching
hospitals. Second, I propose to limit Medicare overhead payments
for graduate medical education and make consistent varying
secondary payor enforcement mechanisms. To reduce escalating
supplementary medical insurance costs and help slow future
increases in beneficiary premiums, I propose to limit payments for
certain overpriced physician procedures, limit payments for durable
medical equipment and supplies, and eliminate a loophole in the
payment process for kidney dialysis. In total, these reforms would
reduce spending for Medicare by $1.2 billion from the level that
would occur if current law were continued. Spending for the
Medicare program would still increase by 7 percent from 1988 to
1989.

   Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, declaring
``I am free,'' today abandoned his faltering campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination but vowed to carry on his fight
for ``the politics of truth.''
   The first Democratic casualty of 1988, Babbitt said he was not
ready to endorse any of the six Democrats still in the race.
   After finishing fifth in Iowa and sixth in New Hampshire,
Babbitt's campaign for the Democratic nomination clearly had no
place to go.
   At a news conference, the former governor, whose wit had drawn
sympathetic coverage from the media said, drew laughter when he
said people had told him, ``You fought a good fight, you were in it
right up to the beginning.''
   ``I don't know why we fared no better,'' he went on. ``I'll
leave that for others to ponder.''
   Looking back on his campaign, Babbitt said, ``I can't say I
loved every minute of it, but I loved most of it.''
   He recalled the occasions during his campaign when he asked
people to stand up if they supported his call for candor,
especially his advocacy of a national sales tax to help reduce the
federal budget deficit.
   ``I'll never forget the people in audience after audience who
stood up out of their chair to join me in a demonstration of belief
for the politics of truth,'' he said.
   ``I stood up for what I believed in,'' he added. ``They stood up
for me. That's what this last year has been about. Because a
campaign is more than a candidate. A cause is more than a campaign.
This candidate is withdrawing. This campaign is closing down. But
the cause that it stood for has just begun.''
   In answering reporters' questions, Babbitt displayed the wit and
self-deprecating humor that characterized his campaign. Asked if he
would consider the vice-presidential spot, he replied, ``You
probably ought to select a vice-presidential candidate from a state
with more than seven electoral votes.''
   He added that if reincarnated he would try to be from the
neighboring delegate-rich state of Texas.
   Asked how the generally favorable press coverage he received
affected the race, Babbitt joked, ``You engaged in a deliberate
conspiracy to destroy my candidacy by making me into kind of a
house pet ... to destroy my credibility with the American people.''
   Addressing his party, which has lost four of the last five
presidential elections, Babbitt said, ``It is up to us to give our
country a compelling reason to elect us to power.''
   ``I'm going to wait and watch and do everything I can to insure
the success of our party,'' he said.
   The 48-year-old former Arizona governor spent Tuesday and
Wednesday consulting friends, supporters and family members about
his decision, which he planned to announce at a news conference
today.
   He said his two children urged him to ``stay in it as long as
you've got half a chance,'' while his wife Hattie contended
conversely that ``timing and grace are a big part of life and
politics.''
   ``There's a point at which you just don't emulate Harold Stassen
forever,'' he added in reference to the perennial Republican
presidential candidate from Minnesota.
   Babbitt finished sixth out of a seven-man field on Tuesday in
the New Hampshire primary, garnering 5 percent of the vote. Only
former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado received less.
   Babbitt's campaign is broke and contributions ``slowed to a
trickle'' after his fifth-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses
where he had staked virtually all of his resources, said campaign
spokesman Vada Manager.
   He said he would not endorse any of the other Democrats right
away, although Jesse Jackson has already sought his support.
   And Hart urged him to stay in the contest when the two spoke
Tuesday night, Babbitt said.
   ``He said, `You've got something to say. You're a courageous
guy. There's nothing shameful about losing.'''
   Furthermore, Babbitt said Hart noted that the large number of
candidate debates this year allows them to have a platform without
spending a lot of money.
   Babbitt is about $150,000 to $200,000 in debt, aides said.
Manager said donations ``slowed to a trickle'' after Babbitt's poor
showing in Iowa.
   But money was not the main problem, said Babbitt, noting in his
usual wry style, ``A lot of my friends are saying the money's never
been a problem. You never had any money, so why should you get
excited about not having any money now?''
   Babbitt approached his campaign with a non-traditional style
from the beginning, turning to unusual outdoor attention-getters
such as a bicycle ride across Iowa, an ascent of Mt. Washington in
New Hampshire, and a rugged cross-country ski tour in northern
Arizona.
   He attracted favorable press reviews for his candor, his wit,
and the depth of his economic proposals. Babbitt often poked fun at
himself and his low standing in the polls with such quips as,
``Nobody ever told me I was going to be a front-runner and so far I
have fulfilled that expectation.''
   He said his New Hampshire loss was not surprising after the Iowa
defeat, but that he had hoped to get at least 10 percent of the
vote.
   Asked to explain what went wrong in his campaign, which he
launched last March 10, Babbitt said:
   ``I would sum it up by saying this: When you have a new
messenger and a different and challenging message at the same time,
it's a hard sell.''
   Babbitt left open the possibility he might take another shot at
the presidency in 1992.
   ``It was a great try and I don't regret a minute of it,'' he
said. ``Who knows, maybe I'll ride back into town again.''

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced to 12 Years For Attempted Murder of Policemen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nathalie Menigon, a suspected member of the Direct
Action terrorist group, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison
for the attempted murder of two policemen in 1980.
   After deliberating for 35 minutes late Wednesday night, a
special criminal court panel of seven judges sentenced Ms. Menigon
for firing at the two policemen on Sept. 13, 1980, when they closed
in on her and her companion, Jean-Marc Rouillan. The policemen were
not killed.
   Prosecutor Daniel Barreyre had asked for a 15-year sentence.
   Ms. Menigon, 31, was the first of seven suspected Direct Action
members scheduled to be tried in the next two weeks for crimes
ranging from robbery to attempted murder.
   She, Rouillan and defendants Georges Cipriani and Joelle Aubron
have been on a hunger strike for 75 days to protest their isolation
in prison and to demand the right to receive more visitors. All
have been in the hospital section of Fresnes prison.
   The four are believed by authorities to be among the original
members of Direct Action, which claimed responsiblity for the
November 1986 assasination of French General Rene Audran in Paris
and the January 1985 slaying of Georges Besse, president of the
Renault company, in Yvelines, outside Paris.
   Those killings are still under investigation, and the current
trial deals with other crimes committed between 1980 and 1983.
   Ms. Menigon, pale and thin, entered the courtroom for the
opening of her trial Wednesday in a wheelchair and accompanied by
two nurses. She refused to answer questions, saying she was too
weak.
   She denounced the trial as ``the negation and theft of who I am,
of my identity as a militant communist revolutionary.''
   The seven defendants were convicted last week of the common
charge of criminal association and received varying sentences up to
10 years in prison.
   All the suspected top members of Direct Action were arrested
Feb. 21, 1987, at a Loire Valley farm. Authorities said the arrests
effectively put an end to the terrorist group.

   A Boston police detective died today after being shot during a
drug raid, San Francisco police killed a retarded boy who was
carrying a toy gun, and a Dallas officer killed a man who pointed a
gun at his partner.
   At St. Charles, Ill., a man who ``just kept shooting and
reloading'' in a residential neighborhood was in serious condition
today with gunshot wounds and two policemen also were hospitalized.
   In San Francisco, 13-year-old Artogi Groshe was hit by a single
bullet in the head Wednesday night.
   Officers Michael Huddleson and Janet Campbell saw the boy
walking down a street with what they believed was a .22-caliber
pistol, said Sgt. Jerome Senkir.
   The two crouched behind the doors of their patrol car ``with
their guns drawn and pointed'' when they were about 40 feet away,
he said.
   ``The suspect turned around with a gun in his hand, crouched
down and let out a loud scream,'' Senkir said. ``Both officers
opened fired.''
   Neighbor Frank Fua said Groshe ``played with the gun all the
time.''
   ``He waved it around and would point it at anything: buses,
trees, the water tower,'' said Fua, 19.
   Boston police Detective Sherman Griffiths was pronounced dead
today at Boston City Hospital, said police spokesman Jim Jordan.
   Griffiths, 36, and five other plainclothes officers went to an
apartment Wednesday night with a search warrant to look for illegal
drugs, said police spokesman Tom Santry.
   When they met resistance, they began to force their way into the
apartment, and two shots were fired from inside, Santry said.
Police did not return fire, he said. Five men in the apartment were
taken into custody for questioning, and one of them was charged in
the shooting, Santry said.
   Two Boston officers were wounded Jan. 29 during a drug
operation. An alleged cocaine dealer who turned a shotgun on an
officer was killed.
   Police in St. Charles, Ill., said Frank Gutierez, 38, carried a
shotgun and another weapon and fired shots wildly Wednesday night
in a neighborhood of homes and small businesses.
   ``He was just shooting at anything,'' said witness Nicholas
Sanchez Jr. ``He just kept shooting and reloading.''
   The first officer on the scene, Ron Brandenburg, was shot in the
foot and another officer, Jeff Finley, was shot in the neck, said a
dispatcher who wouldn't give her name.
   Two other officers shot Gutierez and subdued him, the dispatcher
said.
   Gutierez and Finley were in serious condition today, hospital
and police officals said. Brandenburg was in good condition.
   Two Dallas officers followed a suspicious car Wednesday night
and watched while one of three occupants got out and walked toward
a darkened house.
   The man then approached the officers' squad car, said Lt. Ron
Waldrop. The officers told investigators they got out of their car
and ordered the man to put his hands on the car.
   The man reached for his waistband, produced a gun and pointed it
at one of the officers, they told investigators.
   The other officer fired twice and the unidentified man was
pronounced dead at Baylor University Medical Center, Waldrop said.
A loaded pistol, its safety disengaged, was found nearby, police
said.
   It was the third fatal shooting by Dallas police this year.

<HEAD>French Report Destroying Mine in Gulf, Okinawa Leaves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French warship today found and
destroyed a drifting mine in the northern Persian Gulf, French
naval officials said. Mine-sweeping forces continued their
withdrawal from the waterway.
   In London, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit withdrew its
report that a Japanese cargo vessel had struck a mine off the
United Arab Emirates, saying it now appeared that the ship may have
collided with a recently sunken freighter.
   The U.S. helicopter carrier Okinawa headed down the gulf to
return to the United States with the four helicopter mine sweepers
sent to the region last August.
   The RH-53D Sea Stallions, originally eight in number, spent six
months searching for mines ahead of convoys of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti
tankers. Although they found none, the aircraft accomplished their
mission of protecting the convoys, U.S. officers say.
   The Kuwait news agency quoted French naval officials in Paris as
saying the corvette Montcalm today had used gunfire to destroy an
``old mine'' earlier found floating in the northern gulf.
   It gave no other details, but it appeared the mine may have been
one previously spotted by Saudi Arabia's navy several days ago. The
mine sank and was lost, the Saudis reported.
   The French said it brought to 11 the number of mines, all
believed laid by Iran, that its navy had found and destroyed in
recent months.
   Lloyd's said the 4,842-ton auto carrier Prosper World, which
suffered mysterious damage to its bottom while sailing off Dubai on
Wednesday, may have struck the submerged superstructure of the
Greek-owned motor vessel Mare.
   The 15,241-ton, Panamanian-flag freighter sank in 50 feet of
water off the port of Jebel Ali on Feb. 4 while being towed to a
shipyard. It had been gutted by fire in an Iranian gunboat attack,
then abandoned by its crew, five days earlier.
   Shipping executives said divers found the hull of the Prosper
World had been damaged, possibly by running aground. They ruled out
a mine as the cause.
   The Okinawa, the first major ship to be withdrawn from the
navy's gulf-based Middle East Force since last summer's emergency
buildup of forces to counter the threat of Iranian attacks, was
heading for home port at San Diego.
   Its departure will eventually scale down the force from 17 to 16
ships, including six ocean minesweepers that arrived in November to
replace the helicopters.
   The battleship Iowa and two other ships were withdrawn earlier
from the U.S. task force operating in the Arabian Sea outside the
gulf, in support of the navy's escort operations.
   The five European navies that also sent a total of 14 mine
sweepers to the gulf are now in the process of cutting back those
forces by about half.

   Although the provision of needed legal services for those who
cannot afford them is an important goal in our society, the current
system earmarks a large portion of the funding to ``National and
State Support Centers'' that have been critized for political
involvement. I urge Congress to disallow use of federal funds for
such ``think tanks'' and limit the use of funds to the direct
assistance of the poor in need of legal aid.
   The government often continues programs at the federal level
that are no longer needed. This is the case with rural housing
programs, the Economic Development Administration, urban mass
transit discretionary grants, urban development action grants,
sewage treatment, Small Business Administration direct loans,
housing development action grants, the housing rehabilitation loan
program, and economic development programs of the Tennessee Valley
Authority. Efforts to reverse this situation have been undertaken
by prior administrations as well as my own, but the limited results
to date indicate the difficulty of curbing excessive government
involvement in these areas.
   Regulatory Relief: For seven years I have worked to reduce the
excess burdens of government regulation for all Americans _ working
men and women, consumers, businesses and state and local
governments. As a result, various departments and agencies have
reduced the scope and costs of federal regulation. Federal approval
of experimental drugs has been expedited, making them available to
treat serious or life-threatening diseases when other treatments do
not work. Excessive burdens on state and local governments are
being lifted. Access to goods and services has been made easier,
and at less cost. Federal reporting requirements on individuals and
businesses have been eased, as well as the paperwork burden on
those who wish to compete for contracts with the federal
government. Under the leadership of the Presidential Task Force on
Regulatory Relief, headed by the vice president, the administration
will continue these and other efforts to lessen the burden of
excessive government regulation.
   As a case in point, my budget proposes termination of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, contingent upon enactment of
legislation that completes deregulation of the motor carrier
industry. There is no justification for continued economic (as
opposed to safety) regulation of surface transportation, and there
is a substantial argument against it. As a result of economic
deregulation of trucking and railroads, consumers save tens of
billions of dollars each year, and the industry is healthier, more
innovative and better able to adapt to changing economic
circumstances. This is no time to turn back the clock.
   Privatization: The government and the private sector should do
what each does best. The federal government should not be involved
in providing goods and services where private enterprise can do the
jobs cheaper and@or better. In some cases, the fact that no private
provider exists is a reflection of government policy to prohibit
competition _ as with first class mail service. In other cases, an
absence of private providers reflects a government policy of
providing large subsidies _ as with uranium enrichment. Invariably,
the taxpayer ends up paying more for less.

   Accordingly, my budget proposes that a number of federal
enterprises be transferred back to the private sector, through
public offerings or outright sales. Following our successful sale
of Conrail and auctioning of $5 billion in selected loan
portfolios, I am proposing the sale not only of the Naval Petroleum
Reserves, but also of the Alaska Power Administration, the federal
government's helium program, excess real property and a further $12
billion in loan portfolios. In addition, I have proposed
legislation to authorize a study of possible divestiture of the
Southeastern Power Administration, and plan to study possible
privatization of our uranium enrichment facilities, as well as ways
of making the U.S. Postal Service more efficient through greater
reliance on the private sector. Such ``privatization'' efforts
continue to be a high priority of this administration, and I look
forward to acting on the final recommendations of the Privatization
Commission, which I established last September.
   Privatization does not necessarily imply abrogation of
government responsibility for these services. Rather, it recognizes
that what matters is the service provided, not who provides it.
Government has an inherent tendency to become too big, unwieldy,
and inefficient; and to enter into unfair competition with the
private sector.
   The federal government should also depend more on the private
sector to provide ancillary and support services for activities
that remain in federal hands. Therefore, I am proposing the
development of a private mediating institution to reduce the
backlog of cases before the U.S. Tax Court. I propose that the
private sector be relied upon for booking functions for
concessional food programs. I also encourage the complete
privatization of wastewater treatment plants, certain mass transit
projects, the Department of Agriculture's National Finance Center
and the Rural Telephone Bank.
   In addition, our administration plans to initiate privatization
and commercialization efforts involving federal prison industries,
relying on a private space facility for micro-gravity research
opportunities in the early 1990's, commercial cargo inspection,
military commissaries, Coast Guard buoy maintenance and the
management of undeveloped federal land. Moreover, my budget
proposes that the work associated with certain federal employment
positions be reviewed for the feasibility of contracting their
responsibilities out to the private sector as yet another way to
increase productivity, reduce costs and improve services.
   One of the best ways to test the worth of a governmental program
or a particular project is to shift some of the cost of that
program or project to the direct beneficiaries. We have done that,
for example, with water resources development projects. As a
result, local sponsors and users choose to proceed only on the
projects that are most important and most cost effective.

   A man riding home after a batting-practice
session in the park was fatally shot by a motorist angry because he
thought the man's car was not going fast enough, authorities said.
   The shooting recalled last summer's rash of shootings on roads
when hot-heads turned to weapons to air their grievances with other
motorists. Five people were killed and more than a dozen injured.
One man was left paralyzed.
   Kurt Runge, 23, of Sun Valley, died today, 2{ hours after the
10:10 p.m. shooting in North Hollywood, said police Sgt. Steve
Millarr.
   Runge had been practicing at a baseball batting cage at Castle
Park in Van Nuys, said Detective Mike Coffey. He was heading home
with a friend when a motorist behind their car became angry.
   ``The suspect drove next to the victim and shot at them for
driving too slowly,'' Millarr said.
   The driver, a childhood friend of Runge, said he heard about
three shots. Runge was shot in the chest.
   Police believe the shots were fired from a white, early 1980s
model Chevrolet Caprice carrying two men.
   ``Detectives have information that a light-colored van and
additional vehicles were traveling near the victim's vehicle and
possibly witnessed the event,'' Millarr said.
   Last week, an armed motorist apparently became angered when a
car stalled in front of him at a Tustin intersection and shot at
the stopped auto, critically injuring a passenger, police said.
   Three men recently went on trial in three of the summer
shootings. Two testified they meant to scare other drivers.
   On Wednesday, Margarito Leyva, 27, of Newhall was acquitted of
attempted murder and other felonies in an August shooting involving
a California Highway Patrol officer. But he was convicted of
possessing a firearm in a vehicle and possessing a concealed weapon.
   He faces a maximum six-month jail term when sentenced March 2,
said Public Defender James M. Coady.

   Management Improvements: As we all know, the federal government
has a major effect upon our daily lives through the direct delivery
of services, the payment of financial assistance through various
entitlement programs, the collection of taxes and fees and the
regulation of commercial enterprises. As the 21st century
approaches, the federal government must adapt its role in our
society to meet changing demands arising from changing needs and
requirements. At the turn of the century, the U.S. population will
exceed 268 million, with a greater proportion of elderly requiring
more specialized services. The nation will operate at a much faster
pace as changes in technology and communication link the world's
economies, trade, capital flows and travel as never before.
   I have asked the Office of Domestic Affairs and the Office of
Management and Budget to work with the President's Council on
Management Improvement to conduct an in-depth review and recommend
to me by this August what further adjustments in the federal role
should be made to prepare for the challenge of government in the
21st century. This summer I will receive their report, ``Government
of the Future.'' I also intend to complete the ``Reform '88''
management improvement program I started six years ago to ovwerhaul
the administrative, financial and credit systems in our federal
government; to implement productivity and quality plans in each
agency; and to examine the needs of the federal work force of the
future. I want to leave a legacy of good management of today's
programs, with plans in place to handle tomorrow's challenges.
   Efforts to improve the management of the federal government must
be continued. We have all heard stories of the horrible waste that
occurs in the federal government. Some of it is obvious _ like the
billions of dollars in unneeded projects that were included in the
thousand-page 1988 spending bill that was dropped on my desk last
December. Some are not obvious _ like the billion dollars in
unnecessary interest expense the government paid, year after year,
because it lacked a cash management system, or the billions of
dollars lost annually for lack of a credit management process to
ensure collection of the trillion dollars in loans owed the federal
government.
   In July 1980, I promised the American people: ``I will not
accept the excuse that the federal government has grown ... beyond
the control of any president, administration or Congress ... we are
going to put an end to the notion that the American taxpayer exists
to fund the federal government. The federal government exists to
serve the American people ... I pledge my administration will do
that.'' I have delivered on that promise.
   The first step was taken within months after my inauguration
when I formed the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency,
composed of the agency inspectors general. By the time I leave
office, they will have delivered savings of over $110 billion in
reduced waste, fraud and abuse to the American people.
   Then, in March 1982, I initiated the world's largest management
improvement program with these words: ``With Reform '88 we're going
to streamline and reorganize the processes that control the money,
information, personnel and property of the federal bureaucracy.'' I
told my cabinet at that time that ``we have six years to change
what it took twenty or thirty to create _ and we came to Washington
to make changes!'' I have followed up on that commitment. The
President's Council on Management Improvement has overseen this
effort, and is generating significant results.

   A woman whose husband won more than
$700,000 in the California lottery last month was found dead in her
home with her throat slit, authorities said today.
   A 10-month-old boy found in the house unharmed was believed to
be the woman's son, said San Diego County sheriff's Sgt. Bob
Ramirez. Several other children in the family were not home.
   The body of Ann Marie Jenkins, whose throat had been cut, was
discovered Wednesday afternoon, Ramirez said.
   Mrs. Jenkins' husband, Gary, told authorities he returned home
from work and found his wife's fully clothed body in a hall,
Ramirez said.
   Jenkins won $727,165 in the lottery on Jan. 13, taking home
$581,732 after taxes, said Lottery spokesman John Schade.
   There were no signs of a robbery or break-in, said Ramirez, and
the sheriff's office was investigating a motive. Jenkins was not
being held, the sergeant said.

   A bill to allow youngsters to have
lemonade stands and sell snacks without a license was prompted
after the ``big, bad Health Department'' shut down several
children's stands at a jamboree.
   The bill cleared the House today on a 94-0 vote and now goes to

goods, soft drinks and other refreshments at public events without
a license or permit as long as they didn't run the stands more than
three times a year.
   The bill was amended to include a provision to allow inspections
of the stands.
   The sponsor, Frank Buck, said some children, including his own,
had lemonade stands and sold cookies at Smithville's annual
fiddlers jamboree, but were shut down.
   ``The big, bad Health Depeartment came by and put them out of
business,'' he said.

   U.S. industry operated at 82.2 percent of
capacity in January, matching the December level as the highest
operating rate in almost eight years, the government said today.
   The Federal Reserve said that further growth in the operating
rate was held back last month by cutbacks in steel and automobile
production.
   The last time that American industry operated at higher than
82.2 percent of capacity was in March 1980, when production was at
83.7 percent of capacity.
   During the 1981-82 recession, the operating rate fell below 70
percent. The operating rate climbed to 81.8 percent in August of
1984 as the country pulled out of the recession. However,
manufacturers in many industries laid off workers and closed plants
in 1985 and 1986 as foreign competition cut into sales.
   The Reagan administration began a campaign in 1985 to force the
value of the dollar lower in an effort to make American products
competitive once again on overseas markets.
   That effort began reaping benefits last year with the operating
rate rising by 2.4 percentgage points in 1987. By contrast,
operating rates had fallen by 0.9 percentage point in 1986.
   The administration, which today released its latest economic
forecast as part of its 1989 budget, is counting on a resurgent
manufacturing sector to keep the country out of a recession during
this presidential election year.
   Many private economists, however, believe that growth will slow
considerably, especially during the early part of 1988, as
businesses cut back on orders in an effort to work down high levels
of unsold goods.
   Economists said the January report on factory use showed that
process had already begun.
   The operating rate in the auto industry dropped by 1.2
percentage points in January to 76.7 percent of capacity. It was
the third consecutive monthly decline after auto plants hit an
operating rate of 82 percent in October.
   Steel and other makers of primary metals saw their operating
rates drop to 89.6 percent of capacity last month, down from 91.2
percent in December.
   For all of manufacturing, the operating rate was unchanged at
82.4 percent of capacity. Producers of durable goods, such as steel
and autos, saw operating rates decline to an average of 79.9
percent of capacity, 0.1 percentage point below the December level.
Makers of non-durable goods saw operating rates rise by 0.1
percentage point to 86.1 percent of capacity.
   The mining industry, which has been hardhit by declines in oil
prices, had a 0.3 percentage point drop in the operating rate to
80.2 percent of capacity.
   This was offset, however, by a 0.9 percentage point increase in
the operating rate at utility companies, which rose to 81.6 percent
in January. The big gain was attributed to unusually severe winter
weather which boosted heating demands.

   Nude drawings of women that county
officials ordered removed from a courthouse gallery cannot be
barred from the exhibit, a federal judge ruled today.
   Judge Edwin M. Kosik's order allows the works by artist Joseph
Ray to be hung immediately, and they could be put back up today,
said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Stefan Presser.
   ``This is what makes us different from the Soviet Union. We're
not supposed to have Big Brother saying, `You can look at
landscapes, and you can't look at nudes,''' Presser said.
   Ray, an East Stroudsburg artist and psychology professor, hung
the nudes in a display of 50 charcoal drawings Feb. 5. The show at
the courthouse lasts until Feb. 26.
   Monroe County commissioners and President Judge James R. Marsh
objected to the nudes, and Ray agreed to remove them because he did
not want to jeopardize the rest of the exhibit. But he sued county
officials.
   Ray argued that his rights under the First and 14th amendments
were violated when his paintings were barred from public display.
   Kosik, ruling after a half-hour hearing, said the Fred M. Waring
Gallery in the courthouse was well-established and could not be
censored. County officials established the gallery about 10 years
ago.
   ``They have indeed elected to enlighten or otherwise to open the
public court as a designated forum ... for the display of art,''
Kosik said.
   Daniel M. Corveleyn, assistant county solicitor, had argued the
art should be screened because people often had to pass the gallery
for court business and not by choice.
   He later said the commissioners would not appeal the ruling.
   Ray sought unspecified damages, but that was not addressed in
Kosik's ruling.

   These efforts are described in greater detail in my Management
Report, which is being submitted concurrently. They can succeed
only if all federal managers and employees work together.
Therefore, I propose in this budget a new approach to paying
federal employees who increase their productivity. I ask the
Congress to modify the current system of virtually automatic
``within-grade'' pay increases for the roughly 40 percent of
employees eligible each year to one that is based on employee
performance. This will give federal employees stronger incentives
to improve service delivery and reduce costs to the taxpayer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE BUDGET PROCESS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As I have stressed on numerous occasions, the current budget
process is clearly unworkable and desperately needs a drastic
overhaul. Last year, as in the year before, the Congress did not
complete action on a budget until well past the beginning of the
fiscal year. Th Congress missed every deadline it had set for
itself just 9 months earlier. In the end, the Congress passed a
year-long, 1,057-page omnibus $605 billion appropriations bill with
an accompanying conference report of 1,053 pages and a
reconciliation bill 1,186 pages long. Members of Congress had only
3 hours to consider all three items. Congress should not pass
another massive continuing resolution _ and as I said in the State
of the Union address, if they do I will not sign it.
   I am asking for a constitutional amendment that mandates a
balanced budget and forces the federal government to live within
its means. A constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget
_ and a provision requiring a super-majority vote in the Congress
to increase taxes _ would impose some much-needed discipline on the
congressional budget process. Ninety-nine percent of Americans live
in states that require a balanced state budget, and a total of 32
states already have passed resolutions calling for a convention for
the purpose of proposing a balanced budget amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
   Also, I am asking the Congress for a line-item veto, so that my
successors could reach into massive appropriation bills such as the
last one, cut out the waste, and enforce budget discipline.
Forty-three state governors have a line-item veto; the president
should have this power as well. As governor of the state of
California (1967-1975), I used the line-item veto 943 times. The
California State legislature upheld each of these vetoes, even
though both Houses were controlled by the opposition party.
   In addition, I propose the following further reforms to the
budget process:
   (1) Joint budget resolution. The budget process has so
degenerated in recent years that the presidential budget is
routinely discarded and the congressional budget resolution is
regularly disregarded. As a remedy, I propose that henceforth the
Congress and the Executive collaborate on a joint resolution that
sets out spending priorities within the receipts available. The
requirement of a presidential signature would force both branches
of government to resolve policy differences before appropriations
measures must be formulated. The budget process could be further
improved by including in the budget law allocations by committee as
well as by budget function.
   (2) Individual transmittal of appropriation bills. The current
practice of transmitting full-year continuing resolutions skirts
appropriations committee-subcommittee jurisdictions. More
importantly, it does not permit the legislative and executive
branches to exercise proper scrutiny of federal spending.
Therefore, I propose a requirement that appropriations bills be
transmitted individually to the president.

   Former Black Panther Johnny Spain, one of the
San Quentin Six involved in a 1971 prison shootout, must remain in
prison pending a hearing on his request for parole in an unrelated
murder, a judge ruled.
   Spain, 38, had already served five years of a life sentence for
murder-robbery at the time of the escape attempt at the San Quentin
state prison in which three guards and three prisoners were killed.
   At Wednesday's hearing in Superior Court, Spain's attorney,
Dennis Riordan, argued that parole authorities have refused to
apply normal standards for release to Spain's original
murder-robbery sentence to punish him for his role in the 1971
shootout.
   The attorney argued that authorites have unfairly taken the San
Quentin shootout into account when considering parole, against the
orders of the judge who reversed the conviction and despite a
prison record he described as exemplary.
   Riordan was seeking Spain's release on bail pending a ruling on
his request that the convict be paroled for a 1966 murder-robbery
in Los Angeles.
   Superior Judge Kathleen Parker denied bail, telling Riordan she
didn't have authority to grant it. But she scheduled a full hearing
March 1 on the parole request.
   Spain was convicted of two counts of murder in the prison
shootout, but the conviction was overturned.
   On Feb. 11, a three-member panel of the state Board of Prison
Terms voted to free Spain after he serves an additional 16 months
of the original murder-robbery sentence, bringing the total time
served on his life term to 23 years.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Riordan maintained the average sentence
in such cases is 10 years and the longest a Californian other than
Spain has been imprisoned on a similar conviction is 20 years.

<HEAD>Remaining Molestation Charge Against Ex-Day Care Worker Dropped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because parents of a child who was
allegedly molested will not participate in a trial, a federal judge
dismissed the final molestation charge against a former Presidio
Army base day care worker.
   U.S. District William Schwarzer took the action Wednesday after
the U.S. Attorney's Office learned the parents no longer were
willing to participate in the April 4 trial.
   Schwarzer dismissed the single charge that remained against Gary
Hambright, 34.
   U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said investigators will
continue examining evidence and his staff will ``see if there's not
some way to put together a salvageable case that can be
prosecuted.''
   That presented a less-optimistic picture than was offered last
week by two assistant U.S. attorneys, who vowed to return to a
federal grand jury seeking new indictments against Hambright on
more specific molestation charges after Schwarzer dismissed six
charges because of vagueness.
   Hambright once faced 11 molestation charges involving 10
children. Five counts contained in four charges were dismissed
later when the government said there were evidentiary problems.
Hambright's case has been presented to a grand jury twice.
   He had been charged in January 1987 with molesting a 2-year-old
boy at the day care center but was freed when the boy was found
incapable of testifying and the judge refused to allow second-hand
reports of his statements.
   His indictment again last October triggered an investigation
that resulted in the examination of almost 100 children from the
day care center for signs of physical or psychological abuse.

<HEAD>Magazine Publisher Says Impossible to Know Intent of Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of Soldier of Fortune, defending
the magazine against a lawsuit by a slain woman's family, says he
had no way of knowing a classified advertisement in the journal
would lead to the woman's death.
   The family is seeking $22.5 million from the magazine, accusing
it of negligence for publishing the ad that brought Robert Black
together with John Wayne Hearn and led to the murder-for-hire of
Black's wife, Sandra.
   ``I have no idea what's in the minds of people who place those
ads,'' Publisher Robert Brown testified Wednesday.
   The Bryan woman was shot to death in 1985. Her husband is on
Texas' death row for paying Hearn $10,000 to carry out the killing.
Hearn is serving three life terms in Florida for murder.
   Marjorie Einmann, Mrs. Black's mother, and Gary Black, the
victim's 18-year-old son, are seeking $2.5 million in actual
damages and $20 million in punitive damages from the Colorado-based
magazine.
   Hearn's ad appeared in four issues in late 1984, seeking former
Marine and Vietnam veterans and weapons specialists with jungle
warfare expertise for ``high risk assignments'' in the United
States or overseas.
   ``I never expected anyone to be so stupid to advertise in
Soldier of Fortune their intent to do criminal enterprise,'' said
Brown.
   Under questioning by plaintiff's attorney Ron Franklin, Brown
reviewed more than two dozen classified ads run in the magazine up
to 1984. Many of the ads sought or advertised the services of
self-proclaimed mercenaries, weapons specialists, explosives
experts and mechanics, a term Franklin said was synonymous with
hired killers.
   Brown said a ``mechanic'' in a ``high risk assignment'' also
could mean someone who could fix a helicopter overseas.
   Hearn said in a deposition read into testimony Wednesday that
his ad brought responses from people who were looking for help with
bombings, assaults, jail breaks and killings.
   He said Black first contacted him about the sale of a gun
collection and at their first meeting suggested he needed help to
kill his wife.
   After several discussions, Hearn said he killed Mrs. Black in
February 1985 by shooting her twice in the head at her house.
   In response to a question whether Soldier of Fortune or its
publisher were responsible for his illegal activities, he replied:
``If I had never run an ad in Soldier of Fortune ... I would have
never killed anyone.''
   Attorneys for the magazine do not dispute the magazine ad
brought Hearn and Black together, but they insist Brown had no way
of knowing the ad was for illegal activity.
   Magazine attorney Larry Thompson said the magazine was focused
on Vietnam veterans and the classified ads were run as a source of
employment for them, but also appealed to military historians and
people who like adventure.
   According to Hearn, whose deposition was taken last October, the
ad he placed was intended to attract bodyguard and security work.

   (3) Strict observance of allocations. During the 1980s, an
unacceptable budget practice evolved within the Congress of
disregarding congressionally approved function allocations. Funds
regularly were shifted from defense or international affairs to
domestic spending. I strongly urge that each fiscal year separate
national security and domestic allocations be made and enforced
through a point of order provision in the Budget Act.
   (4) Enhanced rescission authority. Under current law, the
president may propose rescissions of budget authority, but both
Houses of Congress must act ``favorably'' for the rescission to
take effect. In 1987, not a single rescission was enacted, or even
voted on, before expiration of the 45-day deadline. I propose a
change of law that would require the Congress to vote ``up or
down'' on any presidentially proposed rescission, thereby
preventing the Congress from ducking the issue by simply ignoring
the proposed rescission and avoiding a recorded vote.
   (5) Biennial budgeting. The current budget process consumes too
much time and energy. A two-year budget cycle offers several
advantages _ among them, a reduction in repetitive annual budget
tasks, more time for consideration of key spending decisions in
reconciliation, and less scope for gimmicks such as shifting
spending from one year to the next. I call on the Congress to adopt
biennial budgeting.
   (6) Truth in federal spending. _ As part of my Economic Bill of
Rights, I will shortly transmit legislation that will require any
future legislation creating new federal programs to be
deficit-neutral. In addition to requiring the concurrent enactment
of equal amounts of program reductions or revenue increases, my
proposal would require that all future legislation and regulations
be accompanied by financial impact statements, including the effect
on state and local governments.
   Adoption of these reforms should enable the federal government
to make informed decisions in a deliberate fashion that fosters
rational priorities. The American people deserve no less from their
elected representatives.

<BYLINE>CONCLUSION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking back over the past seven years we can feel a sense of
pride in our accomplishments. Important tasks remain, however. The
large and stubbornly persistent budget deficit has been a major
source of frustration. It threatens our prosperity and our hopes
for lessening the burden on future generations.
   Two years ago, the legislative and executive branches of
government responded to this threat by enacting the G-R-H Act,
which mandated gradual, orderly progress toward a balanced budget
over the next several years. My budget achieves the 1989 target of
the amended act while preserving legitimate programs for the aged
and needy, providing for adequate national security, devoting more
resources to other high-priority activities and doing so without
raising taxes.
   My budget also embodies the Bipartisan Budget Agreement reached
last November. In presenting this budget, I am keeping my end of
the bargain. I call upon the Congress to uphold its end _ by
ensuring that appropriations and other legislation are in full
accord with the agreement. By exercising this measure of restraint
and self-discipline, we can secure great benefits for the nation: a
lower budget deficit, reduced demand on credit markets, more stable
financial markets, a steadily declining trade deficit, and
continued prosperity with non-inflationary growth. And, by
reforming the budget process, the Congress can improve its
decisionmaking and garner the thanks of a grateful public. Surely,
these are small prices for what is at stake.

   George Bush flew to Missouri today for
the first campaign stop since his big New Hampshire primary
victory, saying he wouldn't change his recent grass-roots strategy
and quickly visiting a truck stop to prove it.
   Not long after arriving on Air Force Two at Springfield Airport
northwest of here, the vice president had his motorcade pull over
for a stop at Sto's Auto and Truck Plaza.
   Sticking with the strategy that had him visiting plants and
driving heavy equipment in New Hampshire, Bush visited the Tin
Lizzie Restaurant at the truck stop, passed out vice presidential
tie clips and bought two coffees.
   Accompanied by Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., Bush asked a woman,
``You gonna vote for this guy? Then vote for his friend. He's for
me.''
   Wending his way around the dining booths, Bush told another
woman, ``Thought you were going to have a quiet cup of coffee,
didn't you?''
   On his arrival at the Springfield airport, Bush was greeted by a
small but enthusiastic crowd as a school band played in a steady
rain.
   ``Proud to be back. We're going to keep talking about the
issues,'' he said in a brief airport talk. ``I don't have to change
one iota. The message that won in New Hampshire is a good message
for the entire United States.''
   One day earlier, in Washington, Bush brushed aside Sen. Bob
Dole's complaints about Bush's campaign statements.
   ``Talk about the issues. Keep it on a high plane,'' Bush said in
response to Dole's accusation that he distorted the senator's
record in New Hampshire campaign advertising.
   Bush said Wednesday he didn't think his 9-point victory over the
Kansas senator in the GOP primary was a fluke, although he said he
will ``take nothing for granted'' in the coming Southern and
border-state contests.
   In Missouri, he was scheduled to speak at high schools in
Monnett and Friestatt before traveling to Joplin to attend the
``Ozark Jubilee'' festival before heading to Texas.
   The vice president, while deflecting criticism of the negative
ads he ran in the waning days of the New Hampshire campaign, told
reporters Wednesday he wanted to focus on issues, rather than
personalities.
   ``You all want me to talk about Senator Dole. I want to talk
about the issues,'' he said. ``You want to talk about history. I
want to talk about the future.''
   Bush sidestepped any detailed response to Dole's charge that the
vice president had misstated his positions on tax increases, an oil
import fee, and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   Asked point-blank whether he had lied about Dole's record, the
vice president replied, ``I think I said it wasn't true. ... I'm
not going to dwell on it. You see, I don't want to be drawn into
something like that.''
   Dole on Wednesday portrayed Bush and his campaign aides as the
hatchet men of the GOP presidential campaign. ``You're seeing a
mean George Bush,'' he said, and promised to swing back if attacked
again.
   Bush, during remarks to campaign staff workers at his national
headquarters here, promised that he would hew closely to the
new-look, grass roots-style campaign strategy he used in New
Hampshire as he seeks support in the the Super Tuesday primaries
and caucuses on March 8.
   On that day, 16 states or territories will be holding Republican
primaries or caucuses, with more than 700 delegates at stake.
   ``We stayed on those issues (in New Hampshire). We don't have to
change a single thing,'' the vice president said.
   Bush is scheduled to campaign in Oklahoma City, Okla. on Friday,
before returning to Dallas to prepare for the GOP candidate debate
there.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed legislation
designating Tuesday of this week as Lithuanian Independence Day,
saying the United States will never recognize the ``forcible
incorporation'' of Lithuania into the Soviet Union.
   In a proclamation signed last week, Reagan said Lithuania
enjoyed ``political and religious freedom for all citizens''
following its declaration of independence on Feb. 16, 1918.
   ``Then, in June 1940, the year after the signing of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union invaded and illegally
occupied Lithuania and the other Baltic States,'' the president
said.
   ``The United States unequivocally condemned this violation of
national sovereignty and national integrity, and ever since then
our policy has remained consistent. We have never recognized the
forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union, and we
never will,'' Reagan said.
   Police and civilian auxiliary officers prevented Lithuanians
from celebrating the 70th anniversaru of their short-lived
independence on Tuesday, and activists said four Lithuanian
nationalists were put under house arrest.
   Thirty-two U.S. senators have written to Soviet Leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev asking him not to interfere with planned
demonstrations and religious services this week in the Soviet
republics of Lithuania and Eastonia.

   The father of Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins died today, one day after Higgins was abducted in Lebanon.
   William F. Higgins, 72, died at 7:45 a.m. of heart failure at
Humana Hospital Audubon, said hospital spokeswoman Donna Hazle.
   He had been hospitalized with congestive heart failure, and his
son came home in September on emergency leave from the Middle East
to see him. The Marine's mother died in April 1979.
   The younger Higgins' family had been trying to reach him with
news that his father was near death when they learned of his
kidnapping.
   ``We're very saddened. It's a double shot here, you might say,''
said Harold Fisher, who is married to Higgins' sister, Mary. ``It's
been very trying times because we've been here at the hospital off
and on for two weeks. Then we hear this. If one thing's bad, two is
worse.''
   Mary Fisher told WHAS-TV that she called Higgins' wife, Marine
Maj. Robin Higgins, in Woodbridge, Va., on Wednesday to get him
home from Lebanon as soon as possible so he could see his father
before he died. That's when Mrs. Fisher learned of the abduction.
   Mrs. Higgins, who works in the Pentagon's public affairs office,
was informed of her husband's disappearance by the State Department
about 9 a.m. Wednesday.
   Mrs. Higgins and daughter Chrissy, 17, are ``hanging in there
real well,'' said Navy Cmdr. Robert Prucha, a co-worker of Mrs.
Higgins at the Pentagon. The two are ``tough ladies.''
   Higgins' wife and daughter did not talk to reporters outside
their home Wednesday. Prucha said Mrs. Higgins would continue to
work full-time. ``She's going to continue to do what she does on a
daily basis,'' he said.
   The Pentagon said Higgins, 43, was on temporary detail serving
as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's Lebanon
Observer Group.
   U.N. sources said Higgins was kidnapped Wednesday on the coastal
highway between Lebanon's southernmost port of Tyre and the border
town of Naqoura, site of the U.N. force's headquarters. Higgins was
the only U.S. military person in Lebanon allowed to travel alone
and freely in the area.
   Higgins' uncle, Delbert Eagle of Lancaster, said he expects his
nephew will act like an officer and a gentleman.
   ``He loves his country. ... I don't think they could bring
enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any
way. I think he would die first,'' said Eagle, 86, a former circuit
court judge.
   Fisher said the father is too ill to understand what happened to
his son.
   ``The man has not opened his eyes in a couple of days. There's
no way he could be able to comprehend, although he may be able to
hear,'' he said.
   Higgins' family lived in central Kentucky when he was born in
nearby Danville and later moved to Louisville, where he graduated
from Southern High School in 1963.
   After graduating from Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC
scholarship in 1967, Higgins earned masters' degrees in human
resources management at Pepperdine University in California and in
political science at Auburn in Alabama.
   He fought in Vietnam in 1968 and 1972, served as a rifle company
commander in Japan and North Carolina and in various staff
positions at the Marine Corps headquarters in Washington and the
Pentagon. He graduated from the National War College in 1985.

   The United States and Madagascar
signed a $2.2 million agreement for a five-year national infant
health vaccination program, the government announced Thursday.
   The program, financed with a grant from the United States Agency
for International Development, is aimed at reducing infant
mortality in Madagascar, an island nation in the Indian Ocean off
the eastern coast of Africa. Madagascar's infant mortality rate was
109 per 1,000 births in 1985, according to the World Bank.
   The island nation has a population of 10.6 million, growing at
2.8 percent a year.
   The project will be administered by the United Nations Children
Fund to vaccinate 7 million children ages 1-4, and 2.1 million
children over 5. They will be vaccinated against tetanus,
diptheria, measles and whooping cough.
   The program will also provide preventive malaria medicine and
vaccination against tetanus for 2 million pregnant women.

   Three Soviet satellites designed to test space
navigation equipment failed to reach proper orbit and burned up in
the atmosphere, Tass said Thursday.
   Tass said Cosmos 1917, 1918 and 1919 were launched Wednesday,
but on Thursday ``entered dense layers of the atmosphere and ceased
their existence.''
   The booster rocket placed the separation unit holding the
satellites on an interim orbit, but the system then malfunctioned
and the satellites fell from orbit, Tass said.
   In August, Tass announced that a 10-ton satellite had failed to
reach orbit. The report apparently was the first time Soviets
announced beforehand that one of its satellites was dropping from
orbit.
   That satellite fell into the ocean without causing any damage or
injuries.

   _The Guardian (liberal):``If you are counting the odds at this
stage, you may still feel (Bob) Dole a good bet for the Republican
nomination; but the prospect of a hung Democratic convention and a
good deal of brokering around the third ballot grows rather closer,

exhausted by fighting internally that it forgets that the point of
the process doesn't come until November.''

   _Vittorio Zucconi, commenting La Repubblica of Rome
(left-leaning): ``The state of Massachusetts, which about 28 years
ago proposed to America the first Catholic president in its
history, is putting another challenge before the nation: the first
candidate with a `foreign' name. The year 1988, which could have
been the year of the Italo-American (Mario) Cuomo, is becoming the
year of the Greek-American (Michael) Dukakis. ... The human comedy
of the campaign has found a new protagonist in the 50-year-old
`Zorba' from Boston.''

   _The Australian (independent, national): ``It now seems that the
Republican nominee will be either Mr. Bush or Sen. Dole. The
vice-president has made a remarkable recovery but he also won New
Hampshire in 1980 over Mr. Reagan, who went on to win finally in a
sweeping victory.
   ``Gov. Dukakis ... won little more than one-third of the votes
in a state that borders his own Massachusetts. This must mean that
the outcome of the Democratic contest is still wide open, even
though some of the early starters will not remain to the end, and
the possibility that the Democratic Party will draft Gov. Mario
Cuomo of New York cannot be put out of the question.''
   _Sydney Morning Herald (independent): Bush's ``victory alone is
unlikely to arrest the momentum of his leading rival, Sen. Bob
Dole. Nor will it have discouraged Southern supporters of the Rev.
Pat Robertson who, in the wake of Iowa, threatens the Republican
Party establishment.
   ``In the Democratic primary, Gov. Michael Dukakis emerged as a
clear winner as expected. At this stage, however, his victory falls
short of the conclusive kind of result which New Hampshire has
produced for the Democrats in the past.''
   _Australian Financial Review: ``Sen. Bob Dole lost New Hampshire
and perhaps let the presidency of the United States slip through
his fingers because of a catastrophic tactical blunder.
   ``He let (Bush) tag him as soft on tax rises in a low tax state.
It saved his (Bush's) political life and reestablished his claim as
Republican front runner and favorite for the nomination.''

   _Berlinske Tidende of Copenhagen (conservative): ``Now that both

of them who will run against a Democratic candidate in November.''

Robert Dole can still win nomination by winning the primaries in
the southern states next month.''
   _Aftenposten of Oslo (conservative): ``Democrat Michael Dukakis

... be a strong challenger to Bush, because he stands in the midst
of the mainstream of American politics.''

   _Mainichi Daily News (independent, English-language): ``During
this voting in 20 states, will economic criticisms of Japan and
economic nationalism ... appear full blown in the efforts to gain
votes? If the `Japan problem' is taken up as a campaign issue to an
unnecessary extent or in a mistaken manner, this may even affect
Japan-American political and economic relations. ...
   ``At a time when the United States is suffering from huge trade
and fiscal deficits to a greater extent than ever before, we would
like to have the various presidential candidates carry out calm and
conscientious policies vis-a-vis Japan.''
   _Japan Times (independent, English-language): ``The next U.S.

<HEAD>More Than 10,000 Affected By Epidemic in Chad, Embassy Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Chad appealed for emergency aid
Thursday to combat an epidemic of sleeping sickness it says has
affected more than 10,000 people in the southern part of the
landlocked African nation.
   The Chad Embassy in Paris said the areas of Randa, Dobana,
Belama and Tapol near the headwaters of the Logone River were the
worst affected.
   ``The health services can no longer cope with the number of
victims, who are being accommodated in tents or temporary
shelters,'' the embassy said.
   Sleeping sickness is caused by a microscopic organism known as a
trypanosome that enters the bloodstream through the bite of the
bloodsucking tse-tse fly. The often-fatal disease is related to
encephalitis and is permanently present in many parts of equatorial
Africa, although rarely on an epidemic scale.

<HEAD>Scott Jury Begins Deliberations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUANTICO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military jury today began deliberations
in the retrial of Marine Cpl. Lindsey Scott on charges he raped and
tried to kill another Marine's wife.
   ``I am very confident that we will win it,'' Scott's father,
James, said. ``I just think there's justice in the world.''
   Attorneys for both sides in Scott's second court-martial wrapped
up their cases Wednesday.
   Civilian defense attorney John Leino charged that the Naval
Investigative Service used improper lineup techniques and led the
victim to her identification of Scott. He said there was no
forensic evidence linking Scott to the April 1983 crime.
   Scott, 32, of Louisville, Ky., was convicted of abduction, rape,
sodomy and attempted murder, but the verdict was overturned July 7
by the U.S. Military Court of Appeals on grounds he had an
inadequate defense.
   Leino said prosecutors also convinced the victim that Scott
committed the crime. ``In her mind, someone has to pay,'' he said.
   Leino said it is ludicrous to believe that Scott, ``a good
Marine, nothing but a good person,'' snapped and committed a
heinous crime.
   Military prosecutor Maj. Ron McNeil focused on the testimony of
four investigators who said the passenger side of Scott's car had
been wiped down the day after the attack at the Quantico Marine
Corps base.
   ``Was there a conspiracy here to make this up?'' McNeil said.
``Absolutely not. There's no conspiracy here.''
   ``We think that the motive in this case was sex ... and we
believe that the intent was murder,'' McNeil said.
   McNeil also noted the victim positively identified Scott as her
assailant from the witness stand and from physical and photographic
lineups.
   Scott's chief alibi witness, Cynthia Ausby, testified she saw
Scott in a store where she worked as a security guard at the time
of the rape. The store is about 15 minutes from the base.

<HEAD>Reagan Asks Tax Break to Help Parents Finance College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan asked Congress on Thursday
for a new tax break to help parents finance a college education for
their children.
   In a budget recommending only a few tax changes, Reagan called
for requiring all state and local government employees to pay a tax
for Medicare coverage. He proposed a permanent tax benefit for
owners of shares in mutual funds and an expanded break for
independent oil producers.
   In general, Reagan's proposed budget for the 12 months beginning
next Oct. 1 reflect his reluctance to recommend tax expenditures
that would worsen the federal deficit, and his opposition to
raising taxes to cut that deficit.
   However, in his written message to Congress, the president noted
that ``costs of post-secondary education have increased
substantially in recent years, often faster than inflation. As a
result, parents may have difficulty bearing these costs unless they
establish a savings program for this purpose when their chidren are
young.''
   To help solve that problem, Reagan said he will propose that
Congress exempt from taxation the interest earned on certain bonds
that are redeemed to pay for college or vocational education of a
taxpayer, spouse or dependents.
   The tax exclusion would be targeted on lower- and middle-income
taxpayers and would be phased out as incomes rise. Neither the
limitation on how much interest could be excluded nor the phase-out
level has been decided by the Reagan administration.
   The idea is not a new one; in fact, several bills with a
considerable amount of support are pending in Congress to achieve
the same goal.
   One bill, by Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., would allow a family to
buy a maximum of $2,000 worth of tax-free bonds per year. If the
bonds were cashed for any purpose other than education, the
interest would be taxed and the owner would have to pay a
10-percent penalty.
   Williams' bill would allow the interest exclusion for regular
savings bonds that students already own, assuming those bonds are
used to finance an education. Reagan's proposal would allow the
benefit only for bonds issued after 1988.
   The administration estimates its proposal would cost the
government $10 million next year. By 1991, that would rise to $100
million.
   Other revenue proposals in the budget would:
   _Require all state and local government employees to pay the
1.45-percent Medicare tax. Most workers, including state-local
employees hired after March 31, 1986, already pay the tax as part
of their Social Security payroll tax. The president wants all hired
before that date to pay as well, on grounds most of them are
eligible for Medicare benefits through their spouse or by having
worked previously in a non-government job. This would cost those
workers $1.6 billion in 1989 and $2.1 billion in 1990.
   _Make permanent a one-year tax break enacted in December for
owners of mutual-fund shares, saving those shareholders $400
million a year.
   One provision in the 1986 tax overhaul allows deduction of
miscellaneous expenses _ such as union dues _ only to the extent
they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. The law also
requires mutual funds to pass along to shareholders certain costs
of managing the funds, which must be reported as income. Without
the special tax break, many shareholders would have no way of
deducting those costs.
   _Make permanent a special tax credit, expiring at the end of
1988, for increased expenditures for research and experimentation.
This costs the government $400 million a year.
   _Allow U.S. companies that operate abroad to allocate at least
two-thirds of their research expenses to domestic income, saving
them $600 million a year.
   _Permit the targeted-jobs tax credit _ under which the
government pays a share of the wages of poorer workers _ to expire
as scheduled at the end of 1988.
   _Repeal the ``windfall-profit'' tax on the oil industry, which
was enacted in 1980 to take a portion of sharply rising oil prices.
Reagan says the tax makes no sense now that prices have fallen
significantly.
   _Modify rules under which independent oil producers may claim
the oil-depletion deduction. The changes would allow the deduction
even when certain oil properties are obtained from major oil
companies and even when the writeoff exceeds net-income
limitations. This would save producers $52 million in 1989.
   _Repeal a congressional provision that would automatically cut
taxes on airline tickets and aviation fuel when federal spending
for airport and airways improvements drops below a certain level.

   For 11 days in February, violent rains punished
Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, killing at least 198 people and
leaving 11,000 homeless. Petropolis, a city of 300,000 in the
mountains 40 miles north of the city of Rio, was the hardest hit.
At least 167 people died there in mud avalanches and floods. Here
is a report by an AP correspondent who was in Petropolis during the
rains.

<TEXT>
   Waldemar Ferreira was the only bus
driver to brave the winding mountain road up from Rio in a driving
rain on Feb. 5 _ a Friday night. But he wanted to be with his
family for dinner.
   It was to be his last.
   Ferreira almost didn't go. It had been raining hard since the
previous Monday and there were no signs it would let up. Petropolis
always gets rain during the South American summer, but this was
twice as much as normal.
   Just after sunset, Ferreira climbed aboard the bus and began the
route he had driven for 40 years. He was 64 now, getting close to
retirement.
   At 11 p.m., Ferreira finally pulled into the Petropolis bus
station, 40 miles north of Rio, and the 60 passengers applauded. It
was raining harder.
   A few minutes later, Ferreira dashed up the steps of his
five-room, 70-year-old concrete house that was nestled piggyback on
the side of a tree-covered hill on Casimiro de Abreu Street. His
wife was waiting for him, along with his daughter, Sonia, her two
children, and his daughter, Maria, and her husband, Andre Fernandes.
   At 11:15 p.m., Ferreira sat down to dinner. Maria and her
husband said good night and left for their own nearby house. It was
the last time they would see each other.
   Fernandes learned afterward that a concerned friend had called
his father-in-law to see if all was well. Fernandes said his
father-in-law told the caller he thought he heard a strange, loud
noise, then he hung up. It was 10 minutes to midnight.
   At that precise moment, two lovers in a Volkswagen Beetle
outside were exchanging a good-night kiss.
   Two houses away, preparations were under way for a Sweet 16
birthday party on Saturday. Relatives of the birthday girl had come
all the way from neighboring Minas Gerais state to decorate the
house and make snacks.
   In another house, Maria Ismenia Aleixo was putting her
9-year-old son Carlinhos to bed and was preparing to go to bed
herself. Her mother, father and sister already were asleep.
   Then their world fell in.
   The noise Ferreira heard was a mudslide. It got louder as tons
of water and wet earth raced down the slope and slammed into the
houses on Casimiro de Abreu Street with such force that their
concrete shells seemed to explode. The avalanche destroyed houses,
cars and furniture, leaving only a slick-surfaced mass grave.
   Ms. Aleixo ran outside as soon as she heard the noise. She
looked up at the wall of mud looming above her and screamed. Then
she, too, was buried in the reddish-brown slime.
   ``I heard an incredible noise, like an airplane taking off. I
rushed to my gate in time to see electric wires exploding and power
posts toppling at the end of the street,'' said Nair Hoelz, a
longtime resident who lived nearby.
   ``People began screaming for neighbors along the hillside to
turn on their car lights. Then all we could see was mud where eight
homes had been.''
   On Sunday, Feb. 9., rescue workers pulled Ms. Aleixo and two
neighbors alive from the mud-covered rubble where fallen beams had
left enough space for pockets.
   There were no other survivors on Casimiro de Abreu Street.
   ``I didn't have time to grab my son or even to think,'' Ms.
Aleixo, 42, said from her hospital bed. ``I'm a single mother. My
son was my whole life. My joy came from watching him grow up.''
   Over an eight-day period, rescue crews using tractors along
Casimiro de Abreu Street found soft-drink bottles, a mattress, bits
of clothing, three crushed cars and 18 bodies. Among them were
Waldemar Ferreira, his wife, daughter, Sonia, and two grandchildren.
   ``He rushed home that night to die. It's like something that was
meant to be,'' said son-in-law Fernandes, 33.
   The mudslides destroyed more than 1,000 houses in Petropolis,
from slum shacks to wealthy residences with swimming pools. Civil
defense officials evacuated 94 areas in 28 neighborhoods and
condemned 4,000 to 5,000 houses and apartments.
   Carlos Eurico Aragao, an engineer who heads Petropolis' public
works department, said bad planning and excessive logging were
reasons behind the disaster. He estimated that 80 percent of the
city's buildings were on unsafe ground and 50 percent of those that
suffered damage unrecoverable.
   ``This city grew too quickly,'' he said. ``It was not well
planned even when Brazil's former emperors built it in the 1800s.''
Petropolis grew from a sleepy royal summer getaway to a popular
resort for the rich and also a ``dormitory community'' for poor
inhabitants with jobs in and around Rio.
   Many in town blamed three-term Mayor Paulo Rattes for ignoring a
1978 environmental report that predicted just such a catastrophe
from deforestation. City Hall also was accused of not making needed
imporvements in drainage, shoring up hillsides and relocating the
most dangerously situated homes, principally slum shacks.
   ``Basically this is a social problem, one of underdevelopment,''
Rattes said in an interview. Many people here earn the minimum
wage, equal to just under $60 a month, and he said they ``build
their houses however and wherever they can.''
   The mayor estimated total damage at $50 million.
   Even while rescuers were searching for dead bodies, and it still
was raining and more mudslides were occurring, many in Petropolis
were reluctant to evacuate to government shelters.
   ``My husband was raised in this house,'' said Jurema Valente,
53, as she tearfully packed her few possessions and finally agreed
to get out of her three-room mud-brick house.
   ``I have nowhere else to go and no way to build another house.
This has been my life. How could I start again?'' she asked.
   Mrs. Valente, whose husband earns about $50 a month as a
furniture maker, said she planned to return home as soon as the
rains ended. But the city had condemned her street _ Enchantment
Street, in Portuguese _ as one of the area's highest risk zones.

   The robbery and assault convictions of
Wai-Chiu Tony Ng, the last of the defendants in the 1983 massacre
of 13 people in a Chinatown gambling parlor, were upheld today by
Washington's Supreme Court.
   The leader of the robbery-killings at Seattle's Wah Mee Club,
Kwan Fai Willie Mak, is facing the death penalty and Benjamin Kin
Ng was sentenced to life without possibility of parole in the
killings, the deadliest mass murder in state history.
   The court was unanimous in upholding the 13 robbery counts and a
single second-degree assault count against Ng, no relation to
Benjamin Ng. He faces seven consecutive life terms for seven of the
robberies, with the six remaining robbery counts and the 10-year
assault sentences running concurrently with the life terms.
   Tony Ng was charged with felony murder in all 13 deaths, but the
prosecution did not seek the death penalty. He consistently denied
he killed any of the victims and claimed he was forced by Mak under
threat of death to participate in the robbery.
   He was convicted in King County Superior Court in 1985 of the
lesser charges.
   Twelve of the 13 victims at the Wah Mee Club were tied and shot
in the head execution-style to leave no witnesses. One victim, Wai
Yok Chin, survived critical gunshot wounds to identify the
assailants.
   Mak and Benjamin Ng were arrested and tried separately. Tony Ng,
whose family moved to Seattle from Hong Kong when he was a youth,
escaped. He was arrested for immigration violations about 18 months
later in Calgary, Canada. He gave a confession to Canadian and
Seattle police officers.
   Tony Ng sought reversal of his convictions, contending that his
Canadian confession was wrongly admitted at trial. He also
contended his convictions are inconsistent with his acquittal on
the murder charges.
   But the court, in an opinion by Justice Robert F. Brachtenbach,
rejected both contentions.
   The court said that Tony Ng's confession was voluntary and if it
was incorrectly admitted the action was harmless because there was
ample other evidence.
   ``Where the jury's verdict is supported by sufficient evidence
from which it could rationally find the defendant guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt, we will not reverse on grounds the guilty verdict
is inconsistent with acquittal on another count,'' the court said.

   Here are some highlights of President Reagan's
budget message to Congress.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   By reordering priorities so that we spend more on national
security and less on wasteful or unnecessary federal programs, we
have made freedom more secure around the world and have been able
to negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength.
   By pursuing market-oriented economic policies, we have uncorked
the genie of American enterprise and created new businesses, more
jobs, improved production, and widespread prosperity.
   And we have done all this without neglecting the poor, the
elderly, the infirm, and the unfortunate among us.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This budget does not fully reflect my priorities, nor,
presumably, those of any particular member of Congress.
   But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction
must be paramount.
   Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our
economic progress and burden future generations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I propose an increase of $656 million ... for discretionary
programs of the Department of Education. Although state and local
governments fund most educational activity, federal programs
provide crucial aid for the poor, the handicapped, and the
educationally disadvantaged.
   I have proposed reform of our overcentralized welfare system
through state experimentation with innovative alternatives....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ineffective programs to assist dislocated workers would be
replaced by an expanded $1 billion worker readjustment program
(WRAP) carefully designed to help those displaced from their jobs
move quickly into new careers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I propose a continued increase in federally supported basic
research aimed at longer-term improvements in the nation's
productivity and global competitiveness....
   I would provide $11.5 billion for space programs....
   I also recommend $363 million in 1989 to initiate construction
of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), including $283 million
for construction and $60 million for supporting research and
development....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I continue to urge enactment of an affordable self-financing
insurance program through Medicare to protect families from
economic devastation caused by catastrophic illness.
   To attack the scourge of AIDS, I propose $2 billion for
additional research, education, and treatment in 1989 _ a 38
percent increase over the 1988 level....
   Building upon the nation's pre-eminence in basic biomedical
research, I seek a 5.1 percent increase for non-AIDS research at
the National Institutes of Health.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For expanded law enforcement ... I propose $4.5 billion _ an
increase of 6 percent over 1988.
   For drug law enforcement, prevention, and treatment programs, I
propose $3.9 billion in 1989, a 13 percent increase over the 1988
level.
   To relieve prison overcrowding and adequately house a growing
inmate population, I would provide $437 million _ more than double
the $202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For the Federal Aviation Administration to continue its
multiyear program to modernize the nation's air traffic control
systems, I would provide $1.6 billion _ a 44 percent increase over
the level of 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   To carry out the joint recommendations of the U.S. and Canadian
special envoys on acid rain, I recommend total funding of $2.5
billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projects
over the period 1988 through 1992.
   I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanup
efforts, with an increase in Superfund outlays of some $430 million
in 1989.
   To continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at the
current rate of 50,000 barrels per day, I would provide $334
million in 1989. Contingent upon the enactment of legislation
authorizing the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserves (NPR), I would
provide an additional $477 million to bring the fill rate up to
100,000 barrels per day....
   To improve the speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand
information services provided to taxpayers, I would provide a $241
million increase for the Internal Revenue Service....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The proposals for national security contained in this budget
represent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe and
honoring our commitments to our friends and allies....
   ...My budget requests defense funding of $299.5 billion in
budget authority and $294 billion in outlays for 1989. It also
provides for about 2 percent real growth in these programs in
future years....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...I plan to continue pushing for the elimination of
artificially high (farm) price supports, thereby reducing the need
for export subsidies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The budget proposes certain reforms in the Medicare program ...
to limit payments for certain overpriced physician procedures,
limit payments for durable medical equipment and supplies, and
eliminate a loophole in the payment process for kidney dialysis. In
total, these reforms would reduce spending for Medicare by $1.2
billion from the level that would occur if current law were
continued.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The government often continues programs at the federal level
that are no longer needed. This is the case with rural housing
programs, the Economic Development Administration, urban mass
transit discretionary grants, urban development action grants,
sewage treatment, Small Business Administration direct loans,
housing development action grants, the housing rehabilitation loan
program, and economic development programs of the Tennessee Valley
Authority....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...My budget proposes termination of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, contingent upon enactment of legislation that completes
deregulation of the motor carrier industry.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...I am proposing the sale not only of the Naval Petroleum
Reserves, but also of the Alaska Power Administration, the federal
government's helium program, excess real property and a further $12
billion in loan portfolios. In addition, I have proposed
legislation to authorize a study of possible divestiture of the
Southeastern Power Administration, and plan to study possible
privatization of our uranium enrichment facilities, as well as ways
of making the U.S. Postal Service more efficient through greater
reliance on the private sector.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I am proposing the development of a private mediating
institution to reduce the backlog of cases before the U.S. Tax
Court.... I also encourage the complete privatization of wastewater
treatment plants, certain mass transit projects, the Department of
Agriculture's National Finance Center and the Rural Telephone Bank.
   ...Our administration plans to initiate privatization and
commercialization efforts involving federal prison industries,
relying on a private space facility for micro-gravity research
opportunities in the early 1990s, commercial cargo inspection,
military commissaries, Coast Guard buoy maintenance and the
management of undeveloped federal land. Moreover, my budget
proposes that the work associated with certain federal employment
positions be reviewed for the feasibility of contracting their
responsibilities....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...I propose in this budget a new approach to paying federal
employees who increase their productivity. I ask the Congress to
modify the current system of virtually automatic ``within-grade''
pay increases for the roughly 40 percent of employees eligible each
year to one that is based on employee performance.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...A constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget _
and a provision requiring a super-majority vote in the Congress to
increase taxes _ would impose some much-needed discipline on the
congressional budget process.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I will shortly transmit legislation that will require any future
legislation creating new federal programs to be
deficit-neutral...requiring the concurrent enactment of equal
amounts of program reductions or revenue increases....

   President Reagan said today he wants ``to
rescue'' Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, abducted while working for
the United Nations in Lebanon, but officials said the president was
referring to a multinational, diplomatic effort.
   Reagan was queried, during a photo session on the budget with
congressional leaders, about U.S. efforts to find Higgins.
   ``We're doing everything we can,'' Reagan responded. ``We're
trying to find out as much as we can. We're trying to get him
located, and certainly we want to rescue him.''
   Asked what such a rescue would entail, State Department
spokesman Charles E. Redman said, ``I think the president is making
a reference there to all of our efforts to stay in touch with
parties in the region, with the United Nations, to explore every
possibility, to see if Colonel Higgins can be safely returned.''
   There has been no mention by officials at the State Department,
Pentagon or White House of any U.S. military action to rescue
Higgins. Instead, officials repeatedly have emphasized that Higgins
is under U.N. authority and control.
   Redman denied assertions by the group claiming responsiblity for
Higgins' abduction that the Marine officer worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency. The spokesman said the group, the Islamic
Revolutionary Brigade, was not known to U.S. authorities.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill, also played down
Reagan's remark about a rescue. ``I think that was, maybe, just an
off-the-cuff remark of the president,'' said Michel, who was
present when Reagan said it.
   Michel said he always has been supportive of U.N. operations,
but that his advice would be for American servicemen would be to
keep out of Lebanon.
   The Reagan administration, reaffirmed in strong terms, its
determination to continue supplying American soldiers for the
United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization, not just in the
Middle East, but in Lebanon.
   ``We don't intend to let terrorists determine our policies or
deter us from fulfilling our duties,'' Redman said.
   ``It's an important mission; it's one we've been at for a long
time; it's one that we share with a large number of other
nations,'' Redman said.
   He declined, however, to say if any new instructions would be
sent to the remaining Americans.
   Higgins was seized on Wednesday while traveling in South Lebanon
on official business as a member of the UNTSO. He and a number of
other Americans _ the State Department said less than 20 _ are
members of the UNTSO team assigned to keep the truce along the
Israeli-Lebanese border.
   Since 1949, other UNTSO teams observe peacekeeping efforts along
Israel's borders with Syria, Jordan and Egypt as well as Lebanon.
   Higgins' abduction brings to nine the number of Americans seized
in recent years in Lebanon.
   Redman drew a distinction between American civilians _ who have
been ordered out of Lebanon _ and U.S. troops assigned to the
United Nations peacekeeping efforts.
   Since the wave of kidnappings began, the State Department has
been warning Americans to stay out of the country. Last year, after
three more Americans were seized, use of a U.S. passport to travel
to Lebanon was banned.
   ``In this particular case, the individual U.S. officer was under
the responsibility, authority and control of the United Nations in
his role as a member of the United Nations Supervisory
Organization,'' Redman said.
   Redman said he did not know if any special instructions were
given to the U.S. personnel in light of the dangers, but added,
``as I say, these people are not under our operational control at
all.''
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the practice of the American military people
observing the Israeli-Lebanese frontier was to stay at the border,
but one U.S. soldier _ Higgins in this particular case _ was
permitted to travel further northward.
   ``This is not the case of a lone American straying off into a
place he wasn't supposed to be,'' said one official. ``He was
assigned to a task; he was doing his job. There are a lot of people
from many countries on these observer teams and it's dangerous for
all of them.''
   The official said three UNTSO members, none of them American,
have been killed in Lebanon since 1982.

   The death rate from strokes is falling about 6
percent annually, but the disease will still cost Americans nearly
$13 billion this year, according to a medical report released
Thursday.
   Despite its declining mortality rate, stroke remains the
third-leading cause of death in the United States after heart
disease and cancer.
   A report released by the American Heart Association showed that
stroke also continues to be a major financial burden.
   This year, the association estimates that $9.2 billion will be
spent on hospital and nursing home care alone for stroke victims,
who are often left paralyzed by their disease. When doctor and
nurse bills, medicine and lost productivity are added, the total
annual cost of strokes in 1988 will be an estimated $12.9 billion.
   In 1985, the last year for which statistics are available, about
500,000 Americans suffered strokes; 152,700 of them died. About a
third of all survivors need help caring for themselves.
   Not all the statistics are bad, however. The decline in the
stroke death rate has been picking up speed in recent years.
   ``The death rate is falling very dramatically,'' said Dr. Philip
A. Wolf of Boston University Medical School.
   For the past four decades, the death rate from stroke has been
dropping at a rate of about 1 percent a year. But since 1973, that
decline has averaged 5.7 percent a year.
   No one knows precisely why this cause of death is becoming less
common. However, the risk of heart attacks is also going down, and
many experts believe the same factors are involved in curbing both
diseases.
   ``A lot of people think the control of blood pressure, changes
in lifestyles, changes in diet, more exercise and more health
consciousness are affecting vascular (blood vessel) disease in
general,'' said Dr. Louis R. Caplan of Tufts Medical School in
Boston and chairman of the heart association's stroke council.
   Wolf, who is also an epidemiologist at the long-running
Framingham Heart Study, said that control of blood pressure appears
to be the single most important of these factors.
   He noted that when even mildly elevated blood pressure is
brought down through drugs and behavior changes, people's risk of
stroke is cut in half.
   A stroke occurs when the blood supply in the brain is disrupted.
Often a blood clot chokes off an artery, starving brain cells of
oxygen. Strokes also occur when blood vessels burst and flood brain
tissue with blood.
   Traditionally, doctors have been able to do little for patients
except send them to hospitals, where they are taught to live with
their disabilities. However, that is beginning to change, Caplan
said.
   ``A lot of us are hoping that new technology, used in patients
who are diagnosed correctly, may do a lot to help patients get
better,'' he said in an interview.
   Caplan said that new diagnostic machines are becoming available
that can help doctors pinpoint precisely where inside the head the
blood vessels are in danger of clogging or breaking. Strokes may
then be prevented with surgery or treatment.
   Doctors also are experimenting with drugs that may minimize the
damage of strokes once they occur.
   ``Most people have treated stroke casually,'' said Caplan.
``They say there's nothing you can do but rehabilitate the patient.
The excitement is that we are starting to have the technology and
ability to do something.''
   However, he said that most of the new tools and expertise are
now available only at large medical centers. He recommended that
stroke patients be sent to the big hospitals for diagnosis.

   Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt on Thursday
became the first Democrat to quit the presidential race in 1988,
declaring an end to an underdog candidacy that he called ``the
greatest joy of my entire public life.''
   Babbitt told a roomful of family, supporters and reporters that
he is abandoning the race in the wake of dismal showings in Iowa
and New Hampshire but he is not abandoning his cause _ ``an America
that comes to grips with its future.''
   Babbitt said he will not yet endorse any of the six remaining
Democratic contenders. ``They are all first-rate people and I could
support any one of them,'' he said.
   Babbitt, whose campaign was centered around economic themes
including a frank call for a national sales tax, said the Democrats
must ``give our country a compelling reason to elect us to power.''
   ``I'm going to wait and watch and do everything I can to insure
the success of our party,'' he said.
   Babbitt finished fifth in Iowa last week and sixth in New
Hampshire on Tuesday.
   He seemed relaxed and even upbeat as he explained that probably
``a thousand things'' went wrong for his campaign.
   Ultimately, he likened his race to a stranger riding into town
for a Fourth of July party and telling everyone that the party is
over and it's time to rebuild the town.
   ``It's asking an awful lot in the course of a campaign before
the American people, to say, consider both a new messenger and a
challenging and different message,'' he said.
   Throughout his news conference, Babbitt displayed the
self-deprecating wit he has carried through the campaign that he
launched last March 10.
   Babbitt joked that his appearance on NBC's comedy show,
``Saturday Night Live,'' was ``undoubtedly the high point of this
campaign.''
   Asked if he was worried about the nation's future if taxes are
not increased to reduce the huge budget deficit, he quipped,
``Look, I'm not going to slash my throat if we don't raise taxes
tomorrow.''
   And he said one friend told him, ``You fought a good fight, you
were in it right up to the beginning.''
   ``I don't know why we fared no better. I'll leave that for
others to ponder,'' he said.
   As his wife Hattie and two young sons looked on, Babbitt said,
``This campaign has been the hardest work and greatest joy of my
entire public life. I'll not forget any of it.''
   Hinting at a possible future candidacy, he added: ``I can't say
I'd rush to do it again, but I might.''
   Indeed, die-hard Babbitt admirers at his campaign office in
Concord, N.H., answered the phone ``Babbitt in '92.''
   He recalled the occasions during his campaign when he asked
people to stand up if they supported his call for candor,
especially his plan to tackle the federal deficit with a national
sales tax.
   ``I'll never forget the people in audience after audience who
stood up out of their chair to join me in a demonstration of belief
for the politics of truth,'' he said.
   Asked if he would consider the vice-presidential spot, he
quipped, ``My advice to the nominee would be ... `You probably
ought to select a vice-presidential candidate from a state with
more than seven electoral votes.'''
   He added that if reincarnated he would try to be from the
neighboring delegate-rich state of Texas.
   Referring to the generally favorable press coverage he received,
Babbitt jokingly accused reporters of ``a deliberate conspiracy to
destroy my candidacy by making me into kind of a house pet ... to
destroy my credibility with the American people.''
   Babbitt was the subject of many favorable articles, often
focusing on the substance of his economic proposals, his
willingness to risk the unpopular tax-increase message, and his
generally unpretentious style.
   In New Hampshire, Babbitt had hoped to get at least 10 percent
but he garnered only 5 percent, ahead of only former Sen. Gary Hart.
   Hart urged him to stay in the contest when the two spoke Tuesday
night, and told him, ``You've got something to say. You're a
courageous guy,'' Babbitt related.
   Babbitt's staff said the campaign has about $150,000 to $200,000
in bills to pay off.
   His announcement Thursday concluded a campaign that used often
non-traditional attention-getters _ his bicycle ride across Iowa,
an ascent of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, and a rugged
cross-country ski tour in northern Arizona.
   He said his immediate plans include a trip to Mexico with his
family and doing fix-up work around his Arizona home.
   Asked how he will now earn a living, Babbitt smiled broadly and
cocked his head toward his attorney wife, saying, ``Hattie?''

   A few well-earned wrinkles adorn the
cover-girl's face on Lear's, a stylish new magazine that celebrates
``the woman who wasn't born yesterday.''
   ``I feel a kind of earthquake of women over 40 who are going to
change life for themselves for the better,'' said publisher Frances
Lear, 64, whose magazine hits the newsstands Tuesday. ``It's going
to be a greater movement than the women's movement.''
   For members of this new movement, Lear, the former wife of
television producer Norman Lear, blends a dash of fashion with
no-nonsense financial advice and some savvy writing.
   ``Once upon a time,'' says her first editorial, ``a woman took
the events of her life, added the pluses and deducted the minuses,
and lived with that arithmetic. No more.''
   Lear, a longtime supporter of women's causes, knows all about
change _ and about bouncing back.
   Divorced after a 28-year marriage to Norman Lear, she left
California for her hometown, New York, carrying two suitcases of
clothes and the germ of an idea.
   ``I could never look like Linda Evans,'' Lear confides in a
letter to potential subscribers. ``The women's magazines were
urging me to travel, but every resort showed pictures of slim young
women in bikinis.''
   What was needed, she decided, was a magazine for women like her:
educated, affluent and over 40. ``It took a woman to see it,'' she
said.
   Armed with the dream, connections and money, but lacking
know-how, she spent 2{ years picking the brains of the publishing
world.
   ``The last person I spoke to was (New York Magazine creator)
Clay Felker, who said, `Do it. Just do it.' And I did,'' she said.
``I was ecstatic that I would be writing and working for women,
about whom I care a great deal.''
   During the late 1960s, Lear founded Women's Place Inc., a Los
Angeles consulting firm. She later began Lear Purvis Walker & Co.,
an executive search firm for women. In 1984, as a partner in a
political consulting firm, she founded a division for women
candidates.
   The magazine, she said, ``is a fusion of my experience and the
women I've worked with for the past 25 years, who ranged from
welfare mothers to highly skilled executives.''
   It's the female executives _ or wives of executives _ who make
up Lear's guaranteed circulation of 200,000. (The first issue,
which ran 475,000 copies, was expected to sell out.) Market
research shows the subscribers' average household income is $92,400.
   Lear, in fact, is using her own money to start the magazine.
``By the time it's in the black (she hopes in two to three years),
I will have spent $25 million,'' she said.
   Six issues are planned for this year and 10 for the second year.
   The ads and richly colored, high-fashion spreads feature over-40
models whenever possible. (They're in scarce supply.)
   ``We believe that Lear's will spark a whole culture,'' she said.
``Products, instruction, entertainment, recreation _ this whole
market will have their own world of toys to choose from.''
   The copy ranges from humor, essays and fiction to advice on
treasury bills and an interview with Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, who defends her feminine style in the political arena.
   ``We have presented women over 40 who are absolutely beautiful
and sensual and intelligent and character-ful,'' said Lear. ``It
informs, it entertains, it impels, inspires.''
   The feminism is soft-pedaled. ``The militant views of the early
feminists are long gone, and feminism is settling into a more
middle-of-the-road posture,'' she said. ``But the word `feminist'
still conjures up witches in some minds.''
   Profiles mention the potholes on a woman's road to success:
difficult upbringing, multiple divorces, adjustment to the aging
process. Good marriages also get a mention.
   ``It is noteworthy to have a happy marriage. ... I think all
women are basically traditional, and want love and home and
family,'' said Lear. ``And a divorce is a major event in a person's
life. To leave it out would be to leave out one's education.''
   Lear said 17 percent of her readers are under 30. ``They say,

<HEAD>U.S. Judge Labels Newspaper Story on Him As Inaccurate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has denied a newspaper story that
accused him of approving a large attorney's fee for Wedtech scandal
figure E. Robert Wallach after asking Wallach to lobby for his
federal judgeship.
   The story in Tuesday's San Francisco Chronicle said former
Superior Court Judge Eugene Lynch granted Wallach and his partner a
$1 million fee in September 1981, during the period the White House
was considering Lynch's appointment to the federal bench.
   Lynch was appointed a federal judge in January 1982.
   ``The article is misleading in at least one vital respect and
should be corrected,'' said Lynch in a statement Wednesday.
   ``Contrary to the story's implication,'' wrote Lynch, ``it is a
matter of public record ... that I did not finally approve the
attorneys' fees that were the focus of the story. Rather, in an
order dated Dec. 24, 1981, I deferred determination of the amount
and a different judge ultimately dealt with the matter and approved
fees.''
   The judge added: ``I reiterate that in my 16 years on the bench
I have never been improperly influenced in any decision by any of
my many professional or social relationships with members of the
bar.
   ``Finally, I know of nothing that was improper or unusual about
the process of my appointment to the federal bench.''
   Alan D. Mutter, the Chronicle's assistant managing editor-metro,
said today, ``I think if you read our story carefully it answers
all the questions, and we stand by our story.''
   The Chronicle story Lynch, in an interview with the paper,
acknowledged seeking help from Wallach for the federal court
appointment and that Wallach was a friend of long standing.
   Wallach was indicted last month in New York on charges of
influence peddling for allegedly taking payments from Wedtech, a
defense contract in New York City, to lobby Edwin Meese III before
he became attorney general to get the company government contracts.

   As the youngest members of the ruling Politburo,
Georgy P. Razumovsky and Yuri D. Maslyukov could see the reforms
pushed by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev carried further than
their colleagues.
   Razumovksy, 52, and Maslyukov, 50, were elevated Thursday to
non-voting membership on the Politburo by the Communist Party
Central Committee, which has the power to make personnel changes on
the Politburo. Boris N. Yeltsin, the former Moscow party boss, lost
his Politburo post.
   Razumovsky is an agricultural specialist who has close ties to
Gorbachev, and Maslyukov is a top manager of the centrally planned
economy.
   Gorbachev was Razumovsky's superior as department chief in the
Council of Ministers. The Kremlin chief, who was responsible for
agriculture before becoming party general secretary, frequently has
consulted with Razumovsky on farm policy.
   Razumovsky also holds the powerful post of secretary of the
Central Committee in charge of appointing party personnel as chief
of the Department for Party Organizational Work.
   Maslyukov is a deputy chairman of the government's Council of
Ministers and is on the panel's Presidium. He was named earlier
this month to be chairman of the State Planning Committee, which
plays a key role in the country's centrally managed economy. As
head of the committee, Maslyukov replaced Nikolai V. Talyzin, whose
performance Gorbachev had criticized.
   The 58-year-old Talyzin, however, retained his candidate post on
the Politburo on Thursday. Earlier this month, Talyzin was made
head of the obscure Social Development Bureau.
   Maslyukov holds an engineering degree and has become a
specialist in weapons, serving in a number of posts in the Soviet
defense industry. He chairs the Presidium's Military-Industrial
Commission.
   The Politburo, whose size varies, now has seven candidate
members. No new voting members of the ruling body were appointed,
leaving that number at 13.
   Removal of the towering 57-year-old Yeltsin ends a tumultuous
five months. He was one of the strongest advocates of Gorbachev's
reforms but generated controversy because of a speech he gave at
the Central Committee's last plenary meeting, on Oct. 21. Yeltsin
said reform was proceeding too slowly and attacked the party's
style of leadership under Gorbachev. He offered to resign.
   Yeltsin was removed from the Moscow party leadership on Nov. 11,
but a week later was named first deputy director of the State
Construction Committee, with the rank of government minister. Since
then, his name has been mentioned in the press without references
to his Politburo job, a sign he would be ousted.
   Gorbachev denounced Yeltsin for being overly ambitious. Yeltsin
was quoted as saying: ``I am very guilty before the Moscow party
organization, very guilty before the city party committee, and
certainly I am very guilty before Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev,
whose prestige in our organization, in our country, and in the
whole world is so high.''
   Also Thursday, the Central Committee named Oleg D. Baklanov as
one of its secretaries. Baklanov, 55, was appointed minister of
general machine building in 1983.

   The defense in the sedition trial of 14
men linked with white supremacist groups told a federal jury that a
key witness for the government's case is a liar who had himself
crowned king of the Ozarks.
   The charge came during opening statements Wednesday in which the
prosecutor said that leaders of white supremacist groups gathered
in 1983 to discuss poisoning the water supplies of New York and
Washington, D.C., and establishing an Aryan nation.
   Louis Ray Beam Jr., 41, of Houston, a defendant who is
representing himself, told the U.S. District Court jury to expect
``a fairy tale of lies'' from the man he called the prosecution's
star witness, James B. Ellison.
   Ellison, who is serving a 20-year prison term for racketeering
and weapons offenses, was leader of an Arkansas-based group named
The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord.
   Wayland Parker, attorney for defendant Lambert Miller, said
Ellison once went off into the woods, fasted and came out declaring
that God had told him he was king of the Ozarks.
   ``This would be foolishness if they weren't trying to put
innocent men in jail,'' Beam said, urging jurors to look for signs
of untruthfulness when Ellison testifies.
   Beam is among 10 men charged with conspiring to overthrow the
government by force starting at a 1983 meeting attended by Beam,
Ellison and others. Beam said he never met Ellison until that
meeting and knows nothing of any conspiracy.
   ``It's a good story, but that's all it is,'' Beam said.
   Ardie McBrearty, 60, of Gentry, Ark., another of the 10 charged
with conspiring to overthrow the government by force, echoed Beam's
statement in his own statement today.
   ``By golly, Hans Christian Andersen couldn't have done any
better,'' in making up a story, he said. The government's tale, he
said, consists of a ``little truth here, a little truth there, and
a whole lot of imagination in between.''
   He said he received about $100,000 from the founder of a white
supremacist extremist group named The Order, but returned more than
$90,000 after ``I began to sniff that these weren't tax fighters at
all.''
   He said he has long opposed some federal tax laws and procedures
and had contact with some white supremacists only because they were
introduced to him as tax protestors.
   Conspiracy to overthrow the government has a maximum penalty of
20 years in prison.
   Miller and four others are charged with conspiring to murder a
judge and an FBI agent who played a part in the prosecution of
people who harbored a man wanted in North Dakota for the slayings
of two U.S. marshals. The maximum penalty for that charge is life
imprisonment.
   One man, Richard Wayne Snell, is charged with in both incidents.
   The government and five of the defendants made their opening
statements Wednesday, the second day of a trial expected to last
three months.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Snyder said in his statement that
Ellison talked about the poisoning scheme in 1983 at an Aryan
Nations convocation in Hayden Lake, Idaho, with Richard G. Butler
and Robert Miles, Snyder said.
   Butler, 69, is the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ
Christian (Aryan Nations), while Miles, 63, is a former Ku Klux
Klan official convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school
buses in Pontiac, Mich.
   At the time, Ellison had more than 200 pounds of sodium cyanide
in his possession, Snyder said.
   At that same conclave, supremacist leaders discussed the idea of
abolishing the U.S. government and setting up an Aryan state,
Snyder said.
   He said Ellison ``sent a paper around to be signed,'' and when
it came back signed by the leaders, Ellison said, ``All of us today
entered into a conspiracy against the government of the United
States.''
   ``The meeting ended with the Nazi stiff-arm hail victory
salute,'' Snyder said.
   Butler, Miles and Beam disputed this account. Butler said
Ellison is trying to shorten his prison stay ``by saying anything
the government wants him to say.''
   Snyder said the supremacists viewed white people as the people
of God, Jews as ``the spawn of Satan,'' ``blacks were called
mud-people'' and were regarded as sub-human, and the government was
called ZOG, for Zionist Occupation Government.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Resolution Condemning North Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee on Thursday approved a
resolution accusing North Korea of ``murderous acts of
state-sponsored terrorism'' for the bombing last year of a South
Korean jetliner that killed 115 people aboard.
   The Foreign Affairs Committee, which passed the resolution
without dissent, also urged other nations to impose a trade embargo
on North Korea. The resolution was sent to the full House with
strong statements of bipartisan support.
   Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., said the destruction of
Korean Air Lines Flight 858 last November ``was probably the
clearest example we have seen of state-sponsored terrorism.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., called the bombing a monstrous act
that raises doubt about the sanity of the heavily-armed North
Korean regime bordering U.S.-allied South Korea.
   The resolution said that Congress ``categorically rejects the
December 1987 proposal to enter into a dialogue with the Parliament
of North Korea, since its members represent a government that
engages in murderous acts of state-supported terrorism.''
   Prior to the bombing, Soviet diplomats had discussed a proposal
for talks between U.S. and North Korean lawmakers. The discussions
were later proposed in formal letters relayed by the Soviet Embassy
to U.S. officials in December, according to a congressional
staffer, who requested anonymity.
   Solarz said the United States has ``fairly persuasive''
independent evidence of North Korean responsibility for the
time-bombing. In addition, Kim Hyun-hee, surviving member of the
two accused North Korean agents, confessed to South Korean
investigators.
   The two left Flight 868 at Baghdad, its last stop before the
bombing over the Andaman Sea, and took cyanide pills when later
arrested in Bahrain.
   The resolution expressed support for steps taken by the Reagan
administration after the bombing, including the addition of North
Korea to its list of countries supporting international terrorism.
   The resolution asked for sanctions and other measures against
North Korea from ``other countries, particularly with close
relations with North Korea ...'' This was considered a reference to
the Soviet Union and China, North Korea's closest neighbors.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Trying to Save Hospital's Peter Pan
Royalties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister James Callaghan is playing
fairy godfather to a children's hospital in London by trying to
change the law so it can keep earning royalties from the classic
tale, ``Peter Pan.''
   Author J.M. Barrie bequeathed royalties from the book, stage and
film performances about the boy who wouldn't grow up to the
world-renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children.
   But the copyright expired Dec. 31 after the maximum 50 years
permitted by law, just as the 146-year-old hospital launched a
drive to raise $52 million for renovations.
   Callaghan, the former Labor Party leader who was prime minister
from 1976-79, said Thursday he believes an exception should be
made, and he will seek to change the law to make Barrie's bequest
permanent.
   He said the initiative actually came from his wife, Audrey,
chairwoman of the special trustees who administer funds bequeathed
to the hospital.
   Callaghan _ now Lord Callaghan after being made a life peer by
Queen Elizabeth II last year _ said the hospital received a
``substantial'' amount of money from ``Peter Pan'' royalties.
   He couldn't say how much because Barrie stipulated in his will
that the sum should never be revealed. British media have
speculated it was as much as much as $875,000 a year.
   Callaghan said he hopes to introduce an amendment to the
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act next month that would enable the
hospital to receive royalties forever.
   ``It (the amendment) is in train,'' he said. ``Proposals have
been put forward. Everybody has been very helpful.''
   The Times of London reported Thursday that Callaghan's proposal
has the support of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government.
Callagahn was defeated by Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979.
   Lady Callaghan said there is a precendent for a perpetual
copyright. Parliament granted one to Oxford University for the Earl
of Clarendon's 1702 book ``History of the Rebellion'' about
Britain's rebellion and civil wars.
   Clarendon's royalties were once very profitable to the
university. In his honor, the Oxford University Press named the
building it moved to in 1829 The Clarendon Press.
   Barrie's story about a boy who flew with Tinkerbell through
never-never land and triumphed over Captain Hook grew out of tales
he spun for five orphaned boys he took under his wing.
   The play was first performed in 1904, followed by a story,
``Peter Pan In Kensington Gardens,'' in 1906 and the play in book
form in 1911. The play is att$acting full houses at the Cambridge
Theater in London's West End.
   The royalties helped Great Ormond Street Hospital develop a
world-class reputation. Prince Charles had his appendix removed
there as a child.

   One year after jumping bail and failing to
appear in court for a trial on sexual-assault charges, a former
high school honor student remains on the lam, pursued by a bounty
hunter, the FBI and police.
   Alex A. Kelly, now 20, of Darien, has been missing since he and
his parents parted at Denver's Stapleton International Airport on
Feb. 15, 1987. He had been working in Leadville, Colo., and he and
his parents had booked separate flights to Newark, N.J.,
authorities said.
   Four days later, he failed to appear in court in Stamford for
the start of his trial on charges that he raped two teen-age girls
in 1986.
   ``We've had a lot of rumors, but as far as I know, the trail is
cold,'' Assistant State's Attorney Bruce P. Hudock said. ``I
personally have at least another 10 years on this job, so I'm
patient.''
   Kelly's parents, Joseph T. and Melanie L. Kelly, declined to
discuss their son's case or his disappearance.
   They may lose their $450,000 home in this well-to-do suburb of
New York City because they put it up as security for Kelly's
$200,000 bond, raised to $450,000 when he failed to appear.
Prosecutors have filed a foreclosure motion that is pending.
   Bounty hunter Philip B. Dole of New York entered the case last
year after Gov. William A. O'Neill authorized a $20,000 reward.
   Dole, who usually works for bail bondsmen, said recently that he
has uncovered some leads by talking to Kelly's friends and checking
places where he was last seen. He declined to describe the leads,
but he said he expects Kelly to be arrested in less than a year.
   ``He's going to make a mistake,'' Dole said. ``People who stay
out that long feel no one is looking for them.''
   Kelly is charged with three counts of first-degree sexual
assault, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of threatening in
connection with the attacks on Feb. 10 and 14, 1986.
   Kelly was arrested the day of the second assault, only days
after his Darien High School wrestling coach wrote an article in
the weekly Darien News-Review describing in glowing terms how the
teen-ager had overcome a troubled past.
   Kelly had been charged with nine burglaries in 1983 and 1984,
and was sentenced to a four-month drug treatment program.
   Coach Jeffrey Bouvier wrote that Kelly had returned to school in
the spring of 1985 after completing the drug program, was earning
As and had applied to colleges in Colorado.
   ``He is open about his `problem' and speaks candidly to groups
of freshmen about drugs and their potential to ruin a life,''
Bouvier wrote.
   Kelly's attorney, Michael Sherman of Stamford, said he thinks
his client jumped bail because he feared he would not receive a
fair trial after a judge decided to try the two assault cases
together.
   ``It's very easy for the state's attorney to be very macho about
it, but you're still looking at a 19-year-old kid (at the time) who
is afraid and who is facing 20 years in prison,'' Sherman said. He
was referring to a sentence proposed by prosecutors under a plea
bargain agreement.
   Kelly's parents have said they don't know where he is, but
police are suspicious.
   The assault victims were initially apprehensive about the trial,
Hudock said, but Kelly's disappearance has left them angry.
   ``I would say their feelings go to the area of justice not
having been served,'' he said. ``Their interest seems to have
increased in the past year.''

<HEAD>Crimes Against Blacks, Jews Up In Los Angeles County During 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hate crimes directed primarily at blacks and
Jews rose to an eight-year record in the Los Angeles area during
1987, according to a study that linked the increase to white power
groups such as young neo-Nazi ``Skinheads.''
   A study released Wednesday by the County Commission on Human
Relations cited ``entrenched racial and religious bigotry among a
small segment'' of the Los Angeles County population as a reason
for the increase.
   The study recorded 184 incidents of racially or religiously
motivated vandalism and violence last year, the highest number
since the commission began keeping statistics in 1980.
   They included 79 incidents of racially motivated crimes,
compared to 58 in 1986. Anti-religious crimes totaled 115, up from
95 incidents in 1986.
   More than half of the racially motivated crimes were aimed at
blacks and 85 percent of all anti-religious crimes were directed
toward Jews, the study found.
   ``Our numbers for 1987 are the highest we've ever had, and we
don't think it's a result of improved reporting. It's real,'' said
Eugene Mornell, the commission's executive director.
   ``We also think there is an under-count of incidents,
particularly for Latinos and Asians,'' he said.
   The report acknowledged increases in open hate-group activity by
the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party members and sympathizers, including
the rise of ``Skinheads,'' youths who usually shave their heads as
a symbol of their white supremacy beliefs.
   Graffiti was the most common harassment but the commission
documented cross burnings, arson, gunshots and other forms of
violence and vandalism.
   The study's findings were similar to a survey by the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith which found anti-Semitic
violence is on the rise in Southern California, and attributed the
rise in part to the prevalance of ``Skinheads.''
   The annual report for the first time logged 52 cases of
harassment against gays and lesbians, out of 107 cases submitted to
the commission in 1987 by the Gay and Lesbian Community Services
Center.

   President Reagan's 1989 budget would raise
spending on general science by 20 percent, to $13.1 billion, and
provide for machines to probe the outer space above Earth and the
inner space of particles on Earth.
   The budget boosts spending for science and research programs by
$2.2 billion, and includes start-up funds for the superconducting
super collider in the Department of Energy and the space station in
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The spending plan also provides money to the National Science
Foundation to establish 10 to 15 new basic science research centers
over the next five years.
   About $400 million in the budget would go to the Energy
Department for the start of construction on history's largest pure
science machine, the superconducting super collider. This device,
which would include an underground tunnel more than 50 miles long,
would be the world's most powerful proton collider. Its goal is
fundamental research into the basic nature of particles smaller
than the atom.
   A number of states are competing for the super collider, but the
final decision on the site has not been made.
   Energy's science budget authority for 1989 would total $1.2
billion, a 49 percent increase over the 1988 level. Most of the
increase would go to the collider.
   At a briefing on the NASA budget, space agency Administrator
James Fletcher said the president's budget follows a policy that
``clearly commits the United States to space leadership as a
fundamental objective'' and establishes for the first time a
long-range goal of putting astronauts on other planets.
   NASA's budget outlay would increase by nearly 30 percent, from
$8.4 billion in 1988 to $10.1 billion in 1989.
   Almost $1 billion of the outlay would go for start-up
construction of the space station, a permanent orbital base that
NASA plans to have in operation in the mid-1990s. Space agency
officials had hoped for another $800 million, but the project has
been resisted by some in Congress.
   The space budget also includes start-up funds for the Pathfinder
Project, a research program designed to develop the basic
technologies needed to send astronauts to Mars sometime in the next
century.
   NASA also would receive more than $1 billion additional in its
space flight budget in 1989. This will cover the additional costs
of space shuttle missions. The agency hopes to complete recovery
from the 1986 Challenger accident with the resumption of shuttle
flights in August and a gradual increase in mission rate in 1989.
The funding also covers the cost of building a new shuttle
spacecraft, expected to be completed now in 1991.
   The National Science Foundation outlay would increase from $1.67
billion in 1988 to $1.81 billion in 1989.
   Reagan called for a $300 million increase in basic research
funded by the foundation. The budget proposes to establish 10 to 15
basic science research centers over the next five years. These
centers would focus on research among a number of scientific
disciplines and encourage industry participation, the
administration said.

   A river boat capsized Thursday along the
Ganges delta southeast of Calcutta, and 150 people were missing, a
news agency reported.
   Nine people were known dead in the disaster, and a search was
under way for survivors, the United News of India reported.
   The vessel had been carrying about 200 people when it overturned
in the Matla River, one of the many tributaries of the Ganges that
flow through West Bengal state, UNI said.
   Nine bodies have been recovered.
   The vessel was headed from Jharkhali to Port Canning when it
capsized, UNI said. The area is about 25 miles southeast of
Calcutta.

   Anthony McLeod Kennedy was sworn in as the
nation's 104th Supreme Court justice today, bringing a crucial
tie-breaking vote to a court hampered by a vacancy the past eight
months.
   With a hand on his family Bible, Kennedy promised during a brief
ceremony to ``do equal right to the poor and to the rich.'' He then
was seated at the high court bench, at the place traditionally
reserved for the junior justice.
   President Reagan, who appointed Kennedy, did not attend the
courtroom ceremony but Attorney General Edwin Meese III presented
Kennedy's commission of office to the justices.
   None of the three former court members still living attended the
ceremony. Justice Lewis F. Powell, who Kennedy succeeds, and Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger were in Florida. Former Justice Arthur
Goldberg, whose wife died Saturday, also did not attend.
   In comments before the ceremony, Kennedy, 51, said he had a
running start in his new job.
   ``I've been working. I'm ready for Monday,'' when the court ends
its current recess, Kennedy said while posing for cameras outside
the court building prior to his swearing-in.
   ``We're just delighted to be in Washington. The welcome has been
very gracious,'' Kennedy said.
   Surrounded by his wife, Mary, three children and more than 30
other relatives, Kennedy said he plans to live in an apartment in
the nation's capital while he and his wife look for a permanent
home.
   ``It's not quite big enough for the whole family,'' he joked
before walking off with his relatives.
   The former federal appellate judge from Sacramento, Calif., had
two swearing-in ceremonies today: one in the Supreme Court's ornate
courtroom and the other at the White House.
   President Reagan's third choice for the job, Kennedy was
confirmed by a 97-0 vote of the Senate 15 days ago _ a tranquil
conclusion to the political storm sparked by Justice Lewis F.
Powell's retirement last June 26.
   The Senate rejected the president's first choice, Robert H.
Bork. A second nominee, Douglas H. Ginsburg, withdrew after
admitting he had smoked marijuana while a law professor.
   Kennedy, although a conservative for his 12 years on the federal
bench, is considered more of a moderate than either Bork or
Ginsburg.
   Little is known about Kennedy's specific views on abortion
regulation, affirmative action, church-state relations or the other
politically sensitive issues on which the high court is closely
divided.
   He is the third Reagan appointee to join the court, following
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Reagan also elevated William H. Rehnquist to the chief justice's
post when Warren E. Burger retired in 1986.
   A busy schedule awaits Kennedy. The court, returning from a
four-week recess, convenes in an all-day conference behind closed
doors Friday and returns to the bench Monday to begin three days of
oral argument sessions.
   One of the arguments focuses on whether private clubs may
exclude women and racial minorities as members.
   Kennedy was criticized during his Senate confirmation hearings
for his past membership in such exclusive clubs.
   The absence of a ninth justice for more than half the court's
1987-88 term has resulted in some significant deadlocks.
   For example, the court split 4-4 in December when deciding
whether a state may require some teen-agers seeking abortions to
wait 24 hours after telling their parents or a judge about their
decision.
   The justices also split 4-4 last month over the validity of an
affirmative action program designed to promote more blacks and
Hispanics in the New York City Police Department.
   Such votes automatically uphold the lower court's ruling but set
no national precedent.
   The addition of Kennedy reduces the court's average age from 68
to 66, and marks the first time in history the court has included
three Catholics. Like Kennedy, Justices Scalia and William J.
Brennan are Catholic.
   The court also includes three Stanford University graduates and
four Harvard University law school grads.
   Kennedy, who received his undergraduate degree from Stanford and
his law degree from Harvard, joins fellow Stanford grads Rehnquist
and O'Connor. The three other justices who have Harvard law degrees
are Brennan, Scalia and Harry A. Blackmun.

   Athens Airport was shut down Thursday in a
24-hour strike by air traffic controllers and other workers seeking
bonuses for dangerous or stress-filled jobs.
   A labor union spokesman said more than 70,000 workers had joined
the walkout, including airport, railroad, and harbour workers and
state hospital and veterinary employees.
   More than 40 international and domestic flights had been
canceled and that Greek airspace would be closed ``for the day,''
an airport spokesman said.
   Olympic Airways, the Greek state carrier, was scheduling extra
flights for Friday and that international flights would resume
``early in the morning,'' he said.
   ``We want extra money for stressful and dangerous jobs to be
built into our pay scales, and also the right to get an earlier
pension,'' said an airport union spokesman, who requested anonymity
in accordance with Greek practice.
   State hospital doctors also staged a separate walkout to press
their demands for a 30 percent salary increase. Most state-employed
doctors currently earn less than $1,000 monthly. A union spokesman
said hospitals would accept only emergency cases.

<HEAD>Operating Rate Remains Unchanged At 82.2 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's industrial operating rate was
unchanged in January at 82.2 percent of capacity as cutbacks in the
production of steel and autos offset gains in other areas, the
government reported Thursday.
   The January operating rate remained at the highest level in
almost eight years, but it was the first month since September that
the operating rate had failed to move up.
   Many private economists believe the economy, which moved ahead
at a robust pace during the second half of 1987, has entered a
signficant slowdown brought on by high backlogs of unsold products
which will cause cutbacks in production.
   While some believe the slowdown will be so severe that the
country will enter a recession, most analysts are forecasting weak
growth but no recession in the first half of 1988 followed by
rising economic activity for the rest of the year.
   David Wyss, an economist for Data Resources Inc., said he
expected the overall economy, as measured by the gross national
product to rise a miniscule 1.4 percent this year, down sharply
from the 3.8 percent growth recorded in 1987 with the weakness
coming from production cutbacks brought on by sluggish consumer
demand.
   By contrast, the Reagan administration, in releasing its 1989
budget Thursday, forecast economic growth of 2.4 percent for this
year.
   In January, the operating rate in the auto industry dropped by
1.2 percentage points to 76.7 percent of capacity. It was the third
consecutive monthly decline after auto plants hit an operating rate
of 82 percent in October. The report blamed ``excessive
inventories'' on dealers' lots for the production cutbacks.
   Steel and other makers of primary metals, a sector closely tied
to the auto industry, also saw a drop in operating rates, which
fell to 89.6 percent of capacity last month, down from 91.2 percent
in December.
   Analysts said they looked for this trend to continue and spread
to other industries as retailers, caught with high inventories,
slash orders.
   The January operating rate of 82.2 percent was a full 3
percentage points above the operating level 12 months ago,
reflecting the boom the manufacturing sector has enjoyed from
rising export sales.
   The administration is counting on the strength from record-high
export levels to offset weakness in the consumer sector and keep
the economy out of a recession this year.
   For all of manufacturing, the operating rate was unchanged at
82.4 percent of capacity in January. Manufacturers of durable
goods, items expected to last at least three years, operated at
79.9 percent of capacity, a small decline from December, while
manufacturers of non-durable goods operated at 86.1 percent of
capacity.
   The industry with the highest operating rate is paper, where
plants are operating at 96.5 percent of capacity, followed close
behind by textiles, with an operating rate of 94.1 percent of
capacity.
   Normally, when operating rates get above 85 percent, economists
begin to worry about bottlenecks and rising prices. But analysts
said that the expected slowdown in growth should help to constrain
prices this year.
   ``If I weren't expecting a slowdown, I would be more worried
about inflation,'' Wyss said.
   The mining industry, which has been hardhit by declines in oil
prices, had a 0.3 percentage point drop in the operating rate to
80.2 percent of capacity in January.
   This was offset, however, by a 0.9 percentage point increase in
the operating rate at utility companies, which rose to 81.6 percent
in January. The big gain was attributed to unusually severe winter
weather which boosted heating demands.

   Republicans view an emerging Democratic
package of purely humanitarian aid for Nicaragua's Contra rebels as
``pretty soft stuff,'' and will seek to bring their own aid package
up for a vote next week, the House GOP leader said Thursday.
   ``I would certainly hope that whatever ... the speaker brings
up, that we'd be given an opportunity as a minority party to offer
a substitute for whatever they propose,'' Rep. Robert Michel,
R-Ill., told reporters.
   He said ``the preliminary indications are such that it's going
to be pretty soft stuff that won't get the job done. And if it's
just that, of course we would want to make one more attempt at
doing something more significant.''
   President Reagan lost his bid in a House vote Feb. 4 for a $36.2
million aid package that included some $3.6 million for weapons and
ammunition, along with additional millions for military logistical
support.
   Democrats prevailed on that vote, 219-211, after the party's
leadership promised wavering members that there would be a later
opportunity to approve a package of Contra aid that included only
food, clothing, medicine and shelter.
   A group of interested Democrats, together with one or two
Republicans who voted against the president's proposal, have been
meeting daily for the past week to draft such an alternative.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said Wednesday that the
package would continue aid at current rates _ about $1.8 million a
month for the aid itself, and an undetermined additional amount for
transportation of the goods _ but that many other difficult issues
remained unresolved.
   Wright has invited White House officials and the Republican
leadership to participate, but they have elected to stay aloof from
the package.
   Michel alluded to the difficulties Democrats were having in
drawing up an aid package that could win majority support, and
noted that the issue of how the goods are to be transported remains
unresolved. The CIA is using airdrops to get materiel to the
rebels, but that authority expires Feb. 29.
   Many Democrats want delivery authority shifted to some neutral
international body such as the Red Cross or Organization of
American States, but such groups would be unlikely to agree to make
deliveries so long as hostilities continue.
   Cease-fire talks between the rebels and the leftist Sandinista
government of Nicaragua are continuing in Costa Rica.
   ``My feeling is, it has to be done, continue to be done, through
the agency, it's the only meaningful way of getting it there,''
Michel said, referring to the CIA.
   ``There are some undelivered military supplies from the original
appropriation (which ended last year) that have not yet been
delivered,'' he said. ``I would like to see that there still be
that capability for the delivery of the balance of that material.''

<HEAD>Center's Youngest Transplant Patient Dies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with the death of anencephalic baby in
California.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An anencephalic baby kept on life-support systems to preserve
his organs for transplant died this morning in California, and a
3-week-old boy too weak to undergo a second heart transplant died
in a Pittsburgh hospital.
   ``The anencephalic baby has been declared dead,'' said Dick
Schaefer, spokesman for Loma Linda University Medical Center in
Loma Linda, Calif.
   He refused to immediately say whether the boy's organs were in
suitable condition for transplants.
   The unidentified boy, who was born with most of his brain
missing, had been on a respirator at the hospital 60 miles east of
Los Angeles, said spokeswoman Anita Rockwell. He was born Tuesday
in Anaheim, she said.
   Most babies born with anencephaly die within days. Their healthy
organs can be transplanted if organ damage is prevented by
maintaining the infants on life-support.
   No cases of anencephalics being kept on life-support have been
announced in the United States, although Leonard Bailey, chief of
Loma Linda's heart transplant program, last year suggested there
have been such infants.
   At Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Johnathan Stowe died
Wednesday afternoon, still attached to the heart-lungs bypass
machine on which doctors had placed him after surgery, said Lynn
McMahon, hospital spokeswoman.
   His parents, David and Tabitha Stowe of Beaver Falls, were with
him. Johnathan received a new heart Monday. The left side of his
own heart was underdeveloped at his birth Jan. 25.
   Doctors said the cause of death was failure of the donor heart.
The organ had come from an infant close in age and size to
Johnathan, who was 7.6 pounds at birth, Ms. McMahon said.
   ``It really is perplexing for the surgeons,'' she said. ``The
match with the donor organ was very good. The surgery itself ...
proceeded very well. But for some unknown reason, immediately after
surgery, the heart began to weaken.''
   Johnathan was placed on the bypass machine following the
transplant in hopes the donor organ could rest and gain strength,
Ms. McMahon said. Doctors on Monday gave him a 10 percent chance to
survive, and he developed complications with his lungs and kidneys
the next day.
   Johnathan never gained consciousness following the transplant,
Ms. McMahon said. A second transplant was not considered because
``doctors felt his system couldn't withstand another surgery,'' she
said.
   In California, Loma Linda had maintained the infant on
life-support under guidelines developed last year after a woman
pregnant with an anencephalic baby waged a nationwide campaign to
find a hospital that would consent to keep her child on
life-support until the organs could be donated. But that baby was
stillborn.
   One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4
received the heart of an anencephalic baby, but the donor child was
in Canada.
   An infant who received a heart transplant at Loma Linda on
Sunday remained in serious but stable condition. The boy was born
with a fatal heart defect.

<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A caller today claimed the Islamic
Revolutionary Brigades kidnapped a U.S. Marine officer and accused
the officer of being a CIA agent.
   The Arabic-speaking man, in a telephone call to a Western news
agency, said the previously unknown group took Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins out of Beirut ``after he was brought out from
the south.''
   U.N. officials and Shiite Moslem militiamen staged a massive
search for Higgins throughout south Lebanon and virtually sealed
off the area around Tyre, 50 miles south of Beirut.
   In Washington, President Reagan said he wants to rescue Higgins,
but he offered no details. ``We're doing everything we can,'' he
said at a photo session. ``We're trying to find out as much as we
can. We're trying to get him located, and certainly we want to
rescue him.''
   But later, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said,
``I think the president is making a reference there to all of our
efforts to stay in touch with parties in the region, with the
United Nations, to explore every possibility, to see if Colonel
Higgins can be safely returned.''
   In Louisville, Ky., Higgins' father, William F. Higgins, 72,
died of heart failure, said Donna Hazle, spokeswoman for Humana
Hospital Audubon.
   Gunmen on Wednesday blocked the coastal highway near Tyre and
grabbed Higgins as he returned from a meeting with officials of
Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Shiite Amal militia. Abdel Majid
Saleh, an Amal political leader, said he and Higgins had discussed
efforts to free foreign hostages in Lebanon, in addition to other
topics at the Tyre meeting.
   Higgins was serving as chief of an observer group attached to
the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the United
States would continue supplying soldiers for the observer group but
declined to say if any new instructions would be sent to the
Americans.
   The caller said: ``William Higgins has joined the hostages. He
will only come out after he is tried on grounds that he is one of
the directors of the CIA in south Lebanon. Higgins is now out of
Beirut after he was brought out from the south.''
   The caller said a written statement and a photograph of the
captive will be issued soon. Then he hung up.
   There was no way to authenticate the claim immediately.
   The pro-Iranian groups Islamic Jihad, Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, Revolutionary Justice and Holy Warriors
have claimed responsibility for kidnapping 23 of the other 24
foreign hostages in Lebanon. No one has claimed responsibility for
the disappearance of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite.
   U.N. helicopters took off at dawn to join the search for Higgins
but were grounded early today by heavy rain. Troops of the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, and the Amal militia,
the dominant force in the region, searched together through the
night.
   The militia teamed up with UNIFIL to search for Higgins, a
native of Danville, Ky., soon after he was kidnapped.
   ``We hope the kidnappers will have no chance of slipping out
with their captive. That's why all exits have been blocked,'' an
Amal spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Plainclothes militia security men in cars blocked roads along
the Litani River from the Mediterranean coast 25 miles inland to
the slopes of Mount Hermon.
   Uniformed militiamen armed with submachine guns and
rocket-propelled grenade launchers patrolled a 12{-mile stretch of
the coast from the Qassmieh Bridge north of Tyre to the scene of
the abduction.
   ``Our men are searching villages in a 300-square-mile area
north, east and south of Tyre,'' said Daoud Daoud, Amal's military
commander in south Lebanon. ``U.N. troops are blocking the southern
exits.''
   Daoud met today with UNIFIL commanders at the Lebanese Army's
Tyre barracks to coordinate the search. He told The Associated
Press as he went into the meeting, ``We're capable of confronting
the people who've carried out the abduction if need be. But I hope
a quick, happy ending will be accomplished.''
   Security sources said French specialists were dispatched to Tyre
from UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura to interrogate an unidentified
Lebanese bus driver who claimed he witnessed the abduction.
   ``The French have managed to draw a face sketch of the gunman
the eyewitness says he saw pointing a pistol at Higgins' head as he
forced him into the kidnappers' car,'' said one source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Higgins has commanded the 76-member Observer Group, Lebanon,
since Jan. 8. The group, made up of officers from 16 countries, is
attached to the 5,800-man UNIFIL, deployed in south Lebanon since
1978 to police the border with Israel.
   UNIFIL operates in predominantly Shiite areas whose population
frequently have been caught in cross fire between Israeli troops on
one hand and Palestinian guerrillas and Iranian-backed Shiite
extremists on the other.
   Higgins was the third U.N. official to be kidnapped in south
Lebanon in two weeks and the second American military officer ever
abducted in Lebanon.
   He became the 25th foreigner and ninth American held hostage
there. The foreign hostage held longest in Lebanon is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   The first U.S. military officer kidnapped in Lebanon was Col.
Robert Morgan, abducted by Palestinian guerrillas in 1974. He was
freed the same year.
   The other foreign hostages include four Frenchmen, three
Britons, two West Germans, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian, a
Swede, a Norwegian and two unidentified men.

<TEXT>
   Two liberal Democrats are locked in a
close primary battle for a chance to succeed Sen. John C. Stennis,
whose retirement has given Mississippi an open Senate seat for only
the second time in 40 years.
   Stennis, 86 and a 41-year veteran of the Senate, announced Oct.
19 that he would not seek re-election.
   The March 8 primary, which coincides with the state's Super
Tuesday presidential primary _ pits Rep. Wayne Dowdy, a congressman
since 1981, against Secretary of State Dick Molpus. A third
candidate, Biloxi pipefitter Gilbert Fountain, also is on the
ballot but is trailing far behind.
   No one is challenging Rep. Trent Lott, the House minority whip,
for the Republican nomination.
   The Molpus-Dowdy battle, rated a toss-up in the most recent
polls, has been waged mostly in the media. But in recent weeks, the
two contenders have been criss-crossing the state, making brief
campaign stops in a host of towns.
   Dowdy, 44, who gained his 4th Congressional District seat in a
1981 special election, has been stressing his experience in
Washington. Molpus, 38, has been touting his record as director of
federal-state programs under former Gov. William Winter and as
secretary of state since 1984.
   Dowdy, also a former mayor of McComb in southern Mississippi,
was the first candidate to enter tha race after Stennis said he was
retiring.
   ``It was a tough decision to give up my House seat,'' said
Dowdy, adding he felt he could have a greater impact for his
constituents in the Senate.
   Molpus, a native of central Mississippi, said he entered
government in the first place to make ``Mississippi a better place
to live'' and believes he ``can do that most effectively in the
United States Senate.''
   A poll conducted Feb. 12-13 for a Jackson radio station showed
Dowdy with the backing of 40.5 percent of the Democrats questioned,
compared to 35.6 percent for Molpus. Fountain, 47, who ran for
governor last year and finished seventh in the eight-man field, had
2.5 percent, and 22 percent were undecided. The poll of 630
Democrats had a 4 percent margin of error.
   Another poll two weeks earlier for several state newspapers had
Molpus leading 39 percent to 34 percent, with 2 percent for
Fountain and 26 percent undecided. It surveyed 526 voters and a had
3.5 percent margin of error.
   Because Dowdy and Molpus differ little in their political
philosophies, some groups have found it difficult choosing whom to
endorse.
   The Mississippi AFL-CIO gave Dowdy its backing, but said if
Molpus wins the Democratic nomination, its endorsement will
automatically go to him.
   The politically active Mississippi Association of Educators
endorsed both candidates and said it would support the primary
winner.
   Lott, 46, who has served eight terms in the House, says he'll
stress his own Washington experience when his campaign gets under
way in earnest after the primary.
   ``My role as whip in the House has prepared me well, and
certainly after 16 years in the House of Representatives I know my
way around the halls of Washington,'' the Pascagoula resident said.
   The only other wide open fight for a U.S. Senate seat in the
last four decades came in 1978 when Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., won
a three-way fight for the seat that had been held since 1941 by the
late Sen. James O. Eastland, a Democrat and Delta planter.
   Cochran became the state's first GOP senator in a century by
picking up 45 percent of the vote in a battle that included
Democrat Maurice Dantin and black independent Charles Evers. He won
re-election in 1984 with 58 percent.
   Stennis, the nation's oldest and most senior senator, won his
seat in a special election in 1947, taking the place of longtime
state powerbroker Theo G. Bilbo.
   Stennis was a long-time Southern power broker in the Senate,
particularly on military matters and funding. First as chairman of
Armed Services and then of Appropriations, he helped funnel
millions in military projects and bases into the state.
   In addition, Stennis was a major proponent of the
often-criticized Tennesse-Tombigbee Waterway which runs through the
northeast part of the state. Some critics claimed the $2 billion,
234-mile project, completed in 1985, was a classic example of
federal pork barrel politics.
   Stennis never faced a serious challenger until Haley Barbour
left a political post in the White House to make the 1982 race. But
Stennis, then 81, raised a $1 million and ran a slick media
campaign. He wound up carrying all but two of the state's 82
counties and beat Barbour by a 64-to-36 percent margin.

   Physicians concerned for the unborn should not
turn to the courts to force pregnant women to undergo Caesarean
sections, drug abuse treatment or other procedures, two medical
researchers argue.
   Such use of the legal system is unethical and could open the
door to court interference in such personal decisions as whether a
pregnant woman continues to work, the researchers said in an essay
in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``Judicial involvement inevitably invades a woman's privacy,
entails the disclosure of confidential medical and personal
information, and thrusts the woman into the adversarial system,''
wrote Dr. Nancy Milliken of the University of California at San
Francisco and Lawrence J. Nelson of the University of California at
Berkeley.
   Once in that system, the woman ``must defend her choices on a
highly personal matter at a time when she is psychologically and
physically ill-disposed to do so,'' they said.
   George J. Annas, a professor of health law at Boston University
School of Medicine, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that
``the mainstream now is to agree'' with the essay, though some
specialists in infant care still favor court intervention.
   However, Milliken said she and Nelson wrote the essay out of
concern over a survey last year indicating a significant number of
gynecology department heads believed court intervention was
acceptable to force pregnant women to accept treatment on behalf of
fetuses.
   More harm than good results from making adversaries out of
mother and fetus, said the essay, which supports a stand adopted in
August by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   Over the long-term, not only would court interventions undermine
the doctor-patient relationship, but they would necessitate an
impossible task _ defining reliable standards for stepping in, the
essay said.
   ``Forcing women to undergo medical treatment against their wills
is too weighty a matter to be left to the vagaries of personal
interpretation by physicians and judges,'' said the essay.
   The issue comes up most often in court-ordered Caesarean
sections and forced transfusions to the fetus, Milliken said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   ``The extension would be to seek out women for other
behaviors,'' she said. ``That could be anything from smoking to
continuing to work ... sexual activity, if contra-indicated, or of
not following a recommended medical regimen.''
   Milliken and Nelson said: ``We recognize that the behavior of
women who are abusers of alcohol or drugs poses significant
potential for fetal harm.
   ``However, there are solid reasons to doubt that a system of
legal punishment or intervention would decrease the incidence of
this behavior, as it is usually an addiction over which these women
have little control.''

   Douglas Edwards, a contemporary of Edward R.
Murrow and the original anchor of CBS' first network television
newscast, is retiring as of April 1, CBS announced today.
   Edwards said he was ``sad, but a little exhilarated'' by the
prospect of retirement after 46 years with CBS.
   Edwards joined CBS Radio in 1942. When Frank Stanton, then
president of CBS, launched the first nightly television newscast,
``CBS-TV News,'' in 1948, he tapped Edwards to anchor it.
   Edwards was succeeded as anchor in 1962 by Walter Cronkite.
   CBS said in a statement that Edwards, 70, and his wife, May,
would move to Florida where Edwards will continue lecturing on
broadcast journalism and begin work on an autobiography.

<HEAD>Presidential Pardons Expected To Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal felons can take some heart from
President Reagan's 1989 budget proposal. Presidential pardons and
commutations are projected to rise dramatically this year and next.
   In 1987, there were only 23 pardons and no commutations of
sentence. But the budget anticipates 50 pardons and five
commutations in this fiscal year, which began last Oct. 1, and an
additional 50 pardons and five more commutations in the 12 months
beginning next Oct. 1.
   Pardon Attorney David C. Stephenson was not immediately
available for comment on the reasons increases are anticipated.
   Many political figures and legal observers have suggested Reagan
may pardon some of his former White House aides who participated in
the Iran-Contra affair and are expected to be indicted this year by
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Reagan has refused to discuss
such pardons and his aides have said such discussions are premature.
   By comparison, there were 55 pardons in 1986 and no
commutations. Denials and requests for pardons or commutations not
acted upon remained steady at 290 in both 1986 and 1987. There was
no immediate explanation for the drop in pardons in 1987.

   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, on
the heels of disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire,
abandoned his GOP presidential bid today, saying ``today our
campaign lowers its flag, but our crusade continues to march.''
   Du Pont becomes the second Republican to quit the race,
following the withdrawal of former Secretary of State Alexander
Haig last Friday.
   ``You have given me the opportunity of a lifetime,'' said du
Pont.
   Du Pont had hoped to make himself the conservative alternative
to GOP front-runners George Bush and Bob Dole, but he finished far
down in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
   Du Pont took note of his controversial stands on issues from
mandatory drug testing for high school students to elimination of
farm subsidies and said, ``We have moved those challenges forward
to the center of the debate; they are urgent, they are real, they
will not disappear.''
   ``Neither will our efforts to address them. All of us can pause
to catch our breath, none of us should think it time to end our
quest,'' he told about a hundred supporters in his hometown.
   Du Pont, who officially began his campaign 17 months ago,
thanked his supporters.
   ``In America we do not promise that everyone wins, only that
everyone has the opportunity to try. You have given me the
opportunity,'' he said.
   ``You listened, considered and chose. I could not have asked for
more.''
   The former two-term governor finished fourth in a field of five
in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, barely edging former television
evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Du Pont won 10 percent of the GOP vote in New Hampshire, netting
him his first and only two delegates to the Republican national
convention.
   He was never considered a front-runner, instead battling it out
with second-tier candidates Rep. Jack Kemp and Robertson.
   Du Pont's conservative credentials were polished by his
endorsement from Union Leader newspaper of Manchester, N.H.
   Du Pont declared his candidacy Sept. 16, 1986 _ 17 months before
the New Hampshire primary _ making him officially the first
Republican in the field.
   His announcement came in a Wilmington hotel that bears the
family name, one traced back through at least eight generations.
   During the announcement, the 53-year-old former congressman,
state legislator and great-great grandson of the founder of the Du
Pont Co. admitted he was not a public figure despite his famous
name.
   But, he said, ``I'm in a wonderful position. I'm unknown. I'm
underrated, and there's nowhere to go but up.''
   That same day, du Pont took off for Manchester, N.H. In an
interview later that week with the Wilmington News-Journal, du Pont
said if he did not do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, he would pull
out of the race.
   Being first to announce, he drew national attention,
particularly for his provocative stands on several issues,
including mandatory drug testing for all high school students,
creation of a private alternative to Social Security modeled after
IRA accounts, and the replacement of welfare with a mandatory jobs
program.
   Now his political future is unknown.
   He's a Harvard Law School graduate and an attorney with the
Wilmington firm of Richards, Layton and Finger, rated among the
state's most prestigious firms handling corporate law cases.
   He cannot run for governor again, having already served the
maximum two terms. He has said one does not run for vice president.

   Babies whose parents receive a form of
welfare in this southern Maine community won't be ``Pampered''
anymore.
   Selectmen have decided that residents who receive general
assistance, a local form of welfare, cannot use the money to
purchase disposable diapers.
   ``Cloth diapers will be less expensive for the taxpayers,''
Chairwoman Jean Harris said.
   Harris said disposable diapers can cost more than $10 a box, and
some mothers buy up to four boxes each week.
   Selectman W. Robert Donovan was the lone dissenter in Tuesday's
3-1 vote on the issue. ``I'd just like to say, it's not the
1950s,'' he said.
   Local selectmen are permitted to decide how general assistance
recipients can spend the funds. Generally, the money is used for
housing, food, heating, health care and other life essential items.
   About 400 residents will take advantage of Lisbon's $30,000
general assistance fund this year, Town Manager John Baubier said
Thursday.

   Fitness instructor Dick Woit is doing thousands
of push-ups a day, all for the sake of a 7-year-old girl who can't
see.
   The little girl from Turkey, Dilek Erdogan, was born with skin
covering both eyes. She has been in the United States only about
two years and speaks little English. But she and her benefactor,
restaurateur Matt Deletioglu, have won the hearts of Woit and other
residents on Chicago's North Side.
   Woit's push-ups are part of a weeklong fund-raiser at the
Lehmann Sports Club to raise $100,000 for a series of eye
operations for Dilek, who was brought to the United States with her
mother by Deletioglu in 1986.
   Deletioglu, 44, a native of Antioch, Turkey, saw Dilek's picture
in a newspaper from his home country and decided to help her.
   ``I had never met her,'' he said, ``but one picture was worth a
thousand words.''
   For the past two years, Dilek and her mother, Guldane, have been
living with Deletioglu and his family, as doctors at the University
of Illinois Hospital work to open her eyes. Drs. Joel Sugar and
Allen Putterman are donating their services, but hospital bills
have mounted.
   ``It keeps going on and on,'' Deletioglu said. So he went to his
fitness club to seek help in raising money.
   Members of the club, in return, went to other merchants in the
community and put together a weeklong series of events that will
wrap up with a party and raffle Friday night.
   Six weeks ago, Putterman began the first of several operations
that, doctors say, could allow Dilek to see. He took lining from
inside her mouth and used it to start forming an eyelid on the
girl's right side, Sugar said.
   ``In about a month, we hope to reopen her lid and then attempt a
cornea transplant,'' Sugar said in an interview Wednesday. ``Her
condition is called cryptophthalmos, meaning hidden eyes, because
her eyes are hidden.''
   It's likely Dilek will need about six operations on her eyes,
Sugar said. And she will probably never have normal vision.
   ``The likelihood is that her sight will be limited. Our best
hope is that she'll be able to see enough to get around,'' Sugar
said. ``If that fails, at least she can be fitted with a cosmetic
shield to help her appearance.''
   Deletioglu is known in the community for opening his restaurant
to the homeless on Thanksgiving.
   ``I've known Matt a long time, and I know how charitable he
is,'' said Bob Najman, owner of the Lehmann Sports Club. ``When he
told me about her problems, we volunteered to help.''
   Woit raises money by taking on challengers in push-up contests.
The club has pledged to donate $500 to Dilek for any challenger who
beats him; the challenger who loses must contribute Woit's victory
margin in dollars.
   ``It's just something to help,'' Woit said. ``The important
thing is what Matt is doing for this little girl. He's a giver.''

<TEXT>
   Dozens of cars whizzed past a struggle
between a mugger and a woman on the state's busiest highway, but no
one stopped to help her, police said.
   Robin Keeley, 37, a saleswoman from Germantown, Md., became
stranded on the Schuylkill Expressway Tuesday night when she got a
flat tire on her rental car.
   After waiting 40 minutes inside the car for someone to stop to
help her, she was heartened to see a truck driver stop.
   The man was driving a flatbed truck, which he stopped about 300
yards away, she said. As he walked toward her car, she got out and
started talking to him.
   ``He seemed very friendly and helpful,'' she said Wednesday.
``He said he had helped somebody else with a flat tire further
back.''
   But Ms. Keeley said the man then knocked her to the ground and
tried to drag her over a concrete barrier. He finally fled with her
purse when one motorist slowed and honked.
   ``I was screaming and fighting, but nobody stopped,'' Ms. Keeley
said. ``I had one hand out, and I was trying to flag down cars. I
was just waving frantically with the one arm and fighting and
kicking with the other.''
   Police estimated 40 to 50 vehicles passed by during the scuffle,
which occurred about 8:15 p.m.
   ``Ten-to-one, a hundred people saw it,'' State Trooper Stanley
Wells said. ``You're talking about a very heavily traveled section
of the highway.''
   Two anonymous callers reported the incident about 15 minutes
afterward, Wells said. By time police arrived, Ms. Keeley had
returned to her car and had driven it about a mile on the flat
tire, he said.
   The man escaped with a black leather pocketbook containing about
$50, an airline ticket, credit cards and an appointment book, Wells
said.
   Ms. Keeley suffered a bruised shin but did not require hospital
treatment.

<TEXT>
   County health officials are calling for
round-the-clock mobile psychiatric teams to help police handle
disturbed people who may erupt into violence.
   The officials, in a report to the City Council on Wednesday,
recommended placing psychiatric nurses and trained caseworkers at
Parkland Memorial Hospital to be sent out as needed.
   ``Many emergency crises could be effectively interrupted if
professionals were available seven days a week, 24 hours a day to
be dispatched to the scene,'' their report said.
   Law enforcement, mental health and city officials have been
looking for ways to improve treatment and avert violence by the
mentally ill since Officer John Glenn Chase was killed last month
by a disturbed homeless man who grabbed his gun.
   Police Chief Billy Prince told mental health advocates Wednesday
that the Jan. 23 shooting persuaded him to speak out on the need
for better treatment.
   ``We need to help get these people off the street,'' Prince
said. ``If the mental health care had been better, he wouldn't have
been out there.''
   Carl D. Williams, who died in an exchange of gunfire after he
shot and killed Chase in downtown Dallas, had been diagnosed 10
years earlier as a paranoid schizophrenic.
   Prince said that although he earlier laid blame for the shooting
to an anti-police atmosphere created by department critics, he was
unaware of Williams' history of mental illness at the time.
   Some witnesses said a few spectators urged Williams to shoot the
officer; others said they did not hear any such thing.
   County health officials' plan for the psychiatric unit won
plaudits from council members, who said costs and coordination
would have to be examined before a decision is made.
   ``This thing should have been pursued much earlier, before the
Chase shooting,'' said Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Diane Ragsdale.
   Mental health experts estimate that only a small fraction of the
mentally ill may become dangerous. But Prince said officers
regularly deal with ``more than a few time bombs'' who need
treatment.
   ``You're talking about not only a social problem but a
tremendous waste of police resources'' in dealing with the mentally
ill who commit crimes, Prince said.

<HEAD>State Endorses Experimental Sugar Cane Marsh to Save Everglades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state task force has endorsed a
sugar grower's proposal to build an experimental marsh in a cane
field to study ways to protect the Everglades from agricultural
drainage.
   The Lake Okeechobee Technical Advisory Council agreed Wednesday
to encourage the state to develop such plans, but suggested that a
larger test site might be needed in the fields of S.N. Knight and
Sons.
   ``We think it's a good idea and a good approach,'' said Archie
Grant, council chairman.
   Knight offered to build four miniature swamps for the experiment
if the state would extend the grower's lease on 3,700 acres of
state-owned land in western Palm Beach County.
   The action came as the council completed its 50-page interim
report to the Legislature on environmental problems created by
diverting polluted water away from Lake Okeechobee.
   Much of the report focuses on problems in the sprawling sugar
cane-growing region, the 700,000-acre Everglades Agricultural Area.
   The agricultural drainage is damaging the Everglades marshes in
western Palm Beach and Broward counties, and could pose a long-term
threat to local water supplies, scientists have said.
   Council member Garrett Sloan, Metro-Dade's utilities director,
said the outcome of the experiments would be very important for
protecting coastal communities' water supply.
   ``If we can enjoy success with the research into biological,
vegetative methods of nutrient removal, we will all be very happy
along the lower East Coast,'' Sloan said.
   The council recommended a series of experimental projects to
test the ability of artificial marshes to absorb excess nutrients
from farm drainage. It also recommended steps be taken to reduce
nutrients discharged by lakefront communities' sewage treatment
plants, and supported any improved farming practices to reduce
agricultural discharges.
   The panel's recommendations go directly to the state
Legislature, but will not require much legislative action. Most of
the efforts can be carried out by the South Florida Water
Management District without legislative authorization.

<TEXT>
   The parents of a 5-year-old girl
stricken with AIDS have removed her from kindergarten just as
community tensions over the girl's admission appeared to be waning.
   The girl's parents said they decided to withdraw their child
from the Roche Avenue Elementary School to give her more time to
mature and give the community and school a chance to better prepare
for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said
Principal Robert Boulton.
   The girl's removal won't stop efforts to educate parents and
children about the lethal disease, Superintendent Jacob Rankin said.
   ``We're obviously going to plow ahead, not only with parent
information programs, but also with developing AIDS policies,'' he
said.
   Enrollment of the unidentified girl last week had caused concern
by some parents about the safety of their children despite
assurances from health officials that AIDS is not spread by casual
contact.
   Health officials have not said how the girl contracted the AIDS
virus.
   Some parents kept their youngsters out of school earlier in`the
week as a protest. The number of absences fell from 97 on Tuesday
to 42 on Wednesday as attendance returned to normal.
   School officials, complying with state law, refused to provide
any details about the girl's identity or background. The girl had
been examined by the Tulare County Health Department, Valley
Medical Center in Fresno and her personal physician and was deemed
fit to attend public school.
   The girl attended class Feb. 8, but it wasn't mandatory for her
to start kindergarten this year.

   Democrat Bruce Babbitt and Republican Pete du Pont dropped out
of the presidential race today, both declaring their futile
campaigns the opportunity of a lifetime, while most of the
surviving contenders marched south for a campaign blitz leading up
to Super Tuesday's primary trophy.
   Meanwhile, Republican party regulars in Nevada were bracing for
Pat Robertson's ``invisible army'' as they geared up for a
non-binding straw poll tonight. And Democrats were set for
back-to-back debates, starting tonight in Texas, the biggest Super
Tuesday state.
   Babbitt and du Pont became the first post-New Hampshire
casualties.
   ``Today our campaign lowers its flag, but our crusade continues
to march,'' du Pont said in his hometown of Wilmington, Del.
   ``In America we do not promise that everyone wins, only that
everyone has the opportunity to try. You have given me the
opportunity. ... You listened, considered and chose. I could not
have asked for more,'' said du Pont, heir to the chemical-company
fortune.
   Both du Pont, former governor of Delaware, and Babbitt, former
governor of Arizona, said they would not endorse another candidate
for now.
   Appearing at a news conference in Washington, Babbitt said he
was reminded of the biblical saying, ``The truth shall set you
free.'' In his case, he said, the truth _ his poor showings in Iowa
and New Hampshire _ ``came a lot sooner than I expected.''
   Still, he said, ``Today I am free.''
   ``Although I am withdrawing from this race, I am not withdrawing
from the cause that brought me to it,'' he said. ``I don't know why
we fared no better; I'll leave that for others to ponder. But I am
very proud of what we did achieve and I am honored beyond measure
by the opportunity I was granted to take part in this campaign.''
   Babbitt, who formally announced his candidacy on March 10, 1987,
failed to set the electorate afire with his call for a national
sales tax to combat the federal deficit, but received good press
reviews for his candor and wry humor.
   He said today a friend had told him, ``Bruce, you fought a good
fight. You were in it right up to the beginning.''
   Gary Hart, who finished last among Democrats in New Hampshire,
headed home to Denver, where he said his campaign would continue
but not for reasons of ``ego and ambition.''
   Financially strapped Paul Simon, who placed second in Iowa and
third in New Hampshire, backed off his declaration that he must win
contests next week in South Dakota or Minnesota to stay in the race
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   He told reporters at a series of fundraisers late Wednesday,
``We're now hedging on that because of the reaction we've been
getting from around the country.''
   Du Pont entered the Republican race on Sept. 16, 1986, and,
along with Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, sought to present himself as
the conservative alternative to front-runners Bob Dole and George
Bush.
   Bush, who was campaigning in Missouri today, brushed aside
complaints from Dole that he had misrepresented the Kansas
senator's positions on taxes, an oil-import fee and arms control in
a flood of commercials just before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
   ``I'm not going to dwell on it,'' the vice president said. ``I
don't want to be drawn into something like that. Keep it on a high
plane.''
   Dole, who beat Bush in Iowa and had hoped to deliver the
knockout punch in New Hampshire, promised to hit back if attacked
again. Which he was _ by Rep. Jack Kemp, campaigning in Minnesota,
who hit Dole's record on taxes and Social Security.
   The Democrats' New Hampshire victor, Michael Dukakis, hotfooted
it South and took quick aim at Tennessean Albert Gore, who has
hinged his campaign on a strong showing on March 8, when all the
Southern states but one hold primaries or caucuses.
   ``There's a mythology about the South as if it's some kind of
foreign country. It's nonsense,'' said Dukakis, who picked up
endorsements Wednesday from former Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne
Collins and former New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial.
   Told that Gore had said his opponents were alienated from the
voters, the Massachusetts governor retorted: ``Mr. Gore left Iowa,
virtually left New Hampshire. ... I don't know who's alienated.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who finished second in New Hampshire, was
campaigning in South Dakota, which holds a ``beauty contest''
primary on Tuesday in which voters state a preference that does not
commit convention delegates.
   Gephardt strategists said he wanted to head into Super Tuesday
with a recent win under his belt. The Missouri congressman also was
campaigning in Wyoming, which holds caucuses March 5 with 13
delegates at stake.
   Jesse Jackson, who made respectable showings in Iowa and New
Hampshire, was back in the South on a swing through Florida, Texas
and Alabama. In Mobile, he stood with paper workers locked out in a
contract dispute, sounding his campaign call for economic justice.
   The Democrats were gathering in Dallas for the first of two
debates. On Friday they move on to St. Paul, Minn.
   Robertson, in Florida, threatened to reignite the controversy he
kicked off at a GOP debate Sunday when he asserted that there are
Soviet missiles in Cuba _ a claim the White House quickly denied.
   ``In my opinion they are there,'' the former television
evangelist said as he campaigned in Lake Buena Vista on Wednesday.
   Robertson had acknowledged after first making the claim that he
had no direct evidence to back it up.
   In Nevada, where Republicans were holding a straw poll tonight,
GOP state chairwoman Sally Vitkus-McKinney said she had heard
reports that backers of Robertson would try to pack the caucuses.
Followers of the former television evangelist have flummoxed GOP
regulars in several states with massive organizing drives.
   Steve Wark, Nevada coordinator for Robertson, said his
organizing efforts were no different than those of coordinators for
other candidates.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Seek Death Penalty For Nasser's Son in Shootings</HEAD>

   The nation's chief prosecutor said Thursday
he will seek the death penalty for the son of the late President
Gamal Abdel Nasser and 10 other people charged in a series of
shooting attacks on U.S. and Israeli diplomats.
   Prosecutor General Mohammed el-Guindi announced the indictment
of 20 people in the shootings.
   Nasser's eldest son, Khaled Abdel Nasser, and 10 other
defendants will be tried for their lives by a high state security
court. They are charged with murder, attempted murder and
attempting to undermine Egypt's internal security and relationships
with the United States and Israel.
   The other nine, among them Nasser's nephew, Gamal Shawky Abdel
Nasser, face prison sentences up to life. The indictment accuses
them of complicity and covering up knowledge of criminal activity.
   Khaled, 38, is in Yugoslavia, and Nasser's nephew, a physician,
is in Britain. Egypt has no extradition treaty with either country,
and El-Guindi said Egypt will seek help from the international
police agency Interpol to catch them.
   The charges grew out of four attacks in four consecutive years
on U.S. and Israeli diplomats by gunmen in speeding cars. Two
Israeli diplomats were killed and six others were wounded in
shootings between 1984 and 1986. Two U.S. diplomats were wounded in
the last of the attacks in May 1987.
   All the attacks were followed by typewritten statements or
telephone calls to foreign news service offices in Cairo claiming
responsibility from a group calling itself Egypt's Revolution. The
statements opposed Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel, attacked
the United States, reflected pro-Libyan leanings and professed a
pan-Arab Nasserite ideology.
   It was one of the key defendants who reportedly broke the case
by contacting the U.S. Embassy with an offer to sell information
about the group. Embassy officials interrogated him extensively,
then handed him to Egyptian authorities, according to Egyptian
press accounts.
   The indictment listed Nasser's son Khaled, a professor at Cairo
University's Engineering School, as the second defendant after
Mahmoud Nour el-Din el-Sayed Ali Suliman, 47, a businessman and
former administrator at the Egyptian Embassy in London.
   It said the two and Suliman's younger brother Ahmed founded
Egypt's Revolution ``with the aim of committing murder ... and
hostile acts'' against the United States and Israel.
   It said Mahmoud Suliman participated in all four attacks and his
brother Ahmed in some of them.
   In addition to helping form an illegal secret group, Khaled
Nasser was accused of financing it and supplying other ``material
aid'' including firearms, three hand grenades, bulletproof vests
and disguise paraphernalia. He was not charged with participating
in the shootings.
   ``Under the name Egypt's Revolution, these men assassinated and
attempted to assassinate diplomats with the aim of destabilizing
the security situation in Egypt and spoiling relations between
Egypt and those countries,'' el-Guindi said in summing up the
indictment to reporters.
   ``There was no intention to overthrow the government.''
   The defendants included two former military officers and a
former corporal. ``The financing came from abroad, but the
investigation has not showed from where,'' el-Guindi said.
   The tone of statements from Egypt's Revolution and the alleged
involvement of Nasser's son gave rise to speculation in Cairo that
the money came from Libya, whose leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi is a
self-proclaimed disciple of the late Egyptian president.
   The amounts of money the annex said went to finance the group,
including monthly salaries to the defendants, totaled hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   El-Guindi refused comment on the reported involvement of the
U.S. Embassy in breaking the case.
   One such report came from a leading Egyptian newspaper
columnist, Ahmed Bahaa el-Din. He told foreign correspondents last
November that Ahmed Suliman approached U.S. diplomats offering to
sell information and that the Americans' investigation led to the
Egyptians' solution of the case.

<HEAD>Brother Turns Down Leukemia Victim's Request For Marrow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leukemia victim Stephen L. Chapman says it
may be best that his younger brother rejected his request to donate
critically needed bone marrow for a transplant.
   The younger brother, Randy J. Chapman, 31, ran away from home 14
years ago and now lives on the streets of Miami, earning money as a
test subject for medical experiments.
   ``He was a last resort for a match. Being on the streets that
long, he could be sick or on dope,'' Steve Chapman, 38, said
Wednesday. ``There's no telling what he's got. Maybe it's better
that he didn't agree.''
   Steve Chapman, hospitalized at St. Vincent Hospital in
Indianapolis, was urged by his physician to locate the brother
because blood types from other relatives were not compatible for a
marrow transplant. His wife, two teen-age children, a sister and
another brother had all volunteered.
   ``I just had a feeling that he wouldn't do it anyway,'' said
Steve Chapman, of Oolitic.
   Chapman's wife, Cathy, wrote letters to a Miami newspaper and
called the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, Rep. Frank McCloskey,
D-Ind., and others she thought could help locate the brother.
   He was found this week, but Randy Chapman told the Miami News
that he wanted nothing to do with his brother.
   ``I'm not even going to consider it,'' said Randy Chapman. ``If
I sound cruel, well that's the way I feel. I'm not a very forgiving
person. If he dies, he dies.''
   Chapman, on leave from his job as a heavy assembly operator at
the RCA plant in Bloomington, was diagnosed in December as having
leukemia.
   Chapman said his disease is in remission and he hopes to leave
the hospital next week. He said his physician is considering a
treatment used when no compatible donors are available. The
procedure involves removing the victim's bone marrow and treating
it to remove leukemic cells before returning it.
   Chapman said he hadn't talked to his younger brother in 16 years
and wasn't disappointed that he refused to help.
   He said he is not sure what caused the rift between the
brothers, who grew up in Bedford in southern Indiana playing
basketball and fishing together.
   He said his brother ``got into that long-haired stuff'' before
he left Indiana.
   ``We tried to figure out what he was mad about. We just figured
he had a chip on his shoulder,'' the elder brother said. ``Randy
was always a loner. He got worse after Dad died in 1967.
   ``I'm glad he's OK. I'd like to see him,'' Chapman added.

<HEAD>Reagan Proposes Cutting Agriculture Spending by 5 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan proposed on Thursday to cut
spending for agriculture in fiscal 1989 by 5 percent, including
sharp reductions for two major rural development agencies.
   The Reagan budget does not call for new legislation or cuts in
most farm commodity programs. Officials said the one major
exception will be an administration attempt to overhaul the U.S.
sugar program, which includes protective import quotas and price
supports.
   Food programs, including school lunches and food stamps, were
left largely unchanged. A year ago, for example, the administration
sought to exclude children from affluent families from sharing in
the subsidized school lunch program. No such attempt was made this
time.
   The USDA proposals include sharp cutbacks in rural housing
programs operated by the Farmers Home Administration, to less than
$1.4 billion in 1989 from outlays of more than $3.3 billion this
year.
   Direct loans by the Rural Electrification Administration to
electric and telephone borrowers would be replaced by a system of
70 percent guaranteed loans from private lenders. That would mean a
net REA saving of $478 million.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng has previously supported
legislation that would reduce the sugar price support from the
current 18 cents a pound to 12 cents so domestic sugar would be
more competitive with imports.
   Lyng contends the high price supports artificially stimulate
U.S. domestic production, thus forcing the United States to impose
tighter quotas on imports.
   The budget reference to overhauling the sugar program brought a
critical reponse from Dalton Yancey, a member of the executive
committee of the U.S. Sweetener Producers Group, which wants to
keep the current program.
   If the administration prevails, the winners will be ``the giant
industrial corporations that use sweeteners to make soft drinks,
candy and processed foods,'' he said. The losers will be ``hundreds
of thousands of American farmers'' who produce sugar cane, beets
and sweetener-yielding corn, he said.
   On the other side, Tom Hammer, president of the Sweetener Users
Association, called the current program a costly sham paid for by
taxpayers and said ``it is appropriate that this issue be
addressed'' in Reagan's budget message.
   Under the proposed budget to operate USDA in the year beginning
Oct. 1, total spending would be held to $48.3 billion, down from
the estimated outlays of $50.7 billion in the current fiscal year.
   Part of the savings described by USDA budget analysts comes from
the improved U.S. farm economy, a pickup in commodity exports and
general improvements in the agricultural supply-and-demand
situation.
   A report by USDA budget analysts said the department's 1989
spending blueprint ``is consistent with the budget summit
agreement'' reached last November between the administration and
congressional leaders.
   ``The budget does not renew proposals made (a year ago for
fiscal 1988) for new user fees, changes in the Forest Service
payments to states, changes in the food assistance program, or
privatization of the crop insurance program,'' the report said.
``Other than for the sugar program, the budget does not propose
changes in farm price support programs.''
   Most of the cutbacks in the farm commodity programs were already
endorsed by Congress in the Food Security Act of 1985 or in
subsequent legislation. The $76 billion deficit reduction package
approved in December, for example, included a long list of money
savers that will spill over into next fiscal year.
   Cutbacks in target prices for major crops, changes in basic
formulas for price support loans to farmers, and many other
adjustments and reductions were approved by Congress, and are
reflected in the proposed budget for USDA operations.
   The Reagan budget shows total outlays for farm commodity
programs in 1989 dropping to $17.1 billion from a revised estimate
of about $17.7 billion this year. Outlays rose to a record of $25.8
billion in 1986, before declining to $22.4 billion in 1987, also a
revised figure.
   Analysts said the two-year total for commodity program outlays
of $34.8 billion represents a savings of $4.9 billion from
estimates last August for 1988-89 program spending.
   ``Of this amount, $2.5 billion in savings can be attributed to
the provisions of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, and $2.4
billion in savings to improved supply-and-demand conditions,'' they
said.
   But the long-standing drive by the White House to eliminate at
least two rural development programs operated by FmHA took another
turn. Requests were included to operate water and sewer loans at
$250 million, and business and industrial development loan
guarantees at $96 million.
   Some other items:
   _Food stamps, proposed at $12.5 billion, remained virtually the
same as this year. Average participation is projected to decline
slightly to about 18.8 million people.
   _The FmHA would boost its level of farm operating loans to $4
billion from $3.1 billion this year, with guarantees to private
lenders accounting for a larger share.
   _Research and education programs, at $1.19 billion, would be
down from $1.25 billion in estimated outlays this year. Emphasis
would be on groundwater protection, rural development and food
safety.
   _Outlays for marketing and inspection services would be reduced
to $860 million from $871 million.

<HEAD>Reagan Spending Plan Would Cut Force Levels, Weapon Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Thursday proposed a $294
billion military budget that would reduce active-duty forces and
kill cherished weapons programs to comply with a congressional
freeze on his ambitious arms buildup.
   For the first time in a presidency that had earmarked $2
trillion for defense, Reagan proposed significant cuts to American
troop strength _ a drop of 34,000 men and women or 1.56 percent. He
postponed, perhaps killed, such longstanding goals as providing the
Navy a 600-ship fleet.
   He called for retiring hundreds of helicopters and more than a
dozen ships sooner than expected, urged Congress to give up on
development of the mobile Midgetman nuclear missile and abandoned
the ASAT satellite-killing rocket. Navy blimps, Army drones and Air
Force spy planes also fell victim to his budget ax.
   All told, Reagan asked for budget authority totaling $299.5
billion for military programs, of which $294 billion would actually
be paid out during the year starting Oct. 1.
   The fiscal 1989 totals represented increases from the $291.4
billion in budget authority and $285.4 billion in outlays set for
this year _ but not enough to compensate for inflation, the
president said.
   Unlike past years, the administration already had agreed with
Congress on the totals for military spending. That was done last
November in a deal to reduce the national deficit, when the White
House agreed to accept $299.5 billion in budget authority instead
of the $332.4 billion it really wanted.
   Unveiled Thursday, then, were the details of how the
administration had scaled back to reach the new targets. Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci described the changes as painful and
risky, but done to a clear set of priorities that emphasized
quality over quantity.
   ``We've made the hard choices here,'' he said at a Pentagon
briefing. ``We have traded off a smaller force in order to maintain
a quality force.''
   To illustrate what he meant, Carlucci cited a request to provide
military personnel a 4.3 percent pay raise next year instead of the
2 percent planned for civilian workers; a small increase in
spending for operations and maintenance to ensure adequate training
and deployment schedules; and continued production of existing
modern weapons such as the M-1A1 tank and the AH-64 Apache
helicopter.
   In dividing up the 26.1 percent of federal outlays that would go
to defense in fiscal 1989, Carlucci said the administration would
not abandon certain longstanding priorities.
   For example, the Pentagon wants $4.55 billion for the Star Wars
missile defense system, compared with $3.55 billion this year. An
additional $402 million is being sought for Energy Department work
on Star Wars.
   The Pentagon is also asking to continue work on a rail-mobile
version of the MX missile, and is requesting $1.4 billion for
another Trident nuclear submarine, Carlucci said.
   On the other hand, the combined active-duty roster of the Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps will be reduced gradually this
year from 2,172,000 to 2,138,000 and then held at that level
throughout fiscal 1989, Carlucci said.
   The Air Force will be hit the hardest, giving up about 23,000
jobs toward the total 34,000 being cut.
   The Army will deactivate a motorized infantry brigade at Fort
Lewis, Wash., and cancel the scheduled activation of two light
infantry battalions in Alaska. The Navy will scrap plans to
establish a 14th air wing at the Miramar, Calif., Naval Air Station
and retire 16 frigates and one submarine it wanted to keep. The Air
Force will deactivate two fighter wings and start deactivating a
third.
   In other moves, Carlucci and Pentagon comptroller Robert Helm
said:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Army will retire 450 Vietnam-era utility helicopters and
170 scout copters; cancel the Aquila surveillance drone program and
stop production of Copperhead laser-guided artillery shells; cancel
development of the Anti-Tactical Missile and develop only one new
light helicopter instead of two.
   _The Navy will give up its goal of reaching a 600-ship fleet in
fiscal 1989, settling for 580. If Congress and the next
administration agree, the Navy might hit the 600-ship level in
fiscal 1992. The Navy also will kill its new blimp program and
cancel development of a new model of the Intruder attack jet, the
A-6F.
   _The Air Force will deactivate the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing
at Nellis Air Force Base and one other _ either the 401st Air Wing
now in Spain or another one if a new European home is found for the
401st. It will reduce its operation of SR-71 surveillance jets,
relying more on satellites; cancel development of the ASAT
satellite-killer rocket, and place the space shuttle launch section
of Vandenberg Air Force Base into ``mothball'' status.
   Carlucci said he was recommending to Congress that it kill
development of the single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile, but
was requesting $200 million for the program next year to keep the
missile alive long enough for the next administration to decide its
fate.
   Because of the budget environment, Carlucci said he had directed
the services to change their planning guidelines for the four years
after fiscal 1989 to assume after-inflation increases of 2 percent
instead of 3 percent.
   Such growth will be the minimum necessary to reverse four years
of lower-than-inflation increases, he said.

   Final testing of any AIDS vaccine might have to
be done in Africa rather than the United States, because the U.S.
AIDS infection rate is not high enough to determine whether a
vaccine is working, a government researcher said Thursday.
   Such final testing of a vaccine would pose ``a significant
problem in the United States,'' said Anthony Fauci, director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and
coordinator of the government's AIDS research efforts.
   Even among homosexual men, the rate of new infections is no
longer high enough to provide sufficient data on a vaccine's
effectiveness, Fauci said.
   The new infection rate among gay men in San Francisco is so low,
for example, that a test of a vaccine's effectiveness would take
eight years and require thousands of volunteers, he said.
   Fauci testified before the Presidential Commission on the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic, and spoke in a later interview.
   Fauci told the commission he was talking about ``Phase III''
trials, which test how well a vaccine prevents infection. Current
experimental AIDS vaccines are in Phase I trials, meant only to see
whether they are safe and whether they spur an immune response. The
next step, Phase II, aims to find the proper safe dose that gives
maximum immune system response.
   Phase III testing requires the administration of the vaccine to
healthy people likely to be exposed to the disease. These subjects
are then followed for a period of time to see whether or not they
contract the disease.
   In the interview, Fauci said that despite substantial infection
rates among intravenous drug abusers, they are difficult to study
because ``they don't come back'' for follow-up research once a
project begins.
   Given the situation in the United States, Fauci told the
commission, scientists must consider doing Phase III trials in
Central Africa or elsewhere where the new infection rate is still
high.
   He later said Central America or Haiti are other possibilities.
   Fauci said preliminary discussions have begun with the World
Health Organization and with health officials in Central Africa. No
agreements have been reached, he said, but the Africans are
``certainly flexible and open to the possibility of holding these
trials.''
   He also predicted that no vaccine for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome would be available for general use before 1995.
   In separate testimony, AIDS expert William Haseltine of the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute declared, ``nobody can predict with
certainty that an AIDS vaccine can ever be made.''
   But, he said, ``I remain cautiously optimistic.''
   A vaccine is a substance that produces an immune system response
that will fight off infection. There are other drugs that attack a
virus directly.
   Haseltine said the AIDS virus evades the disease-fighting immune
system in several ways, including hiding underneath a surface
coating of sugar that prevents key proteins from being attacked by
immune system antibodies.
   In addition, the virus can infect cells and lie dormant, giving
no sign of its presence to the immune system, he said.
   Even in the absence of a vaccine, he said, virus-fighting drugs
may soon be harnessed to prevent infection. That may be useful for
scientific and health workers who work with the virus, for newborns
of infected mothers, sex partners of infected people and others at
high risk of infection, he said.

   Vincent Gardenia, nominated for an
Academy Award for best supporting actor, says he's been preparing
for his role in ``Moonstruck'' all his life.
   ``I've absorbed my own Italian heritage, and I remember my
father, my mother and my grandfather,'' Gardenia said Wednesday
after the Oscar nominations were announced. ``I grew up in an
Italian community and still live in one in Brooklyn.''
   Gardenia portrayed Cosmo Castorini, a rich plumber who fears
growing old and has an extramarital affair in the hope of regaining
his youth.
   ``I felt he was very real,'' Gardenia said of his character.
``And I thought it was good that we were able to show an Italian
man who was not a thief or any other stereotype. Instead, he was
just an ordinary man, capable of showing emotion and being
sentimental.''
   Gardenia is starring in the Broadway play ``I'm Not Rappaport''
at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center through Sunday.

   Joan Rivers on Thursday praised a judge's
ruling allowing her to proceed with her $50 million lawsuit against
Gentlemen's Quarterly, which published an article saying she wished
her husband dead.
   Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs on Wednesday tossed out an
emotional distress claim Miss Rivers made in the lawsuit. However,
the judge allowed her defamation claim against the magazine and
writer Ben Stein to stand and go to trial.
   ``Thank God Judge Janavs saw the real issue and denied GQ's
motion to dismiss my libel suit,'' Miss Rivers said through her
publicist, Richard Grant.
   The article in GQ's December issue claimed Miss Rivers told a
visitor she wished her husband Edgar Rosenberg was dead before he

   Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Garry
Trudeau says writing for television is similar to drawing daily
comic strips.
   Trudeau is in Nashville for the filming of ``Tanner '88,'' a
two-part show that he wrote for Home Box Office.
   ``This is much closer to what I do in the strip than if I were
writing for a feature film _ this is anecdotal and episodic,
there's less of beginning, middle and end. It's open-ended like the
strip,'' Trudeau said Wednesday on a set of the show, being
directed by Robert Altman.
   ``Tanner '88'' follows the campaign of a Democratic candidate
for president.
   ``I was more interested in exploring the process of a modern
campaign from a backstage point of view,'' he said. ``The candidate
we put together is the one I felt most interested in writing for,
but I could just as easily have written a character from the
right.''

   Director Louis Malle, whose ``Au Revoir Les
Enfants'' received two Oscar nominations, says he drew on his
childhood experiences, especially days at a wealthy boarding school
in France, to write the movie.
   The movie, nominated Wednesday for best foreign film and best
original screenplay Academy Awards, isn't altogether
autobiographical, however.
   ``Imagination used memory as a springboard; I reinvented the
past,'' Malle said in an interview published Thursday in the Los
Angeles Times.
   ``Au Revoir Les Enfants,'' which means ``Goodbye, Children,'' is
about a Jewish boy who, during World War II, is hidden and
protected by monks who run a boarding school. The boy is eventually
betrayed to the Gestapo by a kitchen helper.
   As a schoolboy, Malle befriended a similar Jewish boy, who met
the same fate when someone betrayed the monks.

   Enzo Ferrari went to work as usual
Thursday at the factory that builds the legendary fast cars that
bear his name, and then sat down with his workers at lunch to
celebrate his 90th birthday.
   Ferraris have been a fixture of the highly competitive Grand
Prix Formula One races since he founded the company in 1946 in this
northern Italian town, and the company's exotic sports cars have
appeared in movies and TV series and graced rich collectors'
garages.
   Ferrari had sent each of his 1,742 employees an invitation which
said: ``I expect you for lunch Thursday at the factory in
Maranello.'' But he asked that photographers, journalists and
strangers be kept off the premises.
   Three hundred waiters served lunch near the assembly line.
   The workers each received a miniature reproduction of the F40,
the latest model Ferrari, and a silver medal engraved with the
Ferrari trademark prancing horse. They honored their boss with a
gold plaque.

   Band leader Xavier Cugat was resting
comfortably Thursday a day after he was hospitalized for lung
congestion and hypertension, his doctors said.
   The 88-year-old Spanish-born musician is credited with
introducing tropical rhythms into American popular dance music.
   Doctors at Quiron Clinic said he spent the night in intensive
care.
   A U.S. citizen since he was 12, Cugat gave up a 50-year band
career in 1970 and handed over his orchestra to Tito Puente. Ten
years later, he returned to Spain.
   In late 1986 he returned to the road and night clubs in Spain
with a 16-piece band, three singers and two dancers specializing in
Cuban numbers. Since he returned to live in Barcelona, Cugat has
suffered four heart attacks and a severe stroke.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's $1.1 trillion election-year
budget represents more political accommodation than the seven that
preceded it. It gives Republicans a host of projects to champion
and Democrats a chance to join them in fleeing town early to
campaign.
   Instead of the deep domestic spending cuts and hefty defense
increases that marked past Reagan budgets, the new spending outline
appears designed to avoid fruitless controversy with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
   In any other year, it could have been a budget alternative
drafted by Democratic leaders: a Pentagon spending request that
doesn't even keep pace with inflation, coupled with sharp increases
for education, science, environmental cleanup and the battle
against AIDS.
   And while the budget contains a raft of warmed over cost-cutting
proposals from previous budgets _ sale of government loans,
``privatization'' of Amtrak _ the focus this year is clearly on
innovative new spending programs.
   Much of the fiscal 1989 Reagan budget was already preordained _
courtesy of a two-year framework agreement struck with Congress
last fall that was designed to restore market confidence in the
government's ability to govern in the aftermath of the stock market
collapse.
   That pact set overall limits on defense spending, foreign aid,
domestic spending and new taxes _ removing in a single stoke the
objects of most past White House-Congress budget brawls.
   ``It's a rather unique year,'' Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III conceded on Thursday.
   Echoed Budget Director James C. Miller III: ``Things are
different this year. We have an agreement. Their numbers are our
numbers an our numbers are their numbers.''
   Miller also suggested that, with party conventions and
re-election campaigns fast approaching, no one is going to want to
stay in Washington longer than necessary to engage in protracted
budget battles.
   ``They (Congress) need to work very fast on this budget, and I
anticipate they will do so.''
   And, while Congress was not expected to swallow the Reagan
spending proposals whole, the new budget was better received on
Capitol Hill than any recent adminstration offering.
   ``I think it's a good faith budget,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla. ``It looks like it meets
the (budget) summit agreements. It's right at the targets.''
   Still, the administration went one step further than those
targets in crafting a politically palatable budget document _ in
some cases staking out for itself, territory that previously had
been claimed by the Democrats.
   For instance, after being widely condemned last year for
proposing a nearly $5 billion cut in education spending, the
administration did a flip-flop in the new budget and called for a
$1.5 billion increase.
   Not only does that make political life easier for congressional
Republicans this year, but it also robs Democrats of a potential
campaign issue.
   ``The president has decided to make education a priority,'' said
Education Secretary William Bennett. ``...We think it's good
politics.''
   ``It's pointless to waste time with a budget proposal which
virtually no one in Congress takes seriously,'' he added.
   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell
says that the about-face on eduction shouldn't be a surprise.
``This is an election year. In election years, the Reagan White
House supports eduction. In every other year, President Reagan has
sought deep cuts.''
   In other dramatic changes, the new Reagan budget calls for large
increases in combating acid rain and in cleaning up the nation's
toxic waste dumps _ two programs critics had accused the
administration of neglecting in the past.
   Proposals for $1.3 billion in additional funds for AIDS research
and correspondingly sharp increases in funds for building more
federal prisons, modernizing the air control system and making the
space shuttle safer and more reliable are also likely to play well
in this election year.
   In addition, the administration has thrown Congress another
election-year bone: a rosy economic forecast.
   The administration's budget assumes declining inflation, falling
interest rates and an economic growth rate of 2.4 percent this year
and 3.5 percent next year _ somewhat more optimistic than the
forecasts by private and congressional economists.
   The Reagan economic assumptions would result in a lowering of
the federal deficit from its current $150 billion to $129.5 billion
in fiscal 1989, well below the target in the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, according to the administration.
   By contrast, a recent Congressional Budget Office analysis
suggests that the 1989 deficit could be as high as $176 billion _
even under the budget agreement.
   But, by accepting the White House budget forecasts _ and not
those of its own budget office _ Congress will have an easier time
producing the needed savings to meet the Gramm-Rudman target, at
least on paper.
   And Congress will do just that _ under a revision added last
year when the Gramm-Rudman law was revised.
   Even though a deteriorating economy could eventually bring the
White House and Congress back to the negotiating table to find more
savings, accepting the more optimistic White House projections will
at least buy time for members of Congress _ time to pay more
attention to election-year politics.
   ``This is the year of the big wink,'' said Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

Retarded Son</HEAD>

   An ailing 81-year-old woman tried to shoot
her retarded son to death because she was afraid to leave him ``at
the mercy of strangers,'' her attorney said Thursday.
   Geraldine Sagel was sentenced Wednesday to 30 months' probation
at a nursing home by Circuit Judge William D. Block, who said,
``Sometimes a mother's love puts people in strange situations.''
   The aggravated battery charge carried a maximum penalty of five
years in prison and a fine of $10,000.
   ``It was an act of love and compassion for her son. Being the
only one who had ever, ever cared for him, she felt it her
responsibility to make sure he was at peace before she died,''
Assistant Public Defender Laureen Casey said Thursday.
   ``She had indicated that she wanted to take his life and then
would take her own,'' said Ms. Casey, adding her client suffers
from poor eyesight, emphysema, loss of hearing and is losing her
memory.
   Ms. Sagel of Ingleside admitted shooting her 51-year-old son,
Jack ``Butch'' Sagel, who suffers from dwarfism as well as
developmental disabilities.
   ``I didn't want to leave him behind,'' she told the court from
her wheelchair before sentencing.
   ``I was going blind, my health was failing every day. He would
be on the mercy of the world. I didn't want that, your honor. I
love him too much for that,'' she said.
   Block said Ms. Sagel could have supervised visits with her son,
whom she had been allowed to see only once since her arrest in
early October.
   Ms. Sagel is to spend her probationary period at nearby
Hillcrest Retirement Village, where she has been since her arrest.
She was not taking telephone calls Thursday, said a staff member at
Hillcrest who refused to give her name.
   Jack Sagel will remain at the Waukegan Development Center, where
he has been since early October. Center officials would not discuss
his case, said Belinda Schmidtbauer, who answered the telephone
there.
   Ms. Sagel fired the .22 caliber pistol on Sept. 30 intending to
shoot her son in the heart, but the bullet pierced his shoulder and
then the gun jammed, Lake County Chief Deputy State's Attorney
Michael Waller said Thursday.
   ``I don't think society can condone what she did,'' he said.
``But you can empathize with her feelings. I don't have any qualms
about the outcome.''
   The shooting was reported a few days later by a neighbor who
recognized the bullet wound after Sagel complained that his
shoulder hurt, Waller said.
   Police and prosecutors were unable to question the victim
because of his disabilities, he said.
   ``This case was more of a human tragedy than most criminal
cases. In a lot of cases you view the defendent as a bad guy _ you
can't really say she was a bad guy,'' Waller said.
   Sagel, who has the mental capabilities of a young child, did
small tasks for his mother like going to the store or getting the
paper, Ms. Casey said. He cannot read or write.
   Ms. Sagel shot her son because she ``feared he would be at the
mercy of strangers and be taken for granted and even abused,'' Ms.
Casey said.
   She described the Sagels' relationship as ``the most intense
level of the mother-son relationship I've ever seen.''
   ``When I talk to her about seeing him, she really lights up. She
always says, `Tell him I love him.' Just like a mother.'''

   The House ethics committee recommended
Thursday that Rep. Mario Biaggi, a 10-term New York Democrat
convicted of accepting illegal gratuities, be expelled from
Congress for violating its rules of conduct.
   The committee issued a three-sentence statement: ``The Committee
on Standards of Official Conduct today filed a report with the
House recommending that Representative Mario Biaggi of New York be
expelled. The report will be made available as soon as it has been
printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office. Neither the
committee nor its staff will have any further comment on this
matter.'''
   Biaggi, once the most-decorated policeman on the New York City
force, could become the first congressman since 1980 and only the
second since the Civil War to be drummed out of the House.
   The committee's recommendation must be approved by a two-thirds
majority of the House to become effective.
   The last congressman to be expelled was Rep. Michael ``Ozzie''
Myers, D-Pa. Myers, convicted in the Abscam bribery scandal, was
captured on videotape taking $50,000 from an undercover FBI agent.
Before Myers, no House member had been expelled since the Civil War.
   The committee could have recommended a wide range of sanctions,
including expulsion, censure, reprimand, fine, or loss of seniority.
   Biaggi, 70, pleaded with the ethics committee in December to
keep his Bronx, N.Y., congressional seat. His lawyers had asked the
panel instead to reprimand the congressman, chairman Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., said at the time.
   But the committee counsel recommended expulsion and more than a
month later, the members chose to invoke their harshest punishment.
   In November, two committee lawyers issued a report that said
Biaggi had ``discredited the House of Representatives as an
institution'' after he was convicted of accepting paid vacations in
exchange for helping to steer government contracts toward a
floundering Brooklyn shipyard.
   Biaggi was sentenced in November to 2{ years in prison and fined
$500,000. He is free pending appeal.
   Biaggi was convicted in September of illegally accepting paid
vacations from former Brooklyn Democratic leader Meade Esposito.
Esposito had asked Biaggi to use his influence to help Coastal Dry
Dock and Repair, a shipyard that owed large insurance premiums to
Esposito's brokerage company.
   Esposito, who was convicted of paying gratuities and of illegal
interstate travel, was sentenced to a two-year suspended prison
term. He also must pay a fine of $500,000, serve two years'
probation and perform 500 hours of community service.
   Biaggi faces another trial next month in Manhattan federal court
on racketeering and bribery charges in a case involving Wedtech
Corp., a Bronx defense contractor.

   Israel imposed tough rules on the occupied
territories Thursday that are intended to cripple the Palestinians
economically unless they stop strikes, witholding of taxes and
other acts of civil disobedience.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he would not trade
concessions for an end to 10 weeks of riots in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. ``Those who incite and resort to violence
should not come away with any reward,'' he said.
   An economic boycott of Israel has become a growing
accompaniement to the violence in the occupied lands.
   Israel's new restrictions are designed to hinder the flow of PLO
funds into the territories, and requiring merchants to prove they
have paid taxes could curtail the daily trade in produce and other
goods across the Allenby Bridge between the West Bank and Jordan.
   Arrests were reported Thursday but no casualties in
confrontations between soldiers and protesters in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where U.N. officials say 55 Arabs have been
killed in the violence that began Dec. 8.
   News photographers saw a Jewish settler fire shots into the air
at the Dheishe refugee camp to disperse stone-throwing young
Palestinians, and protests were reported in Arab neighborhoods of
Jerusalem.
   Soldiers arrested 21 Arabs suspected of inciting and
participating in riots in Burka, a West Bank village, Israel radio
said. The military confirmed arrests were made, but said disclosing
the number would violate policy.
   Jerusalem police plan an operation involving 1,500 officers,
some brought in from West Bank towns, who will perform
round-the-clock guard duty in Arab neighborhoods starting Sunday,
the radio said.
   It said police also would arrest suspected ringleaders in an
effort to curb disturbances that are expected later this month when
Secretary of State George P. Shultz visits Israel. City spokesman
Rafi Devara confirmed the report.
   Increasing numbers of the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza have adopted passive resistance to oppose Israeli
occupation, which began when the territories were captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Leaflets and radio broadcasts urge them not to pay taxes to the
Jewish state, work for Israelis or buy Israeli-made goods.
   Only about half the 105,000 Palestinians who worked in Israel
before Dec. 8 now do so. Only a small percentage of Palestinians
have paid taxes so far this year, according to the Arab-run
Palestine Press Service and such Israeli sources as the army's
information center.
   Militants put pressure on Palestinians to keep up the boycott. A
teen-ager stabbed a fellow Arab in the face Thursday, apparently
because he drove Palestinians to work in Israel, Israel radio said.
   ``If the trend continues and takes root, it will become a
serious problem,'' said a senior official in the military
government that administers the territories.
   He said the new financial restrictions require Palestinians to
prove they have paid their taxes before they can travel abroad or
import or export goods, and also must register when they bring
$1,000 or more into the country. The previous limit was $5,000.
   The limitation on money is intended to make it difficult for the
Palestine Liberation Organization to support Arabs who stay away
from their jobs.
   Restrictions on imports and exports could have a serious effect
on the daily trade with Jordan on which Palestinians in the West
Bank are heavily dependent.
   ``We hope this, combined with other measures, will help quell
the disturbances,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``The people have to decide who they should be more
afraid of, the Israelis or the Arab inciters.''
   Mubarak Awad, Arab-American director of the Palestinian Center
for Non-Violence, said the new restrictions would not quash growing
support for peaceful resistance.
   ``What we are going to do is hide our income so we won't have to
pay taxes on it,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We will urge
people to pay cash instead of checks and not to use money changers
or banks.''
   Although the government cancelled Awad's residency permit
because of his calls for non-violent resistance, he has not been
expelled. His U.S. address is Wapakoneta, Ohio.
   The Israeli official said Arabs hurt themselves by refusing to
pay taxes.
   ``We raised about $114 million in taxes from the Palestinians in
1987, and that money goes back into the Arab towns to maintain a
good quality of life,'' he said.
   Israel collects taxes on property, and business and personal
income. There also are import duties, a sales tax and stamp taxes
on documents.
   Discord between Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, his
partner and rival in the coalition government, has been growing.
   Peres, leader of the center-left Labor Party, said Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc had not produced a single peace initiative
that ``paves the way for negotiations to resolve the confict
between us and the Arabs.''
   Shamir said in a speech to the Jewish Agency's board of
governors that Israel should not move too quickly to give the
Palestinians new rights.
   ``There is a need for a considerable period of ... coexistence
between us and the Palestinian Arab authorities before the question
of sovereignty can be approached,'' he said, adding the comment
about rewarding violence.
   The U.S. initiative Shultz will pursue is said to call for
Palestinians to elect new leaders with whom Israel would negotiate
a plan for self-rule.

<HEAD>Administration Forecasts Modest Growth With No Threat Of Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Thursday said the
economy was shrugging off the impact of the October stock market
collapse and would enjoy modest growth this presidential election
year with no threat of a recession.
   In its 1989 budget request, the administration foresaw no storm
clouds on the economic horizon, contending that growth would slow
during the first half of 1988 but then rebound to robust levels in
1989 and beyond.
   The administration's economic forecasts, which provide the
underpinning for its assumptions on revenues and spending in the
budget, have been attacked in the past as ``rosy scenarios'' which
bore little resemblance to reality.
   But this year's version was greeted with less skepticism,
although it was still more optimistic than the outlook prepared by
the Congressional Budget Office and most private economists.
   ``In the last couple of years, the administration has lightened
the tint on their rose-colored glasses although their outlook is
still a lot rosier than we think is justified,'' said David Wyss,
an economist with Data Resources Inc., one of the country's leading
economic forecasting firms.
   The administration derided as ``greatly exaggerated'' the
recession fears stirred by the record 508-point drop in the New
York Stock Exchange's Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19,
contending that the economy had escaped with ``few signs of serious
damage.''
   The administration predicted the gross national product, the
total output of goods and services, would expand at a modest rate
of 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent growth in 1987,
when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986.
   Congressional analysts are forecasting lower growth of 1.8
percent in 1988 and Wyss said Data Resources has just scaled back
its own GNP forecast to 1.4 percent, a full percentage point below
the administration.
   Lower economic growth means less tax revenue for the government
and thus larger budget deficits.
   The administration calls for reducing the deficit to $129.5
billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, down from an
actual deficit of $150.2 billion in 1987 and an estimated $146.7
billion in the current fiscal year.
   In its long-range forecasts, the administration sees the deficit
still at $79.3 billion in 1991, slightly above the $78 billion
deficit the government was running in 1981 when Ronald Reagan took
office with a pledge to balance the budget within three years.
   In its eighth budget to Congress, the administration blamed some
familiar foes for its biggest economic failure, the doubling of the
national debt. The administration placed much of the blame on
Congress for failing to accept Reagan's program of domestic
spending cuts. It also cited the 1981-82 recession, saying the
severe downturn boosted the deficit by $112 billion in 1983 alone.
   The administration conceded that a worse-than-expected economic
performance could doom even its more modest expectations on deficit
reductions. The budget document said that if economic growth is
just 1 percent lower than the administration is forecasting over
the next five years it would add $6.3 billion to the 1989 deficit
and $66 billion to the 1993 deficit.
   In its economic assumptions, the administration forecast:
   _ GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay
above 3 percent through 1993. Many private economists expect the
new president will very likely face a recession in 1989 or 1990.
The current recovery has already lasted a peacetime record of 63
months, twice as long as the normal recovery.
   _ Consumer prices, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise
by 4.3 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four
years to a 2 percent rate of inflation in 1993.
   _ Unemployment will show no improvement this year, because of
the modest growth forecast, but will not get worse, either, holding
steady at the current 5.8 percent rate. In following years, the
jobless rate, which many economists believe is approaching
effective full employment, will dip slightly to 5.2 percent by the
end of 1993.

<HEAD>Former Moscow Party Leader Was Test Case for `Glasnost'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Plenum, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin, the former Moscow Communist Party
chief, had been an outspoken supporter of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of greater openness, but it led to his downfall when his
criticism apparently went farther than the Soviet leader was
willing to allow.
   Yeltsin, 57, was fired from the Moscow post Nov. 11 after he
criticized the party's style of leadership and the slow pace of
Gorbachev's reform policies _ known as perestroika _ during a
meeting of the policy-making Central Committee.
   At the next Centra,l Committee meeting, which ended Thursday,
Yeltsin was dropped from his position as a candidate, or non-voting
member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
   Yeltsin came to Moscow two years ago to take over the party
organization that had been run by Viktor Grishin, who was tainted
by charges of corruption.
   He raised topics that previous officials had left untouched. He
discussed the existence of special food stores for the Soviet
elite, he used mass transit and made unannounced visits to stores
to see if the products were fresh.
   But when Yeltsin was stripped of the job in November, Gorbachev
sharply criticized him for being overly ambitious. In remarks that
were printed in the official press, Yeltsin said he was ``very
guilty'' before the local party organization and Gorbachev.
   Purported copies of his Oct. 21 Central Committee speech that
were circulated in Moscow and printed in some Western newspapers
said he had even criticized the style of Gorbachev's wife, Raisa.
   He was hospitalized for heart problems after he lost the Moscow
party leadership, but since has returned to work in his new job as
a deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee, a position
that carries the rank of a government minister.
   Yeltsin's ouster was seen by some Soviets and Western observers
as a bad omen for the continuation of Gorbachev's policy of
promoting a greater variety of opinions and more openness, known by
the Russian word ``glasnost.''
   Gorbachev acknowledged in a speech to writers and artists in
January that the firing of Yeltsin ``was viewed by some
intellectuals, especially the young people, as a blow to
perestroika.''
   However, he said that was the ``greatest delusion.''

   Republicans in the state Assembly declared
themselves unanimously opposed Wednesday to Gov. Mario Cuomo's plan
to permit distribution of hypodermic needles to some drug addicts
to combat the spread of AIDS.
   The 56 Republicans from the 150-member Assembly approved a
resolution calling for the issue to be submitted to the Legislature
and not handled administratively by state Health Commissioner Dr.
David Axelrod.
   ``The way the free-needle plan was approved is as dubious as the
plan itself,'' said Assembly Minority Leader Clarence Rappleyea.
``The notion of state-subsidized drug abuse is abhorrent.''
   Republican Assemblyman George Pataki called the plan
``constitutionally, scientifically and practically flawed.''
   The Republican resolution said that ``dispensing needles to
addicts not only undermines society's battle against drugs, but
provides a contradictory message to our children who are being
taught to say `No' to drugs.''
   Possession of hypodermic needles without a prescription is a
crime in New York, but the health commissioner has the discretion
to exempt certain classes of people from the law. That's what
Axelrod has said he will do when he and New York City Health
Commissioner Dr. Stephen Joseph settle on the details of a test
program in New York City.
   ``It's a very limited program of only 200 people and a carefully
controlled test of the idea to see if it can change behavior,''
said Axelrod's spokesman, Peter Slocum.
   Cuomo has said the experiment will be closely monitored and
ended quickly if it doesn't have any impact on the spread of AIDS.
   The proposal calls for providing needles only to about 200
addicts who have applied for drug-treatment programs. The
experiment is expected to last for about six months. As part of the
plan, the state is supposed to expand its drug-treatment programs
that are already unable to handle all the applicants.
   Most case of AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, have
appeared in homosexual males or intravenous drug users. In New York
City, the majority of the new cases of the fatal disease, for which
there is no known cure, have appeared in drug users. Researchers
believe that the disease spreads among drug addicts because they
share needles that may be contaminated by tainted blood.

   Three Soviet diplomats arrived Wednesday
to study living arrangements for countrymen who may be stationed in
Utah to monitor compliance with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces
treaty.
   Igor Kripovnov, first secretary at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, Alecsandr Zobkov, an assistant military attache, also
from Washington, and Vladimir Sadovnikov, identified only as a
representative from Moscow, arrived by commercial jet, said Carey
Cavanaugh, a representative from the State Department's office of
Soviet Union Affairs.
   The delegation is here ``just to get a general feel of the Salt
Lake area,'' he said. Three Americans are in the Soviet city of
Votkinsk for a simultaneous visit.
   ``Both areas were identified on the Intermediate Nuclear Forces
treaty as areas where monitoring for the inspection of INF sites
could take place,'' Cavanaugh said.
   Dave Porter, a spokesman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the
delegation would tour the community of Magna, about 25 miles
southwest of Salt Lake City.
   Magna, population 8,500, is a few miles from the Hercules
Bacchus West plant. As many as 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a
compound near the plant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty,
signed Dec. 7 by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The treaty would eliminate all intermediate-range nuclear
missiles in both countries' arsenals.
   The Soviets' proposed INF team would monitor Hercules, which
developed motors for the Pershing II missiles which would be ,
banned under the treaty.
   Porter said the Soviet advance team would not be visiting
Hercules this week. ``They'll see the outer gate of Hercules, but
won't go in at all,'' he said.

   A majority of striking employees at Ford Motor
Co.'s British plants voted Thursday to accept a two-year contract
offer, signaling the end of the country's first major industrial
strike in three years.
   The offer represented the first significant union victory in
Britain in seven years. Ford made several concessions to end the
strike, which began Feb. 8.
   Voter returns Thursday night showed 70 percent of the workers at
the 22 British plants favored the offer, Ford said. The company
said it expected workers to be back on the job Monday.
   The Transport and General Workers Union, which represents
two-thirds of the workers, confirmed that about 70 percent of its
members supported the proposal.
   A final vote count was expected to be released Friday.
   The settlement was worked out in negotiations Tuesday between
company and union officials.
   The company backed down on its demand for a three-year contract,
offering the two-year pact instead, and agreed to a wage increase
of at least 14 percent over the term of the contract.
   Previously, it offered an increase of 7 percent in the first
year and 2.5 percent above the rate of inflation _ which is
currently 3.3 percent _ over the next two years.
   A middle-range worker earned $327 a week under the old contract.
   Ford won some changes in work practices to boost productivity,
but they must be agreed to on the plant level rather than imposed
by management.
   The last major British union victory occurred in February 1981,
when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher backed off plans to close
coal pits after miners threatened a nationwide strike.
   The Ford strike has prompted layoffs of more than 9,700 Ford
workers in Genk, Belgium. It also threatened production at Ford
plants in Spain and West Germany, which rely on parts made at the
British plants.
   The car company said it didn't know when production at the Genk
plant would return to normal.
   Ford said the strike, the to hit the automaker in Britain in
nearly a decade, was costing the company $350 million in lost
production. Ford's British workers last struck in 1978, when they
walked out for nine weeks.
   The strike, combined with a recent walkout by ferry workers and
labor unrest in the state-run National Health Service and coal
mines, prompted concern that there might be a new wave of
industrial strikes and an increase in pay demands in Britain.
   Britain has been relatively free of labor strife since Mrs.
Thatcher's Conservative government came to power and curbed the
influence of Britain's once-powerful unions.
   The last major industrial strike in Britain was a yearlong
walkout by more than 90,000 coal miners in 1984-85. It ended in
defeat for their union.

   A 9-year-old boy who survived almost 40
minutes under water in an ice-covered pond walked out of the
hospital Wednesday, and doctors said he had made almost a complete
recovery from his near-drowning five weeks earlier.
   Kendall Smith was in a coma for two weeks after he fell through
the ice Jan. 12 near his Dillon home, in northeastern South
Carolina. But doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina
Hospital said he progressed rapidly once he recovered consciousness.
   ``We're all humbled as caretakers to see what many of us would
consider, if not miraculous, a near-miraculous recovery,'' said Dr.
Fred Tecklenburg, one of Kendall's attending physicians.
   ``I thank God for giving everyone the knowledge and skills to do
what they've done for my child. It's a miracle,'' said the boy's
mother, Mary.
   Kendall received parting gifts of a new electronic musical
keyboard and a bicyle. He and family members met with reporters
prior to his release.
   Asked how he felt, Kendall shyly said, ``Good,'' and agreed that
while he would have to return to school, he wasn't quite ready to
do so.
   Smiling brightly, the youth wearing black jeans with suspenders,
a blue-striped shirt and a white hat, evoked laughter from
reporters and hospital workers as the keyboard suddenly sounded a
syncopated rhythm. ``I don't know how to play this thing,'' he said
with a laugh.
   Tecklenburg said the keyboard was an appropriate gift because
the first time the youth opened his eyes after the accident it was
to the sound of a similar keyboard.
   Kendall was playing with two companions on the frozen surface of
a pond when the ice gave way. His two friends were rescued quickly
from the water, but it took rescuers almost 40 minutes to fish
Kendall out using grappling hooks.
   Tecklenburg said Kendall is one of only about five children in
the medical literature to have been under water for more than 30
minutes and recovered completely.
   In icy water, the body's metabolism slows and the brain doesn't
need as much oxygen. The reflex is particularly powerful in
children, doctors say.
   Tecklenburg said Kendall tested at his age level on several
standardized tests administered about 10 days ago.
   ``Kendall has very minimal disabilities,'' said Dr. Karen
Powers, another physician who treated the youth.
   She said he may start out going to only a half day of school to
allow his endurance to build up and said he may be seen by a speech
therapist, if needed.
   Mrs. Smith said that during her son's recovery ``everybody kept
telling me to keep the faith and don't give up. All I could do is
keep praying.''
   Cards and letters for Kendall were sent from throughout the
nation and Tecklenburg called it ``a tribute to our country that so
many people have been concerned about Kendall.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, for only the second time in
eight budgets, asked Congress Thursday to increase spending on
education, with much of the extra $1.5 billion going to help
students pay for college.
   The administration also requested modest increases in several
social programs including rental vouchers for low-income families,
drug abuse prevention, foster care and adoption assistance, and
prenatal care for pregnant women.
   But some programs for the needy would suffer cuts under the
proposal, including a $400 million, 25 percent cut in help for the
poor to pay heating and cooling bills. Head Start would be frozen
at $1.2 billion, and other social programs would be left with no
increases or small ones lagging behind inflation.
   The Department of Education's proposed $20.3 billion fiscal 1989
budget is $1.5 billion, or 8 percent higher, than what it expects
to spend this year. The administration asked for budget authority
of $21.2 billion _ fully $7.2 billion more than it sought for the
department 12 months ago.
   The proposed budget adds $590 million to the Pell Grant program
for needy college and trade school students, for a total of nearly
$5 billion, and raises the maximum individual grant in 1989-90 to
$2,300, a $100 increase. Some 3.4 million students would receive
grants that year, up from an estimated 3.1 million this fall and
2.9 million during the current academic year.
   An additional $517 million would be spent on Chapter 1, the
tutoring program for disadvantaged children at risk of academic
failure, bringing it up to nearly $4.4 billion to serve 5.6 million
students.
   The administration proposed modest expansions of magnet school,
drug education, adult literacy and handicapped education programs,
and wants to increase college loans that tie repayments to future
income levels.
   It also asked for a college savings bond program, widely
supported in Congress, with tax-free interest on U.S. savings bonds
used for postsecondary education.
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett, asked to explain the
budget reversal, said, ``It's pointless to waste time with a budget
proposal which virtually no one in Congress takes seriously.''
   The administration has only requested education increases in
1984 and 1988 _ both presidential election years. Asked about the
timing, Bennett said, ``We hope it's good politics. We think it's
sensible.''
   Despite the boosts in some areas, Bennett said he expected ``the
`whine-ometer' will still register'' among department critics. He
was not disappointed.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said his union welcomed `'the administration's
turnaround'' but said there are ``still many gaps in the
president's priorities.''
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, derided the proposal as an election-year ploy ``that
does children ... no favors.'' She said the program for students at
risk serves 1.3 million fewer children than in 1980 and should be
funded at $20 billion to reach all who need it.
   Robert Greenstein, director of the Center for Budget Priorities,
a liberal watchdog group, said, ``It's an improvement over previous
Reagan budgets.'' But he charged Reagan was inflicting cuts on
programs for the needy to pay for a 29 percent boost in the space
program.
   In addition to the reduction in energy aid, Greenstein cited
proposed reductions in aid to soup kitchens, food banks and shelter
for the homeless; low-income rural housing; legal services for the
poor; refugee assistance; community development and community
service block grants; and housing assistance for the low-income
elderly and handicapped.

   Two scientists who reported isolating an
AIDS-related human virus say they now think some original samples
were probably monkey virus, but that scientific conclusions about
it remain unchanged.
   Myron Essex and Phyllis Kanki of the Harvard School of Public
Health, writing in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature,
say certain virus samples they reported in 1986 as HTLV-IV from
healthy Africans should be considered an AIDS virus from monkeys
instead.
   Their virus has since been found in humans.
   It is now considered to be HIV-2, a virus restricted chiefly to
West Africa that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The
AIDS virus found in the United States is called HIV-1.
   The Harvard scientists' statement accompanies a report by
researchers at the New England Regional Primate Center in
Southborough, Mass. The report gives evidence that original HTLV-IV
samples were actually monkey virus that had contaminated human
cells in the laboratory.
   The study reports unusually strong similarities between the
HTLV-IV samples and a ``simian immunodeficiency virus'' found in
macaques.
   Essex, in a telephone interview, said the new data made it
likely that some original HTLV-IV samples were monkey virus. He
also said he knew of no subsequent studies that would have to be
considered invalid because of the mistake.
   In a Nature editorial, Carel Mulder of the University of
Massachusetts Medical School at Worcester said the original
misidentification will not affect results of epidemiological
studies of the virus by Essex and Kanki.
   But the incident should serve as a warning to virologists, he
wrote. He said he knew of, or has been told of, at least five
instances in other American and European laboratories where cells
were accidentally infected with HIV-1 in the laboratory.
   In the past, several scientists have said they suspected
laboratory contamination in the original report of HTLV-IV.

   President Reagan on Thursday declared that
AIDS is his ``highest public health priority'' and asked Congress
for a 38 percent budget boost, to $1.3 billion, to combat the
deadly and spreading disease.
   In addition, the budget envisions spending $736 million under
Medicaid and Medicare to care for people already suffering from the
illness.
   Congress consistently has appropriated more than Reagan
requested for AIDS, but the general outlines for the fiscal 1989
proposal were worked out in closer consultation than in previous
years and Congress is not as likely to vote a large addition this
year.
   For example, Reagan's initial request for AIDS spending for
fiscal 1988 was $534 million, compared with the $951 million
eventually approved by Congress.
   For fiscal 1987, Reagan initially requested $213 million for
AIDS and Congress wound up allocating $502 million.
   The huge jump for AIDS spending stands out even more starkly
when compared with the net increase of 5.8 percent proposed for
overall operation of the 250 programs administered by the
Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees roughly a
third of all federal spending.
   The total HHS budget is to rise from $375.1 billion to $396.8
billion.
   But the bulk of that _ nearly 95 percent _ goes for so-called
entitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare and
Medicaid, over which the administration has marginal control
because basic eligiblity criteria _ including treatment of AIDS
patients _ are laid down by law.
   Social Security's old age and disability programs alone are
expected to grow by $14 billion, or 6.4 percent, to $233.8 billion.
That includes money for new recipients coming onto the rolls as the
population ages as well as an anticipated 4.2 percent
cost-of-living increase next January for all 38 million
beneficiaries.
   Medicaid, the state-federal health program for poor people, will
cost the federal government $32.7 billion in 1989, up 7 percent
from $30.7 billion currently.
   Much of the Medicaid increase is attributed to additional
spending on AIDS patients, an estimated 40 percent of whom qualify
for the program either when they first contract the disease or soon
afterward because they become unable to work.
   Medicaid spending on AIDS is estimated at $375 million this year
and is budgeted to grow to $600 million next year.
   Medicare spending for 33 million elderly or disabled workers is
projected to rise to $84 billion from $78.9 billion.
   The most controversial part of the HHS budget is likely to be
Reagan's proposal for $1.2 billion in Medicare cuts he says are
necessary to meet the deficit-reduction targets that Congress and
the administration agreed to in December.
   Those differences largely boil down to disagreement over whether
Congressional Budget Office projections of overall Medicare
spending are more accurate than those projected by the Office of
Management and Budget.
   Deficit negotiators agreed previously to cut $3.5 million from
Medicare and the administration argues that the $1.2 billion cut in
its proposal will be needed to meet that target.
   The chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate
Finance Committee already have written to the White House
expressing determination to fight the additional cut.
   Of the $1.2 billion in question, about $1 billion would come
from reducing special payments made to large teaching hospitals to
help cover educational costs of interns.
   At a briefing on the HHS budget, department chief of staff
Thomas Burke cited a recent inspector general's finding that the
teaching hospitals' Medicare profits are 2{ times that of their
non-teaching counterparts.
   ``It would seem these hospitals are going to be able to absorb
this reduction,'' Burke said.
   The other $200 million in savings would come from limiting
Medicare payments for durable medical equipment, reducing payments
for radiology and anesthesiology services, closing ``a loophole in
payments for home dialysis treatment for end-stage renal disease,''
more intense of physician claims, and by making permanent the
existing requirement that Medicare Part B monthly premiums _ now
$24.80 _ cover 25 percent of the program costs.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   The Centers for Disease Control reports that as of Jan. 25,
1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 51,916 Americans, of whom more
than half, or 28,965, have died since 1979. No one is known to have
recovered from AIDS.

   Here are excerpts from the text of Thursday's
address to the Communist Party Central Committee by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as translated into English by Tass, the
official Soviet news agency:
   (Education)
   There is absolutely no doubt that everything that concerns
school, education and upbringing is directly linked to the
development of socialism, to perestroika. Moreover, it is its major
direction.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The teacher is a major protagonist of perestroika. Should he
support us with conviction, sense and passion, perestroika will
gain many new sincere advocates and fighters, successors to the
revolutionary socialist cause.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   He must be relieved of petty patronage, suspicion towards his
pursuits and findings must be lifted. He should be relieved of
duties other than teaching, his time and strengyh must be released
for the main thing.
   All obstacles and barriers in the way of innovation in
pedagogics must be removed, decent material conditions must be
created for the teacher's creative endeavor.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   (Socialism and past mistakes)
   Over 70 years our party and people have been inspired by the
ideas of socialism and have been building it. But because of
external and internal causes we have been unable to fully realize
the Leninist principles of the new social system.
   This was seriously hampered by the cult of personality, the
system of management by command and administration that formed in
the thirties, bureaucratic, dogmatic and voluntarist aberration,
arbitrariness, and late in the seventies _ early in the eighties _
lack of initiative and hindrances that have led to stagnation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   These phenomena and what has remained of them and come down to
the present should become things of the past.
   In this lies the answer to those who express their doubt if we
are not retreating from socialism, from its foundations laid down
by generations of Soviet people.
   No, we do not retreat if only a step from socialism, from
Marxism-Leninism, from everything that has been gained and created
by the people. But we decisively reject dogmatic, bureaucratic and
voluntarist legacy as it has nothing in common either with
Marxism-Leninsim or with genuine socialism.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Free competition of minds is needed. Our social thinking stands
to gain from this. Its prognosticating capacity will be enhanced
and, hence, its ability to serve as a reliable basis for working
out the party's policy will increase.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   (Nationalities)
   True internationalism, true friendship of peoples are possible
only if there is deep respect for dignity, honor, culture, language
and history of every people, extensive relations among them. We
ought to facilitate in all ways the further broadening of contacts
between national cultures, their mutual enrichment, their
development and flourishing.
   Soviet patriotism is the greatest of our values, any
manifestations of nationalism and chauvinism are incompatible with
it. Nationalism in any form is blind, attempts at self-isolation
lead only to a spiritual blind alley. The knowledge and
understanding of the scope, grandeur and human specifics of
socialist revolution, the struggle of the party and the people,
full of truth and heroic spirit, and defense of socialist
motherland feed the roots of Soviet patriotism. Here we approach a
very important issue _ unification through revolution and Soviet
power of national honor and national heritage of every people and
internationalism of socialist society.
   In short we should set to thoroughly tackle nationalities policy
at the present stage _ in all areas, including theory and practice.
This is the most fundamental, vital issue of our society. I think
that one of the plenums of the central committee should be devoted
to problems of nationalities policy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   (Politics)
   We should firmly pursue the line of reinforcing the legal levers
of perestroika, first of all to prevent the law on state
enterprises and other legal instruments for economic reform from
being diluted with all manner of departmental instructions and
directives.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The main problem in developing our political system is to create
a mechanism of power and government with precisely regulated
effective democratic control and corresponding legal procedures
which would drastically diminish and even reduce to naught the
element of chance in handling major political, state issues and
preclude the possibility of subjectivity at all floors of our
political system.
   It is necessary to achieve that decisions of principled
importance be worked out and adopted with the people's active
participation. This will correspond to our socialist democracy.
   Priority should be given to cardinally changing the role of the
soviets (governing councils) as the core of the political system of
our society and its embodiment in state bodies.
   It is in the way the soviets are formed and function that the
democratic principles of socialism must be realized in the first
place.
   In a sense, we are talking today about the need to revive the
Soviet system of government in Lenin's interpretation. We should
make the soviets at all levels agencies of state authority and
administration that will be really working, demonstrating
initiative and enjoying full rights.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We should take account in the soviets of the entire diversity of
our country, including national features.
   And, of course, we should not bypass the Supreme Soviet of the
U.S.S.R. We are to re-think its role so as to increase the
effectiveness of its activites, starting from the presidium and
full-scale parliamentary sessions and ending with the work of the
commissions and individual deputies.
   The key issue of reform in the political system concerns
delimiting the functions of party and state bodies.

unanimously ruling that the statute gives police too much leeway in
deciding when people are breaking the law.
   The anti-loitering law prohibits people from sleeping in
transportation facilities or staying there without giving
authorities a ``satisfactory explanation'' of what they're doing.
   The New York Court of Appeals said in its 7-0 decision, ``Such a
generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct calculated to
cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent, thereby
failing to give (a person) adequate notice of what conduct is
prohibited.''
   The court ruled in favor of two New York City men arrested in
1985 for loitering in separate incidents at Penn Station and the
Port Authority Bus Terminal. Both were charged with other crimes
after their arrests.
   The court said the law gives too much latitude to a police
officer to decide whether a person's explanation is satisfactory.
That, Judge Vito Titone wrote, makes the law unconstitutional.
   Simply requiring a person to explain his actions also violates a
citizen's right to remain silent when questioned by police, the
court said.
   ``He (a suspect) is faced with the choice of either forgoing his
constitutional right to remain silent in the hope that his
explanation will satisfy that particular law enforcement official,
or invoking his constitutional right to remain silent and being
arrested,'' Vitone wrote.
   Barbara Sheehan, who argued the case for the district attorney's
office, said Wednesday she would withhold comment on the decision
until she has a chance to read it.
   Michele Maxian, a Legal Aid attorney who represented the two men
arrested for loitering, said the district attorney's office argued
that overturning the law would make train stations and the Port
Authority terminal havens for the homeless.
   But if the law is no good, lawyers can't worry about the
unsavory impact of striking it down, she said.
   ``This decision is for ordinary people,'' she said. ``It says
that you can be in the Port Authority terminal and not be subject
to the whim of a transit police officer as to whether you have the
right to be there.''
   Police still have plenty of ways to protect people from crimes,
Maxian said, citing laws against begging, trespassing and
disorderly conduct. She said police often used the loitering
statute to arrest people they suspected of drug activities when
they hadn't seen them engaged in actual criminal behavior.
   ``Police are still going to be able to arrest people for doing
crimes,'' she said, ``but they can't just arrest people for being
suspicious.''
   The Court of Appeals decision' upheld previous determinations in
the cases by the state Supreme Court and the Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court, two lower state courts.

<HEAD>Arrests And Mess Are Measures Of Carnival Success</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A record-breaking mess and fewer arrests were
two measures of success for what may have been New Orleans' biggest
Mardi Gras. But another, grimmer statistic _ three deaths _ dimmed
the Carnival afterglow.
   Carnival season begins each Jan. 6 and builds to a raucous
climax on Mardi Gras, French for Fat Tuesday, the day before the
start of the Christian Lenten season.
   Police started keeping track of arrests Feb. 5, the day of the
first major parades. And sanitation crews started weighing the
morning-after garbage the next day.
   While some people use the intensity of their hangovers to gauge
how much fun they had, Cecil MacFarland uses the weight of the
garbage his sanitation crews pick up during the 12-day parade
season to judge Mardi Gras' success.
   ``We haven't finished that,'' MacFarland said when asked if he
had totalled up the tonnage yet. ``It's gonna take me another three
days.''
   MacFarland said close to 2,000 tons of garbage already had been
collected by noon Wednesday.
   ``We think we may pass last year's record breaker of 2,001
tons,'' he said.
   Although garbage was up, arrests were down. Police Capt. John
Hughes said there were 1,621 arrests for various offenses. A year
ago it was 1,948 and two years ago it was 2,072, Hughes said. He
attributed the declining numbers to ``people behaving themselves.''
   Although police say exact crowd estimates are difficult to make,
veteran officers said Tuesday's crowds within the city limits were
among the largest they've seen and likely surpassed the million
mark. That was good economic news for a city experiencing hard
times; a recent University of New Orleans study indicates that a
good Carnival crowd can pump as much as $275 million into the
economy.
   While crowds were generally well behaved, getting too close to
moving carnival vehicles cost two lives.
   Witnesses at a parade in suburban Jefferson Parish said
11-year-old Michael Dupree darted under a decorated truck to grab
Carnival trinkets tossed by riders and was crushed by the wheels of
the slow-moving vehicle. He had grabbed items that had landed under
other parade vehicles and had been warned by deputies and his
sister to stay clear of the vehicles, witnesses said.
   In a separate incident in New Orleans, a man ran into traffic
after a paade and tried to hop aboard a ``truck float'' that was
leaving the city. He fell beneath the wheels of the tractor-trailer
rig. His identity had not been confirmed Wednesday afternoon.
   The area had not recorded such parade-related deaths since 1983.
   Another apparent fatality occurred when an officer with the
Mississippi River Bridge Police assigned to help control Mardi Gras
crowds on a ferry slipped into the river as he helped pull aboard a
woman who had fallen off the vessel. He disappeared in the water.

<HEAD>Award Reduced From $10.5 million to $375,000 for Woman Struck by
Bottle Cap</HEAD>

   A judge Wednesday reduced the award to an
83-year-old woman struck in the eye by a soda bottle cap from $10.5
million granted by a jury to $375,000.
   Third District Judge Kenneth Rigtrup said that jurors were
``inflamed with passion'' when they recently made the award to Mae
L. Roberts of Holladay.
   ``The award of $10 million appears to be disproportionate and
unreasonable,'' Rigtrup said at a post-trial hearing. He awarded
$75,000 in compensatory and $300,000 in punitive damages.
   Roberts was struck in the eye when an aluminum twist cap blew
off a 7-Up bottle she was opening. As a result of the injury, the
sight in Roberts' left eye was impaired.
   Rigtrup said Roberts could accept his judgment, request a new
trial within 15 days or appeal the decision.
   Although there was no evidence that Roberts' means of support
was damaged by the accident, the judge said, 7-Up's actions
warranted a judgment for significant injury to her eye.
   The company knew of the potential danger caused by the bottle
caps since the late 1960s and has ``irresponsibly'' not remedied
the problem, Rigtrup said.
   In arguing for 7-Up, Robert Henderson said new owners and
management are concerned about the bottle cap problem and have
taken steps to address the issue, but solutions do not come swiftly.
   He said between 1986 and 1988 the company knew of only one
incident in which someone was injured with a bottle cap.
   Henderson acknowledged 7-Up is partly to blame for the accident,
but the fact that Roberts' was attempting to open the bottle with
pliers shows that she also was at fault.
   Defense attorney Colin King said he will discuss the possibility
of an appeal and said his ``spunky'' client just may seek a new
trial, despite her age.
   ``I'm as shocked about the judge's decision as I was with 7-Up's
refusal to adjust the problem (caused by unsafe bottle caps),''
Roberts said. ``This is a sad day for consumers.''

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and three
aides will apply to travel to Australia next month to attend an
international trade union meeting, a spokesman for the banned
Polish union said Wednesday.
   Spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said Walesa has been invited to
Melbourne on March 14-18 to attend the World Congress of the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
   The invitation was extended by the Australian Confederation of
Trade Unions, Onyszkiewicz said.
   Contacted at home in Gdansk, Walesa said he received the
invitation and would like to make the trip, but declined further
comment.
   Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, has not left
Poland since the union was declared illegal after the 1981
imposition of martial law. He once applied for a passport to travel
abroad but did not receive it for ``technical reasons,'' Walesa
said.
   Onyszkiewicz said Walesa would complete his passport application
for the Australian trip very soon, but the spokesman said he was
not optimistic it would be granted.
   Three other Solidarity leaders also hope to make the trip, said
Onyszkiewicz. They are Bogdan Lis, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk and
Bronislaw Geremek.

   Actor Matthew Broderick, who was fined the
equivalent of $175 for his role in a fatal car crash in Northern
Ireland, issued a statement Wednesday saying he was pleased that a
charge of reckless driving against him had been dismissed.
   The court decision, reached Monday in Enniskillen, has been
denounced as a travesty by John Gallagher, whose wife, Anna, 28,
and mother-in-law, Margaret Doherty, 60, were killed in the crash
Aug. 5.
   Broderick suffered a broken leg in the crash and his passenger,
actress Jennifer Grey, was not hurt.
   Broderick remained in New York while a magistrate fined him for
careless driving. He was originally chared with reckless driving.
   ``I'm glad the court decided that there was no basis for
charging me with reckless driving,'' Broderick's statement said.
``There was never any evidence for that charge. They also
determined that the details of the accident will never be fully
known. However it happened, it was a tragedy.''
   Publicist Wendy Morris said Broderick planned to try to speak
with the victims' family, ``but he doesn't think now is the right
time.''
   She said Broderick had written the family but did not know
whether he received an answer.

<HEAD>NRC Orders Immediate Suspension Of Use Of Ionizing Air Guns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Thursday ordered an
immediate suspension of the use of an industrial device which has
leaked tiny particles of radioactive polonium at plants around the
nation.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also ordered the 3M Corp. to
recall for inspection all 45,000 of the suspect devices, ionizing
air guns used to control static electricity and remove dust from
product containers.
   Robert Bernero, deputy director of the NRC's office of nuclear
materials safety, said that of 828 plants inspected so far,
``detectable'' _ though virtually harmless _ contamination had been
found at 118 sites. Of those, he identified 39 plants where the
radiation exceeded the reportable limit of .005 microcuries.
   ``This is an incomplete list,'' said Bernero. ``It changes
daily.''
   Last week, the NRC issued successive recalls of particular 3M
models used in the food, beverage, cosmetic and drug industries,
involving about 2,500 units. The latest order affects all
industries and applies to all the devices made since they were
first marketed in 1965.
   Echoing earlier reports, NRC and Food and Drug Administration
officials said Wednesday they still have no evidence that the
faulty devices have posed any health hazard, either to workers at
plants where radioactive contamination was found or to consumers of
the products made at those facilities.
   Bernero said in more than 1,000 tests of product samples, there
was only once instance in which radiation was detected, involving a
food supplement made by Ross Laboratories of Altavista, Va. In that
case, the amount was so low it could have involved naturally
occuring radiation, he said.
   But he cited another case, involving Moto Photo of North
Dartmouth, Mass., where he expressed greater concern about what the
inspectors don't know, rather than what they found. That facility
is in a shopping mall, he said, and how much of the leaked
radioactive material ``might have been tracked out into the mall is
just unknown.''
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech said the suspension and broadened recall
order was necessary in light of the growing list of plants where
inspectors found the devices had failed, leaking microscopic
ceramic spheres containing polonium 210, which emits a weak form of
radiation incapable of penetrating the skin but which could prove
harmful if ingested in sufficient amounts.
   FDA Administrator Frank Young said ``we're doing this to ensure
there's not the rare gun out there that's leaking a lot more than
anything we've found so far.''
   Ted L. Pickens, a 3M spokesman, said ``we're certainly going to
comply'' with the order. ``In this business you want to react with
integrity and ensure confidence,'' he said. At the same time,
Pickens underscored the findings by federal officials that no
health hazard appears involved.
   Pickens declined to estimate what the recall and inspection
order would cost the company, but said it would have no major
effect on its overall treasury.
   Polonium 210, a naturally occuring decay product of radium,
emits alpha rays too weak to penetrate the skin. Though it could
prove a health threat if inhaled or swallowed in sufficient
amounts, authorities say the protective ceramic covering on the
material used in the 3M guns should preclude that danger. They say
the particles are too heavy to be inhaled, and the leaked material
in most cases fell harmlessly to the floor. Even if ingested, the
shell, if intact, would pass through the body without harm in two
to four days, they say.
   However, Young and others have expressed concern that some of
the shell could be crushed or cracked, allowing more radiation to
escape. Young said that if one of the particles were absorbed, it
would yield about 4 rem of radiation. By comparison, the average
cigarette smoker absorbs about 6 rem of polonium radiation in a
year.
   Bernero said NRC investigators had found evidence in internal 3M
records that from 0.04 percent to 0.9 percent of the guns,
depending on the model, were faulty, even though the company
reported far lower failure rates.
   By late last week, the government had identified 28 plants were
contamination was found. The facilities just added to that list are:
   Ford Motor Co.'s paint plant at Utica, Mich.; the Dial Corp.
microwave lunch packaging plant at Ft. Madison, Iowa; the Pro
Corp., of Florence, Mass., maker of plastic cases for computers;
the K-Mart film processing plant at Garland, Texas; the Micro
Technology electronic chips plant at Boise, Idaho; Miller Container
of Milan, Ill.; McLaughlin Body Co. of East Moline, Ill.; Super
Photo of New Orleans, and Moto Photo and Ross Laboratories.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Dropped from Politburo, Gorbachev Asks Political Reform</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material and editing throughout, UPDATING with new
quotes, details, Gorbachev call for political reforms at June
conference. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders Thursday dropped Boris N.
Yeltsin, the outspoken former Moscow party chief, from the ruling
Politburo and promoted officials charged with reforming economic
planning and party personnel.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech to the Communist
Party Central Committee, also said a party conference in June would
be called on to adopt major political reforms ensuring the rule of
law over personal will.
   He said the Central Committee should devote a future session to
the problems of the country's more than 100 nationalities. Ethnic
groups in the Baltic republics and elsewhere have been agitating
for greater autonomy or outright independence.
   The official Tass news agency announced the leadership changes
at the end of a two-day meeting of about 300 members of the
policy-making Central Committee in Moscow. The committee also
adopted major educational reforms.
   The Central Committee ``freed Comrade B.N. Yeltsin from his
duties as a candidate member of the Politburo,'' Tass said.
   Georgy Razumovsky, 52, and Yuri D. Maslyukov, 50, were named
candidates, or non-voting members of the Politburo.
   For the past two years, Razumovskya, a Gorbachev protege, has
been a secretary of the Central Committee in charge of appointing
party personnel. Maslyukov was named this month to head the State
Planning Committee, the government body in charge of planning the
state-run economy.
   Yeltsin supported Gorbachev's policy of greater openness but his
criticism apparently went farther than Gorbachev was willing to
allow.
   On Nov 11, Gorbachev ousted the strapping, 57-year-old Yeltsin
from his position as Moscow party leader. At the last meeting of
the Central Committee, on Oct. 21, Yeltsin criticized the pace of
reform and the leadership style of the Communist Party. He had
offered to quit.
   Yeltsin was transferred to first deputy director of the State
Construction Committee, with the rank of government minister.
   Yeltsin's fate was seen as a test by many in Moscow of how far
Gorbachev would carry his policy of allowing greater openness and
differences of opinion.
   Gorbachev said last January it was a ``delusion'' to view
Yeltsin's dismissal as a blow to his restructuring policies. He
said Yeltsin was overly ambitious.
   The Soviet leader gave the clearest indication yet of the
problems he wants to attack at the party conference, the first
since the 1940s.
   He said he intends to reform, not replace, the present system,
and that the dominance of the Communist Party is not in question.
   ``The main problem in developing our political system is to
create a mechanism of power and government ... which would
drastically diminish and even reduce to naught the element of
chance in handling major political, state issues and preclude the
possibility of subjectivity at all `floors' of our political
system,'' he said.
   ``Subjectivity'' was an apparent reference to the personal wills
of earlier Soviet leaders such as dictator Josef V. Stalin and
Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   Gorbachev called for strengthening the electoral system, local
governing councils and the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament.
He called for a sharper distinction between the role of government
organizations and party groups, but provided no details.
   The Central Committee, the only body empowered to make changes
in the ruling Politburo, did not touch the list of 13 full voting
Politburo members.
   Razumovsky's appointment was a clear victory for Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev must have an ally in charge of appointing party
personnel in order to overcome the resistance to his reforms in
many layers of the vast Soviet bureaucracy.
   Maslyukov, a defense industry expert, replaced Nikolai V.
Talyzin, who had been criticized by Gorbachev. Talyzin was shunted
to chairmanship of a little-known government commission, but kept
his candidate status on the Politburo.
   Oleg D. Baklanov, 55, minister of general machine building, was
chosen to become a secretary of the Central Committee.
   Gorbachev told the Central Committee the country faces a ``most
serious financial problem.''
   He said a drop in world commodity prices and the loss of income
from alcohol sales due to his campaign against drunkenness had hurt
the Soviet economy. The Soviet Union depends on oil and natural gas
for a substantial percentage of its export income.
   He said the top priority is improving food, housing and consumer
goods, and said his policies have made progress in those areas.
   Gorbachev rejected claims that his reforms are pulling the
Soviet Union away from socialism. At the same time, he defended his
policy of ``glasnost'' or greater openness, and criticized the
mistakes of former leaders Stalin, Khrushchev and Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
   Gorbachev reiterated Soviet criticism of U.S. conservatives and
some European leaders for urging the Western alliance to upgrade
its weapons systems to make up for U.S. missiles that will be
withdrawn from Europe.
   Regarding Afghanistan, Gorbachev said the war there long had a
``direct and deep impact on the feelings of Soviet people.'' He
said he had been seeking a way out of Afghanistan since he took
power almost three years ago.
   Gorbachev said Feb. 8 the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers
could be pulled out in a 10-month period beginning May 15 if
U.N.-sponsored talks can reach an agreement.

<HEAD>Donor Shortage May Force Rethinking on Use of Artificial Hearts As
Bridges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heart transplantation probably has reached
its peak because of a nationwide shortage of donor organs, and that
may force doctors to re-evaluate the use of temporary artificial
hearts, prominent surgeons said Thursday.
   Because of complications related to their long-term use,
artificial hearts have been used in the past few years strictly to
keep patients alive pending the receipt of donor hearts.
   But at an opening-day session of a conference on thoracic organ
transplantation, surgeons discussed the possibility that use of the
devices as bridges may have to be reconsidered.
   ``I think the artificial heart business and circulatory support
business is going to become more esoteric until such time as we
have a (totally implantable) permanent device to put in,'' said Dr.
Jack G. Copeland of the University of Arizona Heart Center, a
co-sponsor of the conference with the Minneapolis Heart Institute.
   Copeland said using a bridge to transplant ``is much less
appealing in my mind, with the donor shortage, and many patients
sitting around waiting would be better candidates for transplant if
there's one organ available and too many waiting for it. So I think
it's going to be less common.''
   Nearly 200 surgeons and other medical practitioners attended the
opening session, which covered a range of topics on heart,
heart-lung and lung transplantation.
   One of them, Dr. William A. Baumgartner of Johns Hopkins
University, cited a recent study predicting a limit of about 1,500
heart donors annually and said, ``I think that we have proabably
reached the zenith of heart transplant donors, at least for the
forseeable future.''
   Baumgartner last year performed a ``domino donor'' transplant,
implanting a heart and lung into a cystic fibrosis patient whose
own heart was transplanted into a second patient. The first patient
received organs donated by a brain-dead patient.
   Dr. Frazier Eales of the Minneapolis Heart Institute said, ``We
dilute the credibility of our programs if we have 100 people on the
waiting list and all we can do is 15 or 20 transplants a year,''
   A number of surgeons said there has been a falloff in the number
of heart transplants performed so far in 1988 compared with 1987,
but could give no explanation.
   ``We're used to seeing a great deal of variation,'' Eales said.
``But this has been prolonged and it's evidently been nationwide.''
   Dr. Lyle D. Joyce, a cardiovascular surgeon from the Minneapolis
center and an expert on the Jarvik artificial heart, while agreeing
the donor shortage is a ``real problem,'' said he disagreed with
the idea that ``perhaps we shouldn't even consider using the device
as a bridge to transplant.''
   ``We are at a point in the development of these devices that we
need some experience and there is a price we're going to have to
pay,'' including losing some patients, he said.
   He said if not for having moved ahead with such experimental
implants as Barney Clark's, ``I would daresay that there would be
no research going on on a national scale today to develop a total
artificial heart.''
   But he added that the National Institutes of Health has provided
$20 million a year for such development, and predicted a totally
implantable device ``in the near future.''
   Joyce, who worked with Dr. William DeVries in the early
permanent Jarvik implants, said the time may be approaching for a
return to permanent artificial hearts.
   He said the donor shortage likely will force transplant programs
to reject older patients as less-than-perfect candidates, in turn
again making available a pool of candidates for permanent implants.

<HEAD>House Balks At Senate Effort To Ban Pornographic Phone Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday balked at a Senate plan
to outlaw dial-a-porn telephone services after some members raised
constitutional questions and said they had a better way to keep
children from calling.
   The lawmakers voted 382-0 to instruct negotiators on an omnibus
education bill _ one that now includes the Senate ban _ to agree on
new provisions aimed at solving the dial-a-porn problem short of an
outright ban.
   The alternative, pressed by some conservatives, would have been
to instruct the negotiators to accept the ban. But others argued it
would be vulnerable to court challenges based on the right to free
speech.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said the vote paved the way for a
solution involving access codes that would prevent children from
calling the pornographic toll numbers unless their subscriber
parents gave them the code.
   ``There is uniform concern in the House over this problem. We
want to get a bipartisan solution,'' said Markey, chairman of the
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on communications.
   Sponsors of the successful motion said they didn't want to take
the risk that the negotiators would drop the whole issue because
the Senate ban seemed unconstitutional. And they said they didn't
want the negotiators to accept a plan that would result in an
immediate court challenge and injunction.
   ``It would be litigated for years before we got a solution,''
said Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va. ``And maybe we would get to one we
sought, and maybe we wouldn't.''
   Bliley said the purveyors of dial-a-porn might well go to court
anyway, even over access codes, but their cases would be severely
weakened without the First Amendment grounds.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-S.C., sponsored the dial-a-porn ban last
December as an amendment to an education improvement act renewing
and expanding federal programs for elementary and secondary school
students.
   The Senate approved the Helms measure 98-0 despite some
senators' reservations about its constitutionality and the American
Civil Liberties Union's prediction that it would be challenged if
it became law.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee and of the House's negotiating team, praised the House
action Wednesday and promised that ``we will go as far as we can
constitutionally to bring to a halt this obnoxious practice.''
   That was not enough for some conservatives, who said neither
children nor adults should have access to pornographic messages via
their telephones.
   ``We should be voting here today to eliminate dial-a-porn from
the culture of America,'' said Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif. He
tried and failed to win a vote on instructing the negotiators to
accept the Senate ban.

<HEAD>Decline in Corn Available to Market Pushing Prices Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decline in the amount of corn readily
available to the market is one reason feed grain prices have edged
higher this winter, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The department's Commodity Credit Corp. is estimated to have
around 1.75 billion bushels of corn in its inventory for 1987-88,
compared with 1.44 billion bushels last season.
   In addition, farmers have large quantities of corn still under
price support loan _ which cannot be sold on the market or used
until the loans are settled. If the loans aren't repaid, the grain
winds up in CCC inventories.
   Grain also is held in storage under the ``farmer-owned reserve''
program, or FOR, and cannot be released until prices rise to
specified levels.
   ``A key factor in this year's stronger corn and sorghum prices
is the commitment of a larger share of the 1987-88 supply to CCC
inventory, FOR and regular CCC crop loans, and shrinking
uncommitted stocks,'' the department's Economic Research Service
said in an outlook report.
   ``Corn prices have been edging upward in expectation that cash
redemptions from loans will be necessary to meet market demands,''
the report said. ``Corn prices received by farmers are expected to
average $1.65 to $1.85 a bushel, up from $1.50 in 1986-87.''
   Sorghum prices are projected at $1.50 to $1.70 per bushel,
compared with an average of $1.37 in the 1986-87 season.

<HEAD>Israel, Egypt Earmarked for Most 1989 Foreign Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

   Israel and Egypt are slated to receive a
combined total of $5.3 billion in economic and military aid
commitments in fiscal 1989 out of a global total of $14.3 billion,
the State Department said Thursday.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead told a news briefing
that even though the request to Congress for spending authority on
foreign assistance is up about $200 million from the 1988
allocation, many pressing needs will remain unmet.
   ``It is difficult to operate a foreign policy with such limited
funds,'' Whitehead said, noting that the overall international
affairs budget has dropped by some 30 per cent since 1985.
   Israel and Egypt have been given the highest priority in the
foreign assistance allocations for years, and 1989 will be no
exception. Israel is scheduled to receive commitments for $1.2
billion in economic aid and $1.8 billion in military aid while the
figures for Egypt are $815 million and $1.3 billion respectively.
   The $14.3 billion proposed by the administration would not
represent actual 1989 outlays, because some of the money will be
spent on projects extending over several years. The outlay figure
is expected to be several billion less than the $14.3 billion
request.
   A U.S. official said that of the $1.3 billion in military aid
proposed for Egypt, only a few million would actually be spent next
year and the remainder would be in the pipeline for use in future
years. The same holds true for the economic aid program although
the percentage of cash outlays are somewhat higher compared with
the military program for Egypt.
   Meanwhile, the more than 40 aid recipients in sub-Saharan Africa
_ the world's poorest region _ are due to receive a combined total
of $733 million in economic assistance commitments.
   Whitehead said the high assistance levels for Israel and Egypt
are based on need, their decision to make peace a decade ago and
the wishes of the Congress.
   ``There is very little sympathy in Congress for a reduction,''
Whitehead said.
   He noted that, unlike past years, the global totals are likely
to receive congressional approval because they had been agreed to
by the congressional leadership late last year.
   In the past, however, Congress has earmarked specific amounts
for countries it favors, forcing the administraion to make
adjustments in the figures for other countries.
   The administration has strongly opposed congressional
earmarkings and Whitehead expressed hope that lawmakers will
exercise restraint when they take up the 1989 proposals.
   ``Firm earmarkings ... are not a good way to run a railroad,''
Whitehead said.
   Among the few surprises in the proposed country-by-country
allocations was the elimination of the program for Ireland, which
is receiving $35 million in commitments during the current year.
   Whitehead said the decision to drop Ireland from the list was
based on the perception that the United States ``does not receive a
real return'' on its investment.
   Irish diplomatic sources expressed hope that Congress will
reinstate the funding.
   For the past three years, U.S. aid to Ireland has been funneled
through the International Fund for Ireland, in which several
countries make contributions. The bulk of the funds have gone for
the reconstruction of Northern Ireland, with a small amount
earmarked for border counties in the Irish Republic.
   The fund was set up in 1986 for a three-year period but the
Irish sources, insisting on anonymity, said a fourth year of
allocations had not been ruled out.
   ``We understand the view of the State Department that they don't
envisage funding beyond the third year, but the matter has to be
considered by Congress where there is strong support for the
International Fund,'' an Irish diplomat said.
   The foreign assistance program also:
   __Calls for a $98 million increase in commitments for Turkey to
$623.5 million. Greece, Turkey's principal rival, would receive a
$7 million increase.
   __Reinstates military grant assistance to eight Latin American
countries which have been cut out of the 1988 program. All told,
Latin American countries would receive $90 million more in economic
assistance commitments and $55 million more in military assistance
commitments than they have at present.
   __Earmarks $32.4 million in assistance commitments _ almost all
economic _ to Haiti even though aid to that country was suspended
late last year when the military abrogated election laws. Whitehead
said the proposed aid to Haiti would be allocated only if there is
progress toward democracy.

<TEXT>
   Mario Biaggi, 70, came to Washington 20 years
ago as a hero New York City cop, rising above the poverty of a
Harlem tenement to the lofty halls of Congress.
   Now, he is fighting expulsion from the House.
   On Thursday, the House ethics committee said it would recommend
that Biaggi be ousted, a rare step. He is charged with violating
the House's rules for the conduct of a congressman.
   The 10-term congressman says he won't give up his seat without a
fight. But the development climaxes a yearlong decline for a
once-respected lawmaker.
   The Bronx Democrat's troubles began with his indictments in two
separate cases.
   The first came last March 16. Biaggi was charged with accepting
paid vacations in exchange for helping to steer government
contracts toward Coastal Dry Dock and Repair, an ailing Brooklyn
shipyard.
   At his conviction last Sept. 22, Biaggi scoffed that he had been
found guilty of ``tipping.'' But he wept two months later when the
judge, calling the case ``a Greek tragedy,'' sentenced Biaggi to 2{
years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Biaggi was forced to relinquish his two House subcommittee
chairmanships.
   The second indictment came June 3, when Biaggi was charged with
bribery and rackeeteering in connection with Wedtech, the
now-infamous Bronx military contractor. Biaggi pleaded innocent and
faces trial next month.
   When a cadre of House Republicans threatened to challenge his
right to vote. He has refrained from voting ever since.
   Mario Biaggi was born in a Harlem tenement, the oldest of three
sons of immigrants from Italy. He shined shoes and delivered
laundry to supplement the income of his father, a marble-setter,
and his mother, a charwoman.
   After high school, he worked as a foreman in a braid factory
until when he got a job as a mailman. He quit in 1942 to join the
New York City Police Department.
   As a policeman, he earned a record 28 bravery citations in 23
years. He received the Police Medal of Honor for Valor after
killing a gunman who jumped into a car with him and a friend in an
apparent robbery attempt. He was wounded 10 times in the line of
duty. To this day, he walks with a cane after being kicked by a
runaway horse.
   In 1960, the dean of the New York Law School, Daniel Gutman,
heard Biaggi speak at a dinner and was so impressed that he offered
Biaggi, by then a police detective, a full scholarship to study law.
   With Gutman's help, Biaggi obtained a dispensation from the
American Bar Association waiving the requirement for a college
degree. Biaggi completed law school in 2{ years while on leave from
his police duties.
   He retired from the police department in 1965 as a detective
lieutenant and was granted a 75 percent disability pension.
   In 1966, he helped found a New York City law firm which now
employs his son Richard, who has also been indicted in the Wedtech
case.
   Biaggi won election to Congress in 1968 with 60 percent of the
vote and has not faced serious political opposition in the past
decade.
   Combining a dedication to community service, support for federal
spending for those in need, and outspokenness on such issues as
Soviet-Jewish emigration and the conflict in Northern Ireland,
Biaggi won the loyalty of the large Irish, Italian and Jewish blocs
in his district.
   But in 1973, Biaggi mounted a campaign for New York City mayor
that nearly destroyed him politically.
   During the race, Biaggi denied reports that he had taken the
Fifth Amendment before a grand jury investigation allegations of
payoffs to congressmen who sponsored certain immigration
legislation. Biaggi sued to get some, but not all, of the grand
jury records made public. The idea backfired when the judge
released all the minutes, proving that Biaggi had lied and had
taken the Fifth.
   The Internal Revenue Service then launched an investigation, and
Biaggi acknowledged that he had been questioned by another grand
jury looking into whether a judge involved in a case tied to
Biaggi's law firm had been bribed.
   No charges were brought in either case.

<TEXT>
   Deputy Chancellor Alois Mock, head of the
party that backed Kurt Waldheim for the presidency, stuck by him
Thursday but the party itself did not make a statement of support
after a leadership caucus.
   Mock also is foreign minister of the coalition government, in
which his conservative People's Party is the junior partner of
Chancellor Franz Vranitzy's Socialists.
   Vranitzky has indicated Waldheim should resign because of
questions about his conduct as a German army lieutenant in the
Balkans during World War II. Other political leaders ranging from
Socialist to conservative have also suggested Waldheim step down.
   Opinion polls this week have shown declining support for the
president, who on Monday rejected demands that he resign because of
the report a government-appointed commission of historians prpared
on his war service.
   It said he was in ``close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities, knew
of them and did nothing to stop them. The historians said they
found no proof that Waldheim committed war crimes, but they left
the question of guilt open.
   Waldheim, now 69, has consistently denied wrongdoing since
allegations about his war service first appeared in March 1986
during the presidential campaign.
   The government named the international panel of historians at
Waldheim's request in September, after the United States put the
former U.N. secretary-general on a ``watch list'' of undesirable
aliens that barred him from the country.
   After the party leadership caucus Thursday, Mock said Waldheim's
decision to stay in office ``should be respected by all democrats.''
   A source who attended the meeting said privately that prominent
conservatives other than Mock believe Waldheim must go. A statement
issued after the meeting did not explicitly declare People's Party
support for Waldheim, indicating disagreement among its leaders.
   Economics Minister Robert Graf, a conservative who has indicated
Waldheim should resign, said he did not attend the party meeting.
Asked how Austria's political crisis should be solved, he told The
Associated Press: ``The decision lies with the president.''
   Mock would not tell reporters whether Waldheim was criticized in
the meeting. He urged political parties to quit discussing the
matter, contending that more talk would ``endanger trust in
political institutions.''
   He accused the state radio-television monopoly ORF of
``brainwashing'' of the public against Waldheim.
   ``The reporting of ORF is scandalous ... one-sided and
unobjective,'' he said. Mock would not cite cases, but said in
response to questions: ``There is a whole list of things where
brainwashing of the public has been going on for weeks.''
   Thaddeus Podgorski, head of the network, issued a statement
saying the reporting conformed with regulations governing
broadcasting.
   Johannes Kunz, who is in charge of information at ORF, issued a
statement later saying: ``The ORF correspondents were expressly
ordered to include in their reports especially reactions positive
for the president. It does not lie within the responsibility of ORF
that foreign reactions were overwhelmingly negative.''
   The government rejected a call by Israeli's parliament for
Waldheim to be forced from office and tried for war crimes. The
Foreign Ministry expressed ``Austria's indignation'' over the
resolution passed unanimously by the Knesset on Tuesday.
   Vranitzky said in rejecting the resolution that ``wholesale
judgments and accusations of that kind'' would not serve anyone.

   Moslem militiamen searched rain-drenched
citrus groves and valley caves Thursday for Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, and their leaders threatened to go after his kidnappers
unless the U.S. Marine is freed soon.
   ``We want Higgins back and we have no red line as far as his
case is concerned,'' said Daoud Daoud of the moderate Shiite
militia Amal, the dominant force around the ancient port of Tyre.
   U.N. peacekeeping troops and about 1,500 Amal militiamen
virtually sealed off a 300-square-mile area.
   An anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility for
Wednesday's abduction in the name of a previously unknown group. He
claimed Higgins, who commands U.N. truce observers in south
Lebanon, is a CIA agent.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman denied Thursday
that Higgins had any CIA connections: ``There was a claim that Lt.
Col. Higgins was associated with the CIA. That is not true.''
   The abduction brings the number of foreign hostages in Lebanon
to 25, including nine Americans. Most are believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite extremists, whose main Hezbollah militia has
been challenging Amal's dominance in south Lebanon.
   An Arabic-speaking man said in the telephone call to a Western
news agency in Beirut that he represented the Islamic Revolutionary
Brigades, and declared:
   ``William Higgins has joined the hostages. He will only come out
after he is tried on grounds that he is one of the directors of the
CIA in south Lebanon. Higgins is now out of Beirut after he was
brought out from the south.''
   He said a statement and photograph of Higgins would be released
soon. There was no way to authenticate the claim.
   Higgins, a 43-year-old native of Danville, Ky., heads the
76-member observer group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon, the peacekeeping force in south Lebanon known as UNIFIL.
Officers under his command represent 16 nations.
   Daoud is military commander of Amal, the Shiite militia led by
Justice Minister Nabih Berri. He said in south Lebanon: ``We're
capable of confronting the people who've carried out the abduction
if need be, but I hope a quick, happy ending will be accomplished.''
   He and senior aides told reporters they believed Higgins and the
captors still were in an area southeast of Tyre, which is 50 miles
south of Beirut.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for UNIFIL, agreed. ``We do not have any
reason to believe that he is out of the south,'' Goksel said at
headquarters in Naqoura, just north of the Israeli border.
   When Higgins was seized, he was violating U.N. rules for travel
by Americans in dangerous areas, Goksel said, but the colonel
``felt he couldn't abide by these restrictions. ... Higgins felt
that as chief, he should be out with his men and know what they are
doing.''
   American members of U.N. forces are restricted to the
headquarters area and are permitted to travel in Lebanon only with
a U.N. military escort, he said.
   An Amal spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said:
``Despite heavy rain, the search has been completed in areas north
and east of Tyre. We are focusing now on Wadi Jilo southeast of
Tyre.''
   Wadi Jilo, six miles southeast of Tyre, is a stronghold of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for factions holding
most of the captive foreigners. The hostage held longest is Terry
A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, abducted March 16, 1985.
   Higgins' father died Thursday in Louisville, Ky., of congestive
heart failure. The family learned of the abduction while trying
notify the Marine officer that William F. Higgins was near death.
   Daoud and his aides met at a Lebanese army barracks in Tyre with
UNIFIL officers led by Lt. Col. Tor Planting of Finland to
coordinate the search effort.
   ``We hope the kidnappers will have no chance of slipping out
with their captive,'' the Amal spokesman said.
   Cars manned by plainclothes Amal security men blocked roads
along the Litani River from the Mediterranean coast to the slopes
of Mount Hermon about 25 miles inland.
   Uniformed militiamen with submachine guns and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers patrolled a 12-mile stretch of coast from the
Qassmieh Bridge north of Tyre to the kidnap scene three miles south
of the city, the spokesman said.
   ``Our men are searching villages in an 800-square-kilometer
(300-square- mile) area north, east and south of Tyre,'' he said.
``U.N. troops block the southern exits of the region.''
   Berri has issued orders that ``no one sleeps until we get the
man (Higgins) back,'' the spokesman said, adding that Amal is
``anxious to protect and safeguard UNIFIL, regardless of the
nationality of the peacekeepers. Amal views Higgins' abduction as a
deliberate challenge.''
   UNIFIL operates in predominantly Shiite areas frequently caught
in the crossfire of Israel's battles with Palestinian guerrillas
and Shiite extremists loyal to Iran.
   Security sources said French U.N. officers had interviewed a
Lebanese bus driver who claimed he saw the abduction from a few
yards away.
   ``The Frenchmen have managed to draw a face sketch of the gunman
the eyewitness says he saw pointing his pistol to Higgins' head as
he forced him into the kidnappers' car,'' one said.
   Officials have said two gunmen in a Volvo kidnapped Higgins
after blocking his car on a coastal highway.
   Higgins was the third U.N official kidnapped in south Lebanon in
three weeks. The other two, a Swede and Norwegian of the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency, were seized Feb. 5 near Sidon, midway
between Tyre and Beirut.

   World chess champion Garri
Kasparov will join 31 leading chess masters to compete for the
record $75,000 World Blitz Championship in Saint John on Friday and
Saturday.
   The event features a series of duels in which each player's
thinking time will be limited to five minutes per game.
   ``Its going to be outrageous. It will vanquish once and for all
the idea that chess is a boring game,'' said Jay Whitehead, a
26-year-old International Master from San Francisco.
   The series of four game knockouts will culminate Saturday in a
six-game grand finale.
   Most experts are predicting a clash between Kasparov and his
archrival, fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov.
   It would be their first meeting since their world title duel
ended in a 12-12 tie in Seville, Spain, last December, leaving
Kasparov as champion.
   Other observers suggest the frantic pace of the games will
increase the likelihood of an American or West European
grandmaster's pulling off a giant-killing victory.
   While the 10-week Seville contest featured a total prize fund of
$1.85 million, the victor in Saint John will walk away with $37,500
for four hours work, the highest first prize ever in a single
tournament.
   ``It's a completely different kind of chess, but I think it's
very exciting for the public. You need to concentrate for every
second because of the speed,'' said Karpov, 36, at a news
conference Thursday.
   Spectators will be able to watch the play unfold using a
special, British- made computer called an Intelligent chess display.
   Using sensors in the board and pieces, the moves will be
instantaneously transmitted onto video screens throughout the hall.
   ``Such events are part of the future of chess, they are like an
electric shock,'' the 24-year-old titleholder told The Associated
Press. ``Of course, this kind of contest wouldn't have been
possible without the new technology,'' Kasparov added.
   ESPN, the sports cable network based in Atlanta, plans to
broadcast three one-hour programs on the event.
   ``We are trying to use the same broadcast technology used in
other sports, like split screens and extra close-ups, with the
exception of slow motion replays,'' said Peter Allies, an executive
producer with Toronto-based Tier One Communications, which is
producing the programs.
   A 12-man World Swift championship, played under similar
conditions last April in Brussels, Belgium, was won by Kasparov.
Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman came in second, with Karpov third.
   Players reached this final through qualifiers held earlier in
New York, Philadelphia, Biel, Switzerland and in Saint John, a city
of 125,000 on Canada's eastern seaboard.
   The blitz championship is the showcase finale of the World Chess
Festival, billed as the greatest chess spectacular ever held in
North America.
   The monthlong event has attracted more than 700 players from 26
countries.
   It will be Kasparov's first appearance in North America.
   On Sunday, the titlist will travel with his British manager,
Andrew Page, to New York for a four-day tour, including a display
at a school in the city's poor south Bronx district and an
exhibition match against celebrities.
   ``The blitz is the kind of event to increase the popularity of
the game. I hope my visit will help to promote chess throughout the
United States,'' Kasparov said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday upheld the
government's refusal to grant a patent for an electrical motor
which its inventor claims produces a net gain of energy but whose
critics say violates a basic law of physics.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found there was no
valid scientific evidence to support inventor Joseph W. Newman's
claims that his device produced more energy than it consumed.
   Jackson made his ruling on a 5-year-old lawsuit against the U.S.
Patent and Trade Office, which had refused to grant a patent after
examiners determined that the machine did not do what Newman
claimed it could do.
   The Patent Office, which didn't conduct tests, ruled that Newman
was seeking a patent for a perpetual motion machine, a concept that
violates the second law of thermodynamics.
   The law of physics states that in any mechanical process some
energy is inevitably lost, usually in the form of heat, so that
output cannot exceed the input of energy.
   The judge said Newman, an inventor from Lucedale, Miss.,
produced evidence that was ``anecdotal and largely qualitative
rather than quantified measured data'' to support his theory.
   Jackson also found that Newman failed to rebut the findings of
the National Bureau of Standards, which tested the machine and
found ``the device did not deliver more energy than it used.''
   Newman claims that his machine, which largely resembles an
ordinary electric motor except for an unusually large coil of wire,
converts what he calls ``gyroscopic particles'' into energy.
   The 51-year-old inventor has demonstrated his device to a Senate
subcommittee and to news reporters in several cities.
   Jackson found that ``aside from Newman's own somewhat
metaphysical writings which appear at multiple points throughout
his patent application there is no evidence whatsoever... from
which to find the existence of such `gyroscopic particles,' their
observable (or measurable) `release' or `reaction' within the
device.''
   Newman and his attorney, John Flannery, said they expected to
file an appeal of Jackson's decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here.
   ``The procedure in the Patent Office was unfair and we think the
testing procedure was unfair,'' Flannery said, referring to the
tests conducted two years ago by the National Bureau of Standards.
   Flannery contended that Jackson had improperly rejected the
findings of former patent commissioner William Schuyler, a
court-appointed expert, who reported there was clear evidence that
Newman's device worked.
   ``We have an expert... who agrees with our view and we have a
district court judge's opinion that differs with that. So I think
we will have to go the Court of Appeals for a tie-breaker,''
Flannery said.
   Newman accused Jackson and patent officials of bias, charging
they knew his invention would hurt oil companies.
   ``I am pleased the judge has finally ruled because I am counting
on getting up to the higher court,'' Newman said. But ``I don't
expect any justice from those people.''
   The often acrimonious court battle included an incident in 1986
when Flannery was cited for contempt of court for pressing Newman's
claim that Jackson recuse himself because he was appointed to the
federal bench by President Reagan.
   ``I have had just about enough of your insolence in this case,''
the judge told Flannery. Jackson later withdrew the contempt
citation.

   In another sign of eroding support for
the Austrian president, a leading industrialist has suggested that
Kurt Waldheim step down because of the controversy over his World
War II record.
   Herbert Krejci, general secretary of the Austrian Industrialists
Association, said ``the fate of the country is even more important
than the office'' of president.
   Vice Chancellor Alois Mock, at a news conference Wednesday,
rejected as ``not important'' Krecji's remarks, made a day earlier
on national television. Krejci is a member of the conservative
People's Party, which is headed by Mock and which backed Waldheim
for president in 1986.
   The chancellor runs the government and the presidency is a
largely ceremonial post in Austria. The Socialists are the senior
partner in the coalition government with the People's Party.
   The national leadership of the People's Party has scheduled a
meeting Thursday at which it is expected to discuss the Waldheim
case.
   Last week, a commission of historians questioned Waldheim's
moral integrity, saying he was ``in close proximity'' to Nazi
atrocities when he served as a lieutenant in the German army during
World War II, but did nothing about them.
   Though the panel said it found no evidence Waldheim had
committed war crimes, it concluded he tried to cover up his
involvement in the war, which was disclosed nearly two years ago
during the presidential campaign.
   Waldheim, 69, a former U.N. secretary-general, has said he is
innocent of wrongdoing and has refused to resign.
   The tabloid Kurier, which represents the conservative party's
relatively liberal economic and business wing, has said at least
twice in the past week that the party is weighing a plan to put
more pressure on Waldheim to resign.
   It did not describe the plan.
   The Socialists have said that if Waldheim steps down, they are
willing to work with the conservatives to choose a replacement
candidate agreeable to both parties.
   Meanwhile, a group of prominent Austrian intellectuals and
liberals vowed to hold weekly demonstrations against Waldheim until
March, when the country marks the 50th anniversary of Hitler's
annexation of Austria.
   The discord in the coalition over the Waldheim affair has led to
increased discussion of the possibility of new parliamentary
elections. Mock and Heinrich Keller, the Socialist party secretary,
said Wednesday they opposed new elections.

   A prominent forensic psychiatrist testifying
Thursday in a $22.5 million lawsuit brought against Soldier of
Fortune by a murder victim's family said a classified ad in the
magazine led to the slaying.
   ``In my opinion, the advertisement was a proximate cause of
death for Sandra Black,'' said Dr. Park Dietz.
   Dietz, who headed the forensic team that evaluated John Hinckley
after he shot President Reagan in 1981, said Soldier of Fortune was
the magazine of choice for people who looked through its
classifieds for people willing to engage in illegal activity.
   In earlier testimony Thursday, Soldier of Fortune publisher
Robert K. Brown said he was unaware of news reports linking
classified ads in the magazine to criminal acts before a killer was
hired through the ads.
   Brown, in a second day of testimony in federal court, said if he
had known of the reports he might have eliminated the
advertisements.
   ``I would have conducted an investigation to see if it was an
aberration or a pattern,'' he said. ``If we could have developed a
pattern, then I would have discontinued the ads.''
   A Texas family is accusing the Colorado-based magazine of
negligence for running an ad that is linked to a woman's 1985
slaying. The magazine bills itself as the journal of professional
adventurers.
   The ad placed by John Wayne Hearn brought him together with
Robert Black and led to the murder-for-hire of Black's wife,
Sandra, of Bryan.
   Black is on death row for paying Hearn $10,000 to carry out the
killing. Hearn is serving three life terms for murder.
   Marjorie Einmann, Mrs. Black's mother, and Gary Black, the
victim's 18-year-old son, are seeking $2.5 million in actual
damages and $20 million in punitive damages.
   Attorneys for the magazine do not dispute the ad brought Hearn
and Black together, but insist Brown had no way of knowing the ad
was for illegal activity.
   Hearn's ad, which appeared in four issues in late 1984, sought
Marine and Vietnam veterans and weapons specialists with jungle
warfare expertise for ``high-risk assignments'' in the United
States or overseas.
   Hearn said in a deposition read into testimony Wednesday that
his ad was intended to attract bodyguard and security work. He said
it brought responses from people looking for help with bombings,
assaults, jail breaks and killings.
   Brown said he had not read in Denver-area newspapers about an
extortion indictment linking the magazine's ads in May 1984 to a
so-called ``collection agency'' allegedly involved in kidnap,
extortion and death threats.
   Numerous stories about the extortion ring were run in 1984, but
Brown said he may have been out of the area at the time or didn't
see them.
   Brown also denied Thursday that an advertising policy adopted in
May 1984 was in response to police inquiries about crimes that may
have been linked to classified ads in the magazine.
   The policy established for the first time since the magazine
began in 1975 a formal rejection procedure for classified ads.
   ``It was a matter of setting policy to preclude events that
might happen,'' Brown said. ``One of the motives was to upgrade the
image of the magazine.''
   The policy listed about a dozen reasons why a classified ad
could be rejected, including any suggestion an ad would ``encourage
illegal activity.''
   Brown acknowledged that continued publication of personal
services ads had been discussed at the magazine for years and that
he may have been the only person at Soldier of Fortune to favor
their continuation.
   He has said that the magazine was aimed at Vietnam veterans and
that the classified ads were run as a source of employment for them.

<HEAD>Arab League Calls For Assembly on U.S. Bid to Close PLO Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab League on Thursday demanded an
emergency session of the 159-nation U.N. General Assembly to
discuss U.S. plans to close the Palestine Liberation Organization
mission.
   The 21-nation league wants the assembly to ``shield'' the PLO's
observer mission to the United Nations, said a league spokesman,
Clovis Maksoud.
   He was vague about how the assembly might accomplish this.
   ``We cannot recommend at this moment a specific course of
action,'' he told reporters. But if an emergency session was held,
it is expected the assembly would denounce the United States and
say it violated the treaty under which it is host to the United
Nations.
   ``We are not seeking or eliciting a confrontation,'' Maksoud
insisted. ``We are seeking that the United States abide by its
treaty obligations.''
   The request came in a letter to East Germany's ambassador, Peter
Florin, who is president of the General Assembly. Florin is
expected to approve the request, said diplomats, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The PLO, which enjoys strong support at the United Nations, and
Arab diplomats have said they may ask the assembly to move to
Geneva if the mission is closed.
   The State Department had said the treaty obliged the United
States to let the mission operate. But Congress passed a law
ordering the mission closed by March 22. The United States
considers the PLO a terrorist organization.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III now must decide on whether to
close the mission.
   Reagan administration officials in Washington, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Thursday that Meese was expected to
announce his decision near the end of March. Several congressmen
have said Meese assured them he would close the mission.
   Maksoud said the Arab League wants the assembly to begin its
session no later than Feb. 29.
   During its regular session, which ended in December, the
assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on the United
States to leave the PLO mission alone. Israel was the only country
to vote against the measure and the United States abstained.
   Maksoud said the United States could avoid a confrontation with
the United Nations if the law is repealed or if the administration
refuses to enforce it.
   Both possibilities seem unlikely. The legislation had strong
support in both houses of Congress and President Reagan signed the
measure last Dec. 22, despite the State Department's reservations.
   The U.N. mission is the only PLO office in the United States.
The State Department closed the PLO information office in
Washington last year.

   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont
abandoned his bid for the Republican presidential nomination
Thursday after losing badly in Iowa and New Hampshire. ``You
listened, considered and chose,'' he said. ``I could not have asked
for more.''
   Du Pont withdrew just six days after Alexander Haig gave up his
GOP candidacy, leaving four Republicans in the 1988 race. Former
Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt dropped out earlier Thursday, leaving
six Democrats.
   Du Pont, 53, a former congressman and state legislator as well
as governor, is a great-great grandson of the founder of the Du
Pont Co. Despite his efforts and the familiarity of his name, his
candidacy never attracted widespread support in the 17 months after
he announced his presidential plans.
   He had hoped to make himself the conservative alternative to GOP
front-runners George Bush and Bob Dole, but he finished far down in
the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
   In New Hampshire on Tuesday, he won his only two delegates,
finishing a distant fourth behind conservative Rep. Jack Kemp
though slightly ahead of former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   He said Thursday he wouldn't endorse another candidate
immediately.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, told reporters accompanying
the vice president to Texas that Bush had received a call from du
Pont on Air Force Two.
   Fuller described the conversation as ``very friendly'' and
quoted Bush as telling the former Delaware governor: ``Pete, I've
been there myself. Barbara and I wish you and your family the very
best.''
   Fuller described the rest of the 10-minute conversation as
``private'' although he said the two voiced ``a general willingness
to talk at some time in the future.''
   Asked what they would talk about, Fuller said it would involve
the possibility of du Pont endorsing Bush, saying ``it's an
interest we would have. ... I believe whe phone call was simply to
let the vice president know he was withdrawing from the race.''
   In his withdrawal announcement _ made to about 100 supporters,
many wearing ``Pete 1992'' stickers _ du Pont said, ``Today our
campaign lowers its flag, but our crusade continues to march.''
   ``You have given me the opportunity of a lifetime,'' he said,
thanking his supporters for their efforts in his behalf.
   ``In America we do not promise that everyone wins, only that
everyone has the opportunity to try. You have given me the
opportunity,'' he said.
   Du Pont took note of his controversial stands on such issues as
mandatory drug testing for high school students and elimination of
farm subsidies.
   ``We have moved those challenges forward to the center of the
debate; they are urgent, they are real, they will not disappear,''
he said. ``Neither will our efforts to address them. All of us can
pause to catch our breath; none of us should think it time to end
our quest.''
   Earlier, Fred Stern, du Pont's press secretary, said in a
telephone interview that financing was a major consideration in the
withdrawal decision. He said the candidate would ``not run a
deficit campaign.''
   Du Pont raised $7.5 million and was left with $350,000 after New
Hampshire, Stern said. But the campaign would have faced large
expenses to carry on through the 20-state Super Tuesday contests
March 8.
   ``We're solvent right now and we have enough money to run the
campaign for another two weeks. Unlike some of the campaigns, we're
meeting our payroll,'' Stern said.
   Du Pont's conservative credentials were polished by his
endorsement from the Union Leader newspaper of Manchester, N.H.
   Du Pont declared his candidacy Sept. 16, 1986, making him
officially the first Republican in the field.
   ``I'm in a wonderful position,'' he said at the time. ``I'm
unknown. I'm underrated, and there's nowhere to go but up.''
   That same day, du Pont took off for Manchester, N.H. In an
interview later that week with the Wilmington News-Journal, he said
if he did not do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, he would pull out
of the race. On Thursday, he was true to his word.
   Being first to announce, he drew national attention,
particularly for his provocative stands on several issues,
including drug testing, creation of a private alternative to Social
Security modeled after IRA accounts, and the replacement of welfare
with a mandatory jobs program.
   Thursday evening, du Pont thanked several hundred supporters for
their help during a farewell campaign party at a local high school.
   ``All of us are here tonight to celebrate what for me has been
the greatest opportunity of my lifetime,'' he said.
   ``Now some of you are tired and you deserve to rest. And some of
you are sad and you're not allowed to be sad because this is not a
sad occasion,'' du Pont said. ``This is a celebration of a campaign
for the presidency of the United States. It was run the way
campaigns ought to be run, on principles, on issues.''

   ``You're a liar!'' John Demjanjuk's wife
screamed at a prosecutor Thursday as the year-long Nazi war crimes
trial of the retired Ohio autoworker ended.
   ``Shame on you! Shame on you! You have no heart!'' Vera
Demjanjuk shouted.
   Mrs. Demjanjuk, 63, her daughter, Irene Nishnic, and son, John
Jr., mounted the stage of the converted movie theater where the
trial was held to confront prosecutors.
   Security guards pushed the sobbing women out of the courtroom.
The sounds of a scuffle could be heard followed by an angry
expletive from Demjanjuk's son.
   Demjanjuk, 67, appeared startled but did not otherwise react.
The Ukrainian-born defendant is accused of being ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' a brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed
850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.
   Demjanjuk insists he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity.
He was stripped of his U.S. citizenship in 1981 and later
extradited to Israel to stand trial for war crimes.
   Holocaust survivor Mordechai Fuchs also interrupted the session,
tearfully waving an aging photograph of his parents and three
brothers and sister who were killed at Treblinka.
   ``I was among the dead, and I am here in court today. The
(defense) lawyers are liars,'' sobbed Fuchs, 63, who said he
escaped death by jumping from the train transporting his family to
Treblinka.
   The three-judge panel is expected to issue its verdict in April.
The proceeding, which began Feb. 16, 1987, was the first war crimes
trial in Israel since Nazi mastermind Adolf Eichmann was convicted
and hanged in 1962.
   The lengthy proceedings were broadcast live on television and
radio. Initially, spectators waited hours in line for seats, but
interest waned and the final session was sparsely attended.
   The Demjanjuk family's emotional outburst came after defense
attorney John Gill ended his final arguments, and prosecutor
Michael Shaked rose to respond to accusations that the prosecution
withheld documents that could exonerate Demjanjuk.
   Shaked said the prosecution had given all material to the
defense ``on a silver platter,'' and even translated it.
   John Jr., 22, rose angrily from his front row seat, walked onto
the stage, turned and said: ``You're a liar.''
   He was followed by Mrs. Nishnic, 28, who shook her fist and
screamed: ``You're lying! You're lying!'' before bursting into
tears.
   Mrs. Demjanjuk then rose, and in a heavily accented voice
shaking with emotion, shouted: ``You're a liar! You liar! Shame on
you! Shame on you! You have no heart _ nothing!'' She was pulled
from the stage by two security guards.
   After the family's outburst, presiding Judge Dov Levine told
Shaked and the defense team: ``You both ought to do away with this
bitterness because ... we believe there was fair treatment.''
   Demjanjuk's family said they did not believe he received a fair
trial.
   ``They've been lying from the beginning, and they're ending with
a lie,'' Mrs. Nishnic told The Associated Press tearfully after the
trial, her hands shaking.
   ``We didn't expect the trial to end like that, with statements
that aren't true. The defense should have been the ones to have the
last say,'' she said.
   John Jr. said the family believed statements from 21 camp
survivors who did not identify Demjanjuk as ``Ivan'' had been
withheld by the U.S. Justice Department, and the prosecution had
not intervened to help.
   ``Israel's purpose has been to educate young Israelis about the
Holocaust and if they were to acquit my dad, that would not serve
their purpose,'' he said.
   Demjanjuk has been plagued throughout the trial by a poor
defense. He fired Mark O'Connor, his attorney of seven years,
midway through the proceedings.
   Several defense witnesses were discredited, including one who
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide
after her credentials were called into question during
cross-examination.
   Resting the defense case, Gill called on judges to recognize the
prosecution had not ``presented the proof necessary to convict this
innocent man.''
   ``We have presented evidence sufficient to destroy the
prosecution case,'' Gill said. ``John Demjanjuk's life is in your
hands.''
   According to Israeli law, both the verdict and sentence are
reached by a majority vote of the three judges.
   Levine said the date of the verdict would be announced 10 days
in advance. If Demjanjuk is convicted, a separate sentencing
hearing will be held about one month after the verdict. Demjanjuk
could be sentenced to death.
   Defense lawyer Paul Chumak apologized for comparing the
proceedings with the case in which Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer
in the French army, was falsely convicted of treason at the
beginning of this century.
   Chumak told the court Wednesday that Dreyfus was convicted ``on
the basis of false documents in a wave of anti-Semitism.
Paralleling this with anti-Ukrainism, this trial has all the
earmarks of the Dreyfus trial.''
   Dreyfus was later exonerated.
   On Thursday, Chumak said he ``meant no criticism or disrespect
whatsoever to this honorable court. If there were any such
inference that anyone could draw, then of course I apologize
unhesitatingly.''

   Vice President George Bush on Thursday called the
Super Tuesday series of Republican presidential primaries a crucial
campaign showdown, and said: ``I intend to win.''
   Capping the first day of his campaign in the southern and border
states which hold primaries and caucuses on March 8, Bush told an
enthusiastic crowd, ``There is no way you can become president of
the United States by not doing well, if not winning, on Super
Tuesday.''
   Bush described what's at stake as he concluded a campaign foray
into Missouri with a return to his adopted home state of Texas.
   ``Texas is George Bush country,'' Gov. William Clements told
hundreds of Bush supporters massed in the flag-bedecked atrium of
the Loews Anatole Hotel.
   Earlier, Bush touted Ronald Reagan's record in asking Missouri
voters to give a chance to carry on the legacy that ``the president
and I'' have established over the last seven years.
   ``We've come a long way under the Reagan-Bush administration,''
Bush told the Texas audience. ``The question now is, who is best
qualified to carry on.''
   Earlier, in Friestatt, Mo., he surprised customers at a truck
stop and told one woman: ``Thought you were going to have a quiet
cup of coffee, didn't you?''
   After visiting several people in the Tin Lizzie restaurant at
Sto's Auto and Truck Plaza, Bush carried a cup of coffee himself _
he ordered a small, but got a large _ as he returned to his
limousine to continue campaigning.
   Although Bush, in his drive for the Republican presidential
nomination, has repeatedly advertised his loyalty to Reagan, he
gave more emphasis to this part of his basic campaign pitch
Thursday.
   ``I am proud to have stood with this president through thick and
through thin, and in good times and bad times, next to Ronald
Reagan, without cutting and running,'' he said.
   Reagan has remained neutral in the race for the GOP nomination,
although he is widely believed to privately favor Bush. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated earlier this week that Reagan
plans to stay out of the GOP nominating process.
   Bush told reporters he was surprised by the size of his victory
over Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday,
when Bush got 38 percent of the vote to Dole's 29 percent. But Bush
said he could not ``crow about'' elections of the past as he
concentrates on the balloting still ahead.
   Missouri is among the states with events in the crucial round of
Super Tuesday voting March 8. As he campaigned in the state, Bush
kept his promise to resume the grass-roots campaign style he began
after he finished behind Dole and Pat Robertson in the Feb. 8 Iowa
precinct caucuses.
   ``Many things have improved since the president and I took
office,'' Bush told a crowd at an elementary school in Monett.
   On the same day that Reagan sent Congress a proposed $1.09
trillion budget envisioning a $129.5 billion deficit for fiscal
1989 which begins Oct. 1, Bush repeated his own proposal for a
four-year budget freeze.
   Bush said, however, that his spending freeze would make
allowances for the rate of inflation and would not ``freeze in''
expenditures which should go.
   Asked as he arrived in Missouri whether he needed a ``truth
squad'' to check out his statements about Dole, Bush replied: ``I
don't think so. I'm telling the truth. I hadn't heard about that.
I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing here _ get the message out,
fight hard. Feel comfortable on the turf.''
   Dole has accused Bush of running ads in New Hampshire which
distorted the senator's position on several issues.
   In Washington, some Republican senators supporting Dole said
they would go to the Super Tuesday primary states to present what
they termed a clear and unequivocal picture of Dole's record.
   ``We're not going to attack anyone,'' Sen. Wrren Rudman, R-N.H.,
told reporters who asked if they would criticize Bush for his
statements about Dole's voting record.
   Rudman said, however, that during the late days of the New
Hampshire campaign, some Bush ads criticizing Dole's record were
``a misstatement of his record.''
   Rep. Gene Taylor, R-Mo., accompanying Bush on the flight to
Missouri, said he thinks Reagan's standing in Missouri will benefit
Bush. ``We've had a great upswing in Missouri. We've had a great
rebound in the economy,'' Taylor said.
   In an interview, Taylor said he had advised Bush, ``Don't get
into an argument with Bob Dole and Pat Robertson.'' He also said he
told the vice president he did not think negative advertising would
be useful.
   Without mentioning Bush by name, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
said ``to say that Bob Dole has been anything but a tax-cutter, a
deficit-cutter and a fiscal conservative is simply wrong.''
   Bush also said he would honor his commitment to take part in
Friday night's Republican candidate debate here, despite the fact
that Dole and Robertson have said they will not participate.
   Dole said in Atlanta that the Dallas event would be a ``pep
rally'' for Bush, and Robertson spokeswoman Constance Snapp said
the Robertson campaign ``did not believe the format would provide a
fair and equitable discussion of the issues.''

   A toxic chemical spill snaking its way
toward Lake Erie on Thursday forced the evacuation of hundreds of
people and fouled drinking water for at least 22,000 along the
Sandusky River.
   At least three people were treated for injuries after an
estimated 100,000 gallons of toluene, an octane enhancer, spilled
Wednesday from a ruptured Sun Co. pipeline south of here.
   Five hundred people, including 300 residents of Old Fort, 10
miles to the south, were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday because
of the fumes.
   ``It could get worse,'' said Sandusky County Sheriff Dave
Gangwer. ``It depends on how slow it moves, and it's slowing down
rapidly.''
   The spill reached Fremont late Thursday, and the city stopped
pumping water from the river, officials said. They estimated a
14-mile section of the river was contaminated; the river was
flowing at about 1 mph.
   Officials fear the spill killed up to 1,000 fish, many of them
under ice, in Sugar Creek and the Sandusky River, and could affect
waterfowl, said Mike Taylor, a wildlife officer for the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources.
   Gov. Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency for Sandusky
County, which includes Fremont. The declaration makes state
assistance available.
   About 4 million gallons of water, one day's normal supply, was
put in reserve tanks before the spill arrived, said Gary
Rathfelder, assistant superintendent of Fremont's water plant.
   Toluene is a flammable chemical that can produce irritating or
poisonous gases, according to an emergency response guidebook
published by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   The spill was detected around 6 p.m. Wednesday after Sun workers
noticed that pressure had dropped in the pipeline, which carries
the chemical from a Sun oil refinery in Toledo to a refinery in
Marcus Hook, Pa.
   Sonya Elam, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Disaster Services Agency,
said the chemical spilled in a swampy area in Seneca County, south
of Fremont, population 22,000, and then leaked into Sugar Creek, a
tributary of the Sandusky River. The Sandusky River flows north
into Lake Erie, 10 miles north of here.
   Ms. Elam said Ohio Environmental Protection Agency workers were
building a road into the swampy area and setting up a dike to
contain the chemical.
   Bob Arnet, an environmental safety coordinator for the Tulsa,
Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said authorities had not located the
leak.
   ``It's been shut off, but it's still leaking,'' Arnet said.
   Neither EPA nor Sun officials could estimate how much of the
chemical had entered the Sandusky River.
   Two emergency workers were treated at Tiffin Mercy Hospital
after they fell through ice and into contaminated water, while a
volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes. All
were subsequently released.
   Bud Davis, a corporate spokesman for Sun, said the company would
take ``liability and responsibility for the leak.''
   Jack Fox, operations manager for Sun Pipe Line, a Sun Co.
subsidiary, said the source of the leak was an 18-inch split in the
pipeline, which is buried 3{ feet deep and carries the chemical
from northwest Ohio to a refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa.
   The cleanup could cost as much as $1 million and last three to
four months, Davis said.
   EPA officials said they believed much of the chemical would
dissipate by the time it reaches Lake Erie.
   Don Higgins, environmental coordinator for the Ohio EPA, said he
did not expect lasting environmental problems, but added, ``I
expect quite a bit of environmental impact on Sugar Creek.''
   ``It's not the kind of stuff you want in a river,'' he said.
``It won't kill you, but you don't want to be around it for too
long.''

   The AFL-CIO launched a campaign
Thursday against what it called an attempt by Texas Air Corp. to
force a strike at Eastern Airlines and transfer its operations to
non-unionized Texas Air subsidiaries.
   The 14.3 million-member federation's industrial union department
said it has established a citizen's commission to hold hearings on
a ``campaign of abuse'' against Eastern's 22,550 unionized workers
and ``steady deterioration of service and safety standards'' since
Texas Air acquired it two years ago.
   Miami-based Eastern and the Machinists union representing some
12,000 Eastern mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground
personnel have been in mediation since November after declaring an
impasse on the airline's demand for a new round of wage concessions.
   In the meantime, the company has attempted to spin off its
Northeast air shuttle linking New York, Washington and Boston _ a
move contested in court by the union _ and made extensive
preparations to continue operating in anticipation of a strike as
early as April 1.
   ``Eastern has steadily increased work pressures and economic
pressures on its employees with the clear intention of forcing a
strike,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Thursday.
   ``Recruitment of strikebreakers in the midst of negotiations
leaves no doubt that it (Texas Air) intends to repeat the all-out
union-busting effort that it carried out after seizing Continental
Airlines, when it cynically exploited the bankruptcy laws to
abrogate its union contracts,'' Kirkland said.
   Howard Samuel, head of the federation's industrial union
department, said the citizen panel's hearings and demonstrations
planned in Eastern hub cities _ Miami, Atlanta, Washington,
Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Kansas City, Houston and Denver _
are intended to put public pressure on Texas Air's debtholders to
get Eastern to settle with the Machinists.
   A boycott was rejected as ``playing right into his (Texas Air
owner Frank Lorenzo's) hands to destroy Eastern Airlines,'' Samuel
said.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the unions' public relations
campaign will only backfire.
   ``The intent is to cause further deterioration in Eastern's
already serious financial condition,'' he said. ``If such a
self-defeating and destructive campaign were to be successful, the
economic impact would unquestionably have a serious and detrimental
effect on Eastern's 32,500 employees.''
   Eastern, which reported a net loss of $181.1 million in 1987, is
demanding $265 million in concessions from the Machinists over the
next two years. For some, that would mean wage and benefit cuts of
up to 48 percent, union officials said.
   Contracts with two other unions representing the airline's 3,550
pilots and 7,000 flight attendants also come up for renewal in July
and December, respectively. The company last year told them it
needs concessions totaling $185 million from the two groups.
   Samuels said the citizen's panel will be chaired by Eleanor
Holmes Norton, former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, and includes among its members former Labor Secretary
W. Willard Wirtz; the Rev. Joseph Lowry, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, and Texas Agriculture Commissioner
Jim Hightower.

   A biotechnology company said Wednesday it has
developed a 95 percent accurate method of determining the sex of
calves in the embryo.
   ``This embryo-sexing technique makes it possible to control the
composition of the herd,'' said Joseph M. Massey, president of
Granada Genetics Inc.
   The technique involves removing a few cells from the cow embryo
and examining them with a gene probe capable of detecting the Y
chromosome, which is present only in male cells and indicates a
male embryo, the company said.
   Embryos designated male or female can then be shipped to clients
for transplantation, the company said.
   Producing cattle of the desired sex has obvious advantages to
dairy farmers, who need only females, Massey said. Because of
widespread use of artificial insemination, one bull can sire
thousands of calves.

   A Soviet rocket exploded before
reaching orbit this week, and debris believed to be from the blast
landed off Australia, with another chunk expected to hit Earth on
Saturday, a defense official said.
   ``We are trying to identify it and project an entry area. We
can't do that right now ... but should get that sometime tomorrow
morning,'' Bob Hollie, a North American Aerospace Defense Command
spokesman, said Thursday.
   One chunk, believed to have been a foundation piece that held
three satellites to a Soviet Proton rocket launched sometime this
week, came down off the southern coast of Australia, Hollie said.
   A second piece won't make it past the earth's atmosphere, but a
third being tracked by NORAD is believed to be too big to burn up
before hitting Earth, Hollie said.
   ``They may or may not be related to the Proton launch by the
Soviet Union,'' Hollie said. ``We are not saying they are or are
not. The problem we have is they never made it into orbit. The
rocket blew up before it attained orbit.''
   Hollie said it's ``hard to say right now'' if the debris poses
any danger. ``We don't know exactly how big the piece is,'' he
said, but added that it is bigger than the piece that hit near
Australia.
   ``Because of the low orbit, it is very hard for the U.S. Space
Command to track it,'' Hollie said.
   The Space Command, also located near Colorado Springs, tracks
satellites, rockets and space debris. NORAD tracks of bombers and
missiles.

   A baby born with most of his brain
missing and kept on life-support systems to preserve his organs for
transplant was pronounced brain dead Thursday, and a search was
under way for compatible organ recipients.
   The 7-pound child known as Baby Boy John remained on
life-support systems at Loma Linda University Medical Center on
Thursday afternoon, officials said. The infant suffered from
anencephaly, which kills most babies within days.
   Four babies whose blood type matched that of Baby John were
known to need livers, and they were being evaluated for transplant,
said Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda chief of neonatology.
   No other cases in which anencephalics have been kept on
life-support for organ transplant have been announced in the United
States, although Dr. Leonard Bailey, chief of Loma Linda's heart
transplant program, last year suggested there have been such
infants.
   Baby John was born Tuesday at Martin Luther Hospital Medical
Center in Anaheim and transferred to Loma Linda, where Bailey has
pioneered infant heart transplants.
   ``By 9 o'clock last evening our clinical criteria for brain
death were met,'' Ms. Peabody said. She added that a neurologist
unconnected with Loma Linda confirmed the brain death Thursday.
   The organs of anencephalic babies can be transplanted only if
organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infants on
life-support. Baby John's parents, who asked not to be identified,
had wanted other babies to receive his organs.
   Loma Linda maintained the infant on life-support under
guidelines developed last year after a woman pregnant with an
anencephalic child waged a nationwide campaign to find a hospital
that would consent to keep the baby on life-support until the
organs could be donated. However, the baby was stillborn.
   Loma Linda guidelines call for doctors to use machines to keep
the organs of anencephalic infants functioning for up to seven
days, then disconnect life-support and let the baby die if brain
death hasn't occurred.
   The procedure was denounced by the National Right to Life
Committee, which accused Loma Linda of going beyond prevailing
medical ethics.
   ``It is an outrage to see how Loma Linda has bulldozed ahead in
anencephalic experiments,'' said Brian Johnston, the group's
Western director. He called for a halt to further use of organs
from anencephalics.
   ``We are confronted with the very real possibility that body
parts will be taken from live children,'' he said.
   One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4
received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year, but
the donor child was in Canada.
   Bailey set off a medical controversy in 1984 when he
transplanted the heart of a baboon into an infant known as Baby
Fae. She died 20 days later.

   A man who had confessed a role
in the slaying of the country's most prominent human rights
activist recanted Thursday and said he had been drugged and abused
in jail.
   Jorge Miranda, 19, retracted his confession in a writ filed by
his lawyers in the San Salvador court where the case is being
heard. He had said last month that he was a leftist guerrilla and
was a lookout in the killing.
   The document, handwritten and signed by Miranda, asks the judge
to set a date for a new declaration that will negate the
confession. Miranda's lawyers made a copy of the document avaialble
to The Associated Press.
   Justice Minister Julio Samayoa presented Miranda to reporters on
Jan. 5 to reinforce the government's contention that leftist
insurgents killed Herbert Anaya last Oct. 26. Anaya was president
of the independent Salvadoran Human Rights Commission.
   Human rights organizations and San Salvador's Roman Catholic
archbishop, Arturo Rivera Damas, had blamed the slaying on a death
squad. The rightist squads, reportedly linked to security forces,
have been responsible for thousands of political killings since
civil war broke out in 1979.
   Rightists contend the rights commission headed by Anaya was a
front organization for the guerrillas. Three members of the
commission have been killed in recent years and two disappeared.
Death squads claimed responsibility for two of the slayings.
   Miranda last month told journalists he served as a lookout for
the assassins who shot Anaya. He said he was a member of the
People's Revolutionary Army, one of five guerrilla groups in the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   The government contends the rebels killed Anaya to create a
martyr for their movement.
   Miranda, who is the capital's Mariona jail, said in his writ:
``I took responsibility in that death (of Anaya) because I felt
very bad and worn out because of the treatment I was given by the
National Police.
   ``I felt worn out since a doctor arrived and, while I was
blindfolded, gave me an injection ... this and other acts against
me and my family pressured me to take responsibility for things I
did not do.''
   There was no indication as to when Miranda's new declaration
would be taken by the presiding judge.

   A computer whiz who authorities say went
on a shooting rampage at his former company when his fantasies of
romance with a co-worker unraveled was charged Thursday with seven
counts of murder.
   Richard W. Farley also was charged with three counts of
attempted murder, burglary and vandalism in Tuesday's shotgun
massacre at the defense plant in neighboring Sunnyvale.
   The 39-year-old San Jose man, a software development engineer
fired two years ago from ESL Inc., was ordered held without bail.
He is scheduled to enter a plea March 4.
   Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Alan Nudelman said
he would seek the death penalty.
   Farley, who was being held under a suicide watch at the county
jail, shot his way into the high-security installation and damaged
the interior, authorities said. Three people were wounded by
gunfire; a fourth broke an arm trying to escape.
   Among those recovering Thursday was ESL employee Laura Black, a
26-year-old electrical engineer, called the main target of the
shootings.
   Black says she refused to date Farley but he haunted her for
four years with strange gifts and threatening letters and
frequently followed her.
   She obtained a temporary court order earlier this month for him
to keep away from her, and that order was made permanent Wednesday.
   At ESL's offices Thursday, several employees were led through
the facility where the attack occurred. The tours were ``part of
the healing process'' and were recommended by counselors,
spokeswoman Edie Cartwright said.
   Employees saw walls and floors riddled with bullet holes and
dozens of computer terminals with screens shot out, she said.
Numerous windows also were shattered. Blood stains had been painted
over and most rugs removed.
   The extent of damage made it evident ``we were very lucky not to
lose a whole lot more people,'' Cartwright said. The company plans
to reopen its first floor Friday and its second floor, scene of
most of the damage, on Monday.
   Meanwhile, investigators and colleagues reported that the burly
Texas native apparently had no criminal record, had been honorably
discharged after 11 years in the U.S. Navy, was highly intelligent
and performed satisfactorily at several top-secret defense jobs he
had held in the Silicon Valley.
   He is a part-time student in computer science at San Jose State
University, and was engaged to marry another computer student.
   He was known as ``competent, cheerful, a pretty nice guy,'' said
Ron Edinger, president of Sunnyvale-based Covalent Systems Corp.,
his current employer.
   But neighbors said Farley, who lived in a dilapidated cottage
with peeling paint, was a loner who never said hello to anyone.
   When he failed to get dates with Black, he began living in a
fantasy world, said Black's attorney, Mary Bird. Farley was fired
in May 1986 from his $36,000-a-year job as a software development
engineer after sending a letter threatening Black's life, said
Jerry DeRuntz, a company manager.
   The attack, said police Capt. Al Scott and Lt. Ruben Grijalva,
was Farley's way of showing he wouldn't tolerate being spurned by
Black or laughed at by other ESL employees.
   According to court records Black filed in seeking the court
order, Farley believed the two had taken vacations together and
even tried to pass faked photographs as proof that the dates
occurred. Toward the end of the four years of alleged harassment,
he issued frequent warnings that ``something bad'' could occur.
   ``It might not really occur to you how far I'm willing to go to
upset you if I decide that's what I'm forced to,'' he wrote in a
letter to Black last July.
   Then on Nov. 13 he wrote: ``This is going to escalate ... All
because you think I'm a joke and refuse to listen or to understand
that I'm gravely serious.''
   Black said fear of the consequences had caused her to endure the
behavior, obtaining an unlisted phone number and moving three
times, until she realized last month that ``I'm at the end of my
rope.''

   The chief mediator in Nicaraguan peace
talks offered a five-point proposal Thursday night in an attempt to
break what he called an impasse between the Sandinista government
and Contra rebels.
   The Contras said they accepted the proposal by Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo ``in principle,'' but the Sandinistas said it needed
to be clarified in further talks Friday before they could respond.
   Obando y Bravo, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in
Nicaragua, called on the Contras to accept a 30-day cease-fire in
exchange for four major concessions by the government.
   Those concessions were:
   _A ``full, general'' amnesty for the several thousand political
prisoners remaining in Nicaragua, including members of former
dictator Anastasio Somoza's National Guard.
   _A promise to ``reconsider'' a mandatory military draft law that
has sparked protests in some cities.
   _Full freedom of the press, which now is extended only to a
handful of communications outlets.
   _A dialogue with the Sandinistas' internal opposition, including
14 dissident political parties and a coalition of business, labor
and political groups.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, said
Obando y Bravo did not spell out conditions for the cease-fire ``as
to when and where it would take place. We have to clarify those
points.
   ``The requirements of the government were very clear and very
well defined,'' Tinoco said. ``But the requirement for the
Resistance was not as clear.''
   Tinoco said the cardinal's proposal did not say whether the
cease-fire should be country-wide or limited only to certain zones.
He said it also lacked any mention of a verification procedure.
   Obando y Bravo told reporters he offered the proposal after the
two sides could not agree on the terms of a cease-fire in the
opening session of a second round of face-to-face peace talks.
   He said the Contras wanted to discuss a cease-fire in ``terms of
unifying the Nicaraguan family'' through political reforms, while
the government sought to negotiate only a halt in hostilities.
   Tinoco said the Sandinistas had offered the rebels ``a very,
very flexible proposal'' at their first round of direct talks in
San Jose, Costa Rica, in late January.
   ``Our attitude is fundamentally open,'' Tinoco told reporters
shortly before the talks resumed Thursday morning. ``We are willing
to listen to what they have to say ... on all aspects of a
cease-fire.''
   Fernando Aguero, one of seven Contra negotiators, said his side
also approached the talks ``with our minds open. We hope we can
make definite progrss in these negotiations.''
   The talks took place in church offices next to the Roman
Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, where the presidents of five
Central American nations prayed together after signing a peace
accord last Aug. 7.
   It was that pact that brought the two sides in the 6-year-old
Nicaraguan conflict together, first in indirect talks in the
Dominican Republic late last year, then in face-to-face meetings.
   The Sandinistas arrived at 3 p.m., passing about 75 Nicaraguan
refugees who gathered outside the church offices chanting slogans
and carrying anti-Sandinista banners.
   Obando y Bravo arrived minutes later and met privately for about
half an hour with the Sandinista delegation.
   The Contras came to the meeting at 3:30 p.m. in a rented bus and
were greeted as heroes by the protesters. One rebel negotiator, a
field commander known as Commandante Tono, held a fist aloft in
defiance. He was hugged and kissed by women demonstrators.
   The Contras and Sandinistas sat down together and began talks at
4:30 p.m. The discussions are due to continue through Saturday.
   The first round of direct talks came one week before the House
rejected President Reagan's request for $36.2 million in additional
Contra aid.
   House Speaker Jim Wright and other Democratic leaders are trying
to put together a new package that would provide only non-lethal
assistance to see the Contras through a transition to peace.
   The Contras want the talks to include the Sandinistas' internal
opposition, primarily represented by a coalition of business, labor
and political groups known as the Democratic Coordinate.
   The Coordinate and the Contras have called for 17 changes in the
Nicaraguan Constitution, including separation of the army from the
Sandinista political party, electoral reforms and the creation of a
tribunal to guarantee constitutional rights.
   The government has countered with a call for a 30-day
cease-fire, during which the Contras would be confined to three
zones totaling about 4,000 square miles in the northern, central
and southern parts of the country.
   During the cease-fire, the Contras would be able to retain their
arms and receive humanitarian aid from relief agencies. At the end
of the 30 days, they would be required to either accept amnesty or
leave the country.

   A former security consultant to Lyndon LaRouche
was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $50,000 Wednesday
for conspiring to obstruct an investigation of alleged fraud by
supporters of the political extremist.
   Roy E. Frankhauser was the first of 14 individual and five
corporate defendants in the case, including LaRouche, to stand
trial. LaRouche, six aides and the five organizations are on trial
in federal court here.
   Frankhauser, 48, of Reading, Pa., was convicted in December of
helping LaRouche and his aides cover up alleged credit card and
loan fraud by LaRouche followers during his 1984 presidential
campaign.
   Testimony indicated Frankhauser advised LaRouche to order
fund-raisers to leave the country, burn documents and refuse to
cooperate with investigators.
   LaRouche's attorneys have argued that they thought Frankhauser
was working for the CIA and that in following his orders they were
acting in the interest of national security.
   Prosecutors and Frankhauser's attorney said at his trial that
Frankhauser lied about having CIA sources to impress LaRouche.
   Frankhauser was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice,
which carries a maximium penalty of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham requested a
four-year sentence.
   Frankhauser pleaded for leniency, saying he had to take care of
his elderly mother and was planning to get married.
   He also said that he frequently urged LaRouche to settle with
the alleged fraud victims and that he had cooperated with the
government.
   Frankhauser also alluded to his past membership in the Ku Klux
Klan, the American Nazi Party and other extremist groups, telling
U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton, ``I've had enough of
demonstrations.''
   In rejecting the plea for leniency, Keeton said Frankhauser and
his attorney had understated Frankhauser's role in the conspiracy.
   Markham earlier had told Keeton that two grand juries that
investigated the alleged fraud were repeatedly stymied because
LaRouche aides followed Frankhauser's directions on how to obstruct
the investigation.
   LaRouche, a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination, is charged with conspiring to obstruct justice. His
trial began the week after Frankhauser was convicted and is
expected to last several more months.
   Three other LaRouche aides named in the 125-count indictment
have been granted later trials and three are fugitives.

   A man jailed on a murder charge in Oklahoma
will be represented by a stand-in Saturday on the Oregon Lottery's
televised game show, officials said Wednesday.
   Paulino Sanchez, 29, could win as much as $50,000 and will
receive at least $300 for participating in the show, officials said.
   Sanchez was arrested Feb. 5 on a fugitive warrant and was
returned to Oklahoma last week. He is accused of murdering a
bicyclist in Oklahoma City in 1986.
   A rub-off ticket Sanchez bought while in Oregon entitles him to
appear on the weekly ``The Money Game'' show and compete for cash
prizes.
   Bill Johnson, director of lottery security, said Sanchez asked
that Lottery Director Jim Davey appoint a proxy to appear in his
place.
   Any winnings will be sent to Sanchez, Johnson said.

   A baby born with most of his brain
missing was on life-support systems Wednesday to preserve his
organs for transplant, a hospital official said. It was the first
such case announced in the United States.
   The baby, whose name was withheld to protect the parents'
privacy, was born Tuesday at Martin Luther Hospital Medical Center
in Anaheim and transferred to Loma Linda University Medical Center,
said Loma Linda spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   At Loma Linda, the baby was put on life-support equipment.
   ``The infant appears comfortable and is showing signs of
brain-stem death,'' Ms. Rockwell said.
   The baby suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is
missing. Such children almost always die within days. Their organs
can be transplanted only if organ damage is prevented by
maintaining the infants on life-support.
   Loma Linda is maintaining the infant under medical guidelines
developed last year after a woman pregnant with an anencephalic
baby waged a nationwide campaign to find a hospital that would
consent to keep her child on life-support until the organs could be
donated. However, the child was stillborn.
   The guidelines call for doctors to use machines to keep the
baby's organs functioning properly for up to seven days, Ms.
Rockewell said.
   If doctrs declare the infant brain-dead within seven days, he
will be listed on national organ donor registries. If the baby
isn't brain dead after seven days, life-support systems will be
removed and the baby allowed to die.
   ``We don't want to prolong the agony of the parents. ... We feel
there needs to be a limit set as to how long we'll continue this,''
Ms. Rockwell.
   No cases of anencephalics being maintained on life-support have
been announced in the United States, although Dr. Leonard Bailey,
chief of Loma Linda's heart transplant program, hinted last
November there have been such infants.
   One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4
received the heart of an anencephalic baby, but the donor child was
in Canada.
   Bailey triggered an international medical controversy in 1984
when he transplanted the heart of a baboon into an infant known as
Baby Fae. She died 20 days later.

   A hospital patient on a respirator died in a
flash fire that enveloped the oxygen apparatus Wednesday, the Fire
Department said.
   The 26-year-old victim, whose identity was not released,
suffered from AIDS-related pneumonia, said Howard Rubenstein, a
spokesman for Downtown Beekman Hospital.
   The fire remained confined to the respirator but forced the
evacuation of 26 patients in the intensive care unit and patients
from elsewhere in the hospital, Rubenstein said. No other injuries
were reported.
   A short-circuit in the respirator may have ignited the oxygen,
fire officials said.
   ``Nothing else around (the respirator) burned,'' said Fire
Department spokesman Lt. Frank Martinez. ``The bed ... was not
burned in any way. We really have no idea of what killed the
patient actually.''
   Thick black smoke enveloped the third-floor intensive care unit
and extended down to the first floor, Rubenstein said.

   General Motors Corp. said Wednesday it has pulled
an eight-page advertising insert from an upcoming issue of Fortune
magazine because of a negative cover story about GM in a recent
issue.
   The Feb. 15 issue carried a package of articles on GM and its
woes, including a cover story titled ``How I Would Turn Around GM''
by Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, one of the automaker's biggest
critics.
   ``It just would make good business sense not to run the ad. It's
not a punitive action,'' said GM spokesman Jim Crellin.
   Crellin said GM research has shown that ``it's counterproductive
to run an ad in a publication carrying or that recently carried a
negative story.''
   He added that the ad section will not run in a later issue.
   GM spent $750 million in 1987 to rid its board of Perot, who
founded GM subsidiary Electronic Data Systems Corp., and several
associates.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith, who was interviewed for the package,
said after the magazine appeared that he had not known information
from the interview would be presented as a response to Perot's
remarks.
   The ads were part of a $20 million campaign that included a
glitzy weeklong auto technology show at New York's Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in early January.
   Neither GM nor Fortune would reveal how much the ads were worth.
According to the trade journal Advertising Age, GM was the
magazine's largest advertiser in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Watching the frumpy, middle-aged wife of a
provincial English vicar spiral out of control may not seem to be
the ideal subject for what appears, at first, to be a domestic
comedy.
   But Alan Ayckbourn's ``Woman in Mind,'' which opened Wednesday
at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club, is a very funny play. It
is also a dark, disturbing one, an unsettling look at someone
slowly going mad.
   What makes ``Woman in Mind'' special is its fractured,
odd-angled look at the play's main character, a dispirited, dowdy
housewife named Susan. The woman is defeated by life and trapped in
a marriage where she is not so much unloved as ignored.
   The play could have been a dismal household harangue, but
Ayckbourn makes it decidedly unconventional. He carries
theatergoers into Susan's psyche, and it's a harrowing journey.
   A blow to the head from a garden rake sets Susan off on an
escape into fantasy. What Ayckbourn does is juggle reality and
illusion in front of us, while posing questions about happiness,
love and faith and what happens to a woman who has very little of
each in her life.
   Susan's fantasies come alive in the form of a make-believe
family, a husband, brother and daughter who look and sound like
they just stepped out of a Noel Coward comedy. Drinking champagne
and perpetually dressed for tennis, the trio offers her relief from
her unrelenting and uncaring world.
   These people are the antitheses of Susan's real-life husband and
assorted relatives and friends. The stuffy, smug husband is more
concerned about finishing a 600-year history of the local parish
than with his wife's mental collapse.
   The woman must also endure a comic gorgon of a sister-in-law
whose ineptness as a cook sends guests fleeing in terror; a
well-meaning but accident-prone doctor who develops a crush on her,
and an unforgiving son who returns home from the clutches of a
bizarre sect where silence was not only golden but absolute.
   Susan sorts out life in her garden, a wonderfully verdant and
deceptively tranquil oasis designed by John Lee Beatty. She
survives by withdrawing from her tormenters and just refuses to
fight when her imaginary and real families battle over her soul.
   Much of this is accomplished with high humor. The playwright
pricks the social, moral and cultural conventions of a lower middle
class where appearances count most. It's the one thing Ayckbourne's
heroine can't keep up with.
   Under Lynn Meadow's sensitive direction, Stockard Channing gives
a compelling, unsentimental performance as Ayckbourn's haunted
heroine. It's a wide-ranging portrait, capturing the character's
acerbic humor as well as her ever-increasing despair. The actress,
almost unrecognizable, is a lumpy vision of growing dementia. She
wears an unattractive, flower-print dress, and her hair gives new
meaning to the term ``dishwater blond.''
   Her two families are not of equal interest, and the disparity
shows in the performances. Remak Ramsay is superbly self-absorbed
as the vicar, and Patricia Conolly turns in a masterful job as the
lethal cook and relentess sister-in-law. There is also a gentle,
low-key and thoroughly ingratiating performance from Simon Jones as
the well-meaning doctor.
   Susan's fantasy family is not as well defined, and such fine
actors as Daniel Gerroll and Michael Countryman _ Susan's idealized
husband and brother _ must struggle to make them seem more than
just comic devices.
   To his credit, Ayckbourn doesn't make Susan completely
sympathetic, but gives her several abusive tirades which
demonstrate why her husband and son have turned away.
   The playwright also keeps the audience off-center and at arms
length. As Susan descends further and further into insanity,
Ayckbourn darkens the comedy. The audience still laughs, but it's a
nervous laughter born out of the bleakness of the situation.
``Woman in Mind'' never forgets the humor in the horror _ a
remarkable balancing act well worth seeing.

   A Chicago man was listed in critical
condition Wednesday after receiving a Jarvik-7 artificial heart
while he awaits a donor heart.
   Frank R. Martello, 56, underwent the two-hour operation Tuesday
night at Loyola University Medical Center, the hospital said
Wednesday.
   Dr. Roque Pifarre, surgical director of Loyola's heart
transplant program, said Martello's heart had deteriorated despite
two bypass procedures.
   It is estimated that the patient can be kept alive by the
artificial heart for at least 30 days, the hospital said.
   Loyola is the only medical center in Illinois permitted to
perform the procedure and one of 15 centers designated by the Food
and Drug Administration throughout the United States.
   The Jarvik 7 is named for its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik of
Salt Lake City, and was first implanted in 1982 at the University
of Utah. The recipient, Barney Clark, lived for 112 days.
   The longest surviving recipient of the Jarvik 7, William
Schroeder, 52, Jasper, Ind., lived for 620 days and was able to
leave the hospital twice before his death in 1986.

   A judge Wednesday ordered the last tenant
of the rundown Lorraine Motel out of her home of 11 years so that
the site of the Rev. Martin Luther King's assassination can be
turned into a civil rights museum.
   Shelby County Judge John A. Donald said he had no choice but to
side against Jacqueline Smith, who did not appear at the hearing or
have an attorney present.
   Miss Smith, 37, was given 10 days to leave before the case is
turned over the sheriff's office.
   During the 10-minute hearing, witnesses for the state testified
that all procedures had been followed in trying to remove Miss
Smith and that she had been offered relocation assistance.
   Local citizens organized in 1982 to buy the Lorraine at a
foreclosure auction, and the state later took title to the
property. The motel was closed Jan. 11 and its few remaining
residents were told to move out.
   Miss Smith, a former motel employee, ignored a state deadline
Feb. 8 to move out and likened her protest to civil rights battles
led by King. She has said the museum would force poor people out of
the neighborhood.
   King was shot to death at the motel on April 4, 1968, while in
Memphis to help organize a strike by sanitation workers. James Earl
Ray pleaded guilty to the slaying and is serving a 99-year prison
sentence.
   The museum is scheduled to open in 1991.

<HEAD>Would Tax Amnesty Be The Answer?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty states in recent years have conducted tax
amnesty programs, most of them with enormous success.
   In New York State, about 151,000 people sought to pay up without
penalty in 1985-86, bringing $392 million to the treasury that
otherwise might not have been collected.
   Illinois raised $159.1 million, California $146.8 million, and
Michigan $101.7 million. Massachusetts collected $86.3 million,
about four times what it had projected.
   Viewed as an investment, the states did spectacularly. New York
spent $2.8 million to bring in 140 times that amount. Illinois'
cost was $2 million, and California's $5.8 million.
   Impressive as they might be, those figures tell only a fraction
of the benefits that accrued to states.
   The states discovered continuing sources of higher revenue
because they were able to identify those who had heretofore eluded
identification. And honest taxpayers were reassured that they
weren't carrying an unfair burden.
   Moreover, the amnesty programs generally were followed by more
disciplined administrative procedures to assure that evasion
wouldn't be so attractive in the future.
   And that brings up the question: With the U.S. Congress having
spent two decades wrestling with budget deficits, should an amnesty
program be considered on a national level?
   The significance of that question descends with a shock on
anyone familiar with the 1983 U.S. Treasury estimate that more than
$100 billion a year of federal revenue is lost because of
under-reporting and nonreporting.
   The question of a federal amnesty isn't new, having been
discussed in the media, academic circles and Congress. President
Reagan has expressed concern about underpayment. Honest and
dishonest taxpayers have supported the idea.
   Now there is more grist for the argument with publication of a
study of state amnesty programs by a college professor that
suggests there are ways to assure a program' success.
   Working under a fellowship from the Rockefeller Institute, Ram
L. Chugh, economist at the State University of New York at Potsdam,
found that the most successful programs were followed by tougher
penalties immediately thereafter.
   Chugh found that guilt and gratitude were among the three most
important motivations in successful programs. The other factor,
cited most often of the three, was fear.
   ``Amnesty programs in several states were accompanied by
warnings that tax enforcement would be much stricter after the
amnesty period,'' said Chugh. And in the more successful programs,
publicity reinforced those warnings.
   There are lessons for the country in the experience of the
states, one of them being that failure to pay taxes isn't always to
save the money. Ignorance of the law was cited. Confusion was
mentioned. Divorce. Procrastination, too.
   While criminality is an obvious factor in the failure to pay
taxes, there are many reasons, some apparently involving simple
human failings. One of those may be a failure to understand the tax
system.
   That much becomes clear not so much from Chugh's study as from
the differing answers given to the same questions by those
interpreting the tax laws, including the Internal Revenue Service's
own personnel.
   Whatever the reasons, the consequences cannot be measured in
money alone. Chugh comments that tax evasion in its various forms
has grown more serious in recent years, leading to significant
social and economic consequences.
   For one thing, he says, ``the honest taxpayer ends up bearing
the additional tax burden.'' And, he suggests, the existence of a
huge element of nonpayers actually distorts official data on the
economy's performance.

<HEAD>Swedish Crystal Makers Cling to Old Tradition</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VAXJO, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erik Hoglund, a commercial artist, brought
a new style to the old art of making crystal in Sweden 30 years
ago. He did it with a potato.
   He threw the potato into a pot of molten glass, creating air
bubbles. But when glassblower Ruben Hjelm began to shape a piece at
the end of his five-foot-long iron pipe, he became enraged.
   The crystal had bubbles in it and wasn't clear as good crystal
should be, Hjelm told Hoglund, and stormed out.
   The story goes that it took a bottle of shnapps to get Hjelm
back, and thus was created a style of crystal bowl and vase _ with
bubbles frozen into the thick glass _ that has distinguished Sweden
in the art of glassmaking.
   The story of the potato and the air bubbles has entered local
folklore in Smaland, a southern province in Sweden known as the
Crystal Kingdom.
   Here, glassblowing is a matter of pride, tradition and economic
survival.
   Smaland, which is too hilly, rocky and forested for farming, has
lived from glassmaking for 100 years. The industry has suffered
some hard times, but the marriage of artistry, craftsmanship and
export marketing has helped bring a revival.
   Glassmaking employs some 2,500 of Smaland's 700,000 people, and
earned $180 million in export income during the first 10 months of
1987.
   Tableware from the Orrefors and Kosta Boda companies appear in
homes from Tokyo to Topeka and can sell for as much as $80 per
glass. One vase made by Orrefors in 1939 fetched $93,000 at an
auction this past November.
   Glassblowing is a craft that generally takes 10 years to master.
It's a tricky art to breath a bubble of air into molten glass to
give the edge just the right thickness, twirl the fiery mass on the
end of the pipe, shape it, cool it and cut it.
   It's an art still passed on from father to son in Smaland. But
some aspects of the industry are changing as big companies and
high-powered managers take over.
   ``When I first started working here in 1959 this was a
family-owned company,'' said Gunnar Cyren, one of eight designers
for Orrefors.
   ``All the youth in the village gathered in the blowing hall to
keep warm by the ovens. The door was always open. Today there is a
fence around the factory.''
   Half a million tourists a year come to the village of Orrefors,
which has a population of 1,000, to see the glassworks.
   Smaland once had as many as 60 glass factories with 4,000
workers. Many companies closed during Sweden's economic crisis of
the 1970s, and now only 20 remain.
   Orrefors, which began as an ironworks in 1726 and turned to
glassmaking later, was bought in 1971 by Incentive, one of Sweden's
largest holding companies. Kosta Boda was acquired by
Uppsala-Ekeby, another multi-company group.
   Anxious to keep employment high, Sweden's Social Democratic
government subsidized the industries and pressured the larger
companies to buy up the smaller factories to keep them open.
   ``They were afraid that the villages would die if the plants
closed,'' Orrefors' president, Goran Bernhoff, said in an interview.
   A 1982 devaluation of the Swedish krona, together with the
big-scale management and marketing of the new owners, turned around
the industry.
   Now the numbers are climbing again. About 40 young artists have
opened studios to sell to tourists and other small markets, says
Gunnel Holmer, curator of the Smaland Museum here in Vaxjo, the
regional capital.
   The threat to the handblown glass industry today comes from new
technologies, said Mrs. Holmer.
   ``If we make good tableware here, others soon copy it with
machines and sell it much cheaper. But the unique pieces, the `art
glass,' that's something else,'' she said.
   Glassmaking is a symbiosis between the artist and the artisan.
   ``You don't do any of the craftwork yourself,'' says designer
Erika Lagerbielke.
   ``You make a sketch and try to explain to the glassblower what
is to be done. When you work well with someone, one plus one
sometimes adds up to three or four. Sometimes you both end up
surprised.''
   That was the way it was 30 years ago with Erik Hoglund, Ruben
Hjelm and the hot potato.

   Industrial production edged up 0.2 percent in
January despite big declines in auto production and steel,

   The Federal Reserve Board said Wednesday that the January
increase was just half the 0.4 percent gain recorded in both
November and December.
   Private analysts said this slower growth was consistent with
their forecast of a significant slowdown as businesses work off a

   They call themselves ``The Steeple
People,'' and their creations can be found reaching for the sky
from Alaska to Saudi Arabia.
   Jerry Bennett has been one of them since his college days when
he took a part-time job to help pay for his education. Today, at
48, he is president and co-owner.
   ``There aren't many things we can't do when it comes to
steeples,'' said Bennett. ``We also specialize in cupolas, crosses,
towers, or anything else needed to decorate a church or a
building.''
   Campbellsville Industries' products are shipped everywhere and
may range from six feet to 229-feet, which is the size of what
Bennett calls the world's largest prefabricated steeple.
   ``We're trying to get it included in the Guinness Book of
Records,'' Bennett said, adding that the $350,000 project was built
for the First Baptist Church of Huntsville, Ala.
   Other installations include the Baptist Pavilion at the 1982
World's Fair in Knoxville; the Solidarity Tower replica in Chicago;
and reproduction of the West Bridgewater, Mass., steeple, which was
originally constructed during Paul Revere's time.
   ``The order from Saudi Arabia called for a cupola for a
waterworks system.''
   Bennett's plant, located 80 miles from Louisville, has 85
employees, including six draftsmen who will furnish a design if the
customer doesn't know in advance what he wants.
   The company mails out more than one million pieces of
advertising annually, but Bennett said he also gets sales from the
interstates.
   ``Somebody will see our trucks, loaded with steeples or cupolas,
and then telephone us to ask, `How do I get one of those things?' ''
   His crews do a lot of driving. Several years ago, they made four
1,200 mile trips to New Haven, Conn., to erect a spire on a Roman
Catholic landmark there.
   Bennett became involved with steeples after Campbellsville
College set up a small industry complex on campus to help students
with their finances.
   ``I was among those who were able to work with wood or metal,
turning out items that could be marketed for a nominal profit.''
   Later, Bennett taught art in high school but returned to the
college as a full-time employee handling designs and sales for the
complex.
   In 1969, Campbellsville College sold the business to a private
individual who kept it 10 years before he was bought out by Bennett
and three other employees.
   Although the company is diversified, steeples still account for
60 to 70 percent of sales. They also have caused a few embarrassing
moments.
   Bennett recalled the time that a contractor in Virginia
purchased a steeple and gave ``our deliveryman vague instructions
about reaching the church where it was to be installed.''
   The spire went to another church and the contractor showed up
the next morning to retrieve it.
   Before he could say anything, the excited minister told him:
   ``We have been praying for new pews and an anonymous donor
provided them.
   ``We prayed for new carpet and got it anonymously.
   ``The last item we wanted was a new steeple. Last night, the
Lord put it in our front yard.''
   The contractor explained the mixup and admitted later to Bennett
that ``it was the hardest thing I've ever done.''

   Oil prices remain mostly lower amid sluggish
demand and adequate supplies.
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for March
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
closed Wednesday at $16.61 per 41-gallon barrel, down 6 cents from
Tuesday.
   Among refined products, wholesale contracts for unleaded
gasoline closed at 46.66 cents a gallon, up 0.37 cent, while
wholesale heating oil was down 0.79 cent at 45.58 cents a gallon.
   A trade report published late Tuesday stimulated an early rally,
because the numbers showed sharp drawdowns of gasoline and heating
oil supplies, as well as a cutback of refinery use in the week
ended Friday, analysts said.
   They said the figures _ released by the Washington-based
American Petroleum Institute _ led many traders to believe that
prices would increase, as existing demand chased tigher supplies.
   But the gains turned into losses, ``once people realized that
the stocks were moving from primary storage into secondary storage
in anticipation of the tugboat strike in New York harbor,'' said
Donald Morton, an analyst at the Boston office of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``The market closed at its low in fairly light volume,'' he
added.
   Morton said dealers were having the products shipped from New
York to Boston and other markets to ensure continued access.
   A union representing 2,500 tugboat and barge crew members went
on strike against nine towing companies on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Union: Northwest Flight Attendants Will Strike if No Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines' 6,500 flight
attendants will vote to strike on Feb. 26 if they haven't reached
agreement on a new contract, Teamsters union officials say.
   About 300 flight attendants with the Eagan, Minn.-based airline
began the strike authorization vote Tuesday during a union meeting
in Bloomington. Results of the voting, which will continue through
Saturday in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., and five other U.S.
cities, are expected to be announced at a strike rally Monday
night, Teamsters Local 2747 officials said Wednesday.
   Strike authorization requires a two-thirds majority of the
membership.
   In the last strike against Northwest, the machinists union
walked out for 27 days in May 1982.
   The two sides have not negotiated since the National Mediation
Board released them from mandatory negotiations last month because
they were deadlocked over wages, fringe benefits and work rules. A
30-day cooling-off period ends Feb. 26.
   A federal mediator is expected to bring the two sides together
again next week, although no date has been set.
   Northwest officials said they are determined to keep flying if a
strike occurs. About 2,000 Northwest managers are qualified to be
flight attendants and would be used during a strike, said Northwest
spokesman Redmond Tyler. Northwest also has advertised to recruit
replacement flight attendants over the past few weeks.
   But some travel agents are beginning to warn prospective
Northwest passengers of a possible strike.
   ``People are starting to ask about it, '' said Kevin Mossier,
president of the Travel Co., a Minneapolis-St. Paul travel agency.
   Northwest, which merged with Republic Airlines in 1986, controls
about 60 percent of the Minneapolis-St. Paul passenger traffic. In
the event of a strike, United Airlines, the No. 2 carrier in the
Twin Cities, would bring in larger planes for Twin Cities flights,
according to United spokesman Matt Gonring in Chicago.
   On Tuesday, a federal judge in New York City ordered the
Teamsters local to reinstate Northwest flight attendants Guy Meek
and John Davis as members of the union's negotiating committee.
Meek and Davis formerly worked for Republic.
   The Teamsters must allow the two men to participate in
negotiations and vote on whether to send any contract offers to the
flight attendants for ratification, U.S. District Judge Joseph
McLaughlin ruled.
   Teamsters officials had ejected the two men from the bargaining
committee last fall, alleging that they tried to persuade 2,800
former Republic attendants not to pay union dues.
   Former Republic attendants said the Teamsters have urged them to
pay union dues voluntarily.
   It was not clear from the judge's order whether the Teamsters
can force the members to pay dues, but Teamsters spokesman Jeff
Musto said all flight attendants would be allowed to vote on the
strike authorization whether or not they were current on dues.
   On another front Tuesday, a federal judge in Minneapolis said
Northwest and its machinists union will have to arbitrate a
1{-year-old dispute over restoration of wage cuts granted by about
1,200 former Republic Airlines employees.
   U.S. District Judge David Doty dismissed a lawsuit brought by
District Lodge 143 of the International Association of Machinists
in November 1986 and refused to order Northwest to pay the higher
wages.
   The dispute, which involves mechanics, stock clerks, plane
cleaners, custodians and clerical workers who granted wage
concessions to Republic, should be resolved by an arbitrator, not a
federal judge, Doty ruled.

<HEAD>Black & Decker Rebuffed Again In American Standard Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black & Decker Corp. has been rebuffed again
in its attempt to make personal contact with the top management of
American Standard Inc., which is the target of a takeover bid by
Black & Decker.
   In a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the power tool and home appliance maker said Chairman
Nolan B. Archibald attempted to telephone American Standard
Chairman William B. Boyd on Feb. 11.
   ``Unfortunately, as has been the case throughout, Mr. Boyd
wouldn't take the call,'' said Black & Decker spokeswoman Barbara
Lucas.
   Archibald wanted to reconfirm his company's ``strong desire to
arrange a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Boyd to negotiate a business
combination between Black & Decker and the company, and to advise
Mr. Boyd that he was willing to make major concessions in order to
consummate a friendly transaction, including a preemptive price,
board seats and financial arrangements for employees of the
company,'' Ms. Lucas said.
   ``The message was no different from the one we've been leaving
all along,'' she said.
   ``We think the price of $65 (a share) was a preemptive price,''
she said. The Towson, Md.-based manufacturer will consider raising
that price, ``only on the basis of information that we haven't seen
yet.''
   However, the SEC filing should not be taken as a sign that Black
& Decker is willing to raise the price, she stressed.
   American Standard has urged its shareholders to reject Black &
Decker's $2.1 billion hostile takeover. The New York-based maker of
plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment has also adopted a
``poison pill'' defense that allows its shareholders to buy back
shares of the surviving company at half their market value.
   American Standard also has said it is considering alternatives
to the bid, including a restructuring, leveraged buyout or a
friendly merger with another company.
   Black & Decker, which originally bid $56 a share for American
Standard stock, said last week it had obtained bank financing for
the deal.

   The president of the Association of
Flight Attendants urged the Federal Aviation Administration to
tighten its regulation of the airline industry.
   ``Passengers' first priority should be to insist that the FAA
promote safety over profit, rebuild the inspector workforce and
place tighter controls on the number of flights until the air
traffic controller workforce is rebuilt,'' Susan Bianchi-Sand said

   Ms. Bianchi-Sand proposed reforms that she said were inexpensive
ways to improve cabin safety.
   ``All that is needed is a will to make flying truly safe,'' the
union president said. ``We have learned from emergency after
emergency that changes are needed.''
   Ms. Bianchi-Sand said the FAA should update its standards to
require passenger seats that do not break loose in a crash, require
life vests on more planes, and limit the hours that flight
attendants can work.
   Ms. Bianchi-Sand said the FAA also should resist industry
pressure to repeal a ruling that would require improved cabin
materials and reduce the threat of toxic smoke.
   ``Where costs are involved, the industry is almost shameless,''
she said.

<HEAD>Campeau Increases Pressure On Federated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. has intensified the pressure on
Federated Department Stores Inc. by boosting its tender offer for
the giant retailer to $61 a share.
   Federated, meanwhile, continued to look into ways of avoiding a
hostile takeover.
   Campeau's amended offer came Wednesday a day after the Federated
board of directors rejected the Toronto developer's previous
proposal to pay $66 a share in a definitive merger agreement. The
board had questioned whether Campeau had the necessary financial
backing to complete the $5.85 billion deal.
   Campeau said it would further sweeten its bid to $66 if
Federated agreed to be acquired by midnight Sunday. The company was
only willing to pay $66 a share if Federated management agreed to
go along voluntarily. Campeau is offering a lower price if
Federated management resists.
   Instead of accepting the tender offer, the Federated directors
decided on a restructuring that could include retaining Federated's
department stores and selling its other assets, the company said.
   The latest rebuff by Federated's directors did not deter
Campeau, which said Wednesday it has the necessary financing to buy
Federated.
   Campeau's latest tender offer of $61 a share amounts to about
$5.4 billion, a sharp increase from the $47 a share, or roughly
$4.2 billion, it initially offered on Jan. 25. Federated rejected
the original tender offer as inadequate.
   Federated stock fell $2 to $61.75 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Wednesday.
   Federated also twice rejected Campeau's alternative offer for a
definitive merger agreement, including offers of $61 and $66 per
share, because it questioned Campeau's ability to complete such a
deal.
   However, Campeau spokeswoman Joele Frank said in New York
Wednesday that ``financing for a $66 bid is absolutely solid.''
   Federated managers are looking into other options, such as
selling to other unspecified interested parties, issuing perferred
stock and buying back more than half of Federated's 88.5 million
shares.
   Analysts said it was unclear how Federated might proceed if it
chooses to sell its non-department store assets.
   ``A lot depends on whether they sell them to someone outright or
spin them off'' through a public stock offering, said Thomas
Tashjian, an analyst with the Los Angeles investment firm of
Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.
   Federated operates about 650 stores in 36 states and had sales
exceeding $11 billion last year. Its holdings include
Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Straus, both based in New York;
Filene's of Boston; Burdines of Miami; Rich's in Atlanta; Bullock's
and Bullock's-Wilshire in Los Angeles; I. Magnin in San Francisco;
and Lazarus in Ohio.
   The company could be considering selling chains such as its
Ralphs grocery stores, Main Street soft-goods stores, Gold Circle
discount stores and Children's Place clothing stores, industry
observers said.
   Federated's directors said a shareholders' rights plan adopted
by the board last month would take effect Thursday. The plan, known
as a ``poison pill'' defense, is designed to discourage an unwanted
takeover by making such a move more expensive.
   Federated spent last weekend negotiating with numerous parties,
including Campeau, which bought Allied Stores Corp. in December
1986. Among those believed to be interested is the takeover
specialist firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co., based in New York.
   Campeau's upgraded tender offer Wednesday includes a provision
that recently enacted anti-takeover legislation would have to be
invalidated. Campeau is challenging anti-takeover measures in
Delaware and Ohio.
   Cincinnati-based Federated could be covered by both
anti-takeover measures because it is based in Ohio and is
incorporated in Delaware.

<HEAD>Texaco Reportedly Plans to Sell U.S. Refining Operations to Saudi
Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. plans to sell a stake of about 50
percent in its extensive U.S. gulf coast refining operations to
Saudi Arabia for more than $1 billion, according to the
International Herald Tribune.
   A final agreement between Petromin, the Saudi Arabian oil
holding arm, and Texaco is expected to be reached within a month,
the Herald Tribune reported Thursday, quoting an unidentified
Texaco executive and unidentified Arab oil executives attending an
annual conference of the Institute of Petroleum in London.
   In White Plains, N.Y., a spokesman at Texaco's headquarters
refused to confirm or deny the accuracy of the report.
   ``On Jan. 8, Texaco announced as part of its restructuring plan
that it would aggressively move foward to get partners in joint
ventures based on its downstream operations,'' said K. Peter
Maneri. ``At this stage, it would be inappropriate to issue public
statement regarding those discussions.''
   Saudi Arabia has been considering taking a large stake in the
refining and marketing arms of one of the U.S. major oil companies
which were once shareholders in the Arabian American Oil Co., or
Aramco, oil industry officials said.
   Those companies are Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp., and
Texaco.
   Over the past few months, all four companies have been given
preferential access to Saudi Arabia's crude oil at market-related
prices, which are below officials prices, while most other
companies have had to pay official prices for the oil.
   Texaco has been the largest single buyer of Saudi crude oil for
the past year, oil industry sources said.
   Texaco announced its restructuring program as part of its plan
for emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   The nation's third-largest oil company hopes to complete that
move in April, one year after it filed for protection from its
creditors to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous bond while
appealing a $10.3 billion judgement held against the company by
Pennzoil Co.
   A Houston jury awarded the judgement to Pennzoil after ruling
that Texaco had improperly interfere with a Pennzoil plan to
acquire part of Getty Oil Co. and acquired Getty itself.
   As part of its proposed reorganization plan, Texaco agreed to
settle the case by paying Pennzoil $3 billion in cash.

<HEAD>SEC Chief: Japan Making Good Progress on Stock Market Safeguards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has made satisfactory moves to regulate its
stock and futures markets to curb insider trading, the chairman of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday.
   ``I think the Japanese are moving at a good pace toward insider
trading restrictions,'' said David S. Ruder, who arrived here this
week at the invitation of Japanese officials for talks on improving
cooperation to guard against insider trading and cope with market
volatility.
   ``I have had a great sense of a desire for cooperation between
the American and the Japanese stock markets, futures markets and
regulators,'' he said.
   The SEC, which regulates the U.S. securities industry, and
Japan's Finance Ministry issued a joint statement Wednesday saying
both sides had agreed to strengthen measures against insider
trading and improve communication between exchanges in both
countries.
   The statement came a day after the Finance Ministry recommended
in a report stronger measures against insider trading on par with
those in the United States. The report said Japan's Securities and
Exchange Law should be tightened to specifically prohibit insider
trading and recommended that criminal penalties replace current
civil penalties for such abuses.
   Ruder said the proposal ``seemed to cover the elements of
insider trading as we know it in the corporate environment in the
United States.''
   Wednesday's joint statement vowed to encourage discussions
between self-regulatory organizations in both countries to detect
fraudulent activity and develop ``procedures for the exchange of
financial, surveillance and investigatory information among those
organizations.''
   Restrictions on insider trading, Ruder said, must be approached
carefully because of a conflict between preventing inside corporate
information from leaking to the public and a desire to encourage
public disclosure of certain information.
   The infrequency of corporate takeovers in Japan helps prevent
large-scale insider trading, he said. Knowledge of a planned
takeover before its public disclosure is a key reason for insider
trading, as it creates an opportunity to buy stocks of a target
company and often sell them at a higher price later.
   But financial sources have said information is often leaked to
investors in the Japanese market.
   Japan's big four securities firms _ Nomura, Nikko, Daiwa and
Yamaichi _ can handle as much as 80 percent of daily stock trading
volume, creating an environment for market manipulation, financial
sources say.
   Until October's worldwide stock market crash led the Tokyo Stock
Exchange to impose rules on reporting transactions, Japanese
executives were not required to report transfers of their
shareholdings.
   The SEC and Finance Ministry recognized a growing
``interlinkage'' between markets in both countries and agreed that
planned expansion of futures trading in Japan will intensify their
interdependence, Ruder said.
   He also said communication between the U.S. and Japanese markets
would be improved after the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading
Commission is put in direct contact with the Finance Ministry's
Securities Bureau.
   In talks this week, the ministry and the SEC agreed to create
safeguards to counter ``market emergencies,'' their joint statement
said.
   ``Market volatility, as experienced in October 1987, becomes
even more a global concern,'' Ruder said, and praised the caution
exercised by Japanese institutional investors in times of crisis.
   Stock prices in New York fell about 23 percent on Black Monday,
but the Nikkei Stock Average, the Tokyo market's key indicator,
followed with a fall of less than 15 percent partly because
Japanese institutional investors were reluctant to flee the market,
Ruder said.
   ``I think I will go back to give the message to institutional
investors that they should be more cautious in their reactions,
like Japanese investors,'' he said.

Surface</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: grafs 1-4 new to UPDATE with Reagan sending budget to
Congress; picks up 2nd graf pvs: The Commerce ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan sent Congress a $1.09 trillion conciliatory,
election-year budget today that combines his most restrained
military request ever with proposals for more spending on
education, science and the fight against AIDS.
   Reagan's 1989 budget, the last budget of his presidency, calls
for reducing the federal deficit from $150.2 billion last year and
the $146.7 billion estimated for 1988 to $129.5 billion in the
fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1.
   That is below the target of $136 billion called for in the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   The new budget also contends that the ``economy has shown few
signs of serious damage'' from last October's stock market plunge,
and that the recent boom in exports holds out the promise of
continued economic expansion.
   But signs of economic weakness were evident in the government's
reports that housing construction fell in January while industrial
production rose at a slower rate than in each of the previous two
months, some analysts say.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that housing construction
fell 1.9 percent to its slowest pace since the end of the last
recession five years ago.
   Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said industrial production
rose 0.2 percent in January after 0.4 percent gains in November and
December.
   The report on construction of single-family homes and apartments
raised new concerns among some economists about the possibility of
a recession this year.
   The January decline in housing construction followed a 15.5
percent December tumble and pushed building activity down to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units, the slowest
pace since a rate of 1.3 million units in December 1982, just as
the last recession was ending.
   Housing is being watched very closely in the aftermath of the
stock market crash last October because it is often one of the
first sectors to weaken at the onset of a new recession.
   The weakness last month came from a 2.9 percent decline in
construction of single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate
of 1.01 million units.
   This drop offset a 0.8 percent increase in construction of
multi-family housing, which edged up to an annual rate of 366,000
units.
   Building permits, considered a good sign of future activity,
fell 8.2 percent in January to an annual rate of 1.25 million
units, the lowest level for permits since January 1985. Permits had
fallen 7.4 percent in December.
   In a separate report, a private forecasting firm estimated that
construction contracts will drop 4 percent this year, led by steep
declines in office and other commercial building and lesser drops
in housing and public works projects.
   Builders will commit to $246.2 billion worth of new contracts in
all of 1988 compared with $255.2 billion last year, according to an
update of the 1988 Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook from
McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co.
   Private analysts said the slower growth in industrial production
may indicate the economy will slow in the early part of 1988 as
businesses work off a backlog of unsold inventories built up during
the final three months of 1987.
   The Federal Reserve traced the output rise in January to
production of non-durable goods, which rose 0.4 percent. Production
of durable goods, items expected to last three years, showed no
increase last month.

   In a budget that calls for few tax changes,
President Reagan today recommended a tax break to help parents save
to pay for a college education for their children.
   The president, in submitting his 1989 budget to Congress, said
he will ask lawmakers to make tax-exempt the interest on savings
bonds that are redeemed to finance post-secondary education. This
would cost the government an estimated $10 million during the 12
months beginning next Oct. 1.
   The tax benefit would be targeted for lower- and middle-income
families and would be eliminated as earnings exceed a certain level.
   ``The costs of post-secondary education have increased
substantially in recent years, often faster than inflation,''
Reagan said in his written message to Congress. ``As a result,
parents may have difficulty bearing these costs unless they
establish a savings program for this purpose when their children
are young.''
   The biggest new revenue-raiser recommended by the president
would require all state and local government employees to pay the
Medicare hospital-insurance tax. The tax, which most Americans
already pay, is 1.45 percent of the first $45,000 earned. The levy
is collected as part of the Social Security tax.
   The tax already is collected from state and local workers hired
after March 31, 1986. Reagan said workers hired before that date
also should be required to pay in order to reduce a drain on the
Medicare system.
   The change, which Congress has rejected several times, would
bring in $1.6 billion in 1989.
   Repeal of the ``windfall-profit'' tax on the oil industry, which
Congress also has rejected, is included in the president's budget.
Reagan says the tax, which was imposed when oil prices were rising,
is an unnecessary paperwork burden on the industry at a time of
declining prices.
   The oil industry would get a $52-million tax break under the
budget if Congress goes along with a proposed modification of rules
affecting the depletion allowance.
   Other revenue proposals:
   _A permanent tax break for owners of shares in mutual funds, who
would be affected by a 1986 tax change that limits miscellaneous
itemized deductions to those that exceed 2 percent of adjusted
gross income. Congress voted an exception to mutual-fund deductions
for 1987 only.
   _Permit U.S. companies to allocate at least two-thirds of their
total research and development expenditures to domestic operations.
This would save them about $600 million in 1989.
   _Make permanent a temporary tax credit for research and
experimentation, saving U.S. companies $400 million next year.
   _Repeal a provision imposed by Congress that reduces air-ticket
taxes and aviation-fuel levies when federal spending for airport
and airways imporovements drops below a certain level.
   _Increase user fees incurred in federal regulation of nuclear
power plants.
   _Change the method of calculating a special fee on imported
products, costing the government about $100 million next year. The
modification of the 0.17-percent fee is necessary to bring the
United States into compliance with international trade agreements.

   A major Wall Street debt analyzer has lowered
its credit ratings for eight of the nation's biggest banking
institutions because of a decline in its valuation of their foreign
loans.
   The action Wednesday by Moody's Investors Service comes 15 days
after another credit ratings service, Standard & Poor's Corp.,
lowered its estimate of the creditworthiness of five big banking
companies.
   Among the banking concerns downgraded by Moody's was J.P. Morgan
& Co., which lost its top rating. At the same time, Moody's
affirmed its top rating for Morgan's banking unit, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co.
   In a statement, the company said it was disappointed that the
rating of the holding company ``does not appear to recognize fully
our exceptional capital position and our capacity to repay all debt
without reliance on any dividends from Morgan Guaranty.''
   Moody's also said it had confirmed its ratings for three banking
companies and was continuing to review its rating on debt from a
12th banking concern, European American Bank Corp.
   The ratings help determine interest rate levels for companies
borrowing money in the credit markets and apply to securities of
various maturities. A lower rating often means a company may have
to pay more interest to sell debt.
   The downgradings affected about $48 billion in outstanding debt,
while the confirmations applied to about $34.6 billion in debt,
Moody's said.
   Roger Arner, senior analyst at Moody's, said the action followed
a review begun last December of loans that a dozen major banking
companies and their subsidiaries had outstanding to Third World
countries.
   Moody's had previously indicated that some Third World
countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, were becoming
economically less capable and politically less willing to continue
servicing their debt as agreed.
   Arner said Moody's review indicated that some banking
institutions continued to carry some Third World loans on their
books at a higher value than the ratings concern felt was warranted.
   ``We think their assets are worth less. We think banks will
continue to need to build their capital and that our ratings are
reflective of our assesment of their ability to do that,'' he said.
   The ratings cuts generally ranged from one to three steps on the
agency's 10-step system for investment quality ratings, depending
on Moody's assessment of the varying earnings potential, capital
and assets of each of the concerns.
   The eight downgrades included J.P. Morgan & Co.; Bankers Trust
Co.; Citibank N.A.; Chase Manhattan Corp.; Chemical New York Corp.;
Manufacturers Hanover Corp.; BankAmerica Corp.; and Irving Trust Co.
   The three ratings confirmations were for First Chicago Corp.,
Continental Illinois Corp. and Bank of Nova Scotia.
   Moody's took different approaches in some cases on its ratings
of debt issued by a bank holding company and that by its subsidiary
bank.
   While lowering the rating for Citibank, for instance, Moody's
confirmed its rating for the parent company, Citicorp. Citibank is
the nation's biggest bank and Citicorp is the nation's biggest bank
holding company.
   On Feb. 2, Standard & Poor's said it was lowering its rating on
debt from Chase Manhattan Corp., BankAmerica Corp., Chemical New
York Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and First Chicago Corp.,
citing Third World loans.
   At the same time, it affirmed its ratings for Citicorp, Bankers
Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co.
   Many major banking companies reported losses or sharply
diminished earnings in 1987 as they boosted their loan-loss
reserves, which provide a cushion for future earnings against loans
that may be written off or sold at a loss.
   But Arner said Moody's viewed some of those actions as
``accounting transfers'' that the agency felt ``have not added any
real strength to the balance sheet.''

   The Reagan administration today issued an
economic forecast any Republican presidential candidate could run
on with pride, predicting a record sixth year of peacetime economic
growth with no increase in inflation.
   The administration, which in the past has been derided for its
``rosy scenarios'' of future economic activity, presented an
optimistic view that the current expansion will continue into the
indefinite future. And it derided initial recession fears from the
October stock market crash as ``greatly exaggerated.''
   ``Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices, however, the real
economy has shown few signs of serious damage,'' the budget
forecast stated.
   While the economic assumptions that underpin the president's
1989 budget are more optimistic than the predictions made by the
Congressional Budget Office and most private forecasters, they are
not as far from the general consensus as in previous years.
   Indeed, the administration boasts that its economic forecast a
year ago, which was also above the general consensus, turned out to
be closer to right.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew 3.8
percent in 1987, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986. The
administration had predicted 3.2 percent growth.
   ``Most forecasters failed to anticipate the magnitude of the
improvement in the manufacturing sector just then getting under
way,'' the budget stated.
   For 1988, the administration predicts manufacturing will remain
a source of strength with export sales continuing to rise because
of the weaker dollar.
   The administration predicts the overall economy will expand at a
2.4 percent annual rate this year with much of that growth coming
from the improving trade deficit.
   This compares to a CB0 growth forecast of 1.8 percent. The CBO
forecast is the same as the consensus view of 51 top economists
surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an investment newsletter.
   Among the economic assumptions, the administration predicts:
   _GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay
above 3 percent through 1993.
   _Consumer inflation, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise
by 4.3 percent this year and decline steadily over the next four
years to a 2 percent rate in 1993.
   _Unemployment, because of the modest growth, will show no
improvement this year, remaining at 5.8 percent at the close of the
year, matching the current level. However, the jobless rate will
begin declining modestly in future years, dropping to 5.5 percent
in 1989.
   These assumptions provide the basis for the administration's
hopes of making further progress in getting the federal budget
under control.
   The 1989 spending plan, Reagan's eighth submission to Congress,
has a valedictory quality about it, reviewing in detail the
president's economic goals when he took office in 1981 and trying
to explain the reasons for Reagan's biggest economic failure, the
string of record budget deficits.
   The administration, as it has in the past, put much of the blame
on Congress for failing to enact its domestic spending cuts. But
the budget also says the 1981-82 deficit played a large role,
adding $112 billion to the deficit in 1983 alone.
   The new budget calls for reducing the federal deficit to $129.5
billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, down from an
actual budget deficit of $150.2 billion in the 1987 fiscal year and
an estimated deficit of $146.7 billion for the current fiscal year.
   The 1987 deficit was originally put at $148 billion but was
revised in today's budget document.
   The 1989 budget estimate is below the target of $136 billion
called for in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, but the
administration concedes that its estimates in the past have fallen
victim to worse-than-expected economic performance.
   Those pitfalls could derail the current plan as well, the
administration says, noting that if GNP growth is just 1 percent
lower than the administration is forecasting over the next five
years it would add $6.3 billion to the 1989 deficit and $66 billion
to the 1993 deficit.
   A minority of economists is predicting an even worse outcome for
this year, forecasting the economy will fall into an actual
recession.
   If growth is slower than the administration forecasts, or in a
worst-case scenario, the country does enter a recession, then that
would mean smaller federal tax revenues and higher spending for
such programs as unemployment benefits.
   The current economic recovery began in December 1982, following
the worst recession since the Great Depression, and is now in its
63rd month, surpassing the old record for a peacetime recovery of
59 months set between 1975 and 1979.

   The stock market declined slightly today in
sluggish trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.98 to 1,999.01
in the first half hour.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 466 up, 552 down and
497 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street.
   Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt
traders to take big positions either way.
   The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors'
worst fears about the business outlook eased.
   But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits
remain subdued, and many market participants are evidently
reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000
level.
   Speculation has also died down lately that the Federal Reserve
will take any new steps in the immediate future to relax its credit
policy.
   Hewlett-Packard was a standout gainer among the blue-chip and
technology issues, rising 1{ to 59. The company reported earnings
for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 of 71 cents a share, up from
45 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .02 to 145.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .10 at 278.99.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.98 to
2,000.99.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
743 up, 761 down and 472 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 176.83
million shares, against 135.38 million in the previous session.

   Early returns in voting today by 32,000 striking
empoyees from Ford Motor Co.'s British plants indicated strong
approval of a new two-year contract, the company said.
   ``We are greatly encouraged by the voting figures coming in,''
said a Ford spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There
have been some big swings in favor of accepting the offer, compared
to voting on the last offer, which was turned down.''
   The final results were to be released on Friday, but the
spokesman said hourly workers from at least eight of Ford's 22
British plants voted to accept the contract.
   The strike, which began Feb. 8, prompted the layoff of more than
9,700 workers. It disrupted production at a Ford plant at Genk,
Belgium, and threatened production at Ford plants in Spain and West
Germany, which rely on parts made at the British plants.
   The settlement was worked out in negotiations Tuesday between
company and union officials. If accepted, operations at Ford's
British plants could resume Monday.
   Shop stewards representing 8,000 Ford workers at the
traditionally militant Halewood plant near Liverpool in northwest
England on Wednesday recommended rejection of the offer.
   Peter Moore, a local union official at Halewood, said: ``We feel
there should be more money on offer, but we are also concerned that
plants on the Continent are getting improvements in hours and
holidays and we won't be getting that for another two years.''
   Shop stewards at a Ford engine-manufacturing plant in Bridgend,
Wales, recommended acceptance, saying they believed the company had
made significant concessions. That plant employs 1,300 hourly
workers.
   The Financial Times, Britain's leading business daily, said in
today's editions that the strikers seemed set to accept the deal,
although possibly by a narrow margin. The British Broadcasting
Corp. said the deal appeared likely to gain at least 60 percent
support.
   Ford backed down on its demand for a three-year contract,
offering instead a two-year pact with wage increases of at least 14
percent over the term of the contract. A Ford assembly worker in
Britain now earns a basic $320 a week.
   The unions agreed to changes in working practices designed to
increase productivity, but the changes must be agreed upon at the
plant level instead of being imposed by management.
   Legislator Barry Porter of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
governing Conservative Party on Wednesday condemned the proposed
settlement.
   ``It is quite clear that other industrial unions will take this
climbdown by the management as their bench mark for their claims in
the future. This has national implications in relation to the
government's fight against inflation,'' he said.
   Britain's annual inflation rate is now 3.3 percent. This is the
lowest it has been since October 1986.
   The government introduced tough measure to curb the once
powerful unions and the last major industrial strike in Britain was
a yearlong walkout by more than 90,000 coal miners in 1984-1985.
   But the Ford strike, a walkout by English Channel ferry crews,
and unrest in the state-run National Health Service and elsewhere
prompted fears in some quarters that they could herald a new wave
of industrial strife and an explosion in pay demands.
   Ford's British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978.

   The stock market showed a small loss in quiet
trading today, continuing the sluggish pattern of Wednesday's
session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.16 to 1,999.83
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 638 up, 670 down and 485
unchanged.
   Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt
traders to take big positions either way.
   The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors'
worst fears about the business outlook eased.
   But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits
remain subdued, and many market participants are evidently
reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000
level.
   Speculation has also died down lately that the Federal Reserve
will take any new steps in the immediate future to relax its credit
policy.
   Hewlett-Packard was a standout gainer among the blue-chip and

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices fell on profit-taking from Wednesday's sharp
gains and in reaction to an increase in farmer selling of soybeans,
analysts said.
   Soybean futures advanced as much as 13} cents a bushel
Wednesday, partly in reaction to a Paul Harvey radio commentary
about a ``sudden-death syndrome'' affecting soybean crops. The
story turned out to be based on research findings that were first
reported nearly two years ago.
   Speculative buying limited the losses in soybeans this morning,
said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for the
investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``The market's not breaking as much as it could have, so there's
some underlying strength,'' Loewy said.
   Corn prices also retreated on increased farmer sales, while
wheat prices declined in follow-through selling from Wednesday,
analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.26\ a bushel; corn was } cent
to 2\ cents lower with March at $2.00\ a bushel; oats were } cent

2{ cents to 3{ cents lower with March at $6.30 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed to lower in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .08 cent higher with February
at 71.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent
lower with March at 83.42 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .42
cent lower with February at 46.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .28 cent to .48 cent higher with February at 56.00

<HEAD>Lomas & Nettleton To Lay Off 500 Workers Nationwide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lomas & Nettleton Financial Corp., citing a
downturn in the nation's housing market, says it plans to shut down
half its mortgage banking operations and cut about 20 percent of
its workforce.
   The Dallas company, which is the nation's largest independent
mortgage banker, said it would take a $93 million charge in the
current quarter as a result of its restructuring plans.
   Lomas said it expects to lose about $69 million for the three
fiscal quarters ended March 31 and about $55 million for the year.
   Lomas President James Wooten said Wednesday that the company
planned to close offices in more than 30 of the 65 cities in which
its mortgage branch operates, and lay off 500 of its 2,650
employees. The company also cut nearly 1,000 employees last year.
   Although final decisions have not been made on which offices to
eliminate, several are expected to be in the Midwest and Southeast,
Wooten said.
   The company also said it plans to divest itself of a small,
virtually inactive home-building company, Braewood Homes of Dallas.
   Lomas' problems stem from a downturn in the housing industry
nationwide, which has slowed new mortgage originations.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, estimates there
will be between $320 billion and $330 billion in mortgages
originated nationwide in 1988, a decline from the $430 billion
originated in 1987.
   At the same time, more homeowners have fallen behind on their
payments, and more of the company's existing loans are delinquent,
Wooten said.
   ``By far the biggest portion of it (the restructuring) is the
result of bankruptcies and foreclosures that have just kept on
keeping on,'' he said. ``Rather than whittle it as you go, you've
got to build a reserve for it and start recovering from it.''
   Kenneth Campbell, an analyst with Audit Investments Inc. of
Montvale, N.J., said Lomas is not alone in its troubles.
   ``Other mortgage bankers are seeing the same thing. They've
either cut back on offices or staffing. The whole industry has been
slammed into reverse,'' he said.

<HEAD>Midland Bank Posts Loss Due To Third World Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midland Bank PLC, one of Britain's big four
commercial banks, said Thursday it suffered a huge loss during
1987, due to the October stock market crash and its decision to
raise its loan-loss provision to cover shaky Third World debt.
   The bank said it lost 456 million pounds, or about $798 million,
last year, compared with a net profit of about $424 million in 1986.
   Midland took a charge of $1.79 billion in the middle of last
year for an increase in its loan-loss provisions. But it said an
extraordinary gain of $110 million, on which it wouldn't elaborate,
helped narrow the 1987 loss.
   Excluding the loan-loss provision charge, Midland said, its
pre-tax profit would have been about $894 million.
   Several major U.S. banks also reported a severe drop in 1987
earnings or losses due to their decision to build up provisions for
loan losses. The banks' goal was to establish a cushion to protect
future earnings from loans that must be writen off or disposed of
at a loss.
   The action was taken after Brazil, the developing world's
biggest debtor, halted interest payments on its international bank
debt a year ago. The banks also cited continuing economic woes in
Third Wrold countries and a series of debt restructurings.
   Midland also said ``losses incurred by (the) institutional
equities business were ... a serious setback, but we believe our
investment banking operations as a whole weathered the financial
storms of 1987, especially the period since October,'' when
worldwide equity markets collapsed.
   Midland said it began a cost-cutting program at the end of last
year.
   In November, the bank announced that Hongkong & Shanghai Banking
Corp. would take a 14.9 percent stake in Midland and that the two
banks would collaborate on a number of activities.
   Last summer, the company sold additional stock.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today sent Congress a $1.09
trillion conciliatory, election-year budget combining his most
restrained military request ever with proposals for more spending
on education, science and the fight against AIDS.
   ``In presenting this budget, I am keeping my end of the bargain.
I call upon Congress to uphold its end,'' Reagan said in the
eighth, and for practical purposes, final budget of his presidency.
   Unlike earlier Reagan budgets, the new document embodies an
agreement on spending priorities already reached with Congress.
   Reagan's 1989 budget calls for reducing the federal deficit from
$150.2 billion last year and the $146.7 billion estimated for 1988
to $129.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1.
   That's even below the target of $136 billion called for in the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. When Reagan took office in 1981
with a promise to balance the budget within three years the annual
deficit stood at $78 billion.
   At a White House photo session with congressional leaders,
Reagan extolled the budget for not increasing taxes while
increasing spending to battle illicit drugs and AIDS.
   With a pile of blue budget documents stacked before him on the
table, Reagan said he hoped the White House and Congress ``can work
together through this budget process this year, sticking to our
agreement and completing the appropriation process before the end
of this fiscal year.''
   Leaving a White House meeting with Reagan, the Democrats who
head the House and Senate budget committees said the budget was
better than past Reagan efforts. Sen. Lawton Chiles, R-Fla., said,
``I think it's a good faith budget. It looks like it meets the
(budget) summit agreements. It's right at the targets.'' But Chiles
said Congress would not agree to sell off so many government assets
as Reagan wants.
   The House budget chairman, Rep. William H. Gray, D-Pa., said,
``There are some better domestic priorities than in the past.
However, there still are some problems areas, such as the
willingness to build more houses in space as opposed to housing
here on Earth.''
   In today's budget message, Reagan conceded the new document
``does not fully reflect my priorities, nor, presumably, those of
any particular member of Congress.''
   But, citing ``give and take on all sides,'' Reagan told
Congress: ``The goal of deficit reduction through spending
reduction must be paramount.''
   The two-year budget pact struck with Congress last November, in
the wake of the stock market collapse, sets limits for both
military increases and social program cuts and restricts new taxes
to the $14 billion already passed for 1989 by Congress.
   Because of this prior agreement, Reagan's fiscal 1989 budget was
expected to generate few fireworks on arrival at Capitol Hill. And
budget leaders played down prospects of a major election-year
budget fracas.
   The new Reagan budget contends that the ``economy has shown few
signs of serious damage'' from last October's stock market plunge,
and that the recent boom in exports holds out the promise of
continued economic expansion.
   In fact, the new Reagan budget assumes a declining rate of
inflation, falling interest rates and economic growth of 2.4
percent this year and 3.5 percent next year. This projection is
more optimistic than forecasts by congressional budget analysts and
private forecasters but closer to their predictions than in
previous years.
   However, if growth is even one percentage point less than
Reagan's forecast, the deficit would rise an additional $6.3
billion in 1989 and $18 billion in 1990, the budget report conceded.
   Reagan's new budget proposed military spending authority of
$299.5 billion in fiscal 1989 and actual outlays for the year of
$294 billion _ up from $291.4 billion in 1988 in budget authority
and $285.4 billion in outlays.
   That increase, which doesn't even keep pace with last year's 4.4
percent increase in inflation, represents the smallest military
spending increase ever sent to Congress by Reagan. It is likely to
result in reductions in some of the military forces and weapons
programs that have grown substantially since he became president.
   ``Anything less would jeopardize not only our security ... but
would also dim the prospects for further negotiated agreements with
our adversaries,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan's budget recycles a number of favorite administration
proposals for reducing government programs.
   These include the abolition of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the Economic Development Administration, Small Business
Administration direct loans, urban development action grants and
public subsidies for Amtrak rail passenger service and mass transit
systems.
   In addition, Reagan again proposed the sale naval petroleum
reserves and some regional power-marketing authorities _ including
the Alaska Power Administration.
   Even though these ``privatization'' efforts have never gained
much support in Congress, Reagan expanded the concept this year by
proposing, for the first time, the sale of waste treatment plants,
mass transit projects and the Rural Telephone Bank. In addition, he
asked for studies of ``possible privatization'' of some Postal
Service operations and the government's uranium enrichment
facilities.
   However, this year, the administration backed away from some of
the more politically controversial proposals of past Reagan budgets
_ including abolition of the Legal Services Corp. and sale of the
Bonneville Power Adminstration.
   At the same time, the president laced his 1989 request with a
number of items certain to be politically palatable _ including
nearly $2 billion in spending authority to combat ``the scourge of
AIDS,'' a 38 percent increase over 1988 levels.
   In addition, Reagan _ who last year caused congressional
consternation by proposing sharp cuts in education spending _
proposed a $1.5 billion increase in education outlays, a rise of 8
percent, well over inflation.
   The new budget also earmarked $1.6 billion in spending authority
to upgrade the nation's air control system and a $430 million
increase for the ``Superfund'' program to clean up hazardous waste
sites.
   Other new proposals for spending authority in Reagan's 1989
budget:
   _ A request for $437 million, more than double last year's
budget, for federal prison constructon to relieve overcrowding.
   _ A 13 percent increase, to $3.9 billion, for drug law
enforcement and treatment programs.
   _ A request for $11.5 billion for space programs, including the
program to orbit a manned space station and to improve the
``performance and reliability'' of the space shuttle.
   _ Spending of $363 million to begin construction of the
Superconducting Super Collider, ``the largest pure science project
ever undertaken.''
   _ Stepped up law enforcement efforts, with a focus on white
collar crime, organized crime and terrorism.
   _ Full funding for a $2.5 billion, five-year program to combat
acid rain.
   Although the budget proposal would come in under the $136
billion deficit ceiling specified by the Gramm-Rudman law, part of
the savings would be accomplished with the sale of federal assets _
including about $12 billion in federal loans.
   Under the budget agreement, asset sales cannot be fully counted
toward meeting the deficit reduction target. Taking out these
sales, the Reagan budget would result in a deficit of about $143
billion.
   That would still be within the bounds allowed by the law, which
says the 1989 deficit can be as high as $146 billion without
triggering automatic spending cuts.

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange fell Thursday
after a weak early trend on Wall Street compounded earlier worries
about inflationary pressure on the British economy.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed down
12 points, or 0.69 percent, at 1736.1.
   The market was depressed during the morning by the release of
economic data that pointed to increased inflationary pressure on
the economy. The figures revived worries of a further increase in
base lending rates.
   The market was especially concerned by an increase in bank
lending last month.
   Share prices fell to the day's low during the afternoon because
of a weak early trend on Wall Street, dealers said.

<HEAD>B.F. Goodrich Announces 58 Percent Increase In Fourth-Quarter
Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   B.F. Goodrich Co. said Thursday its
fourth-quarter profit jumped 58 percent from a year earlier, partly
because of higher sales in its key polyvinyl chloride plastic
business.
   Goodrich said it earned $20.5 million, or 73 cents a share, in
the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $13 million, or 51
cents a share, earned during the same period of 1986.
   Fourth-quarter sales were $567.3 million, compared with $491.3
million during the same period in 1986.
   Sales of polyvinyl chloride and intermediates rose 26.4 percent
to $273.4 million during the quarter, the company said in a news
release. Goodrich also reported a 25 percent boost in sales of
specialty chemicals, to $181.4 million.
   Sales of industrial products were down 36.4 percent, while sales
of aerospace and defense products dropped 4.7 percent, Goodrich
said.
   Rising polyvinyl chloride sales also were credited with more
than tripling Goodrich's annual profit, although total company
sales declined. Net income for 1987 was $105 million, or $4.06 a
share, compared with $32.7 million, or $1.32 a share, in 1986.
   Annual revenue fell to $2.2 billion from $2.5 billion in 1986.
   The 1986 results included $660 million in tire sales before the
formation of the company's Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. joint venture.
   ``Our 1987 results are a clear confirmation that the
restructuring of the company is achieving the goals that were
previously set,'' said John D. Ong, Goodrich chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``Our core businesses produced operating income at record levels
despite significantly increased investments in research and
development and in marketing,'' Ong said.

<HEAD>Post Office Hops Cuts Will Save $160 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mail cutbacks, forced by federal budget
reductions, are starting to be felt by customers who are finding
some windows closed at post offices and their out-of-town mail
being delayed.
   Post offices dropped their third shift on Sundays starting last
weekend, said Postal Service spokeswoman Meg Harris. The group
works from about 3 p.m. to midnight and sorts mail bound to other
cities.
   The move is expected to save between $55 million and $60 million
toward covering the $160 million the agency has to absorb in cuts
in the current fiscal year, she said.
   In addition, $50 million is expected to be saved by closing post
office window services for a half-day a week, with the balance to
come from cuts in transportation, management travel, training and
other expenditures.
   Dropping the third-shift of mail processing on Sundays is
expected to primarily affect mail going out of town, said Harris.
She said Sundays were chosen for the cut because that is the day
when the least mail is deposited in the system.
   The first and second shifts, which generally sort mail for
delivery within the city where the office is located, are remaining
at work on Sundays, Harris said.
   The Postal Service closed most of its post offices on the
Saturdays following Christmas and New Year to cut costs, and now
has instituted a local program of closing a half-day a week. The
decision on when to close is being left to local managers.
   In general, postal managers have said they do not expect the
cutbacks to have a major effect on mail delivery, although
elimination of some sorting on Sunday could slow outgoing mail.
   Over the next 21 months the postal service will have to trim
$430 million from its operating budget and also has had to either
postpone or scrap $1.7 billion in capital construction and
purchasing because of the budget cuts imposed by Congress.
   There has been disagreement over how postal workers will be
affected. Postal officials have said they do not expect any
layoffs, while union leaders contend that the cutbacks could result
in loss of several thousand jobs nationwide.

   The stock market hovered in a narrow range
today, continuing the sluggish pattern of Wednesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .83 to 2,001.82
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 683 up, 706 down and 511
unchanged.
   Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt
traders to take big positions either way.
   The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors'
worst fears about the business outlook eased.
   But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits
remain subdued, and many market participants are evidently
reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000
level.
   Speculation has also died down lately that the Federal Reserve
will take any new steps in the immediate future to relax its credit
policy.
   Hewlett-Packard was a standout gainer among the blue-chip and

<HEAD>Supercomputer May Reduce Guesswork in Economic Forecasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minneapolis area will soon be at the
center of an attempt to use one of the world's fastest
supercomputers to dramatically reduce guesswork in economic
forecasting.
   If successful, the three-year project using a Cray Research Inc.
supercomputer could make businesses, consumers and workers less
vulnerable to blunders caused by faulty assumptions about the
nation's economy.
   In recent years, supercomputers have produced revolutionary
solutions to complex problems in engineering, chemistry, physics,
biology, meteorology and other disciplines.
   Computers have been less successful in economic forecasting, and
some economists argue that the problems are so complex that they
cannot simply through faster ``number crunching.''
   Arthur Rolnick, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Minneapolis, said: ``In the long run, the supercomputer research
should mean a smoother-running economy with fewer government
mistakes. That's the objective. That's the hope.''
   The supercomputer project, to be conducted at the University of
Minnesota's Institute for Empirical Macroeconomics, will make
Minnesota a magnet for top economic thinkers from around the world.
   The institute already has applications from as far away as
England and Australia from scholars seeking one of several resident
fellowships to work with supercomputers, said David Runkle, the
institute's associate director.
   Ten to 15 economic researchers from the Minneapolis Fed and the
University of Minnesota will take part in the supercomputer
research, a study that will begin sometime this year.
   ``This is path-breaking work,'' said Daniel Newlon, economics
program director at the National Science Foundation, which is
reviewing an application to finance a large share of the
supercomputer research. The balance of the tab would be picked up
by the Minneapolis Fed.
   The Minneapolis-based Cray is donating free access to a
supercomputer.
   Newlon said the project promises to bring together public and
private economic forecasters, who make their living predicting the
future, with researchers who are on the frontier of using
supercomputers to expand economic thinking.
   ``What could emerge from this is a new generation of policy,
analytical and forecasting tools that will dramatically improve our
ability to understand and forecast the way the economy performs,''
he said.
   In computerized economic forecasting, a computer sifts through
millions of pieces of information about the behavior of thousands
of businesses and millions of consumers. In this process, the
computer tries to simulate changes in the economy in the face of
changing circumstances.
   Christopher Sims, director of the macroeconomics institute, said
the mammoth memory and rapid pace of a supercomputer will vastly
increase the number of pieces of information that a computer
simulation of the economy could store and manipulate.
   If all goes well, Cray and other supercomputer makers could find
a whole new market among economists and other social scientists.

   Royale Belge SA, a leading Belgian
insurance company, said Thursday it had sold its 3.75 percent stake
in Societe Generale de Belgique SA to Banque Generale du Luxembourg.
   A spokesman for Royale Belge declined to disclose the terms of
the sale.
   Societe Generale, Belgium's largest holding company, is the
target of a hostile takeover bid by Italian financier Carlo de
Benedetti.
   De Benedetti claims he controls 38 percent of Societe Generale's
28.2 million shares outstanding and has launched a bid for another
15 percent.
   Societe Generale closed at 4,920 francs a share on Thursday,
about $140.58, down from 5,000 francs on Wednesday.
   Royale Belge's main shareholders are Groupe Bruxelles Lambert
SA, which is Belgium's second largest holding company, and Union
des Assurances de Paris, a major French insurer.
   The Royale Belge spokesman said his company still had a small
stake in a Societe Generale unit Sodecom, which is a vehicle for a
contested share issue Societe Generale is trying to launch to
dilute De Benedetti's stake in the company.

<HEAD>SEC Enforcement Chief Quoted As Saying Heavy Penalties ImpedingNew
Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe insider-trading penalties are damaging
new cases by discouraging potential defendants from cooperating, a
top official of the Securities and Exchange Commission was quoted
as saying Thursday.
   Gary Lynch, SEC enforcement director and one of the architects
behind an aggressive campaign against Wall Street corruption, was
quoted as saying in an interview that the prospect of imprisonment,
civil fines and financial ruin is convincing some people ``it's
better to hunker down than cooperate.''
   It was unclear from Lynch's remarks whether he was suggesting
less stringent sanctions against insider trading, the illicit use
of nonpublic information to profit in securities transactions.
   Lynch spoke to ``The Wall Street Journal Report,'' a weekly
television program of business and financial news produced by Dow
Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal.
   The company released a partial transcript of his remarks, to be
broadcast this Sunday, one year since the Feb. 20, 1987 sentencing
of Dennis B. Levine, a former investment banker whose arrest for
massive insider trading infractions spawned a widespread federal
investigation.
   Levine, who cooperated with the government, was forced to
relinquish $11.6 million in illicit profits. He received a criminal
punishment of two years imprisonment and a $362,000 fine.
   ``We're getting less cooperation today,'' Lynch was quoted as
saying in response to a question about what has changed in the past
year that has made the investigation easier or more difficult.
   ``More people are asserting their fifth amendment rights and not
cooperating,'' he was quoted as saying. ``So we're not able to ask
basic questions about contact, and that's certainly their
constitutional right, but it does make it more difficult to put
together information for an investigation.''
   Asked for further explanation, Lynch was quoted as saying: ``It
was one thing when people had to be concerned about a civil action
by the SEC and perhaps the disgorgement of money.
   ``It's another thing, when you talk about putting them out of
business completely and, not getting disgorgement of profits, but a
civil penalty as well and then subjecting them to the possibility
of time in federal prison. So, add it all up and some lawyers are
advising their clients: It's better to hunker down than cooperate.''
   Lynch was traveling abroad until Monday and unavailable to
comment about the interview, his office said.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue, who didn't attend the interview,
said ``I've heard Gary say before that there is more hunkering
down, so I would not dispute that, but I don't know if I would make
that the greatest news release that ever hit the pike.''
   Levine's cooperation led investigators to Ivan F. Boesky, once
one of Wall Street's most powerful stock speculators. He paid a
record $100 million to settle civil charges of insider trading in
November 1986 and was sentenced to a three-year criminal term last
December.
   Although Boesky and Levine are said to have implicated a number
of other Wall Street professionals in illegal activity, there have
been no significant arrests in the past year.

<HEAD>U.S. Pressure For Trade Concessions Changing Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwanese trade concessions made under
U.S. pressure are profoundly changing this prosperous island,
enraging businessmen who face stiffer competition and delighting
consumers who find lower price tags on foreign goods.
   The United States, which ran up a record trade deficit last
year, has pressured Taiwan to cut its hefty tariffs and revalue its
currency. Roughly one-tenth of the $171.2 billion U.S. deficit came
from trade with Taiwan.
   Since the United States is Taiwan's most important political
ally and receives nearly half of Taiwan's exports, Washington's
wishes cannot be ignored.
   ``We want to maintain our export market in the United States so
we must take more positive measures to help solve the trade
problems (between the two countries),'' Economic Affairs Minister
Lee Ta-hai told a recent legislative session.
   After decades of closely linking the Taiwan dollar to the U.S.
dollar, Taiwan authorities have allowed their currency to rise
about 40 percent against the U.S. dollar since January 1986.
   The changing exchange rate makes Taiwan goods more expensive
overseas and American products cheaper in Taiwan.
   Taiwan also recently reduced tariffs on 3,500 agricultural and
industrial products in a sweeping move that cut the average duty on
imported goods to an estimated 3.8 percent from 7.5 percent,
although tariffs on some goods remain much higher.
   U.S. officials, however, have indicated they want even further
trade concessions from Taiwan and Asia's other newly industrialized
countries _ Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. That upsets
Taiwanese who believe the trade concessions already have hurt the
country, whose exports account for 58 percent of gross national
product.
   In a poll conducted by the mass-circulation China Times and
published at the end of 1987, about 350 people out of nearly 1,000
interviewed chose the United States as the most unfriendly nation
to Taiwan. That was more than double the number of people who
picked Communist China, Taiwan's arch rival.
   ``Our 40 years of endeavors may be wiped out in these one or two
years,'' grumbled David Hong, president of K-Moebel Co., a sporting
goods manufacturer whose 140-member work force was cut in half to
reduce costs as the rising Taiwan dollar squeezed profits.
   Hong said the United States' decision in January to remove
duty-free and preferential tariffs on Taiwan products would make
business even more difficult.
   ``I am worried that mainland Chinese products, which will
continue to enjoy the preferential tariffs, may gradually take
over,'' he said.
   Businessmen argue that the Taiwan government has made too many
trade concessions too quickly under U.S. pressure, giving
labor-intensive local industries little time to adjust.
   Farmers also say the government has sacrificed their interests
to please the United States by cutting tariffs on farm products.
Thousands of farmers descended on Taipei last December to protest
sharply lowered fruit prices.
   But Taiwan's policy changes have not all been painful.
   Taiwan citizens generally welcome the government's tariff cuts
on a wide variety of foreign products, which have long been too
expensive for most people to afford.
   An estimated 8,000 American passenger cars were sold to Taiwan
last year, an eightfold increase from the year before but still
representing only 4 percent of the domestic market. Total imported
cars sales increased an estimated 35 percent.
   Imports of some American home appliances and many other goods
more than doubled last year. U.S. goods accounted for an estimated
5 percent of color televisions sold, 14 percent of refrigerators,
21 percent of washing machines and 8 percent of cigarettes.
   ``American cars are no longer considered as expensive, bulky and
gasoline-consuming. Many people are buying them now as the second
family car,'' said auto dealer Sherry Yang.
   Office managers, secretaries and salesmen armed with fatter
paychecks are buying Buicks, Skyhawks and Cieras that once were
only within the reach of the most wealthy. A Skyhawk sells for
about 700,000 Taiwan dollars, or $25,000, about 30 percent cheaper
than two years ago.
   ``Many people are finding for the first time they can afford
American products,'' said Dustine Wang, a dealer of Whirlpool,
General Electric and Westinghouse home appliances, which used to be
more than twice as expensive as local products.
   ``I did not hesitate at all in buying it,'' Wu Pei-pei said of
her new Whirlpool washer. ''I know it is more endurable, has a
larger capacity and not much more expensive'' than her old
Taiwan-made machine.
   Recent statistics indicate the trade gap is narrowing.
   Taiwan's January trade surplus of $843 million with the United
States was the lowest since February 1986.
   With its January exports of $1.2 billion, the United States
replaced Japan for the first time since 1963 as the country selling
the most goods to Taiwan.
   But the trade battle between the two countries is not yet
finished. Local newspapers, with dispatches from Washington, said
U.S. officials indicated they would ask Taiwan to further
appreciate its currency after the one-month state mourning period
for President Chiang Ching-kuo, who died Jan. 13 of heart failure.
   The local media also have reported that U.S. agricultural
officials have protested against planned measures by Taiwan
authorities to protect local farmers against foreign competition.

<HEAD>Airlines Announce Fare Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines has sparked a new
round of air fare increases by boosting some one-way coach fares by
$5 and first-class tickets by $10, effective Saturday, officials
said.
   Delta, United and Braniff airlines are among those who matched
the increases that American said Wednesday would affect most
tickets except advance-purchase fares, the cheapest available for
air travel.
   ``We felt that a slight, upward fare adjustment was economically
justified at this time,'' American spokesman Al Becker said at the
company's headquarters here.
   Houston-based Continental, which in the past year has served as
the industry's price leader, matched the fare hikes in a few
markets, said company spokesman Doug Birdsall.
   He said Continental will continue studying the markets where it
has not yet raised fares.
   The higher prices will affect mostly business travelers and
people traveling because of a personal emergency or some other
spur-of-the-moment reason, officials said.
   The price increases will affect:
   _Many coach and first-class fares for non-stop flights between
major cities, including Dallas, New York, Chicago, Kansas City,
Denver, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
   _Most unrestricted _ and unadvertised _ one-way discount fares.
   _Some round-trip discount fares with advance-purchase
requirements of up to 14 days and cancellation penalties of up to
50 percent.
   American's higher fares will mean, for example, that an
unrestricted coach ticket to Los Angeles or Washington, D.C., from
Dallas will cost $410 one way instead of $405. A discounted,
unrestricted coach ticket will cost $214 on those routes, up from
$209.

<HEAD>J.C Penney, Carter Hawley Hale Report Strong Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. on Thursday reported an increase in its
fourth quarter profit despite a slight drop in sales, while another
major retailer, Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., said it had
stronger second quarter earnings.
   Penney, based in New York, said net income for the three months
ended Jan. 30 rose 10 percent, to $280 million, or $1.93 a share,
from $253 million, or $1.80, during the same period a year ago.
   Sales totaled $4.94 billion, down from $4.98 billion.
   For its fiscal year, the giant retailer's net income totaled
$608 million, or $4.11 a share, on sales of $15.33 billion. That
compared with earnings of $478 million, or $3.53, and sales of
$14.74 billion.
   Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley netted $20.4 million, or 94
cents per share, on sales of $866 million for the three months
ended Jan. 30. A year ago, it lost $24.2 million on sales of $995.1
million, reflecting a major restructuring.
   The company earned $31.1 million, or $1.33 per share, during the
first half of its fiscal year, vs. a deficit of $7.8 million in the
previous year. Sales fell to $1.48 billion from $1.7 billion.
   Penney Chairman William R. Howell said the company's retail
operations achieved record results during 1987 despite fierce
competition during the lucrative Christmas holiday season. The
company's catalog operations also were especially strong throughout
the year, he said.
   Howell said Penney was able to cut many expenses during the
fiscal year, particularly in personnel and advertising. As a result
of the 1986 tax law, income taxes were cut by $17 million in the
fourth quarter, he said.
   Howell said the company was ``well positioned to respond to
consumer buying patterns'' in 1988.
   ``The expansion of women's apparel offerings and the continued
strengthening of men's and children's apparel will result in
significant opportunities for stores and catalog,'' he said in a
statement.
   Carter Hawley's results for last year included a loss of $29.3
million in both the quarter and half for early retirement of debt,
although this year's results reflected sharly higher interest
payments because of debt linked to its restructuring.
   As part of the restructuring, the company spun off its
higher-end specialty-store operations. It also sold its John
Wanamaker chain and two Broadway-Southwest stores in August 1987.
   Carter Hawley's stores include Broadway, Emporium Capwell,
Thalheimers and Weinstock's department stores.

<TEXT>
   Mississippi police are investigating
allegations that American Tobacco Co. tampered with the jury in a
cigarette liability case that ended in a mistrial last month, the
Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
   At issue are allegations that two employees of American's legal
defense team contacted three jurors during the trial, Frank
Carlton, district attorney for Mississippi's 4th Judicial District,
told the Times.
   Carlton said if the contacts did occur, they probably were
improper but not ``an outright attempt to ... affect the outcome of
the trial.''
   The allegations were made in affidavits gathered by attorneys
for the family of Nathan H. Horton, who died at age 50 of lung
cancer after smoking American's Pall Mall cigarettes for more than
30 years.
   Horton's family filed a $16.5 million suit in Lexington, Mass.,
against the cigarette maker. The suit ended in a hung jury Jan. 29.
   In the affidavits, two jurors said they were called during the
trial by employees of American Tobacco's legal team and and told of
a change in scheduling. Other affidavits said an American Tobacco
adviser boasted of receiving $2,700 for his work and was seen
talking to a third juror.
   The company's lead lawyer, James Upshaw, termed the affidavits
``absurb'' and ``an absolutely pathetic effort to get some type of
publicity.''

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Thursday in a modest sell-off on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans led the decline in reaction to reduced demand for
soybean meal, analysts said. Many traders also took profits after
Wednesday's sharp advance in soybean futures, analysts said.
   Increased farmer selling of soybeans also pressured futures
prices, but the losses were limited by news of new soybean oil
sales to India and expectations for more export business, said
Richard Loewy, an analyst in New York for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``Based on the profit-taking which could have ensued, you're
still looking at good underlying strength'' in the soybean market,
Loewy said.
   Corn prices followed soybeans lower, while wheat prices
retreated on expectations of adequate near-term supplies, he said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.22{ a bushel; corn was

<TEXT>
   Chemlawn Services Corp., the Ohio-based lawn
care service, uses ``fraudulent, deceptive and illegal''
advertising regarding pesticide safety, the state attorney charged
Wednesday in a lawsuit calling for a halt to the ads and a fine for
false advertising.
   The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan State Supreme Court, charged
Chemlawn advertising made claims ``not supported by scientific
evidence or valid in only a narrow, technical sense.''
   The filing by Attorney General Robert Abrams came three weeks
after Chemlawn filed suit against the attorney general over his
allegations and asked a Supreme Court judge to determine whether
the advertising was misleading.
   The company and Abrams have been arguing for months over the
contents of Chemlawn advertising; the attorney general notified the
company in November of his impending lawsuit.
   ``We have a right to distribute accurate information about our
product,'' said Steve Hardymon, a Chemlawn spokesman. ``The
attorney general has been harassing us for the last year. We just
got tired of it, and asked a judge to make the final decision on
the ads.''
   Hardymon had not seen Abrams' filing Wednesday, and could not
comment on his specific charges.
   The attorney general alleged that because information is not
available about the chronic, long-term effects of many pesticides,
Chemlawn could not guarantee full safety.
   Abrams specifically cited one ad as false and misleading after
it promised, ``A person would have to ingest over 40 cupfuls of
lawn clippings treated with Chemlawn to equal the toxicity of a
single cup of coffee.''

   The stock market showed no clear trend today,
continuing the sluggish pattern of Wednesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.15 to 1,997.84
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers were evenly balanced in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 722 up, 722 down and
495 unchanged.
   Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt
traders to take big positions either way.
   The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors'
worst fears about the business outlook eased.
   But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits
remain subdued, and many market participants are evidently
reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000
level.
   Speculation has also died down lately that the Federal Reserve
will take any new steps in the immediate future to relax its credit
policy.
   Hewlett-Packard was a standout gainer among the blue-chip and
technology issues, rising 2[ to 59|. The company reported earnings
for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 of 71 cents a share, up from
45 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   Lomas & Nettleton Financial fell 1] to 15\ on top of a 1[-point
drop Wednesday, when the company said it would take a charge of
about $93 million in the current quarter in connection with moves
to cease its homebuilding operations and restructure its mortgage
banking division.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.05 to 145.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .35 at 278.74.

<HEAD>British Petroleum Reports Higher 4th Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said its fourth-quarter earnings rose
by 95 percent, under the accounting standard used by most U.S. oil
companies, with profits bolstered by stronger gains in refined
products, chemicals and minerals.
   The world oil giant, which acquired full ownership of
Cleveland-based Standard Oil Co. last year, said it earned 394
million pounds, or $683 million, compared with 202 million pounds,
or $281 million, in the fourth quarter of 1986.
   Earnings per share totaled 81.6 pence, compared with 44 pence a
year earlier. Earnings per American Depositary Receipt, each of
which equals four shares, were $1.42, vs. 61 cents in the fourth
quarter of 1986.
   Sales totaled 6.8 billion pounds, or $12 billion, in the
October-through-December period vs. 6.6 billion pounds, or $9.4
billion, in the 1986 fourth quarter, the London-based company said.
   For the full year, the company said it earned 1.3 billion
pounds, or $2.1 billion, compared with 1.8 billion pounds, or $2.6
billion.
   Earnings per share totaled 208.8 pence, compared with 388.4
pence in 1986. Earnings per American Depositary Receipt totaled
$4.61 last year, compared with $5.72 in 1986, when the dollar was
stronger.
   Revenue for all of 1987 totaled 27.6 billion pounds, or $45.2
billion, up from 27.2 billion pounds, or $39.9 billion, in 1986.
   The figures are based on the ``replacement cost'' system of
accounting, which is most directly comparable to the
Last-In-First-Out system used by virtually all major U.S. oil
companies.
   Under this method, the value of inventories is listed according
to their market value at the time they are used and must be
replaced.
   By tradition, however, BP also uses the ``historical cost''
method of accounting, under which inventories are valued at their
original cost on a First-In-First-Out basis.
   In its report issued Thursday, BP said that under the historical
cost method, its profit rose 10.2 percent, to 260 million pounds,
or $471 million, in the fourth quarter, from 236 million pounds, or
$341 million in the last quarter of 1986.
   The results included a loss of 134 million pounds, or $212
million, on the value of inventories over that period.
   For the year, the company said it earned 1.4 billion pounds, or
$2.3 billion, under the historical cost method, compared with 817
million pounds, or $1.2 billion in 1986.
   Earnings per share totaled 298.8 pence in 1987, vs. 178.4 pence
in 1986. Earnings per ADR totaled $4.61, compared with $5.72.
   ``Despite a substantial fall in the dollar against sterling and
softening of oil prices in the last quarter, our results for 1987
represent a robust performance in a difficult year,'' said BP
Chairman Sir Peter Walters.

   The stock market turned downward near the close
of a quiet session today as traders apparently shied away from the
2,000 level in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt
traders to take big positions either way.
   The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors'
worst fears about the business outlook eased.
   But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits
remain subdued, and many market participants were evidently
reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000
level.
   Speculation has also died down lately that the Federal Reserve
will take any new steps in the immediate future to relax its credit
policy.

researchers have made the world's fastest dynamic memory computer
chips, the company said Wednesday at a research conference in San
Francisco.
   The experimental chips can retrieve a bit of information in 20
billionths of a second, three times as fast as the current
generation of so-called D-RAM chips.
   D-RAM chips are the most common kind of memory chips in
computers. They are more compact and cheaper but also slower than
static random access memory chips, known as S-RAMs.
   Separately, IBM said it had built an experimental S-RAM chip
that can retrieve information in a record 11 billionths of a
second. It announced another experimental S-RAM capable of storing
1 million bits of information, unprecedented for that kind of chip.
   The announcements were made at the annual International
Solid-State Circuits Conference, an event that draws top
researchers from the United States, Europe and Japan.

<HEAD>Meat Industry Group Concerned Over South Korea Imports Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meat industry group has asked the government
to investigate whether South Korea has violated international trade
practices through its 3-year-old ban on imports of U.S. beef.
   The American Meat Institute said it filed a complaint Tuesday
with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, contending South
Korea's import ban is ``unjustifiable, unreasonable and burden or
restrict United States Commerce.'' The AMI said the import ban is
actionable under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.
   Manly Molpus, president of AMI, said that historically the
United States was the major supplier of high-quality beef to South
Korea, a market that averaged about $5 million a year.
   Molpus said South Korea was in violation of obligations under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and under tariff
concessions agreed to in the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade
negotiations.

<HEAD>Venezuela Foresees Trouble in Meeting International Payments This
Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Venezuelan government foresees
trouble in making foreign loan payments this year but a top
government official denied Wednesday the country will seek new
terms for repaying $20 billion in refinanced debt.
   ``We will make every effort this year to prevent a significant
drop in international reserves, but this will depend on oil
prices,'' Finance Minister Hector Hurtado told a press conference.
   ``We think we can partially cover the oil price drop,'' Hurtado
said.
   Petroleos de Venezuela President Juan Chacin Guzman said
recently the state oil company will earn around $15 per barrel on
its oil exports in the first half of the year, or $1.70 less than
the company's $16.70 per barrel estimate for the year.
   The drop means around $1 billion less in oil income, according
to private estimates.
   The oil company originally estimated oil earnings this year of
$9.6 billion, while other exports could reach $1.3 billion.
   Hurtado said the government would be paying around $3.5 billion
this year in interest and principal on its $32 billion foreign
debt. It will amortize $400 million of refinanced debt.
   ``Renegotiations (on the refinanced debt) make no sense while we
continue to pay interest,'' Hurtado said.
   He said the drop in oil income will be partially covered by $300
million more from exports of aluminum and gold.
   The government will also press for multilateral loans and
foreign direct investment, and it is considering additional issues
of dollar-denominated bonds, he said.
   Last week the government launched a $100 million Eurobond issue
aimed at Venezuelan investors.
   The government recently reduced the private sector import budget
to around $7.2 billion but indicated there could be further cuts.
   The Central Bank's foreign reserves were $9.3 billion at
year-end 1987, including $3.5 billion of operating reserves.
   The nation is in technical default of its refinancing agreement
if operative reserves fall below $2 billion.

<HEAD>EPIC Bailout Expected to Proceed Despite TMIC Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bailout plan in the $1.4 billion collapse
of real estate syndicator Equity Programs Investment Corp. is
expected to continue despite the financial problems of EPIC's major
mortgage insurer, officials said Wednesday.
   However, the decision last month by TMIC Insurance Corp. to halt
claims payments put into default 6,600 of EPIC's properties with
unpaid balances of $485 million. Deeds to those properties were
offered to lenders in lieu of foreclosure, said John Cross of
Skyline Financial Services Corp.
   That means the lender assumes ownership, rather than the
partnerships that had been formed by EPIC to buy the properties.
   Virginia-based Skyline has been hired to oversee the sale of
EPIC's properties. The number already had been reduced to 12,500
from 20,000 in the past two years before the TMIC default.
   Cross said the EPIC bailout was expected to proceed despite
TMIC's difficulties.
   Meanwhile, state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said
talks are under way between her agency, the Federal National
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and private mortgage companies in
efforts to rescue TMIC and the EPIC bailout plan.
   A new actuarial study indicating how deep TMIC's troubles are is
expected to be completed later this month, Ms. Gillespie said
Wednesday.
   Fannie Mae, a major purchaser of mortgages from EPIC, was the
lead agency in arranging the EPIC bailout plan.
   TMIC is a subsidiary of the nation's leading title insurer,
Ticor, and has been operating under state conservatorship since
April 1986.
   The bulk of TMIC's problems stemmed from the collapse of EPIC.
   TMIC had insured about 45 percent of the 20,000 mortgages worth
$1.4 billion syndicated by EPIC as tax shelters for the
well-heeled. In 1985, EPIC defaulted on the mortgages and the
insurers were left holding the bag.
   Besides TMIC, two other major mortgage insurers had large
liabilities when EPIC collapsed: MGIC Investment Corp., a unit of
Milwaukee-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., and
Republic Mortgage Insurace, a unit of Chicago-based Old Republic
International Corp.
   Officials of MGIC and Republic said their companies were
continuing payments under the EPIC plan.
   EPIC, which was based in Falls Church, Va., was the real-estate
investment arm of Community Savings & Loan Association of Bethesda,
Md. In 1986, Community sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors
and subsequently was acquired by Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh, Pa.

   The stock market gave ground in late trading
Thursday as traders apparently shied away from the 2,000 level in
the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips dropped 14.58 to 1,986.41
after closing slightly above 2,000 in the week's first two sessions.
   Declines outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 among New York
Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 688 up, 813 down and 478
unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 151.43 million shares, against 176.83
million in the previous session.
   Analysts said there was little in the economic news to prompt
traders to take big positions either way.
   The market rallied last week and Monday as some of investors'
worst fears about the business outlook eased.
   But expectations for economic growth and corporate profits
remain subdued, and many market participants were evidently
reluctant to buy stocks with the Dow hovering around the 2,000
level.
   Speculation has also died down lately that the Federal Reserve
will take any new steps in the immediate future to relax its credit
policy.
   Not everyone was entirely cool to the market, however. Charles
Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, recommended
that investors move some money from bonds into stocks, citing
evidence of strength in the manufacturing economy, among other
things.
   He suggested that they have 50 percent of their money in stocks,
40 percent in bonds and 10 percent in money market investments,
compared with a previous recommendation of 45 percent stocks, 45
percent bonds and 10 percent ``cash.''
   Hewlett-Packard was a standout gainer among the blue-chip and
technology issues, rising 2 to 59{. The company reported earnings
for its fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31 of 71 cents a share, up from
45 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   By contrast, Ford Motor fell 2\ to 42\. The company reported
fourth-quarter earnings of $1.87 a share, up from $1.50 in the last
quarter of 1986.
   Lomas & Nettleton Financial fell 1] to 15\ on top of a 1[-point
drop Wednesday, when the company said it would take a charge of
about $93 million in the current quarter in connection with moves
to cease its homebuilding operations and restructure its mortgage
banking division.
   Rorer Group jumped 4| to 58. The company said it hadn't been
approached by anyone with a merger or acquisition proposal.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.31 billion, or 0.40
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .58 to 145.14.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 175.83 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 1.61 to 296.98,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.30 at 257.91.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .35 to 355.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 277.92, down 1.17.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises in Domestic Trading, Gold Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar staged an unusual turnaround
Thursday, closing mostly lower in Europe but rising domestically on
technical factors and President Reagan's statement that he wants to
rescue a kidnap victim in Lebanon.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New
York reported a late bid for gold of $442.80 a troy ounce, down
from Wednesday's late bid of $446.00.
   In European trading, the dollar finished lower against all major
currencies except the Canadian dollar, with little news to affect
trading.
   Traders sold dollars in anticipation the U.S. currency would
fall through certain technical levels. But when the dollar failed
to cross those points, dealers had to buy back dollars to cover
their positions, pushing the currency higher in U.S. activity,
traders said.
   ``The markets weren't going anywhere, and people needed to buy
dollars back,'' said James O'Neill, a vice president and financial
market economist at Marine Midland Bank.
   Separately, traders said President Reagan's statement that he
wants to rescue Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was
kidnapped in Lebanon, sparked sudden interest in the dollar.
   ``The prospects of the U.S. going in with forces to get the
colonel out of Lebanon adds fuel to the fire because in the case of
war breaking out, the dollar is a safe haven,'' said Joseph Cally,
a trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 130.00 Japanese yen,
down from 130.41. In London late Thursday, the dollar traded lower
at 129.72. Later in New York, the dollar rose to 130.375 yen from
130.125 yen Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7508 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.7490. In New York, it
cost $1.74175 to buy one pound, cheaper than Wednesday' $1.75415.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.71225 West German marks, up from 1.7010;
1.40965 Swiss francs, up from 1.3995; 5.7870 French francs, up from
5.7395; 1,261.00 Italian lire, up from 1,253.50, and 1.27055
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2673.
   Other dollar rates in Europe late Thursday, compared with
Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.7040 West German marks, down
from 1.7065; 1.4010 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030; 5.7555 French
francs, down from 5.7635; 1.9130 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9190;
1,254.625 Italian lire, down from 1,258.75; 1.2690 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2656.
   Gold bullion prices were mostly lower. The late bid price in
London was $444 a troy ounce, down from 446.00, but it was higher
in Zurich at $447.50 bid, up from $446.00. Hong Kong financial
markets were closed for the Chinese New Year holiday.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $442.90 a
troy ounce, down from $446 Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.43 bid a troy ounce,
up from $6.42. On the Comex, silver closed at $6.335 a troy ounce,
down from $6.43 Wednesday.

<HEAD>Profit-Taking Pulls The Plug On Livestock Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock futures plummeted the limit allowed for daily trading
Thursday in a wave of profit-taking apparently prompted by weak
demand for beef and pork products.
   Futures prices also fell on most other commodity markets.
Precious metals, copper, grains and soybeans, energy futures and
stock-index futures all retreated.
   The Commodity Research Bureau index, a measure of the
performance of 21 commodities, fell 2.07 points, a fairly large
move for the indicator.
   Livestock and meat traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
had been ignoring the weakening cash markets for beef and pork
products, but their attitude changed abruptly on Thursday, analysts
said.
   ``We've had a horrible beef market for three weeks and it never
bothered anybody. Today it started bothering everybody,'' said
Charlie Richardson, an analyst in Denver for Lind-Waldock & Co.
   ``We had people start to take profits, and later in the day
everybody decided they wanted out,'' Richardson said.
   Analysts said there had been no change in market fundamentals.
   ``The profit-taking kind of fed on itself,'' said Roger Norem,
an analyst for Agri-Visor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill. ``We
had quite a few orders to get out of long (buy) positions at the
close, and that carried over into the pork complex.''
   The selling caused limit-down moves of 1.50 cents a pound in
some live cattle, feeder cattle and hog contracts and 2 cents a
pound in some contracts for future delivery of frozen pork bellies.
   Live cattle settled .53 cent to 1.50 cents lower with the
February contract, which expires Friday, at 71.27 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .10 cent to 1.50 cents lower with March at 82.50
cents a pound; hogs were .48 cent to 1.50 cents lower with February
at 46.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to 2.00
cents lower with February at 53.70 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures registered substantial declines on the
Commodity Exchange in New York after gold for April delivery passed
the psychologically important level of $450 a troy ounce only to
encounter strong resistance at $451.40, analysts said.
   The subsequent price decline was ``a very typical reaction to a
market that breaks out and fails to follow through,'' said Craig
Sloane, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Gold settled $3.10 to $3.50 lower with April at $445.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 9.5 cents to 10 cents lower with March at $6.35 a
troy ounce.
   Copper futures fell sharply on the Comex, with the March
contract settling 5.75 cents lower at 98.75 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower in a modest
sell-off on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans led the decline in reaction to reduced demand for
soybean meal, analysts said. Many traders also took profits after
Wednesday's sharp advance in soybean futures, analysts said.
   Increased farmer selling of soybeans also pressured futures
prices, but the losses were limited by news of new soybean oil
sales to India and expectations for more export business, said
Richard Loewy, an analyst in New York for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``Based on the profit-taking which could have ensued, you're
still looking at good underlying strength'' in the soybean market,
Loewy said.
   Corn prices followed soybeans lower, while wheat prices
retreated on expectations of adequate near-term supplies, he said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cent to 6 cents lower with March at $3.21} a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.00} a
bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at
$1.91} a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 6 cents lower with March
at $6.28{ a bushel.
   Unleaded gasoline led energy futures prices lower on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Jim Ritterbusch of PaineWebber Inc. said crude oil supplies were
abundant while demand for gasoline and heating oil was weak.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent to .19 cent
lower with March at $16.45 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent to
.73 cent lower with March at 45.08 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .69 cent to 1.30 cents lower with March at 45.97 a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.55 points lower at 258.30. The
underlying spot index was up 1.30 points at 257.91.

<TEXT>
   The nation's basic money supply fell by $3.4
billion in mid-February, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure of money known as M1 fell to a
seasonally adjusted $760.7 billion in the week ended Feb. 8 from
$764.1 billion the previous week. M1 includes cash in circulation,
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $754.7 billion, a 1.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks.
   Analysts said the latest figure was within the range expected by
a number of economists, and as such had little effect on the bond
market.
   The Fed last year stopped setting a specific growth target range
for M1 because of doubts that the measurement accurately reflected
underlying economic activity. Instead, the Fed indicated, it was
more closely monitoring broader monetary aggregates known as M2 and
M3, exchange rates and other economic indicators.
   On Thursday, the Fed began reporting M2 and M3 on a weekly
instead of monthly basis. M2 fell $1.8 billion in the week ended
Feb. 8 to a seasonally-adjusted $2.94 trillion, and M3 fell $2.1
billion to an adjusted $3.712 trillion.
   M2 is made up of M1 and such accounts as savings deposits and
money-market mutual funds. M3 is the sum of M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   The Fed on Thursday also released its benchmark revisions to the
monetary aggregates for 1987.
   The central bank said M1 growth in 1987 was 6.2 percent, revised
from 5.9 percent; M2 growth was 4.0 percent, revised from 4.1
percent, and M3 growth was unrevised at 5.4 percent.
   The Fed had set a growth target range of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent for M2 and M3. The actual growth was the slowest in those
aggregates since the Fed began targeting growth in 1979.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $368 million in
the week ended Feb. 10, compared with a gain of $87 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window bank borrowings from
the Federal Reserve System averaged $254 million daily in the week
ended Wednesday, up from $118 million during the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $272.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Feb. 10, down from $272.9 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports Profit In Quarter, But Loss For Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System said it earned a profit
of $179 million in the final quarter of 1987, but posted a loss for
the full year in spite of a big reduction in its reserve for loan
losses.
   The loss of $17 million for all of 1987 was a fraction of the
losses of $2.7 billion in 1985 and $1.9 billion in 1986.
   The Farm Credit System said its interest income fell because of
competition from other lenders and a general decline in the demand
for agricultural loans. On the positive side, the system said it
was able to reduce the amount of money set aside for possible loan
losses because of ``continued improvement in the general
agricultural economy and the increased capacity of farmers and
ranchers to service their debt.''
   Loan-loss reserves were decreased by $684 million during the
year, to $2.95 billion at the end of 1987 from $3.64 billion at the
end of 1986.
   The Farm Credit System is a 71-year-old group of 37 banking
cooperatives and nearly 400 local lending associations. It was hit
hard by weakness in the agricultural economy.
   Bailout legislation signed into law last year created a private
assistance corporation that is authorized to issue up to $4 billion
in government-backed loans to financially troubled institutions in
the system.
   Interest on the loans will be paid initially by the government,
although the Farm Credit System would eventually pay everything
back.
   The Farm Credit System said its profit of $179 million in the
fourth quarter came on total interest income of $1.46 billion. In
the year-earlier period, the system had a loss of $384 million on
total interest income of $1.65 billion.
   In all of 1987, the Farm Credit System's loss of $17 million
came on total interest income of $5.78 billion, in contrast to a
year-earlier loss of $1.91 billion on total interest income of
$7.17 billion.
   The strong fourth-quarter results are not indicative of
expectations for 1988, the Farm Credit System said, because they
include a chunk of interest income from previous periods that was
not previously recorded.
   The results were also boosted by one-time reductions in
loan-loss provisions.
   The reduction in the provision for loan losses, partly offset by
some actual losses, added $207 million to the system's bottom line
in the fourth quarter and added $196 million to the bottom line in
all of 1987.
   In contrast, new provision for loan losses had subtracted $356
million from the bottom line in the fourth quarter of 1986 and
subtracted $1.80 billion from the bottom line in all of 1986.
   Price Waterhouse, the system's independent accountants, issued
an opinion on the statement that was qualified because of questions
surrounding the implementation of the federal bailout.
   ``The successful and timely implementation of the 1987 act is
dependent on several factors, many of which are outside the control
of the system,'' the Farm Credit System said in a news release.

   The Teamsters union is girding for a worldwide
strike against Pan Am Corp. on Sunday, but some travel agents say
the troubled airline's incentives will keep passengers lining up at
the gate.
   In formally announcing strike plans at a press conference
Thursday, William Genoese, director of the union's airline
division, promised a ``traditional type'' of Teamster walkout.
   Separately, the airline announced it lost $265.3 million last
year, compared with a $462.8 million loss the previous year. The
airline, which earlier estimated it lost $90 million last year,
reiterated in the earnings statement its pledge to remain fully
operational in the event of a strike.
   Genoese said there is enough support for Pan Am Local 732 among
other Teamsters locals to cut off the airline's supplies of fuel,
laundry and liquor around the world. And he added that there will
be violence ``if the company provokes violence.''
   The strike is set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST Sunday, the end of
a federally mandated 30-day cooling-off period in the labor dispute.
   Several travel agents polled Thursday said the public is barely
aware of the conflict, which centers on the Teamsters' demand for
higher pay and the airline's call for belt-tightening.
   The 4,500-member Pan Am Teamsters local represents passenger
reservation clerks, customer service employees and workers who fuel
planes.
   Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am's new chairman, told union members in
a letter earlier this month that in the event of a strike, the
airline ``can and will hire someone to provide the services you
withhold.''
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the carrier already has
recruited potential replacement employees and trained managers
within the company to perform some of the Teamsters' clerical
functions.
   The Teamsters have yet to receive a show of support from Pan
Am's four other unions. Jim Gannon, a spokesman for the
5,000-member Transport Workers Union, said members voted
unanimously Thursday against supporting the Teamsters.
   And a spokesman for the airline's flight engineers said members
were advised to ``continue with their work assignments.'' The
pilots and flight attendants unions also are not expected to
support the Teamsters.
   The pilots, flight attendants and engineers already have
accepted labor concessions in an effort to ensure Pan Am's
financial recovery.
   Herbert Teison, of Travel Smart for Business in Dobbs Ferry,
N.Y., said most travelers ``don't even know about the strike.''
   And Jack Bloch, president of JB's World Travel in New York, said
he hasn't seen any cancellations yet. ``Their frequent-flier
program, their special fares that are lower than most other
carriers and their triple mileage offer keeps people choosing money
over service,'' he said.
   Pan Am had no comment on a Teamsters claim that the carrier has
begun installing armed guards throughout its facilities at New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, the airline's main
hub.
   ``Obviously security is a top priority,'' Hanlon said. ``We are
making preparations to deal with it, but we won't disclose what
they may be.''
   Genoese said the hiring of the guards was a provocation that by
itself could spark violence among members.
   The Teamsters, Pan Am and Meredith Buel, a spokesman for the
National Mediation Board in Washington, D.C., acknowledge that
negotiations are still going on. But Genoese said no progress has
been made and he remains pessimistic.
   Picketing is expected to begin Sunday morning, and several
rallies have been scheduled at hotels near JFK airport.
   ``Our people are all positioned, they have signs and they know
where to go,'' said Frank Bertucelli, business representative for
Local 732.
   Pan Am, which operates Pan American World Airways Inc., a
Northeast air shuttle and other services, needs labor concessions
totaling around $540 million over three years to ensure its
survival, analysts and company sources estimate.
   The Teamsters say they have offered $75 million in concessions
over the next three years. Pan Am has sought an 8 percent wage cut
per year, work rule changes and revisions to its health care plan.
   The Teamsters claim that the give-backs amount to a 15 percent
to 17 percent wage cut for members, who make an average $480 a week
and have not received a raise since 1981.
   Last month Plaskett last month rejected an offer from the
National Mediation Board to arbitrate the contract dispute with the
Teamsters.
   By rejecting arbitration, Plaskett set in motion a federally
mandated 30- day ``cooling-off'' period between the two sides. At
the end of that time, Pan Am would be free to impose its demands on
the union, which in turn would be free to strike.

   Gov. William Donald Schaefer signed into law
Thursday bills giving top corporate officials greater protection
from lawsuits filed by disgruntled stockholders.
   Schaefer had sought the legislation to enhance the state's
business climate and to prevent some Maryland-based companies from
moving their headquarters to neighboring states that offer such
protection to officers and directors.
   As of Jan. 1, some 35 states had enacted laws offering some
degree of immunity from stockholder suits and are actively using
such laws to sell their states to companies considering
reincorporation, said Alan Rifkin, Schaefer's top legislative aide.
   ``This says something to business,'' Schaefer said as he signed
two identical bills passed at morning sessions of both the House
and Senate.
   ``It says we're interested in working together for the good of
the state,'' he said.
   The measures are specifically aimed at lawsuits brought by
stockholders who believe a business decision by an officer or
director was responsible for a drop in the value of a company's
stock.
   Business leaders strongly supported the measures, telling
lawmakers that skyrocketing liability insurance premiums have made
it increasingly difficult to attract quality business people to
serve on boards of directors.
   The Schaefer administration introduced a bill for the same
purpose last year, but it was rejected by the House Judiciary
Committee, reportedly because 1987's version did not give
stockholders the right to reject such immunity for its officers and
directors.
   The bill signed Thursday requires formal ratification of the
immunity provision by stockholders. The law also specifies that
such protection does not apply to lawsuits brought by third parties.
   Under the new law, which went into effect immediately after
Schaefer signed the bills, such immunity is lost when an officer or
director receives an improper financial benefit or in cases
involving deliberate dishonesty by a top corporate official.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, proposing a $1.1 trillion federal
budget on Thursday, predicted the economy would continue to grow
without threat of recession.
   In other economic news, the Federal Reserve said the nation's
industrial operating rate was unchanged in January at 82.2 percent
of capacity, remaining at the highest level in almost eight years.
   In the financial markets, the stock market gave ground in late
trading Thursday and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped below 2,000, falling 14.58 to 1,986.41. Bond prices and the
dollar edged higher.
   In its 1989 budget request, the administration foresaw no storm
clouds on the economic horizon, contending growth would slow during
the first half of 1988 but then rebound to robust levels in 1989
and beyond.
   The administration's economic forecasts, which provide the
underpinning for its assumptions on revenues and spending in the
budget, have been attacked in the past as rosy scenarios which bore
little resemblance to reality.
   But this year's version was greeted with less skepticism,
although it was still more optimistic than the outlook prepared by
the Congressional Budget Office and most private economists.
   ``In the last couple of years, the administration has lightened
the tint on their rose-colored glasses although their outlook is
still a lot rosier than we think is justified,'' said David Wyss,
an economist with Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting firm.
   The administration derided as greatly exaggerated recession
fears stirred by the record 508-point drop in the New York Stock
Exchange's Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 19 and contended
the economy had escaped with ``few signs of serious damage.''
   The administration predicted the gross national product, the
total output of goods and services, would expand at a modest rate
of 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent growth in 1987,
when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986.
   Congressional analysts are forecasting lower growth of 1.8
percent in 1988 and Wyss said Data Resources has just scaled back
its own GNP forecast to 1.4 percent, a full percentage point below
the administration.
   In the capacity utilization report, the Federal Reserve said
cutbacks in the production of steel and autos offset gains in other
areas, the government reported Thursday.
   The January operating rate remained at the highest level in
almost eight years, but it was the first month since September that
the operating rate had failed to move up.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp., which has
assembled an ensemble of actors from the ``M-A-S-H'' television
series for its advertising, said Thursday it has signed the star of
that popular program.
   IBM said that Alan Alda, who starred as Hawkeye Pierce in
``M-A-S-H,'' signed a multiyear agreement earlier this month to
appear in commercials for the computer and office systems giant.
   The company declined to disclose how much Alda was being paid.
   The first ads featuring Alda will appear Saturday during
ABC-TV's Olympics broadcasts, IBM said. He will initially appear
alone in IBM ads.
   In one commercial, Alda paddles about a flooded office and
describes how an IBM service team worked without stop to restore a
customer's computer operations.
   He says IBM can help customers face the future in another ad,
and describes in a third commercial how the company can help
businesses of all sizes.
   Dave McGovern, an advertising executive for IBM, said the
company eventually plans to work Alda into ads that feature other
former members of the ``M-A-S-H'' cast.
   IBM launched advertising for its new family of Personal System 2
computers featuring seven former ``M-A-S-H'' cast members last
April, including Gary Burghoff who played Radar O'Reilly, Harry
Morgan who was Col. Sherman Potter and Loretta Swit who played Hot
Lips Houlihan. For IBM, they played the roles of co-workers in an
office.
   Conspicuously absent from that group was Alda, who reportedly
was still under contract to another computer company, Atari Corp.
   McGovern said IBM had been interested in having Alda appear in
its ads for some time, but that Alda had other commitments that
were preventing it.
   A call was placed to Alda's agent, but was not returned.
   McGovern said Alda continues to be widely recognized and is well
liked by the public although the ``M-A-S-H'' program creators and
actors have disbanded and the show has gone into reruns.
   He said Alda has done little advertising and said his
appearances for Atari occurred five years ago and should not
diminish his effectiveness for IBM.
   ``You don't have a sense that he is saying anything he doesn't
believe in,'' said Barry Hoffman, a creative director for the ad
agency Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc., which created the IBM
ads.
   McGovern said the ads using the former ``M-A-S-H'' actors have
scored better than the industry average with the public.
   IBM has said that it did not set out to reassemble the
``M-A-S-H'' cast for its ads. Among those from that program who are
missing from the IBM ensemble are McLean Stevenson, who played Col.
Henry Blake.
   McGovern declined to speculate on whether any new characters
would be added to the IBM ads. ``Stay tuned for further
developments,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pan Am Loses Heavily in 1987; USAir Reports Record Earnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Pan Am-Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. said Thursday it lost $245.5 million in the 1987
fourth quarter and $265.3 million for the year, blaming the results
on labor costs, poor marketing, uncollectable bills and the
airline's frequent-flier program.
   At the same time, USAir Group Inc., one of the nation's
fastest-growing airlines, reported slightly lower fourth-quarter
earnings but record earnings for the year, during which it acquired
two other carriers.
   Pan Am's losses, reported against a background of
labor-management feuding, an executive shakeup and an impending
strike this weekend, bring the venerable airline company's losses
to more than $883 million in the past four years.
   The quarterly loss was 24 percent higher than the $197.5 million
loss in the same quarter of 1986, although the yearly loss was
about 43 percent lower than the 1986 loss of $462.8 million. Still,
Pan Am officials expressed alarm.
   ``Last year's results are terribly disappointing for the
company,'' said Thomas G. Plaskett, who was elected chairman of Pan
Am last month.
   ``A loss of this magnitude underscores the urgent need for Pan
Am to lower its current operating costs and revitalize its
marketing and revenue-generating programs,'' Plaskett said in a
statement.
   Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $877.1 million, up 9.8 percent
from $798.6 million in the same quarter of 1986. For the year,
revenues totaled $3.59 billion, up 18.2 percent from $3.04 billion
in 1986.
   Aside from blaming labor costs, which are among the highest in
the industry, Pan Am said the losses last year were aggravated by
$42 million in ``increased allowances for inventory obsolescence,
uncollectible receivables, and costs associated with the WorldPass
frequent-flier program.''
   Such programs, offered by all major carriers, attempt to gain
repeat customers by offering them free trips after they fly a
certain number of miles. USAir Group said its 1987 fourth-quarter
earnings totaled $26.7 million or 62 cents a share, a 16.6 percent
drop from the $32 million or $1.06 a share reported a year earlier.
The company had 43.19 million shares outstanding in the 1987
quarter vs. 31.73 million a year earlier.
   Quarterly revenues totaled $1.12 billion, more than double the
$483.38 million reported a year earlier.
   For all of 1987, USAir said it earned a record $194.64 million
or $5.28 a share, nearly double the $98.35 million or $3.34 a share
earned in 1986. Revenues totaled a record $3 billion vs. $1.83
billion, a 63.5 percent gain.
   USAir Group is an airline holding company that includes USAir,
Pacific Southwest Airlines and Piedmont Aviation. PSA was acquired
in May 1987 and Piedmont was purchased in November 1987.
   The company said its financial statement reflected the
consolidated results of all three airlines for the months following
the acquisitions, as well as USAir's equity stake in Piedmont prior
to the completion of that acquisition.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan proposed Thursday his
smallest Pentagon increase but sharply higher spending for AIDS
research and airline safety in a $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget
that was largely pre-ordained in a deal with Congress.
   ``This budget does not fully reflect my priorities,'' the
president said in his message accompanying the last spending plan
he'll see through to completion. ``But ... abandoning the deficit
reduction compromise would threaten our economic progress and
burden future generations.''
   The spending plan only hints of the ``Reagan revolution'' years
as it strives to comply with the administration's agreement with
congressional leaders last November to reduce the federal deficit.
   The agreement set overall spending limits for domestic, military
and foreign aid spending. Reagan has already signed the tax
increase required under the agreement, adding $14 billion to the
Treasury's receipts for next year.
   The president's plan envisions overall spending of $1.094
trillion, offset by $965 billion in receipts. That would leave a
deficit of about $129.5 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1, within the guidelines of the Gramm-Rudman, budget-balancing law
and down from $150.4 billion last year and an estimated $146
billion this year.
   Because of the agreement with congressional leaders, Reagan was
forced for the first time to submit a military budget that would
not keep pace with inflation.
   Restrained to $294 billion in outlays, up from $285.4 billion
this year, the president proposed reducing the nation's active-duty
forces and abandoning the goal of a 600-ship Navy.
   Servicemen and women would get a 4.3 percent pay increase,
compared to 2 percent for other federal employees.
   On the domestic side of the ledger, the president requested new
spending authority that he has resisted in the past but which
Congress would likely favor anyway in an election year, including:
   _$1.3 billion for AIDS research, a 38 percent increase.
   _An increase of $1.5 billion, or 8 percent, on education.
   _A 13 percent boost, to $3.9 billion, for drug law enforcement
and treatment programs.
   _$363 million to begin construction of the Superconducting Super
Collider, a huge new atomic research facility.
   _Full funding for a $2.5 billion, five-year program to combat
acid rain, and an increase in spending on hazardous waste cleanup.
   _A 44 percent increase, to $1.6 billion, for the Federal
Aviation Administration to modernize its air traffic control system.
   _$11.5 billion for space programs, including the manned space
station and space shuttle improvements. The actual outlay would be
$10.9 billion in 1989.
   But Reagan offsets those increases by calling for an halt to
Amtrak and mass transit subsidies, ending Urban Development Action
Grants, and eliminating the Interstate Commerce Commission and
Economic Development Administration. In addition, government assets
such as loan portfolios, the Alaska power administration and the
Naval Petroleum Reserve would be sold.
   The president's budget director, James C. Miller III, told
reporters that, even though Congress has rejected many Reagan
budget proposals like asset sales in the past, he believed they
would fare better this time.
   ``Congress will have to come up with these additional savings
one way or another,'' Miller said, suggesting that the cuts
outlined in Reagan's budget might be ``the course of least
resistance for Congress.''
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said it was ``the
intention of both the executive and legislative branches to
honestly fulfill the terms of the budget agreement. It's a rather
unique budget year.''
   Reagan said his budget reflected the give-and-take of last
fall's budget ``summit.''
   ``In presenting this budget, I am keeping my end of the bargain.
I call upon Congress to uphold its end,'' he said.
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Congress
would live within the agreement but ``there is obviously room for
setting priorities in a different way than the president's budget
proposes.''
   The deputy Democratic leader in the House, Tony Coelho of
California, was less generous. He said the failure to do more to
tackle the deficit leaves ``an enormous problem to the next
administration and to the next generation. It is a sad closing
chapter to the failed story of Reaganomics.''
   The administration predicts that if its budget is adopted
deficits would continue to retreat from the record levels earlier
in Reagan's term. When Reagan took office in 1981, the annual
deficit was $78 billion, and he promised to bring the budget into
balance within three years. Instead annual deficits nearly tripled
by fiscal 1986.
   To stay below the $136 billion deficit target for fiscal 1989 in
the Gramm-Rudman law, the budget includes $10 billion in revenue
from selling government assets and other one-time receipts.
   But those sales aren't counted in Gramm-Rudman's calculations,
because they are only temporary solutions. So the president
technically failed to hit the $136 billion target, although not by
the $10 billion margin that would trigger automatic spending cuts.
   The goals for future years are missed by the plan even by the
president's own estimates.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said he doubted either the White House or Congress
would face up to the continuing deficit problem this year. ``This
is the year of the big wink,'' he said. ``I don't envy the
president who will follow this administration because of the
deficit he will inherit.''
   The administration figures are based on projections that
economic growth will continue undiminished by last fall's stock
market collapse, and that inflation will ease.
   GNP growth will rebound in 1989 to a 3.5 percent rate and stay
above 3 percent through 1993, according to the budget. Consumer
prices, which rose 4.4 percent last year, will rise by 4.3 percent
this year. The jobless rate of 5.8 percent will hold steady,
according to the budget.
   The forecast is more optimstic than that of the Congressional
Budget Office and private economists, but not so far out of line
with them as in past years.
   The chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees said they
thought Reagan's budget was more realistic than his past efforts.
   ``I think it's a good faith budget,'' said Sen. Lawton Chiles,
D-Fla., chairman of the Senate committee.
   ``What we're doing now is working together,'' said William H.
Gray III, D-Pa., the House chairman. ``The president and the
Congress compromised.''
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a member of the budget
committee and co-sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman law, said the
administration's deficit projections might be too optimistic, but
``no one's going to talk about it.''
   The administration said if growth was even one percentage point
less than Reagan's forecast, the deficit would rise an additional
$6.3 billion in 1989 and $18 billion in 1990.
   But Hollings predicted this year's battles will be over the
details, not the overall thrust of the budget or its
deficit-reduction goals.
   ``It's like tying two cats by the tail and throwing them over
the clothesline,'' he said. ``There'll be a lot of small
intramurals, but nothing really's going to happen.''

   Children's television advocates in the House
and Senate introduced legislation Thursday designed to rid the
airwaves of programs that feature toy manufacturers' products as
the central characters.
   ``Children's TV has been grossly overcommercialized,'' said Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, sponsor of the Senate measure. ``You
flip the dial and you'll find toys _ Lady Lovelylocks, ThunderCats,
Inhumanoids, GI Joe _ all starring in their own shows.''
   Since the Federal Communications Commission in 1984 scrapped its
commercial limits on children's TV shows, at least 70 programs that
critics call ``program-length commercials'' have appeared on
television, he said.
   Such programs are nothing more than ``sophisticated marketing
strategies aimed at kids,'' he said.
   ``I just say that's absurd and it's wrong. The airwaves belong
to the people of this country and they're being abused,'' he said
at a news conference attended by other members of the House and
Senate and organized by Action for Children's Television.
   The legislation was attacked by the National Association of
Broadcasters, which called it ``anachronistic, unnecessary,
inappropriate and ineffective,'' and said it raises First Amendment
questions.
   The NAB said toy-based programs are not commercials and not
subject to government regulation. ``Does the federal government
want to eliminate the Disney, Sesame Street and Charlie Brown
programs?'' NAB said.
   Metzenbaum's bill would restore the FCC's previous guidelines
that limited ads on children's shows to 9{ minutes per hour on
weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays.
   A similar House bill also would reinstate the limits and in
addition would require TV stations to provide seven hours per week
of educational programming for young viewers.
   ``We can make children's television better,'' said Rep. Terry
Bruce, D-Ill., who co-sponsored the House measure with Reps. John
Bryant, D-Texas, and Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee.
   The FCC, in response to a federal appeals court ruling last
June, is reviewing its children's TV policies and is considering
whether ad limits are needed and whether toy-based shows constitute
program-length commercials.
   But Markey said Congress will not wait for the FCC to act.
   ``The commission clearly has demonstrated that it cannot be
trusted to protect children from commercial exploitation,'' said
Markey, who has crossed swords with the FCC over many broadcasting
issues. ``When it comes to children's programming, this commission
has never found an offensive practice that it did not like.''
   Charren said her group has been concerned for years that
commercial considerations dominate programming decisions regarding
children's TV, making it difficult to get stations to devote time
to educational and informational shows for kids.
   Spencer Boise, a vice president of Mattel Inc., which makes a
dozen different toys on which cartoon shows are based, said the
programs are not commercials because the toys themselves are not
shown and ads for the toys never appear during or adjacent to the
program featuring the toy's cartoon character.
   ``It's an entertainment concept,'' he said. ``The characters are
shown in cartoon or animated form, not static form like the toys.''
   Markey said the content of many of the toy-based programs for
children would be classified as commercial time and, with ad
limitations in place, would be driven off the air.
   ``There will be certain clear areas where it will be
indisputably evident to all who witness it that a seamless fabric
connecting commercials to program content has been developed,'' he
said.
   ``We may reach some gray areas where there is a more open
question, but clearly there is going to be an overwhelming
consensus in the bulk of the areas ... that will be very difficult
for anyone to deny that products are actually seeking to be
promoted as part of the program content,'' he said.

   A former TRW Inc. executive entered a guilty
plea to a charge of conspiracy to make false statements and submit
false documents to the Defense Department, the Justice Department
announced Thursday.
   Patrick M. McLaughlin, U.S. attorney for the Northern District
of Ohio, said the government had alleged that Richard E. Kavicky,
former financial manager of TRW's compressor components division,
conspired with other TRW employees.
   U.S. District Judge George W. White accepted the plea and
allowed Kavicky to remain free on personal bond pending completion
of a pre-sentence report.
   Last week, Kavicky, 55, of Wickliffe, Ohio, agreed to cooperate
with a federal investigation of TRW's handling of federal contracts.

   President Reagan proposed his smallest
Pentagon increase but sharply higher spending for AIDS research and
airline safety in a $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget.
   The spending plan revealed on Thursday only hints of the
``Reagan revolution'' years as it strives to comply with the
administration's agreement with congressional leaders last November
to reduce the federal deficit.

   President Reagan's 1989 budget proposal calls
for a 5 percent cut in agriculture spending, including sharp
reductinos for two major rural development agencies.
   But the budget packaged unveiled Thursday does not call for new
legislation or cuts in most farm commodity programs. Officials said
the one major exception will be an administration attempt to
overhaul the U.S. sugar program, which includes protective import
quotas and price supports.

   President Reagan asked Congress for a new tax
break to help parents finance a college education for their
children.
   In a budget recommending only a few tax changes, Reagan called
Thursday for requiring all state and local government employees to
pay a tax for Medicare coverage. He proposed a permanent tax
benefit for owners of shares in mutual funds and an expanded break
for independent oil producers.

   The Reagan administration said the economy was
shrugging off the impact of the October stock market collapse and
would enjoy modest growth this presidential election year with no
threat of a recession.
   In its 1989 budget request released Thursday, the administration
foresaw no storm clouds on the economic horizon, contending that
growth would slow during the first half of 1988 but then rebound to
robust levels in 1989 and beyond.
   The administration predicted the gross national product, the
total output of goods and services, would expand at a modest rate
of 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent growth in 1987,
when measured from the fourth quarter of 1986.

   The nation's industrial operating rate was
unchanged in January at 82.2 percent of capacity as cutbacks in the
production of steel and autos offset gains in other areas.
   The January operating rate reported by the government Thursday
remained at the highest level in almost eight years, but it was the
first month since September that the operating rate had failed to
move up. Some economists suggested this provided further evidence
of an impending slowdown.

automaker outearned General Motors Corp. for the second straight
year.
   The results announced Thursday were good news to Ford workers,
who will earn record profit-sharing checks, but some experts on
Wall Street had expected even better earnings from the company.
   After the earnings announcement, Ford's stock fell, finishing
down $2.25 per share to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

the 22 British plants favored the offer. The company said it

<HEAD>Southland Agrees to Sell Dairy Company</HEAD>

   Southland Corp. officials said Thursday they have
reached an agreement to sell the Dallas-based company's Dairies
Group to MorningStar Foods Inc. for an undisclosed amount.
   The purchase by MorningStar, an affiliate of Houston-based
private investment firm Duncan, Cook & Co., will include 10
regional dairies located throughout the United States, comprising
25 plants and related distribution points.
   MorningStar expects to retain substantially all Dairies Group
employees. Also, the dairies will continue to operate under their
own recognized brand names, including Adohr Farms, Bancroft,
Cabell's, Embassy, High's, Merritt Foods, Oak Farms, Specialty
Products, Velda Farms and Wanzer.
   The sale of the Dairies Group is one of several previously
announced in connection with the December 1987 leveraged buyout of
Southland by JT Acquisition Corp., an affiliate of Thompson Co.,
the investment firm of Southland's founding family.
   In a leveraged buyout, the purchaser puts up as collateral money
that will be generated from the sale of the target company's assets.
   In addition to the recently completed sale of 270 7-Eleven
stores in Houston, Southland has reached agreements to sell its
Chief Auto Parts, MovieQuik videocassette rental and Tidel Systems
operations and 21 7-Eleven Stores in Missouri.
   The company also plans to divest its Reddy Ice, Snack Foods and
Chemical-Food Labs divisions and about 700 other convenience stores.
   ``The Dairies Group has played an important role in Southland's
growth and the success of our 7-Eleven stores since 1936, when the
Oak Farms Dairy was founded in Dallas,'' said Jere Thompson,
president of Southland.
   Southland is the nation's largest convenience retailer, with
8,000 7-Eleven and other convenience stores supported by five
Southland Distribution Centers and six Southland Foods Division
food centers.
