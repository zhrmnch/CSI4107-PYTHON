   An artist's attempt to project the image of Mount
Rushmore onto the side of a Chicago building, with the faces of
passers-by playing the parts of the four presidents, didn't quite
come off as planned Friday.
   But some residents still gave David Fitzgerald high marks for
attempting his ``Urban Mount Rushmore'' video display, though the
images were much less clear than he had planned.
   ``It's a good way to start,'' said David Harris, 23, of Chicago,
who was among a handful of people who stopped through the Chicago
Loop on his way home to watch the show.
   Harris and his friend, Mark Flower, also 23, said that even
though they expected the images to be larger and easier to see, it
probably was the closest they would get to Mount Rushmore.
   Fitzgerald said that, overall, he wasn't disappointed by his
photographic blending of the faces of passers-by with the figures
of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Teddy
Roosevelt.
   ``We thought the glass would reflect better,'' said Fitzgerald,
24, a graduate student at the School of the Art Institute of
Chicago. ``But the glass is reflecting so much that it's acting
like a mirror.''
   Images of Washington and Lincoln, about 20 feet wide and 16 feet
tall, flashed onto the windows on the side of the Kluczinski
Federal Building. But while Fitzgerald said they were clearly
visible to the people attending a private dinner on the sixth floor
of the Union League Building across the street, they were harder
for street-level pedestrians to recognize.
   Fitzgerald's idea was to take snapshots of as many as 40 people
walking by the Union League Building. Powerful video equipment was
set up to project the images of those photos combined with images
of the figures on Mount Rushmore on the side of the Federal
Building.
   ``The federal building is this city's urban Mount Rushmore and
seemed like the obvious place that we should project them,'' said
Fitzgerald.
   The project was designed to give urban dwellers the chance to
see the historic granite carvings at almost actual size _ a sight
usually reserved for tourists who make the trek to the Black Hills
of South Dakota.
   The Union League, a civic foundation founded while Lincoln was
president, decided to sponsor the event as the centerpiece of a
private dinner.
   Fitzgerald has brought images of other gigantic historic statues
to the city.
   For the Fourth of July in 1986, he used 12 projectors to
recreate a lifesize image of the face of the Statue of iberty on a
wall of the Art Institute, he said.
   During a Chicago Bears game in 1985, Fitzgerald projected a
mammoth ``Bears No. 1'' across the Prudential, CNA Insurance and
Standard Oil buildings.
   ``Art should be for all the people all the time. I really want
to bring my art to the common people,'' Fitzgerald said.
   ``And along the way, I hope to make a couple of people smile.''

   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., billing himself as
``entirely different'' from his Democratic presidential rivals,
tangled with Rep. Richard Gephardt and Gov. Michael Dukakis
Thursday night in a crackling debate that raised the curtain on a
three-week campaign for Southern support.
   Dukakis and Gephardt fired back, with the Massachusetts governor
telling Gore ``you'd better be accurate'' with accusations and the
Missouri congressman telling him to check ``your own record first''
before making charges of campaign flip-flops.
   In one tart exchange, Gephardt said some of Gore's campaign
positions were so conservative that he seemed ``more like Al Haig
than Al Gore.''
   Shot back Gore:
   ``That line sounds more like Richard Nixon than Richard
Gephardt.''
   Five of the six remaining Democratic presidential contenders
participated in the two-hour debate on the Southern Methodist
University campus. With the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary
concluded, the debate marked the opening event in the run-up to
Super Tuesday, the March 8 round of primaries and caucuses _
primarily in Southern and border states _ in which nearly a third
of the Democratic National Convention delegates will be picked.
   Bruce Babbitt withdrew from the race earlier Thursday, and
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon skipped the debate to campaign elsewhere.
   Dukakis, winner of last Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, took a
dig at Gephardt, first-place finisher in the Iowa caucuses.
   ``I think we were all a little surprised when Dick last Saturday
stood up and said he was proud to vote for the Reagan tax bill''
after telling Iowans that he did so only as a last resort, he said.
   The debate resumed in the back room after the television cameras
were turned off.
   Said Gore: ``I think it's fair to lay out the record and lay it
on the line.''
   Said Gephardt: ``He probably thinks I'm ahead in the South and
he's got to jump-start his campaign to have a chance.''
   Much of the on-stage fireworks were initiated by Gore in the
two-hour confrontation that contained some of the most pointed
language of the Democratic race for the White House.
   ``I'm not going to sit here and listen to that,'' Dukakis said
after the Tennessee senator accused him of a willingness to accept
a Soviet client state in Nicaragua. ``If you're going to be
president of the United States you better be accurate.''
   Gephardt sat silently when Gore accused him of a long list of
shifts in positions on critical campaign issues, from Reaganomics
to abortion, and said a president has to stand his ground against
pressure, whether from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev or domestic
groups.
   But a few moments later, the Missouri congressman acidly replied
that he had listened to Gore's ``lecture on consistency,'' adding,
``maybe you ought to start looking at your own record first.''
   At another point, Gephardt slapped down Gore's decision to skip
the Iowa caucus and minimize his efforts in New Hampshire's
primary. ``I don't think people vote for political strategies,''
said the Missouri congressman.
   There were moments of humor during the two hours, such as when
Gore declared that Dukakis was a good governor, ``and I think you
ought to keep right on being governor.''
   But there was plenty of political thrust and parry, as well.
   Gary Hart said he didn't question Gephardt's motives in
supporting a tough trade bill, but added, ``We all know the road to
hell is paved with ... good intentions.''
   ``I think if Dick's bill ever went into effect it would be a
catastrophe, and the first casualty in any trade war would be
American workers and farmers.''
   Jesse Jackson, like Gore looking to appeal to a natural
constituency, drew one of the loudest rounds of applause when he
said the United States is making products that consumers don't want
to buy.
   ``How many of you own an MX missile? Not one,'' he said in a
now-familiar refrain.
   Gore sought to set himself apart as he noted that Democrats have
lost four of the last five presidential elections.
   ``I'm saying something in this campaign that is entirely
different from what these other candidates are saying. This is the
time for a Democratic nominee who is in support not only of
economic growth and social justice but also a strong America.''
   Gore also was the aggressor from the opening bell.
   ``I listen to Mike (Dukakis) talk and it sounds a litle
different from what he said in Iowa a week ago ... when he implied
it would be all right to have a Soviet client state in Central
America,'' Gore said. ``If the president of the United States said
that in office it could have catastrophic consequences.''
   Dukakis shot back: ``I never ever said that _ please get your
facts straight.''
   As for Gephardt, Gore said the Missouri congressman's tough
trade bill would deal with only a small portion of the nation's
trade problem.
   He said the leading cause of the nation's trade deficit was
Reaganomics ``which Gephardt supported when it was put in.'' With
Gephardt's trade bill, he said, ``we will never be able to get the
kind of trade surpluses in the next decade that we need.''
   Dukakis also addressed the trade issue, saying, ``We've got to
make made in America the international symbol for quality and value
and durability once again.''
   The debate was provided to public broadcasting stations and
moderated by Roger Mudd.
   The Republican candidates were scheduled to meet in a similar
debate Friday night, but Sen. Bob Dole and former television
evangelist Pat Robertson announced Thursday afternoon that they
would not participate. There was no word from the two remaining GOP
contenders, Vice President George Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp.

   A passenger bus trying to pass on a
curve in the eastern state of Veracruz on Thursday slammed into a
gasoline truck, killing 17 people and injuring 14 others,
authorities said.
   The impact caused the gasoline truck to explode near Tierra
Blanca, 22 miles west of the port of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico.
   The accident occurred at 6:32 a.m.
   Luis Edmundo Perez Garcia, a spokesman for the Mexican Red
Cross, said it appeared the accident happened when the driver of
the bus tried to pass another vehicle on a curve.
   He said most of the bus passengers were laborers traveling to
their jobs on an oil exploration rig in the town of Cotlaxta.

   President Reagan's modest proposals for
education and social spending next year drew a relatively warm
reception on Capitol Hill, but two committee chairmen said his
budget requests still aren't high enough.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee, said the extra spending authority sought for education
programs will not enable more children to participate in Head Start
or Chapter 1, the federal tutoring program for academically
disadvantaged children.
   ``We intend to press for funding over and above the president's
request'' to meet and surpass inflation, Hawkins, D-Calif., said in
a statement following the unveiling Thursday of Reagan's $1.1
trillion fiscal 1989 spending blueprint.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, said ``crucial domestic programs'' are
shortchanged in the Reagan budget despite its education increases.
   ``I am concerned that overall spending for social programs will
not even keep up with inflation,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Reagan just last year asked for cuts of nearly $5 billion in the
education budget. This year he is seeking an 8 percent or $1.5
billion increase for a total of $20.3 billion in expected spending
during fiscal 1989.
   About a third of the money would be added to the Pell grant
program for needy college and trade school students. Grants would
rise from $2,200 to $2,300 a year for total Pell grant spending of
nearly $5 billion.
   Another third would be spent on Chapter 1, bringing that
spending total to nearly $4.4 billion. The program serves 5.6
million students at academic risk.
   The rest would fund modest expansions of a number of programs,
including magnet schools, drug education, adult literacy and
handicapped education. The administration also is proposing a
college savings bond program under which interest on bonds used for
tuition would be tax-free.
   The administration requested modest increases in several social
programs, including rental vouchers for low-income families, drug
abuse prevention, foster care and adoption assistance, and prenatal
care for pregnant women.
   But some programs for the needy would suffer cuts under the
proposal, including a $400 million, 25 percent drop in help for the
poor to pay heating and cooling bills. Head Start would be frozen
at $1.2 billion, and other social programs would be left with no
increases or small ones lagging behind inflation.
   ``The areas still targeted for critical cuts, such as emergency
food and shelter for the homeless, child abuse, discretionary
grants and schooling for migrants, show that the administration
still wants to save money at the expense of the most vulnerable
Americans,'' said Marian Wright Edelman, president of the
Children's Defense Fund.
   The National Council on Senior Citizens condemned the cuts in
heating and cooling bill subsidies and in housing programs for
low-income elderly and rural residents. They constitute ``a grim
reminder that the Reagan administration does not now, nor has it
ever had, compassion for the neediest citizens in our society,''
the group said.
   Many reacted with amusement and skepticism to the
administration's reversal on education, pointing out that the only
other time the president asked for an education budget increase was
in 1984.
   ``We shouldn't be surprised. This is an election year,'' said
Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association. ``In election years, the Reagan administration
`supports' education.''
   Education Secretary William Bennett said the turnaround came
because ``the president has decided to make education a priority''
and because the administration realized after several rebuffs that
it was a waste of time to present cuts to Congress.
   He added: ``It's not politically dumb, that's for certain.''

   The Reagan administration, concerned about
threats to U.S rights to overseas military bases, is proposing a
$150 million increase in aid to three strategic allies _ Greece,
Turkey and Portugal.
   The administration also is seeking a slight increase in relief
funds, enough to settle 68,500 refugees in the United States next
year. But officials expressed concern that it won't be enough to
cope with an expected new influx of Vietnamese boat people and
others.
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead outlined Thursday
what he termed a ``bare bones'' request for $18.1 billion in
spending authority for foreign aid and State Department operations
in the fiscal year starting next Oct. 1.
   The total includes $14.3 billion in overseas economic and
military aid commitments and $3.8 billion for the State Department,
the U.S. Information Agency and other foreign affairs operations,
including embassies and consulates.
   The figures would not represent actual outlays, because some of
the money will be spent on projects extending over several years.
The outlay figure for foreign aid is expected to be several billion
dollars less than the $14.3 billion request.
   The budget had few surprises, but some of the requests reflected
new U.S. concerns about conditions abroad.
   The plan calls for a combined commitment of $1.12 billion in
assistance to Turkey, Greece and Portugal, an increase of $150
million over the current allocation.
   All three countries provide bases for U.S. forces, and have said
their willingness to play host depends on how well Washington
assists them.
   Portugal and the United States are reviewing an agreement that
permits American use of Lajes Air Base in the Azores through 1991.
That country would get a $163 million commitment next year,
compared with $117 million this year.
   Turkey would get $623.5 million, up from $525.3 million, and
Greece would get $351.1 million, compared with $344.1 million this
year.
   Negotiations with Greece for renewal of base rights that expire
next year are about to begin. Turkey and the United States recently
signed a base rights agreement, but the Turkish government has
frozen ratification proceedings partly to protest U.S. aid levels.
   Congress traditionally has ignored State Department aid requests
for Greece and Turkey and recalculated assistance to comply with an
unwritten practice of giving Greece $7 for every $10 given to its
bigger and poorer rival, Turkey.
   Reagan's budget plan calls for $340 million in refugee
assistance to allow 68,500 displaced people to enter the United
States. That is about the same number resettled in the current year.
   ``It is not as large an increase as we need, in view of our
estimates of refugee flows,'' Whitehead said, adding that there
will be more Vietnamese boat people and an higher level of Soviet
Jews and Armenians.
   ``We're not really sure just where the money will come from to
cope with the refugees that will be coming out,'' Whitehead said.
   As usual, Israel and Egypt would be the major beneficiaries of
U.S. foreign aid next year, with combined commitments of $5.3
billion in economic and military assistance.
   The more than 40 aid recipients in sub-Saharan Africa, the
world's poorest region, would share $733 million in economic
assistance commitments.
   Military aid to eight Latin-American nations that were cut out
of the 1988 program would be reinstated. Latin America as a whole
would get $90 million more in projected economic assistance and $55
million more in military aid than current levels.
   The administration proposed to eliminate aid to Ireland, which
received $35 million in commitments this year. Whitehead said the
decision was based on a perception that the United States ``does
not receive a real return'' on its investment there.

   A woman who poured gasoline into her
washing machine to remove oil from dirty clothes was burned
Thursday when the dryer ignited the fumes, a Fire Department
spokesman said.
   The unidentified woman had added about a gallon of gasoline to
the soap and water, said the spokesman, Russell Brown.
   She was treated at a hospital for second- and third-degree burns
on her arms and face Brown and was released, fire officials said.
   Firefighters found the woman's frightened young son hiding under
a table, said Brown. The child was unhurt.
   The fire quickly extinguished itself and the house sustained
little damage except to the washing machine and windows blown out
by the explosion, said Brown.

   Anthony M. Kennedy is quickly getting down to
cases after taking his place as the newest member of the Supreme
Court with a pledge to uphold a Constitution that he said makes the
United States unique.
   ``The Constitution of the United States is the single idea, the
single fact, the single reality, the single moral principle that
sets the United States apart from other nations, now and throughout
history,'' Kennedy said during a White House swearing-in ceremony.
``I shall honor that Constitution.''
   Kennedy, 51, on Thursday became the 104th Supreme Court justice
in U.S. history, restoring the court to full strength for the first
time in eight months and inheriting a pivotal vote on key issues.
   Today he meets in a private conference with the other eight
justices to discuss pending cases and prepare for the court's
return Monday from a four-week recess.
   Kennedy, who has been reading legal briefs in preparation for
his new duties, appeared relaxed as he posed for cameras outside
the court building.
   ``I've been working. I'm ready for Monday,'' he said.
   One of the first cases in which Kennedy will hear arguments next
week focuses on whether private clubs may exclude women and racial
minorities as members.
   The case has attracted considerable attention and Kennedy's
participation will be watched closely. He was criticized during his
Senate confirmation hearings for his past membership in such
exclusive clubs.
   Kennedy took part in two oath-taking ceremonies Thursday.
   At the first in the ornate courtroom where the justices meet to
hear arguments, he said, ``I do solemnly swear that I will
administer justice without respect to persons and do equal right to
the poor and to the rich.''
   He then took his seat at one end of the high court bench
reserved for the Supreme Court's newest member.
   Later, Kennedy went to the White House to a take a second oath
of office in the presence of President Reagan.
   ``Justice Kennedy has shown a consistency and a courageous
dedication to preserving ours as a government of laws, and that's
why I nominated him,'' the president said.
   ``He won the respect of his colleagues and of the entire legal
community,'' Reagan said. ``Lawyers and judges of all persuasions
characterize him as fair, open-minded and scholarly.''
   Kennedy gave a thumbs-up salute with both hands after the
audience in the East Room of the White House applauded him.
   Kennedy was Reagan's third choice to succeed Justice Lewis. F.
Powell, who retired June 26.
   Reagan's first choice, Robert H. Bork, was rejected in a bitter
Senate battle and the next appointee, Douglas H. Ginsburg, withdrew
after admitting he had smoked marijuana occasionally while a law
professor.
   Reagan did not attend the courtroom swearing-in ceremony. Also
absent were Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was attending a meeting
in Hawaii, and the three former court members still living: Powell,
Warren E. Burger and Arthur Goldberg.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist welcomed Kennedy by wishing
him ``a long and happy career in our common calling.''
   Unanimously confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy is viewed as a
moderate conservative with an open-minded approach to issues
involving civil rights and individual liberties.
   But little is known about his specific views on abortion
regulation, affirmative action, church-state relations or the other
politically sensitive issues on which the high court is closely
divided.
   He is the third Reagan appointee to join the court, following
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Reagan also promoted Rehnquist to chief justice when Burger
retired in 1986.

   Secretary of State George Shultz will be in a
hurry to pack for the Middle East after two days of talks in Moscow
next week, but he will go out of his way to stop in Brussels to
brief the NATO alliance.
   Then he'll jump aboard his Air Force jet and rush home having
about 24 hours to shift gears, pack fresh laundry and head for the
Middle East to push a plan for Arab-Israeli negotiations that
neither side is excited about.
   Shultz will pause patiently at NATO headquarters on Tuesday to
give the West Europeans a blow-by-blow account of his talks with
General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   He considers these briefings critical to the cohesion of the
West European alliance. It's also Shultz' way of making sure Moscow
knows that the United States is on guard against any attempt to
divide the allies.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will get a bigger and
more publicized boost on March 2.
   President Reagan will hold a summit meeting with the 15 NATO
West European and Canadian leaders. The aim is to reinforce the
idea that the trans-Atlantic alliance formed after World War II
remains the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy.
   Hundreds of reporters, photographers and television cameras will
make sure the point is not lost on American and West European
audiences.
   And yet, high-powered diplomacy and public relations aside,
maintaining American unity with Western Europe in a nuclear-nervous
era is not always easy.
   The Dutch and the Belgians did not want U.S. intermediate-range
nuclear weapons on their soil. The Danes opposed having the rockets
anywhere in Western Europe. Norway and Spain are self-declared
nuclear-free zones. France, with its own nuclear force, does not
take part in various NATO deliberations.
   West Germany in 1979 readily accepted the Pershing 2 and cruise
missiles that now will be withdrawn over three years. But
significant segments of the West German electorate and political
spectrum wanted the United States to move on to negotiations to cut
back battlefield nuclear weapons.
   NATO decided in 1983 to scrap 1,400 of the oldest nuclear arms
in Western Europe. But many of the American weapons that remain and
are below the 315-mile intermediate range will be replaced with
newer ones.
   ``No alliance allows its forces to defend itself ... with
weapons from yesteryear,'' Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne
Ridgway said Wednesday. ``Modernization is an ongoing process. We
are not prepared to defend Europe with weapons from the 1890s.''
   Large numbers of the new arms would be deployed in West Germany.
   She said the West German government supported the program and
was not pushing for negotiations to reduce the current tactical
arsenals.
   ``There is no move for the removal of the tactical nuclear
weapons from Europe,'' the U.S. official said.
   Actually, the West Germans would have preferred giving top
priority to negotiating a reduction in tactical nuclear weapons now
that the United States and the Soviet Union have signed a treaty to
scrap 2,700 intermediate-range rockets.
   But Shultz and the 15 Western foreign ministers resolved at a
NATO meeting last year in Reykjavik, Iceland, to place three other
items on the top of the agenda: a strategic nuclear weapons
cutback, a ban on chemical weapons and eliminating the Warsaw
Pact's edge in ground forces.
   Now that the West Germans have backed off, the Reagan
administration can concentrate on still another problem: the future
of U.S. bases in Western Europe.
   While Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has dropped all
discussion of pulling Greece out of NATO, he has not withdrawn his
threats to close U.S. military bases on Greek soil. Portuguese
Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva has threatened to scrap a treaty
that allows American use of a base in the Azores Islands. And the
United States is still looking for a home for the 72 F16
fighter-bombers Spain is ordering out of the Torrejon base near
Madrid.

Their campaigns charged the event would be packed with supporters

   The withdrawals leave only Bush and New York Rep. Jack Kemp
scheduled to attend. Bush was saying Thursday that he still planned
to participate.
   ``We had one of those (Bush) pep rallies in Houston. I don't see
why we have to have two of them in one candidate's home state,''
Dole told reporters after a rally in the rotunda of the Georgia
Capitol.
   Richie Martin, Robertson's state campaign director, said he also
thought the event was ``stacked for Bush.''
   Dole complained that organizers of the debate at Southern
Methodist University _ sponsored by The Dallas Morning News,
KERA-TV and Texas Monthly magazine _ had given his campaign only 60
of 2,600 tickets for the debate audience.
   But Burl Osborne, president and editor of the Dallas Morning
News, said all the campaigns received 60 tickets each.
   ``It is preposterous to try to blame their decision to withdraw
on the Morning News as Dole's representatives have tried to do,''
Osborne said in a statement.
   ``He complains that he received only 60 tickets. That is the
same number of tickets allotted to each candidate _ no more, no
less,'' the statement said.
   Osborne said 304 tickets went to SMU for distribution on campus.
   Debate organizers received on-again, off-again reports that Dole
would withdraw and that Dole was trying to persuade Robertson to
pull out too, Osborne said.
   ``We hope that Sen. Dole and Mr. Robertson do not write off
Texas and merely go away. We will have chairs for them at the
debate and we hope they use them,'' he said.
   The Democratic presidential candidates, except for Sen. Paul
Simon, debated Thursday night under the sponsorship of the same
organizations.

<HEAD>Some Older Programs Do Well in Restrained Reagan Budget Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

   Restraint is the note struck by President
Reagan's 1989 budget proposal, but the administration still found
room in the $1.1 trillion spending plan for new projects and hefty
increases in old programs.
   Much of the budget, the last of Reagan's presidency, has been
pre-ordained by a deficit-cutting deal he cut with Congress in
negotiations spurred by the October stock market crash.
   It offers few new ways to spend money and retreats from the
administration's favorite use of tax dollars: the military. The
Pentagon would get only a $9 billion boost to $294 billion. It's
the smallest ever proposed by Reagan and doesn't even keep up with
inflation.
   However there were some winners, including the agency that
regulates the stock market. The Securities and Exchange Commission
would get a 19 percent budget increase and 153 new employees.
   Science and space programs are among the biggest beneficiaries.
While domestic programs overall will increase by only 2 percent,
spending on science will increase 20 percent to $13.1 billion.
   Leading the list is a huge new atomic research facility to study
the building blocks of matter. The Energy Department would get $363
million next year to start construction of the superconducting
super collider at a site yet to be chosen.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration Administrator
James Fletcher says the president's budget establishes, for the
first time, the goal of putting astronauts on other planets. It
provides start-up money for the Pathfinder Project, a research
program designed to put an American astronaut on Mars early in the
next century.
   It also earmarks nearly $1 billion for a permanent manned space
station to orbit the Earth by the mid-1990s and more than $1
billion in added funds to help get the space shuttle off the ground.
   The budget devotes $1.3 billion to research into preventing and
treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a 38 percent boost.
   Another new element in the Reagan budget is its treatment of
education. Last year the president proposed a $5 billion cut. This
year he calls for a $1.5 billion increase to $20.3 billion.
   And, the president proposes a new program to help low- and
middle-income parents save for their children's education.
Purchasers of U.S. savings bonds wouldn't have to pay taxes on the
interest if they're cashed to pay for college tuition.
   On the revenue side of the budget, Reagan reprises many of his
``privatization'' proposals of the past: sale of government loans;
sale of Amtrak, the government-owned passenger rail service; and
sale of military housing. One new proposal is a private plan to
mediate disputes that now choke the U.S. Tax Court.
   Among other highlights of the budget, released Thursday, were:
   _$3.9 billion, a 13 percent boost, for drug law enforcement and
treatment.
   _$2.5 billion over five years to fight acid rain.
   _$1.6 billion, a 44 percent increase, to improve the air traffic
control system.
   _Nearly $1 billion for the new Worker Readjustment Program
(WRAP).
   WRAP will provide counseling, job search assistance, education
and training aimed at helping displaced workers move into new
careers. It replaces two other federal programs: one which provides
unemployment benefits after unemployment insurance runs out and a
second that pays states to help dislocated workers.

   The federal government has until the end of
today to appeal a court decision that paves the way for a merger
between two of the nation's largest manufacturers of glass
containers.
   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green rejected the
Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction to
block the merger between Toledo, Ohio-based Owens-Illinois Inc. and
Brockway Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., ruling that the FTC had not
proven the deal would hurt competition.
   The FTC had sought to stop the merger while it conducts
administrative proceedings on its complaint that the combination of
the nation's second- and third-largest glass-container makers
threatened to violate antitrust laws by reducing competition.
   But the judge rejected the agency's claims, saying: ``The FTC
has not shown the possibility of harm to competition that would
occur between the denial of the preliminary injunction and final
adjudication.''
   Green accepted the argument advanced by the two manufacturers
that competition from the plastics and metal-packaging industry
will keep down prices.
   ``The trend in packaging is definitely toward a greater variety
of container alternatives rather than fewer,'' the judge said.
``Counterbalancing the potential for direct impact on glass prices
through price discrimination, the other relevant effect on price
and supply would be efficiencies to be gained from the merger.''
   Last month, the judge concluded four days of hearings on the
FTC's motion to block the merger. She had issued a temporary
restraining order stopping the deal, but it expires today.
   Last September, Owens-Illinois proposed to buy Brockway for $750
million, or $60 per share.
   The merger would make the combined company the largest
manufacturer in the industry. The nation's top manufacturer is
Anchor Glass Container Corp., which controls 23.7 percent of the
market.
   Owens-Illinois has a 22.7 percent share of the market, while
Brockway controls 15 percent of sales.
   The FTC has said the merger might violate federal antitrust laws
by substantially reducing competition in the glass container
industry and creating conditions for price discrimination.
   But attorneys for Owens-Illinois said the purpose of the merger
is to achieve cost savings and efficiencies that will enable the
combined companies to vigorously compete against the producers of
plastics, metal and other types of packaging materials.

   FBI officials will report publicly to senators
next week on the conduct of agents who spied on and infiltrated an
organization opposed to President Reagan's policies in Central
America.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee asked for an internal probe
after publicly released documents showed the bureau conducted a
broad investigation of the Committee In Solidarity with the People
of El Salvador.
   The group, known as CISPES, contends that the FBI's motives were
political and that it was targeted because it opposes Reagan's
policies. CISPES pointed out the March 1983-June 1985 investigation
was closed down without any charges filed.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions was asked by the committee in
closed session Feb. 2 to conduct an internal probe of the bureau
operation. Although top FBI officials will present their interim
findings Tuesday, Sessions will not appear until a later session,
the committee said.
   Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla. and Vice Chairman
William Cohen, R-Maine, said in a joint statement that ``while we
will not draw any conclusions prematurely,'' they viewed
``violations of the civil rights of individual Americans as an
extremely serious matter.''
   The hearing also will focus on the FBI's justification for
conducting the investigation under broad guidelines that are
supposed to be used when acts of international terrorism are
carried out or planned.
   Use of those guidelines gave the FBI more leeway to investigate
CISPES; the bureau has other guidelines for conducting domestic
investigations which would have placed far more restrictions on
agents' activities.
   The FBI has said it conducted a legitimate investigation into
allegations that certain leaders and key members of CISPES were
covertly giving money and materials to a foreign terrorist
organization. The FBI identified the group as the FMLN, which is
fighting the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador.
   Thursday, the FBI gave the committee more than 3,000 pages of
still-classified documents on the investigation.
   Another 2,000 documents have been released under the Freedom of
Information Act, and they show the FBI was concerned that some of
its field offices were investigating protected political acts.
   Representing the FBI Tuesday will be Executive Assistant
Director Oliver B. Revell; Bill Gavin, assistant director in charge
of the inspection division; Bob Ricks, deputy assistant director,
criminal investigation division; and Steve Pomerantz, chief of the
terrorism section of the criminal investigative division.

<HEAD>Group Says Stop Political Interference in Parks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The effectiveness of the National Park Service
is threatened by political interference, a problem that is getting
worse and can only be solved by making the agency independent,
according to the nation's principal park advocacy organization.
   ``The popularity of the national parks inspires political
appointees to curb the National Park Service's independence and
limit its clout,'' said the National Parks and Conservation
Association in a set of recommendations released Thursday.
   ``There is an urgent need to make the National Park Service an
independent agency, responsible directly to the Congress and the
president'' because of ``increasing politicization,'' the
association said.
   The recommendations ranged over a wide field, calling for, among
other things, establishment of 75 new park units in the 340-unit
system and expansion of 200 existing units.
   The report also urged the service to end the physical and
administrative isolation of researchers; to install a systematic,
understandable recruitment and hiring procedure; and to provide the
chance for employees to move back and forth between general
positions like ranger and specialist jobs like historian.
   Conservationists have continually criticized the three interior
secretaries of the Reagan administration for their tight control
over the service and their reluctance to seek funds for land
acquisition. But Paul Pritchard, president of the association, said
at the news conference introducing the report: ``It's not just this
administration. The process doesn't work.''
   Defenders of the present system say the Cabinet-rank interior
secretary carries clout for the service in the White House. The
association says it doesn't work that way:
   ``More often, the service has taken its concern to the public
and the Congress, either publicly or privately, to overcome
obstacles placed before it by political appointees of the
department.''
   If independent, ``the service would still have to compete
against all other federal agencies for funding, (but) it would be
able to compete without the filters and constraints of interior
secretaries, who historically have reduced National Park Service
funding requests to fit their own priorities.''
   The service was founded in 1916 in the Interior Department to
take care of the parks, the first of which was established in 1872.
The service now has 340 national parks, monuments, battlefields,
recreation areas, seashores and other units.
   Many were added in the 1960s and 1970s by a Congress delighted
to discover a new political currency that won favor with
constituents. Only four units have been added under the Reagan
administration.
   All directors have been professional park managers with one
exception: Ron Walker, a former campaign aide for President Nixon.
The current director, William Penn Mott, began his career with the
service in the 1930s and served as state parks director in
California under then-Gov. Ronald Reagan before being appointed to
his current job by Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel.
   ``I don't think he's free to advocate,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento,
D-Minn., chairman of the parks subcommittee of the House Interior
Committee, at the news conference.
   Vento said he was introducing a bill to transfer all the
secretary's legal responsibilities for the parks to the director
and to make the directorship a five-year presidential appointment.
The director would have to be a professional parks manager
confirmed by the Senate and subject to removal only for cause. The
bill also would establish a three-member board to advise Congress
on the parks.
   Complaints about political direction are common in the
government, but until recently have been rare in the park service.
Interior secretaries have tended to keep the directors they
inherit, but there have been reports that some have not been above
making it clear they'd like to see an early retirement.
   Current employees say they are under tighter political rein than
ever.
   Vento's bill would not actually take the service out of the
Interior Department, but he said it would accomplish the objectives
the association seeks and ``be more acceptable by my colleagues.''
   He said the association report ``sets forth a damning case
against the politicization of one of the finest professional
organizations in government.''
   Mott, said spokesman George Berklacy, ``does not support the
removal of the service from interior. He does not believe there is
anything advantageous to that. He feels very strongly that the
director of the National Park Service should be a professional park
manager. A five-year presidential appointment is OK with him.''

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department issued some wordy
marching orders this week for reporters preparing stories on its
$299.5 billion budget request for next year.
   The aim was to prevent publication of budget details until noon
Thursday.
   In official Washington, copies of complicated documents are
routinely made available to journalists in advance of publication
to give them time to absorb the complexities and write informed
stories.
   The agency that issues the document sets the day and hour when
the information can be released. In journalistic parlance, that's
called an embargo.
   But the Pentagon's budget embargo warning was more emphatic _
and a lot wordier _ than most.
   Its budget embargo was to be a ``total embargo,'' no ifs, ands
or buts.
   ``Until release, NONE of this material may be paraphrased,
hinted at or alluded to in any way,'' the Pentagon declared.
   ``This material must NOT be discussed with or provided to others
who have not accepted the package on an embargoed basis.''
   The Pentagon also laid out the rules under which it would
discuss the contents of the budget.
   ``In advance of release, no telephone inquiries on this material
will be accepted by Defense Department personnel,'' the department
said. ``Questions from news media correspondents must be asked in
person and the requester must acknowledge acceptance of this
embargo.''
   Just to make sure the message got across, the Pentagon directive
_ stamped top and bottom with the words _ HOLD FOR RELEASE _ added
the following:
   ``There is a total embargo on this budget, as stated above,
which includes any and all references to any material in the budget
or the budget appendix.''

   Two rival groups that sponsor chili
cook-offs have removed a simmering dispute from the back burner and
taken it into the courtroom.
   The Chili Appreciation Society International Inc. has been
judging the fiery merits of this Southwestern specialty since 1967.
Five years ago, an unincorporated spinoff group took the same name
and started its own cookoff.
   Both groups hold an annual championship cookoff each November
near the west Texas ghost town of Terlingua.
   The older group has mounted a court challenge seeking to force
the newer one to change its name. U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton
said he would decide within 20 days which group will get to keep
the Chili Appreciation Society International name.
   Frank X. Tolbert, now deceased, helped organize the first
cookoff in 1967 to publicize this ghost town.
   One of Tolbert's early partners, Ray King, testified Wednesday
that Tolbert agreed in 1980 to incorporate the group, but later
backed out because ``he didn't care much for rules and
organization. He liked it like it started out.''
   King and others incorporated the group, and Tolbert accepted the
organization's honorary title of ``Supreme Pepper.''
   But in 1983, Tolbert broke from the society and started a rival
cookoff across the road from the original site at the vacant Chisos
Saloon.
   The older, larger group has since moved its cookoff eight miles
down the road to Villa de la Mina, where 2,500 participated last
year.
   Bunton likened the argument to the child-custody dispute King
Solomon resolved by ordering the baby cut in half.
   ``That's exactly what's happened to Terlingua,'' Bunton said.
``The baby is split. Terlingua doesn't need two cookoffs.''

   Reagan administration plans to overhaul the
U.S. sugar support system and drastically cut rural housing and
telephone programs are headed for the same chilly reception that
Congress gave them in past years, farm-state Democrats say.
   ``They were dead on arrival and will remain dead on arrival,''
Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said after President Reagan submitted
his proposed fiscal 1989 farm budget on Thursday.
   Panetta, a member of the House Agriculture Committee,
characterized Reagan's spending plan as ``a no-news budget'' and
``a rehash of old proposals.''
   In any case, he said, legislators are in no mood to revamp farm
programs so soon after approving a full-scale overhaul in the 1985
farm law.
   Food programs, including food stamps and school lunches,
remained largely untouched under Reagan's proposed budget. There
were no changes in most farm commodity programs except for the
sugar program, which includes protective import quotas and price
supports.
   The Agriculture Department wants to reduce the sugar price
support from 18 cents a pound to 12 cents to make domestic sugar
more competitive with imports. It contends that high supports
artificially stimulate domestic production and forces the United
States to impose tighter quotas on imports.
   Most of the major decisions embodied in the proposed budget
resulted from a summit agreement between Congress and the White
House on $76 billion in deficit-reducing savings over two years.
   Accordingly, the administration proposed to cut overall farm
spending by 5 percent, but dropped previous proposals for new user
fees, changes in Forest Service payments to states, alterations in
food assistance programs and turning the federal crop insurance
program over to private enterprise.
   The 5 percent cut included a proposed reduction in Farmers Home
Administration rural housing programs from more than $3.3 billion
this year to less than $1.4 billion in fiscal 1989, which starts
Oct. 1.
   Also, 70 percent of Rural Electrification Administration loans
to rural telephone companies and cooperatives would be transformed
into guaranteed loans from private lenders at an estimated
government savings of $478 million.
   But Congress has tossed these same proposals in the wastebasket
in the past, and seems likely to do the same this year.
   ``This is not the leadership required to address the need for
economic recovery in the thousands of rural communities that have
been bypassed by the economic recovery,'' said Sen. Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   Said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., a member of the House
Agriculture Committee: ``This is not a budget that attempts to deal
with real numbers. It is a philosophical budget, an attempt to use
the budget in obtaining the Reagan administration's philosophical
goals.''
   ``We recognize the need for budget discipline,'' said Rep. E
``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House panel. But he
said Congress ``would remind the administration and the public that
over recent years, agriculture has taken more than its fair share
of budget cuts.''
   According to the House Budget Committee, agriculture spending
after inflation increased 109.8 percent from fiscal 1981 until
fiscal 1987. The increase was caused largely by huge subsidy
programs under the 1985 law that were intended to spur exports and
revitalize the depressed farm economy.
   Net outlays for farm payments by the Agriculture Department's
Commodity Credit Corp. peaked in 1986 at $25.8 billion. They have
been falling since then to $17.7 billion currently, and are
projected at $17.1 billion next year.
   Reagan's budget proposed no new types of price-support payments,
although some lawmakers have begun to push for new subsidies for
soybeans and possibly other crops.

<HEAD>Report: Investigators Believe Israel Had Second Spy in United
States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials have drawn up a list of
suspects in their search for a ``Mr. X'' inside the government who
they believe helped Israel direct convicted spy Jonathan Jay
Pollard to critical secret documents, The Washington Post reported
today.
   The Post reported that Justice Department officials believe
Israel almost certainly had another espionage agent spying against
the United States in addition to Pollard, who has been sentenced to
life in prison.
   However, no evidence has been developed yet that points to the
specific identity of this second person, who has been dubbed ``Mr.
X,'' the Post said, citing unidentified sources for its information.
   ``As we have indicated previously, there are unanswered
questions in the case and the investigation continues,'' Justice
Department spokesman Terry Eastland said.
   An Israeli Embassy spokesman, Yossi Gal, said the Pollard case
was an aberration and that the Israeli government has no more spies
in the United States.
   Pollard was a Navy intelligence analyst who was working at the
Navy's new Antiterrorism Alert Center during the 17 months when he
spied for Israel. He was sentenced in March 1987 to life
imprisonment after pleading guilty to selling secrets to Israel. He
was arrested in November 1985 outside the Israeli Embassy in
Washington and is imprisoned in Springfield, Mo.
   Pollard's wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, was sentenced in March
1987 to five years imprisonment after she pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to receive embezzled government property and being an
accessory after the fact to possession of state secrets. She has
been moved to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., where
she is suffering from a digestive tract disease.
   The Post, quoting unidentified sources, said the belief that a
Mr. X must exist grew out of a massive debriefing and polygraphing
of Pollard over many months.
   Pollard told authorities that his Israeli handlers often
specified by date and document control number the highly sensitive
U.S. documents they wanted him to acquire, the newspaper said.
   The handlers once showed him a top secret U.S. document to which
Pollard himself did not have access, the Post said, identifying the
document as an index or catalog that Pollard then could use to
obtain other documents from U.S. intelligence agencies.
   Investigators concluded that another American _ Mr. X _ had
provided that index and other specific information on U.S. secrets
that Pollard learned from his Israeli handlers, the newspaper said.
   Prosecutors have said Pollard sold Israel enough classified
documents to fill a large, walk-in closet and called the spy case
one of the nation's worst.

   The Reagan administration is taking aim at a
favorite budget-cutting target again this year, the dams and
irrigation projects that are cherished by members of Congress.
   The White House spending plan for fiscal 1989, sent to the
Capitol on Thursday, calls for construction starts on only a
half-dozen water projects by the Army Corps of Engineers. And for
the second consecutive year, no new projects were proposed for the
Bureau of Reclamation.
   A year ago, the president's 1988 budget request included funds
to begin 13 corps projects out of the scores authorized by Congress
under a 1986 law that required local beneficiaries to start paying
a share of the costs.
   For decades, Congress had cooperated closely with the corps and
the bureau, simultaneously expanding business for both agencies and
providing lawmakers with public works projects to extoll during
re-election campaigns.
   The congressional response to Reagan's request last year for
only 13 new construction starts was to appropriate money to begin
21 corps projects, ranging from flood control dams to replacement
of sand on eroding beaches.
   There was no immediate reaction among legislators Thursday to
the administration's proposal to start only six new flood control
projects in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   The battle over Reagan's request probably will be fought in
coming months during closed meetings of the House and Senate
Appropriations committees.
   The slow-growth spending plan for water projects was termed ``a
good one'' by Robert Dawson, associate director of the White House
Office of Management and Budget for natural resources, energy and
science.
   ``It's a strong water development budget, clearly founded on the
concept that the user must help pay the cost,'' he said. ``It shows
that worthy projects can proceed even in times of budget
austerity.''
   The fiscal 1989 request for the corps totals nearly $3.3
billion. The bulk of it is earmarked to continue work on 157
projects under construction and to operate and maintain more than
650 completed projects.
   The total for the corps' flood control, navigation, recreation
and environmental repair activities is only about $52 million more
than Congress appropriated for the current fiscal year.
   Spending by the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department
agency operating in Western states, would total $1.07 billion in
fiscal 1989, just $13 million more than Congress approved for
fiscal 1988.
   The bureau's budget request calls for higher spending to solve
environmental problems caused by irrigation systems, in line with a
major redirection of the agency's activities last year.
   The bureaucratic changes, which include transferring the
majority of the bureau's Washington staff to Denver, was tied to
the reclamation reality that nearly all the major rivers in the
water-short West have been dammed.
   The bureau's budget also includes a reshuffling of construction
priorities aimed at channeling increasingly limited funds to more
quickly complete major projects such as Central Arizona and Central
Utah.
   Last year, Congress rejected an administration attempt to make
an even more drastic reallocation of money among projects under
construction.
   The six newly proposed corps projects are Cache Creek Settling
Basin and the Santa Ana River Mainstem in California; Sheyenne
River, West Fargo and Riverside in North Dakota; the Ramapo and
Mahwah rivers in New Jersey and New York; Lock Haven in
Pennsylvania, and Nonconnah Creek in Tennessee and Mississippi.

   The Defense Department wants to spend $9
billion on military construction projects in fiscal 1989, including
more than $1 billion for work outside the United States.
   Of the $9 billion, more than $200 million has already been
authorized, meaning that about $8.8 billion in new funds is being
sought.
   Within the United States, the biggest winners would be
California, New York, Texas, Alaska and Washington state, primarily
because of work on new bases or seaports.
   Abroad, the Pentagon plans to spend the most in West Germany,
South Korea, the Philippines, England and Italy, in that order.
   The $81.4 million request for construction work in the
Philippines comes at a time of instability in that country and
uncertainty over whether the government of President Corazon Aquino
will approve extension of leases for the Subic Naval Base and Clark
Air Base beyond 1991.
   The Pentagon has said it expects to negotiate new leases for the
bases and will continue improving them in the meantime.
   Also contained in President Reagan's fiscal 1989 budget request,
sent to Congress on Thursday, is $3 million to ``upgrade
facilities'' in Honduras, where U.S. forces regularly engage in
maneuvers as part of a U.S. campaign to deter Nicaraguan expansion.
   The budget plan also includes $9.9 million to improve air fields
in Oman near the Persian Gulf and $16 million for a missile range
complex in the Kwajalein Islands in the Pacific Ocean for
experiments on Reagan's Star Wars missile defense system.
   The funds for more than 1,100 construction projects at more than
600 sites were contained in Reagan's request for $299.5 billion in
Pentagon spending authority for the budget year starting Oct. 1,
compared with $291.4 billion this year.
   The administration initially had planned to spend more than
$10.6 billion for construction next year, but was forced to trim
back because of a deficit-reduction agreement with Congress last
November.
   Of the $9 billion construction total, the Pentagon said it would
spend nearly $5.8 billion on military facilities and nearly $3.3
billion on housing. By contrast, the department plans to spend $8.7
billion this year, including $5.5 billion on new facilities and
$3.2 billion on housing.
   Nearly $600 million would be spent next year to build 3,226 new
housing units and improve 16,900 existing units. The remaining $2.7
billion would be for operating and maintaining the 413,000 existing
family units, the Pentagon said.
   The military facility projects include work to support the B-1
bomber, the MX missile, the ``Stealth'' bomber and new ports for
ships joining the Navy's fleet.
   Among the larger individual projects are $56.3 million for a new
naval submarine base at Kings Bay, Ga.; $214 million in previouly
authorized money for the new home of a light infantry division at
Fort Drum, N.Y.; $72.5 million for a major Star Wars test facility
at Falcon Air Station, Colo., and $53 million for a new aircraft
carrier base at Everett, Wash.
   Including family housing funds and previously authorized
projects, the Pentagon said it planned to spend $666 million in
California, $309.5 million in New York, $217.6 million in Texas,
$202.2 million in Alaska and $201.2 million in Washington state.
   Besides the Philippines, foreign spending would include $421.1
million in West Germany, $133.6 million in South Korea, $77.7
million in England and $50.4 million in Italy.

   Bruce Babbitt closed the doors on his
presidential race in the same way that he campaigned _ with grace
and humor, and a pledge to continue to keep fighting for his vision
of America.
   The former Arizona governor stood before a roomful of
supporters, TV lights and reporters on Thursday to announce what
had become apparent since his dismal sixth-place showing in New
Hampshire on Tuesday: that he was ending the marathon he had
officially started on March 10.
   But there was hopeful news for the Babbitt faithful _ their
champion said he wasn't bowing out of the political arena
completely.
   Indeed, staffers at his New Hampshire campaign office were
answering the phone on Thursday with the words, ``Babbitt in '92.''
   Babbitt said he's making no plans for 1992, and hopes to be
supporting an incumbent Democratic president. Nonetheless, he
stated:
   ``I want to be a positive part of this process. I'm not leaving
_ it's too much fun, and I am too much an optimist, and too much an
American who believes in the process to walk away from it or to say
anything negative about the candidates.''
   With an endorsement of the campaign process, if not of any rival
candidate, Babbitt said he intends to continue speaking out and
``chiding'' the other candidates because ``there's room for
improvement'' in the field.
   Babbitt's departure was relaxed, upbeat and laughter-filled,
with no trace of bitterness that his long quest had ended so early
in the 1988 primary season.
   The tall, lanky 49-year-old, flanked by his wife Hattie and two
young sons, cracked jokes, often as not poking fun at himself and
the campaign that never caught fire. It was a Babbitt typical of
the man reporters covering him had grown to expect.
   Babbitt seemed to have general affection for the press corps,
which had bolstered his cash-poor campaign with a spate of positive
articles highlighting his frankness, his willingness to take
unpopular stands such as his call for a national sales tax, and his
quotable and colorful remarks.
   At one point, the favorable publicity before the Iowa caucuses ,
which never quite coincided with Babbitt's low poll standings, came
to be known as the ``Babbitt boomlet.''
   On Thursday, Babbitt kiddingly accused the media of a conspiracy
to discredit him with the public by ``making me into kind of a
house pet.''
   As he left the podium, Babbitt closed his news conference by
saying, ``Thank you very much, it's been an honor and a privilege.''
   Campaign manager Fred DuVal said one supporter remarked to him
afterward, ``That wasn't a press conference. That was an encounter
group.''
   In contrast to the rancorous withdrawals by past candidates who
blamed press scrutiny for their troubles, DuVal said that one line
that had been suggested to Babbitt to use as he exited the race
was, ``After this you won't have Bruce Babbitt to puff any more.''
   The line was a parody of Richard Nixon's 1962 remark that he was
leaving politics and the press wouldn't have him to ``kick around''
any more.
   Babbitt seemed genuinely reluctant to leave the final press
conference of his campaign, modestly stating that he had
monopolized a half hour of reporters' time but would take a couple
more questions, and then, ``I'll stay around for a while. ... As
vicious and unprincipled as you've been, I hate to let loose,'' he
joked.
   Later at a farewell luncheon for his staff, the mood was teary
and affectionate as loyalists recounted what the campaign had meant
to them.
   ``There's been tears ... equal doses of disappointment and
affection,'' said DuVal. ``Everybody feels as if they've just
tasted an extraordinary experience.''
   Even on the night of the New Hampshire debacle, Babbitt and his
supporters partied as if they were at a victory celebration, the
candidate and his wife dancing the twist until 1:30 a.m.
   They cheered every percentage point as a victory of sorts _ this
collection of salesmen, students, writers, politicians and lawyers
turned envelope stuffers, telephone operators and chauffeurs. And
they left convinced they had done the right thing.
   Babbitt compared traveling the debate circuit with his
Democratic rivals to going to summer camp ``when all of a sudden
you're living in the same cabin with a bunch of guys that you never
knew before.''
   But he said he would be happy to back any one of the Democrats
who gets the nomination.
   One of them, Sen. Paul Simon, on Thursday, said, ``Seeing Bruce
leave the campaign trail is like seeing an Army buddy ship out to
go home. He has contributed much to this campaign.''

   The biggest merger in New York legal history was
announced by one of the nation's oldest law firms, Lord, Day &
Lord, which plans to join with a slightly smaller New York City
firm.
   The merger announced Thursday with Barrett Smith Simon &
Armstrong will create a firm of 170 to 180 lawyers that will be
among the nation's 75 largest firms.
   Lord, Day & Lord, suffering from the recent defections of top
partners, will change its name for the first time since its
founding 140 years ago. It will be known starting March 31 as Lord
Day & Lord, Barrett Smith.
   The New York Times said Friday that the deal was prompted in
part by pressure from clients to match huge firms that offer larger
staffs capable of handling bigger deals, more complex lawsuits and
more diverse services.
   Both firms serve a number of prestigious clients in business and
the arts but have been hurt recently by the loss of top lawyers who
took leading clients with them, the Times said.

   Seeking to break an impasse in peace
talks, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo urged Contra rebels to accept
a 30-day truce in exchange for four major concessions from
Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   The Contras said they accepted ``in principle'' the proposal
forwarded Thursday night. The leftist Sandinistas called it
``interesting and constructive,'' but said it needed clarification.
   Obando y Bravo, leader of Nicaragua's Roman Catholics, is
mediating the talks, whihc were to resume today.
   The concessions requested of the Sandinistas are:
   _A ``full, general'' amnesty for the several thousand political
prisoners in Nicaraguan jails, including all members of the
National Guard of former dictator Gen. Anastasio Somoza, whom the
Sandinistas overthrew in 1979.
   _Full freedom of the press, which now is granted only to a few
communications outlets, including the opposition newspaper La
Prensa and Radio Catolica, the voice of the Catholic Church.
   _A promise to ``reconsider'' a mandatory military draft law,
which has sparked violent disturbances in several Nicaraguan cities
by young men and the mothers of draft-age youths. The most recent
disturbance was in Masaya only a week ago.
   _Renewal of a dialogue with the Sandinistas' internal political
opposition, which is calling along with the Contras for 17 changes
in Nicaragua's Constitution. The talks broke off last year.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, said
the cease-fire proposed by the cardinal was ``vague and
ill-defined'' and would have to be clarified before the government
could respond to the plan.
   ``The four requirements for the Nicaraguan government are very
clear and very well defined,'' Tinoco said. ``The requirement for
the Contras is not quite clear.''
   Tinoco said the cardinal did not define ``when the cease-fire is
going to happen, how long it is going to be, where it is going to
be'' or how it would be verified. ``We have to clarify what the
Contras are going to give in exchange,'' he said.
   Obando y Bravo said he offered the plan after the two sides were
unable to agree on the philosophy underlying a cease-fire.
   The Contras had argued that any truce must be preceded by
democratic reforms, while the Sandinistas contended hostilities
must end before real change can begin.
   ``We argued a long time,'' the cardinal said. ``We could not
come to agreement on the definitions.''
   The concessions requested by Obando y Bravo of the government
were among many the Contras have been demanding for some time.
   The rebels have also been seeking tri-partite talks among the
Sandinistas, their internal opposition and the Contras. The
cardinal did not forward that demand.
   Nor did the requested concessions specifically address other
Contra concerns, including constitutional changes that would
prevent a Nicaraguan president from succeeding himself, separate
the army from the Sandinista political party and establish a
tribunal to guarantee constitutional rights.
   Obando y Bravo said the inability of both sides to ``define a
cease-fire'' led to ``an impasse'' after just two hours of talks
Thursday, the opening day of their second round of face-to-face
peace negotiations.
   The first direct talks took place in San Jose, Costa Rica, in
late January, only a week before the U.S. House of Representatives
rejected President Reagan's request for $36.2 million in additional
Contra aid.
   The two sides presented their basic bargaining positions in the
San Jose talks, which all participants characterized as cordial but
lacking in progress.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras came to Guatemala City clearly
stating that they were still far apart on the question of which
should come first, a cease-fire or democratic reforms in Nicaragua.

   Lauren Bacall says Humphrey Bogart did not give
their marriage much chance after they wed when she was 20 years old.
   But the union produced a son and daughter and did not end until
Bogart's death 12 years after the marriage. That's longevity by
Hollywood standards. And Miss Bacall credits it to Bogart's
determination not to allow work to separate them.
   ``I never went on location to shoot a film,'' she said in an
interview in the current issue of Us magazine.
   ``The agreement before we got married was that I would not take
off and leave him behind. When he went on location I went with
him,'' the sultry-voiced actress said.
   Bogart, who was a quarter-century older than Miss Bacall when
they were married in 1945, once said he had ``figured I would leave
him in five years, because I didn't know anything about life and
the world at that point,'' said Miss Bacall.

   Director John Boorman says his movie ``Hope and
Glory,'' which received five Academy Award nominations, almost was
not finished because of financial problems.
   ``Hope and Glory'' won best picture and best director from the
Los Angeles Film Critics and 13 nominations Feb. 9 from the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts. Its Oscar nominations
announced Wednesday included best picture, direction and script.
   Boorman, 55, recalled the day in June 1986 when he found himself
$3 million short of the $9 million needed to finance the movie.
   ``I was going down to the set on a Friday morning at 7 o'clock
to give the men all their notices to stop the picture,'' he said in
a telephone interview from his Paris apartment.
   But both the money and a studio, Columbia, were eventually
found. The critics and word of mouth did the rest.

   Alan Alda, star of the ``M-A-S-H'' television
series, makes his debut this weekend in advertising for IBM, and
may team up with other cast members from the popular show already
pitching the company's computers.
   International Business Machines Corp. said Thursday that Alda,
who played wisecracking surgeon Hawkeye Pierce in ``M-A-S-H,''
signed a multiyear agreement earlier this month to appear in its
commercials.
   The company would not say how much Alda was being paid.
   The first ads featuring Alda will appear Saturday during
ABC-TV's Olympics broadcasts, IBM said, and will continue on
several programs through April.
   Alda will initially appear alone in the IBM ads. The company
eventually plans to work him into ads featuring other former
``M-A-S-H'' actors, said Dave McGovern, an advertising executive
for IBM.
   IBM launched advertising last April for a new family of personal
computers featuring seven former ``M-A-S-H'' cast members,
including Gary Burghoff, who played Radar O'Reilly; Harry Morgan,
who was Col. Sherman Potter; and Loretta Swit who played Hot Lips
Houlihan. In the ads, they played office co-workers.
   Conspicuously absent from the IBM group was Alda, who reportedly
was still under contract to another computer company, Atari Corp.

600,000 Kentucky arthritis sufferers.
   Miss Principal, who plays Pam Ewing on the CBS TV show, appeared
before Senate committees Thursday in her role as spokeswoman and
lobbyist for the National Arthritis Foundation.
   The Beverly Hills, Calif., actress was pushing for passage of a
Senate bill to make expensive anti-arthritis drugs available by
prescription to Medicaid patients without prior approval by the
state social services agency.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson made it academic, ordering a policy
change to do what the bill seeks.
   Miss Principal expressed gratitude, but insisted legislation was
still needed. ``Arthritis is a serious, staggering health problem
in our country, in this state and in your district. It's not just a
nuisance and it's not just a problem of old age,'' she said.

<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO has accused United Press
International of attempting to ``bust'' the union representing the
news service's writers, editors and photographers.
   The labor federation, in a statement issued by its executive
council on Thursday, condemned UPI's ``callous treatment of its
employees'' in declaring an impasse last October in negotiations on
a new contract and unilaterally imposing ``harsh new work rules.''
   ``Members of The Newspaper Guild ... are fighting to save their
union and their jobs from efforts by UPI's owner to bust the union
and shut down many of the news service's operations,'' the
36-member council of union presidents said.
   AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Thomas R. Donahue called the dispute
between the Guild's Wire Service Local 222 and UPI ``the latest
struggle in a decade of employee sacrifice to keep the financially
troubled news service afloat.''
   The labor federation said UPI employees have agreed to major
concessions including pay, pension and benefit cuts since 1978, and
stayed on the job despite bounced paychecks when the company sought
bankruptcy protection in 1985.
   Newspaper Guild President Charles Dale said the company's last
contract proposal would ``eliminate job security and allow UPI to
subcontract all bargaining unit work to itself for the sole purpose
of cutting wages again and the destruction of the union.''
   Dale said UPI has fired 112 employees and put no money into its
employee pension plan since Nov. 12.
   Chris Smith, a UPI spokesman at its headquarters in Washington,
said the company's last offer and imposed work rules include a 16
percent pay raise over the next two years for top-scale editorial
workers.
   Smith said 181 employees have left the company's payroll since
Oct. 1 but that 70 of them have been replaced.
   UPI has ``never made an expression to use its subcontracting
power to replace existing full-time news staff,'' Smith said. ``It
hasn't happened and we don't anticipate it happening.''

   The U.S. dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo Friday, while stock prices rallied for the seventh
consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 130.53 yen, up 0.53 yen from Thursday's
close of 130.00 yen. It had opened at 130.33 yen and traded in a
narrow range of 130.30-130.55 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 245.41-point winner Thursday, added another
98.05 points to close the week's trading at 24,773.41.
   ``There's absolutely nothing to move the market, no
market-motivating news, and the dollar is dead,'' said a trader
with a major commercial bank.
   The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said currency
trading was also dampened by a holiday in Hong Kong and the slow
start-up of trading in Singapore after a holiday.
   Japanese housing and retail shares posted gains along with
high-technology issues and those of importers.
   ``These sectors are moving the market as the country seems
determined to address the trade imbalance problem and expand
domestic demand,'' said Yoshio Ogawa of Nikko Securities.

<HEAD>Tobacco's Clout In Southern Politics May Be On The Wane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tobacco is still a titan in many of the 14
Southern and border states that will hold presidential primaries
March 8. But some say it's no longer political suicide in the
tobacco belt to talk about health risks of smoking or to voice
opposition to government subsidies of the industry.
   Testing that theory in recent weeks, two Southerners hoping for
strong presidential showings in the region _ Republican Pat
Robertson and Democrat Albert Gore Jr. _ have raised eyebrows with
statements about tobacco that might have doomed them in past
campaigns.
   In an article in Conservative Digest, Robertson proposed a
10-year phaseout of the domestic tobacco industry, which employs
710,000 people and generates $14.1 billion per year in wages and
benefits.
   Robertson called for federal assistance to cushion the blow for
farmers and cigarette manufacturers.
   Gore's statements were less provocative. During a mid-January
debate in Iowa, he said he opposed federal subsidies of tobacco and
supported federal anti-smoking programs targeted at young people.
   Rep. Charles Rose, a North Carolina Democrat who is chairman of
the House subcommittee on tobacco and peanuts, says the industry
still wields enormous clout.
   ``It's a very silent but powerful force in Southern politics,''
Rose said.
   But Jim Van Hecke, North Carolina Democratic chairman, said
growers were more outspoken in past decades because there was less
scientific evidence of the dangers of smoking. Also, the growth of
Southern cities and the arrival of workers and industries from
other areas have made the region's economy more diverse.
   It has become routine for presidential candidates venturing into
North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Georgia to face questions about their stands on the federal tobacco
program and the government's war on smoking. Few had openly defied
the tobacco industry until this year.
   Robertson's industry-phaseout plan was widely condemned in
tobacco circles.
   ``Ludicrous and asinine,'' said Joe King, a grower and president
of the 300-member South Carolina Tobacco Association.
   However, Earl Black, political science professor at the
University of South Carolina, said, ``Robertson's getting some
criticism but he's also getting some praise for having the courage
to take on an issue like this.''
   In Robertson's home state of Virginia, the impact has been hard
to gauge, said Steve Haner, executive director of the state's
Republican Legislative Caucus.
   ``You go down to southside Virginia where they grow the stuff
and it's fatal to talk like that,'' Haner said. But he also said
Robertson had ``a committed cadre of followers'' who would not
desert him because of his stand on tobacco.
   Robertson himself sounded unconcerned. ``I'm not about to lose
any votes on this,'' the former television evangelist said in
Columbia, S.C. ``I'm on the side of the angels on this one.''
   Gore, a U.S. senator from Tennessee, said he opposed subsidies
``in spite of the fact that there are 100,000 tobacco farmers in my
home state.'' The federal tobacco program is financed through fees
paid by the growers, not direct government payments.
   Many of this year's presidential hopefuls have tried to please
the tobacco industry as well as increasingly assertive non-smokers
by separating the health and economic issues.
   ``You can be against smoking cigarettes without being against
family farmers who grow tobacco,'' Jesse Jackson said recently.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis told an audience in Wilson,
N.C., that he had ``no problem'' with the existing tobacco program,
but he urged farmers to grow other crops as well.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is an enthusiastic supporter
of the tobacco program. ``It encourages an orderly market for
tobacco. We're going to have tobacco and tobacco products in
America and it's just a matter of where it's grown.''
   On the Republican side, Rep. Jack Kemp said he would continue
support programs for tobacco and other commodities where necessary
but preferred the free-market system.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says British Nuclear Arms Deter Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain must
retain nuclear weapons because without them Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev could threaten Western Europe.
   Soviet superiority in conventional and chemical weapons would
guarantee Gorbachev ``would get what he wanted,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said on commercial television's ``News at Ten'' Thursday night.
   Three hours earlier on another commercial television newscast,
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov said he did not
accept Mrs. Thatcher's view that British nuclear weapons were vital
to Western security.
   ``I don't accept this because we want to see the world
nuclear-free and we cannot see it nuclear-free if Britain is going
to keep her nuclear forces,'' he said.
   Gerasimov said although the United States and the Soviet Union
want to get rid of nuclear weapons, the British did not.
   ``We are believers, you are non-believers. You do not believe in
a nuclear-free world. So our task is to convert you to our faith,''
he said.
   Asked about this later, Mrs. Thatcher responded: ``I want a
war-free Europe. A nuclear-free Europe I do not believe would be a
war-free Europe.''
   She added, ``The nuclear weapon has kept the peace in Western
Europe for 40 years.
   ``Of course Mr. Gorbachev wants to get rid of nuclear weapons
out of Western Europe because he knows that if he does, the
enormous superiority he has got in men, in tanks, in aircraft, in
all conventional weapons, and the colossal superiority in chemical
weapons, would mean that if he got the nuclear weapon out of
Europe, we would never be able to deter an aggressor.''
   Mrs Thatcher said: ``He could almost threaten, and he would get
what he wanted. It's my job, as head of government, to see that no
one who wants to threaten Western Europe has any chance of
succeeding.
   ``The only way to do that is to see that we have a sure
defense.''
   She concluded: ``You are not sure because of your own virtue.
You are sure because the men, the materials, the weapons, including
the nuclear, are there.
   ``And if you make a mistake now it may not affect our
generation, but it may affect future generations because one
mistake will take 10 or 12 years to recover.''

   A couple and two of their children were
slain in their nightclothes with a hatchet Thursday, and the
couple's 16-year-old son was being sought for questioning,
authorities said.
   The bodies of Bernard Brom, his wife, Paullette, and children
Diane, 14, and Rick, 9 were found Thursday night at their home in
suburban Cascade Township, said Olmsted County Sheriff Charles Von
Wald.
   A bloody ax 2 to 3 feet long was found in the basement, Von Wald
said.
   The sheriff said a nationwide bulletin was issued for the Broms'
16-year-old son and the family van. The boy was at Lourdes High
School on Thursday morning but did not attend classes, the sheriff
said.
   Friends at the school said the boy had dyed his hair black,
shaved the sides of his head and spiked the hair in back, Von Wald
said. The youth also bought a wig and makeup.
   ``He indicated he was having some trouble with his parents,''
Von Wald said. ``One student said he was having trouble with his
dad because of a tape he had bought and he didn't want him
listening to it.
   Bernard and Rick Brom's bodies were found in their upstairs
bedrooms, and Paullette and Diane Brom's bodies were in an upstairs
hallway, the sheriff said. He said they were slain early in the
morning.
   The house is among four on a road in a quiet, well-to-do area of
Cascade Township.
   Von Wald said the sheriff's department received a call at about
5:30 p.m. from an unidentified school official about a possible
problem at the house.
   The family van had been missing but was found late Thursday, Von
Wald said. A car and another car's license plates were reported
stolen from the vicinity of the high school.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's 1989 budget would boost
America's space and science spending by 20 percent and proposes new
funds to put astronauts on Mars, probe particles smaller than the
atom and listen for voices from distant galaxies.
   The $13.1 billion general science request is an increase of $2.2
billion over this year and includes start-up funds for the
superconducting super collider in the Department of Energy and the
space station in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA also would get start-up money for a new machine to search
for radio signals from unknown sources in outer space _ an effort
to answer the ageless question of whether there is intelligent life
elsewhere in the universe.
   The spending plan, part of Reagan's $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989
budget proposal delivered to Congress on Thursday, calls for new
money for a National Science Foundation program to develop
scientists and engineers for America's future and to continue
fundamental research at colleges and universities.
   ``Our faith in science and technology has served us very well in
the past,'' said William R. Graham, the presidential science
adviser. ``We see this as the dawn (of this concept) and not the
end of it.''
   The budget calls for $400 million to start construction of the
super collider. The experimental device would be the world's most
powerful proton collider, capable of conducting research into
fundamental subatomic particles.
   Several states are competing for the $4 billion super collider,
but a final location has not been determined.
   The Department of Energy's science budget authority for 1989
would total $1.2 billion, a 49 percent increase over the 1988
level. Most of the increase would go to the collider.
   James Fletcher, the NASA administrator, told reporters that
Reagan's budget follows a policy that ``clearly commits the United
States to space leadership as a fundamental objective.''
   For the first time, he said, it also funds a national goal of
putting astronauts on other planets. About $100 million is planned
for the Pathfinder Project, an effort to develop the technologies
needed to send astronauts to Mars in the next century.
   The budget asks nearly $1 billion to start construction of the
space station, a permanent orbital base that NASA plans to have in
operation in the mid-1990s. NASA officials had hoped for a
presidential commitment of about $1.8 billion, but even the reduced
amount may run into resistance in Congress.
   ``I am not prepared to sacrifice important science projects,
including environmental Earth studies, to build a space hotel,''
said Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., the ranking Republican on the house
subcommittee for independent agencies.
   NASA's total budget outlay would increase by about 20 percent,
from $9.11 billion in 1988 to $10.97 billion in 1989.
   The funding would include the final expenses in recovering from
the Challenger accident and returning the space shuttle fleet to
orbit. Seven missions are planned for the shuttle in fiscal year
1989, with the resumption of flights planned for next August.
   Tucked into the budget is a modest $9 million to start building
an instrument that would be able to listen to thousands of
different radio frequencies at once. Fletcher said the instrument,
which is planned for operation by 1992, is part of a continuing
search for civilizations that may be sending signals from planets
far beyond the solar system.
   There also are funds for NASA's share of a joint project with
the Air Force to develop the spaceplane, a transport capable of
carrying cargo and passengers around the Earth at hypersonic speeds
by cruising in and out of space.
   The National Science Foundation, which endured heavy cuts in
Congress in its 1988 budget, would increase its 1989 outlay from
$1.65 billion to $1.80 billion, a boost of about 9 percent.
   Erich Bloch, the NSF director, said the president's budget would
include a program to establish 10 to 15 basic science research
centers over the next five years.
   Bloch said the NSF would put a much heavier emphasis than in the
past on programs to boost science and math education on the
``pre-college'' level, an effort to boost the number of students
attracted to the science and technical fields.

   Here are some highlights of President Reagan's
budget message to Congress.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   By reordering priorities so that we spend more on national
security and less on wasteful or unnecessary federal programs, we
have made freedom more secure around the world and have been able
to negotiate with our adversaries from a position of strength.
   By pursuing market-oriented economic policies, we have uncorked
the genie of American enterprise and created new businesses, more
jobs, improved production, and widespread prosperity.
   And we have done all this without neglecting the poor, the
elderly, the infirm, and the unfortunate among us.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This budget does not fully reflect my priorities, nor,
presumably, those of any particular member of Congress.
   But the goal of deficit reduction through spending reduction
must be paramount.
   Abandoning the deficit reduction compromise would threaten our
economic progress and burden future generations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I propose an increase of $656 million ... for discretionary
programs of the Department of Education. Although state and local
governments fund most educational activity, federal programs
provide crucial aid for the poor, the handicapped, and the
educationally disadvantaged.
   I have proposed reform of our overcentralized welfare system
through state experimentation with innovative alternatives....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ineffective programs to assist dislocated workers would be
replaced by an expanded $1 billion worker readjustment program
(WRAP) carefully designed to help those displaced from their jobs
move quickly into new careers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I propose a continued increase in federally supported basic
research aimed at longer-term improvements in the nation's
productivity and global competitiveness....
   I would provide $11.5 billion for space programs....
   I also recommend $363 million in 1989 to initiate construction
of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), including $283 million
for construction and $60 million for supporting research and
development....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I continue to urge enactment of an affordable self-financing
insurance program through Medicare to protect families from
economic devastation caused by catastrophic illness.
   To attack the scourge of AIDS, I propose $2 billion for
additional research, education, and treatment in 1989 _ a 38
percent increase over the 1988 level....
   Building upon the nation's pre-eminence in basic biomedical
research, I seek a 5.1 percent increase for non-AIDS research at
the National Institutes of Health.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For expanded law enforcement ... I propose $4.5 billion _ an
increase of 6 percent over 1988.
   For drug law enforcement, prevention, and treatment programs, I
propose $3.9 billion in 1989, a 13 percent increase over the 1988
level.
   To relieve prison overcrowding and adequately house a growing
inmate population, I would provide $437 million _ more than double
the $202 million devoted to federal prison construction in 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For the Federal Aviation Administration to continue its
multiyear program to modernize the nation's air traffic control
systems, I would provide $1.6 billion _ a 44 percent increase over
the level of 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   To carry out the joint recommendations of the U.S. and Canadian
special envoys on acid rain, I recommend total funding of $2.5
billion for innovative clean coal technology demonstration projects
over the period 1988 through 1992.
   I also recommend an expansion of hazardous waste cleanup
efforts, with an increase in Superfund outlays of some $430 million
in 1989.
   To continue filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at the
current rate of 50,000 barrels per day, I would provide $334
million in 1989. Contingent upon the enactment of legislation
authorizing the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserves (NPR), I would
provide an additional $477 million to bring the fill rate up to
100,000 barrels per day....
   To improve the speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand
information services provided to taxpayers, I would provide a $241
million increase for the Internal Revenue Service....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The proposals for national security contained in this budget
represent an essential minimum program for keeping America safe and
honoring our commitments to our friends and allies....
   ...My budget requests defense funding of $299.5 billion in
budget authority and $294 billion in outlays for 1989. It also
provides for about 2 percent real growth in these programs in
future years....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...I plan to continue pushing for the elimination of
artificially high (farm) price supports, thereby reducing the need
for export subsidies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The budget proposes certain reforms in the Medicare program ...
to limit payments for certain overpriced physician procedures,
limit payments for durable medical equipment and supplies, and
eliminate a loophole in the payment process for kidney dialysis. In
total, these reforms would reduce spending for Medicare by $1.2
billion from the level that would occur if current law were
continued.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The government often continues programs at the federal level
that are no longer needed. This is the case with rural housing
programs, the Economic Development Administration, urban mass
transit discretionary grants, urban development action grants,
sewage treatment, Small Business Administration direct loans,
housing development action grants, the housing rehabilitation loan
program, and economic development programs of the Tennessee Valley
Authority....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...My budget proposes termination of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, contingent upon enactment of legislation that completes
deregulation of the motor carrier industry.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...I am proposing the sale not only of the Naval Petroleum
Reserves, but also of the Alaska Power Administration, the federal
government's helium program, excess real property and a further $12
billion in loan portfolios. In addition, I have proposed
legislation to authorize a study of possible divestiture of the
Southeastern Power Administration, and plan to study possible
privatization of our uranium enrichment facilities, as well as ways
of making the U.S. Postal Service more efficient through greater
reliance on the private sector.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I am proposing the development of a private mediating
institution to reduce the backlog of cases before the U.S. Tax
Court.... I also encourage the complete privatization of wastewater
treatment plants, certain mass transit projects, the Department of
Agriculture's National Finance Center and the Rural Telephone Bank.
   ...Our administration plans to initiate privatization and
commercialization efforts involving federal prison industries,
relying on a private space facility for micro-gravity research
opportunities in the early 1990s, commercial cargo inspection,
military commissaries, Coast Guard buoy maintenance and the
management of undeveloped federal land. Moreover, my budget
proposes that the work associated with certain federal employment
positions be reviewed for the feasibility of contracting their
responsibilities....
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...I propose in this budget a new approach to paying federal
employees who increase their productivity. I ask the Congress to
modify the current system of virtually automatic ``within-grade''
pay increases for the roughly 40 percent of employees eligible each
year to one that is based on employee performance.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ...A constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget _
and a provision requiring a super-majority vote in the Congress to
increase taxes _ would impose some much-needed discipline on the
congressional budget process.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I will shortly transmit legislation that will require any future
legislation creating new federal programs to be
deficit-neutral...requiring the concurrent enactment of equal
amounts of program reductions or revenue increases....

<HEAD>For Pete du Pont, An Emotional Campaign Farewell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It had all the trappings of a campaign
rally. The only thing missing was a presidential candidate.
   On Thursday night _ hours after Delaware's former governor
announced he was dropping out of the race for the Republican
presidential nomination _ du Pont was greeting supporters at a high
school, thanking them for their help in fueling his longshot
campaign.
   The du Pont partisans, who had made nearly 400,000 telephone
calls for their candidate, who had sent out more than a million
pieces of mail, crowded around, cheering, sporting ``Pete 1992''
buttons.
   ``In America nobody promises you you're gonna win,'' du Pont
said as he announced his withdrawal. ``America only promises you're
gonna get your chance to try. She gave us our chance. We took it.
We used it. We did well with it. And of that I am enormously
proud.''
   At the rally, du Pont, never letting go of wife Elise's hand,
tried to greet everyone, to shake every hand on his way to the
stage.
   Ironically, the campaign folded in part because of money. It's
ironic because the du Pont name is synonymous with big bucks.
   He is the great-grandson of the founder of the Du Pont Co.; his
wife is a descendant of Benjamin Franklin and an heiress to a dairy
fortune.
   Du Pont and top aides decided there was not enough time to raise
the millions needed for a respectable campaign leading up to Super
Tuesday on March 8. The campaign ended, however, with no debt and
$350,000 on hand.
   The couple's daughter Elise was there for Thursday night's
farewell, as were sons Pierre and Benjamin Franklin. Eleuthere,
known as ``There,'' was ``back at college doing what he ought to be
doing _ getting his college degree,'' du Pont said.
   Du Pont, who was heading to Iowa and then New Hampshire next
week to thank supporters, first wanted to thank those who have
supported him through a stint in the state legislature, three terms
as Delaware's lone congressman, and the maximum two terms as
governor.
   The 53-year-old du Pont announced his candidacy Sept. 16, 1986 _
17 months before the New Hampshire primary. He was the first
Republican in the field. He said then if he did not do well in Iowa
and New Hampshire, he would pull out of the race.
   He was fifth in a field of six GOP candidates in the Iowa
caucuses. He was fourth out of five in the New Hampshire primary.
   The two contests marked the first electoral losses in his
political career.
   The Harvard Law School graduate is convinced, however, that his
campaign made a difference.
   ``In those 17 months we contributed something here. We changed
the agenda. We put forward a set of proposals that made a
difference,'' he said.
   Du Pont garnered attention, if not widespread support, with his
provocative approach to certain issues such as mandatory drug
testing in high schools, a workfare program to replace welfare, and
a private alternative to Social Security.
   He talked about what might have been.
   According to du Pont, tracking polls showed he was solidly ahead
of Jack Kemp the Friday before Tuesday's primary.
   ``If that election had been held on Friday we'd be in South
Carolina tonight,'' he said to the cheering crowd.
   Du Pont talked about the future, particularly the Republican
National Convention this summer in New Orleans.
   ``We didn't get quite as many votes as we needed, but we did
what was right for the country. And now our job is to keep talking
for those things that are right for the country and make sure that
those other candidates adopt our ideas. Make sure they get into the
Republican platform,'' he said.
   Du Pont affectionately scolded his supporters, telling them not
to be unhappy about the end of his candidacy.
   ``Some of you are sad and you're not allowed to be sad because
this is not a sad occasion. This is a celebration of a campaign for
the presidency of the United States,'' he said. ``It was run the
way campaigns ought to be run. On principles, on issues.''
   ``You're not allowed to be sad but you're allowed to say we
fought the good fight. We nearly won it,'' he said.
   ``You were part of a little moment in history,'' he told them,
``that will live in my heart for a long while.''

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush won a
presidential straw poll of Nevada Republicans, but his tally was
nearly equaled by undecided votes _ many of which were believed to
have been cast by supporters of Pat Robertson in a bid to control
later balloting.
   With only a tiny fraction of returns still unreported from
caucuses around the state Thursday night, Bush had 1,341 votes in
the non-binding straw poll, and undecided votes totaled 1,146.
   Steve Wark, Robertson coordinator in Nevada, said many Robertson
voters cast undecided ballots as part of a strategy to win in later
voting for delegates to the upcoming county conventions.
   ``They did that to protect their (convention) delegates,'' said
state GOP Chairwoman Sally Vitkus-McKinney. ``That's politics.''
   ``We knew that the Dole and Bush people would get together to
try and squash us if we came out strong in the straw poll,'' Wark
said. Even so, Robertson, a former television evangelist, had 733
votes outright.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole had 1,130 votes, officially finishing ahead
of Robertson but lagging behind the undecided tally. Rep. Jack Kemp
had 644 votes.
   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, who dropped out of the GOP
race on Thursday, got 39 votes and former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig, who called it quits last week, got six votes.
   The caucuses were open only to registered Nevada Republicans,
and the straw poll was conducted by secret ballot.
   The caucuses drew several thousand of the more than 120,000
Republicans registered to vote in Nevada. The registration total
has gone up several thousand since Jan. 1, but exact numbers
weren't available.
   Ms. Vitkus-McKinney said the increase was due both to state GOP
registration efforts and to separate efforts by the Robertson camp.
   Whether the Robertson strategy in the straw poll worked remains
to be seen. The makeup of the delegations to the county conventions
won't be known for several more days and even then delegates won't
have to publicly declare their presidential preferences.
   The straw poll was developed last summer, before former Nevada
Sen. Paul Laxalt announced in September that he wouldn't seek the
GOP presidential nomination. He would have been the probable Nevada
poll winner had he stayed in the running, Ms. Vitkus-McKinney said.

   A television station that pre-empted two
minutes of ``Jeopardy'' to report on a plane crash later broadcast
the missing game-show footage during its news programs after
viewers complained, station officials said.
   ``Viewers missed less than two minutes of `Jeopardy.' But those
were the final minutes, and so we replayed them,'' said WXFL-TV
general manager Jim Saunders.
   Two people were killed Tuesday when a twin-engine plane slammed
into a house in Dunedin.
   On Wednesday, WXFL broadcast the end of ``Jeopardy'' twice, once
during the station's noon and 6 p.m. news shows.
   Saunders said he did not know how many complaint calls were
received Tuesday, but a source at the station told the Tampa

   Most Americans don't know the recommended blood
cholesterol levels, but do have a general knowledge of what
cholesterol is, according to a Louis Harris poll sponsored by the
maker of a cholesterol-lowering drug.
   Seventy-nine percent of those asked didn't know the recommended
cholesterol levels, according to the survey sponsored by Bristol
Laboratories, makers of the cholesterol-lowering drug Questran.
   However, most had general knowledge of cholesterol, the survey
showed. Eighty-three percent identified it as a fatty substance,
and 96 percent said they knew that eating fatty foods can elevate
cholesterol levels.
   Cholesterol has been linked to heart disease.
   The survey was based on telephone interviews with 1,438
Americans over age 18 conducted between Dec. 22, 1987 and Jan. 14,
1988.

   Stock prices rallied for the seventh consecutive
day in active trading in Tokyo today, while the U.S. dollar climbed
slightly.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected shares, a 245.41-point winner Thursday, added another
98.05 points or 0.4 percent and closed the week's trading at
24,773.41.
   ``Share prices rose almost across the board. We expect the stock
average to top the 25,000-level pretty soon,'' said Hiromi Yoneyama
of Wako Securities.
   He said institutional investors were especially active in areas
such as steel and shipbuilding. Volume of the first-section trade
reached the 1 billion-share mark for the first time in six weeks,
up from 750 million shares Thursday.
   Electrical issues scored strong gains, while automobiles and
steel also rose.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed the
week's trading at 130.53 yen, up 0.53 yen from Thursday's close of
130.00. It had opened at 130.33 yen and traded in a narrow range of
130.30-130.55 yen.
   Ken Iio of the Bank of Tokyo said trading was quiet ahead of the
weekend with no major news affecting dealing today.
   The influential Hong Kong and Singapore markets, which were
closed part of this week due to the Chinese New Year's holiday,
also made the dealing sluggish, he said. The volume of trade was a
moderate $2.296 billion.

   Stroke victims confined to wheelchairs for many
years after their attacks can be taught to walk or climb stairs
again, according to a new study by researchers who say therapists
shouldn't give up.
   Some patients who took part in a rehabilitation program were
able to make improvements 40 years after their strokes, a doctor
said.
   ``This is a group that generally doesn't get rehabilitated,''
said Dr. Paul Bach-y-Rita. ``They are almost totally forgotten. And
we show they can make significant recovery with the right program.''
   Bach-y-Rita, a physician at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, presented his findings on about 200 patients Thursday at
an American Heart Association meeting on strokes.
   In a separate report, Dr. James N. Davis of Duke University said
drugs may help speed up recovery in the days immediately after a
stroke.
   Strokes occur when the flow of the blood to the brain is
disrupted. Often an artery is clogged by a blood clot, starving
some of the brain of oxygen carried by blood. Other strokes occur
when a blood vessel bursts, flooding the brain with blood.
   About 500,000 Americans suffered strokes in 1985, the last year
for which statistics are available, and 152,700 of them died.
   More than a third of all stroke victims die within a month of
their attacks. About a third of the survivors need help caring for
themselves, often because one side of their bodies is partially
paralyzed.
   The latest research is part of a growing interest among
specialists in helping the brain shift important functions, such as
control of movement, from the damaged part of the brain to
undamaged regions.
   These experts have found that over time, even injured brain
cells can sprout new branches and connections that help repair
damage.
   The program developed by Bach-y-Rita and a colleague, Dr.
Richard Balliet, sets small goals for longtime stroke victims, such
as learning to move a finger or twist a wrist through exercise.
   ``As a patient recovers even small amounts initially and knows
that recovery is possible, that patient will work very hard, even
without a therapist there, to get to the next grade of recovery,''
he said. ``Over a period of time, it adds up to significant
functional improvement.''
   Patients visit the rehabilitation clinic for a week at a time
every two or three months, he said. The rest of the time they work
at home, usually with relatives' help.
   Bach-y-Rita said some patients who were confined to wheelchairs
for many years learned to walk and climb stairs again. Others have
become able to employ a useless hand or arm for such chores as
eating and supporting themselves.
   ``You dangle in front of us who deal with people with stroke the
exciting possiblity that something can be done to treat these
people to restore their independence,'' said Dr. Fletcher H.
McDowell of Cornell Medical College. ``If you are right at all, we
all ought to be doing it.''
   Bach-y-Rita said, ``Pick out a few of your patients who are five
or 10 years post-stroke and convince yourself how you can obtain
function. If you pick realistic goals in a few patients, I think
you are going to get so excited, you won't stop.''
   He cautioned, however, that patients must have good mental
function and a will to work and improve.
   Davis said he has preliminary evidence that amphetamines, given
soon after a stroke, appear to speed some people's recovery
significantly.
   ``I'm not trying to argue that it will work in all patients,''
he said. ``But there are some patients in whom you can facilitate
rehabilitation with drugs.''

   Vice President George Bush is proposing a program
of spending restraint that would balance the budget by 1993, while
claiming that Sen. Bob Dole's plan ``sounds easy, but it isn't
decisive.''
   On the same day that President Reagan sent a $1.1 trillion
budget to Congress, Bush also claimed that Dole's fiscal policy
would ``cut into Social Security and COLAs and reduce the checks
for our senior citizens.''
   Bush elaborated on his budget proposal while predicting he would
score the most impressive victories in the Super Tuesday series of
Republican Party primaries and caucuses in the South and border
states.
   He also said he will honor his commitment to take part in
tonight's GOP candidate debate here, despite Dole's withdrawal,
because ``we're committed.''
   During a heavy day of campaigning here and in Missouri, Bush
also said he didn't want to get into ``name-calling'' battles with
Dole, his closest competitor for the party's presidential
nomination.
   Bush, in fact, did not name Dole when he told an audience in
Joplin, Mo. that ``one candidate'' is supporting a budget freeze
proposal that would provide only a 2 percent window of flexibility
on additional spending.
   ``It sounds easy, but it isn't decisive,'' Bush said. ``It's
ducking decisions about where you cut and where you add.'' He said
Dole's ``across-the-board'' freeze would ``freeze in some
outrageous waste'' in spending programs.
   The vice president said he is best suited to carry on Reagan's
economic and foreign policy legacy, and asked voters help him
follow up the New Hampshire victory with a strong showing on March
8.
   While Bush continued his grass-roots style of campaigning,
making an unscheduled stop at a truck stop in rural Missouri, his
chief spokesman, Pete Teeley, said the vice president's campaign
aides feel Bush is well positioned to make a strong showing in the
next series of primaries.
   Bush sought to capitalize on Reagan's relative popularity in the
South and border states, saying ``the president and I'' have
brought economic prosperity to the country. Bush did say, however,
that some areas of the country missed out on the benefits of the
recovery from the 1981-82 recession, and said he planned to do
something about that if elected.
   On his bitter battle with Dole, Bush said he did not want to get
into any direct confrontations with the Kansas Republican.
   ``I don't respond to Bob Dole. I'm trying to stay on the
issues.''
   Asked in a local television interview whether he would continue
to run negative commercials against Dole, Bush replied, ``He (Dole)
called them comparative ads when they were all about me.''
   Asked if he would support Dole if the Kansan won the nomination,
Bush said,``I'd vote for him over any Democrat and I expect he'd
vote for me over any Democrat.''
   Bush said ``the next focused event, with the entire nation's
focus, will be South Carolina'' which holds its presidential
primary on Tuesday. And Teeley said that Bush will not try to
compete in Minnesota, which also holds its presidential contest
next week.
   Addressing a large crowd in the atrium of the Loews Anatole
Hotel here, Bush said ``there is no way you can become president of
the United States by not doing well, if not winning, on Super
Tuesday. I intend to win.''
   Bush would seek to bring about a balanced budget by fiscal 1993
by limiting the growth in expenditures to a growth in U.S. Treasury
receipts ranging from 5 percent to 8 percent, and a 4 percent
annual rate of inflation.
   ``The question is, who is best qualified to get this deficit
down,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gore Takes Offensive In Democratic Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Albert Gore Jr., hoping to set himself
apart from his rivals, accused Richard Gephart of flip-flopping on
issues and Michael Dukakis of foreign policy inexperience in a
combative debate Gore said signals the ``beginning of the main
event'' in their presidential race.
   Gephardt and Dukakis, who are battling the Tennessee senator in
the delegate-rich primaries across the South less than three weeks
away, came under attack almost immediately Thursday night and
countered in a series of testy exchanges.
   ``It's quite natural he would launch an attack,'' Gephardt, the
Missouri congressman, said afterward. ``He probably thinks I'm
ahead in the South and he's got to jump start his campaign to have
a chance.''
   With Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart included, the five candidates
debated for two hours in a televised session with a heavy focus on
the South _ the major battleground of both parties' nomination
fights before the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries. One candidate,
Paul Simon, bypassed the event to concentrate on Minnesota and
South Dakota, which have earlier contests.
   A similar debate was scheduled tonight for the four remaining
Republican candidates.
   But it was placed in jeopardy when Bob Dole withdrew Thursday
saying he feared it would become a pep rally for Vice President
George Bush, and Pat Robertson followed suit. That left only Jack
Kemp to debate Bush, and sponsors said they hoped it would still go
on _ with empty chairs on the stage for the absent contenders.
   The Democratic debate contained what were some of the most
pointed exchanges among the candidates, most of whom have met each
other in more than 20 debates over the past year.
   Gore came out swinging immediately, using the first question to
charge that Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, was without
foreign policy experience and had said in a recent televised
interview that he was willing to tolerate a ``Soviet client state''
in Nicaragua.
   ``I'm not going to sit here and listen to that,'' Dukakis shot
back, denying he said or believed such a statement. ``If you're
going to be president of the United States you better be accurate.''
   Gore turned to Gephardt moments later, saying his calls for
tough trade policies would invite a trade war and cost American
jobs. But it was his accusations that the Missouri congressman had
shifted positions on a range of issues from Reaganomics to abortion
that drew a sharp rebuttal.
   ``When you make a lecture on consistency, maybe you better take
a look at your own record first,'' Gephardt said.
   In a reference to the recently withdrawn GOP candidate, he
added, ``Lately you've been sounding more like Al Haig than Al
Gore.'' Gore responded: ``That line sounds more like Richard Nixon
than Richard Gephardt.''
   Gore clearly came into the debate eager to use it as an
opportunity to battle the two contenders he views as his chief
opponents, while leaving Hart and Jackson relatively untouched.
   Gore defended his strategy in talking with reporters later,
saying consistency ``is a legitimate issue'' and the race had now
moved into his territory.
   Dukakis and Gephardt are the two winners so far in the 1988
Democratic nomination race, Dukakis winning in New Hampshire
earlier this week and Gephardt winning Iowa's caucuses the week
before.
   Turning to Gephardt, Gore served warning, saying, ``I'm going to
lay it on the line now Dick,'' and then accused him of voting in
Congress against increases in the minimum wage, against a
Department of Education and for tuition tax credits. In each case,
he said, Gephardt has taken different positions now.
   ``You voted for Reaganomics; now you say, well, where are you
this week on Reaganomics?'' Gore said.
   Gephardt has acknowledged changing positions on some key issues,
saying time and circumstances have changed. Meeting with reporters
after the debate, he said: ``All of us in public life should try to
re-examine issues. That's what I've tried to do.''
   Dukakis and Gephardt tangled amongst themselves some too.
Dukakis said the Democratic rivals were surprised Gephardt had said
in New Hampshire he was proud to have voted for President Reagan's
tax-cut bill ``when he'd said all over Iowa he was against it and
only voted for it as a last resort.''
   The sharp exchanges left Hart and Jackson out of the spotlight
much of the time. Hart at one point said he was not withdrawing
from the presidential race despite critics who said he should.
   Hart said that with Bruce Babbitt's withdrawal from the race,
Hart was the only candidate left who had laid out his plans for a
federal budget. ``Men, when are you going to produce your
budgets?'' he asked.
   Jackson, who has a strong following among black voters in the
South and leads in polls of some Southern states, drew one of the
loudest rounds of applause when he said the United States is making
products that consumers don't want.
   At another point, stressing the need for government to help poor
children and welfare mothers, Jackson said he was ``a graduate'' of
the nation's underclass.

   Americans will spend nearly $13 billion this
year treating and caring for victims of strokes, the nation's
third-leading cause of death, according to new statistics.
   Stroke remains an extremely expensive disease, even though the
stroke death rate has fallen sharply in recent years.
   Stroke victims are often left paralyzed or disabled. The
American Heart Association, which released the latest figures
Thursday, noted that about a third of all stroke survivors need
help caring for themselves.
   Strokes are exceeded only by heart disease and cancer as a cause
of death in the United States.
   In 1985, the last year for which statistics are available, about
500,000 Americas suffered strokes, and 152,700 of them died.
   However, notes Dr. Philip A. Wolf of Boston University Medical
School, ``The death rate is falling very dramatically.''
   For the past four decades, the death rate from stroke has been
dropping by about 1 percent a year. But since 1973, that decline
has averaged 5.7 percent a year.
   No one knows precisely why stroke deaths are becoming less
common. However, the risk of heart attacks is also going down, and
many experts believe the same factors are involved in curbing both
diseases.
   ``A lot of people think the control of blood pressure, changes
in lifestyles, changes in diet, more exercise and more health
consciousness are affecting vascular (blood vessel) disease in
general,'' said Dr. Louis R. Caplan of Tufts Medical School in
Boston, who is chairman of the heart association's stroke council.
   Wolf, who also is an epidemiologist at the long-running
Framingham Heart Study, said that control of blood pressure appears
to be the single most important of these factors.
   He said that when even mildly elevated blood pressure is brought
down through drugs and behavior changes, the risk of stroke is cut
in half.
   This year, the heart association estimates that $9.2 billion
will be spent on hospital and nursing home care alone for stroke
victims, who often are left partially paralyzed. When doctor and
nurse bills, medicine and lost productivity are added, the total
annual cost of strokes in 1988 will be an estimated $12.9 billion.
   A stroke occurs when the blood supply in the brain is disrupted.
Often a blood clot chokes off an artery, starving brain cells of
oxygen. Strokes also occur when blood vessels burst and flood brain
tissue with blood.
   Traditionally, doctors have been able to do little for patients
except send them to hospitals, where they are taught to live with
their disabilities. However, Caplan said, that is beginning to
change.
   ``A lot of us are hoping that new technology, used in patients
who are diagnosed correctly, may do a lot to help patients get
better,'' he said in an interview.
   Caplan said new diagnostic machines are becoming available that
can help doctors pinpoint precisely where inside the head the blood
vessels are in danger of clogging or breaking. Then strokes may be
prevented with surgery or treatment.
   Doctors also are experimenting with drugs that may minimize the
damage of strokes once they occur.
   ``Most people have treated stroke casually,'' said Caplan.
``They say there's nothing you can do but rehabilitate the patient.
The excitement is that we are starting to have the technology and
ability to do something.''

   Amtrack said delays were likely on its
passenger trains running from New York to Richmond, Va., and other
points south until crews could clear tracks of derailed cars from a
78-car freight train.
   Twelve cars from the train jumped the tracks Thursday evening,
forcing the evacuation of two office buildings and five homes but
causing no injuries, authorities said. Amtrak uses the same track.
   Lt. Michael Reilly of the Fairfax County Fire Department said
the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac train, traveling from
Richmond to Alexandria, derailed around 7:10 p.m. Some of the cars
careened into seven empty freight cars parked on adjacent tracks.
   Ten of the cars contained industrial equipment, while two tank
cars were carrying soybean oil, Reilly said.
   Two office buildings located about a mile from the crash scene
and five nearby homes were evacuated as a safety precaution, Reilly
said.
   The 19 people forced from homes and offices were allowed to
return around 9 p.m., after officials confirmed the derailed cars
contained no hazardous materials.
   Passengers planning to travel on Amtrak between Richmond and New
York were to be bused between Richmond and Washington, D.C., where
they could continue north on Amtrak, said Marci Larson, operations
manager for Amtrak. In addition, Larson said, trains traveling from
New York to Florida and Georgia would be rerouted to Southern
Railway tracks between Washington and Richmond.

proposed budget for fiscal year 1989 that President Reagan
submitted to Congress:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OVERALL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Spending is projected at $1.09 trillion, up from $1.05 trillion
in 1988.
   _Receipts are estimated at $964.7 billion, $55.5 billion more
than in 1988. Income taxes provide 55 percent of receipts, followed
by 36.8 percent from social insurance taxes.
   _The budget would reduce the federal deficit from an estimated
$146.7 billion in 1988 to $129.5 billion in the fiscal year that
begins next Oct. 1. That's below the target of $136 billion called
for in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.

   _Military spending would be $294 billion, up from $285.4 billion
in 1988, but the smallest military spending increase Reagan has
ever sent to Congress. The 3 percent increase is less than needed
to keep pace with inflation, projected at 4.3 percent this year.
   _The plan calls for nearly $2 billion in spending authority to
combat Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, a 38 percent increase
over 1988 levels.
   _Education spending would rise 8 percent, or $1.5 billion. The
biggest gain would be in the Pell grant program for needy college
students.
   _About $10.9 billion is included for space programs, with almost
$1 billion of that going to the start of construction of a manned
space station and another $1 billion for the space shuttle.
   _About $363 million for the start of construction of the
superconducting super collider, a machine designed to study the
nature of matter.
   _About $1.6 billion is earmarked for upgrading the nation's air
traffic control system.

   The American Cancer Society has broken ground for
a new headquarters next to Emory University and across the street
from the headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   ``I'm hopeful that this headquarters will be successful,'' Gov.
Joe Frank Harris said at groundbreaking ceremonies Thursday.
   Harris said he would like to see the new building ``phased out
of existence (someday) ... because a total cure for cancer has been
found and announced here.''
   The Cancer Society has had its headquarters in New York City the
last 75 years. It hopes to move next January to the $12 million,
six-floor building. The society estimated that 125 or more of its
300-person staff will make the move south.
   ``We are now moving at top speed into the future, toward
advancements that would have seemed like science-fiction fantasies
a few years ago,'' said Dr. Harmon J. Eyre, a Salt Lake City
oncologist and president of the Cancer Society. ``Amazing and
wonderful things will happen at this place.''
   The Cancer Society, the world's largest volunteer health agency,
said it wanted to escape high operating costs in New York.
   Emory sold the four-acre site to the society for $1 million. The
college had purchased the tract, worth $2.5 million, with
assistance from a foundation, and wanted to add the society's
headquarters to a growing cluster of health and science centers
near its campus.

<HEAD>Douglas Edwards, Original Evening News Anchorman, Retires From CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Douglas Edwards, Walter Cronkite's predecessor
and the nation's first nightly television news anchor, is retiring
April 1 after 46 years with CBS.
   Edwards, who covered World War II on radio with the legendary
Edward R. Murrow, says he's ``a little sad, but exhilirated'' about
retirement.
   ``I've had a daily TV news report without a break since April
15, 1948, which is a record, almost 40 years now,'' Edwards said
Thursday. He laughed and added: ``That and a dollar will get you a
ride on the subway.''
   ``He's been solid and accurate and straightforward and reliable
through the years,'' said Mike Wallace, who worked with Edwards on
radio nearly 50 years ago, before the two met again at CBS. ``He
has not been flashy, and he has not been sensational, he's been
solid.''
   In 1948, then-CBS President Frank Stanton tapped Edwards to
anchor ``Doug Edwards and the News.'' After 14 years in the job, he
was succeeded by Cronkite on the ``CBS Evening News.''
   Edwards, 70, still does the network newsbreaks and a weekly
show, ``For Our Times,'' as well as regular radio broadcasts.
   ``Doug Edwards has been a friend and a mentor since before I
joined CBS News,'' said Dan Rather, only the third TV news anchor
in the network's history. ``He's a giant in our craft, and all of
us in television and radio news are indebted to him.''
   ``His name has been synonymous with CBS News since the dawn of
television,'' said CBS News President Howard Stringer. ``Doug will
be sorely missed, his accomplishments long treasured.''
   Edwards already had 10 years of broadcast experience when he
joined CBS Radio in 1942 at age 25. He joined Murrow's staff in
London in the final months of World War II. Afterwards, he became
Paris bureau chief. A interview on the local New York CBS station
about his foreign coverage impressed CBS executives.
   ``They seemed to like the way I conducted myself in front of the
camera, and they asked me afterwards if I'd like to do some
television news,'' Edwards said. He started by doing the Thursday
and Saturday news shows.
   He was tapped for the news show after his participation with
Murrow and Quincy Howe in CBS' acclaimed radio coverage of the 1948
presidential conventions.
   ``We did very well, the three of us on those conventions,''
Edwards recalled. ``Afterward, CBS asked me to go into television,
and I did it with some fear and trepidation and trembling, not
because I was nervous about being on television, I had done quite a
bit of it, but radio was the power, and I was pretty young at the
time.''
   In the beginning, the CBS network consisted of a half-dozen

   NBC had ``Camel News Caravan'' with John Cameron Swayze in 1949.
ABC launched a nightly news show in 1951 anchored by John Daly, a
former CBS correspondent.
   Edwards began his broadcasting career at the tender age of 15 on
a radio station in Troy, Ala.
   After high school, he landed a job with radio station WXYZ in
Detroit, home of such popular radio serials as ``The Lone Ranger''
and ``The Green Hornet.'' He worked with another up-and-coming
newsman, Mike Wallace.
   ``We were both Cunningham News Aces back in 1940-41,'' Wallace
recalled in a telephone interview from Atlanta, where he was
working on a segment for CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' ``Then he left to go
to WSB in Atlanta, where I am at this moment.
   ``Cunningham was a drug chain, and they used to sponsor
newscasts, and they used to have the sound of a P-38 (fighter
plane) or whatever zooming and, `The Cunningham News Aces are on
the air!' _ Doug and me.''
   Edwards said he and his wife, May, plan to move to Sarasota,
Fla., where he will continue lecturing on broadcast journalism and
begin work on an autobiography.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Considers Blocking Abortion Counseling Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge is considering whether to issue an
injunction blocking proposed regulations that would prohibit some
4,000 federally funded family planning clinics nationwide from
offering abortion counseling services.
   ``If I were to grant an injunction, why should I not enjoin
(Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen) from enforcing
these regulations anywhere in this country?'' U.S. District Judge
Walter Skinner said at the end of a two-hour hearing Thursday.
   The HHS regulations, which take effect March 3, are being
contested in U.S. District courts in Colorado, New York and
Massachusetts.
   A federal judge in Denver this week granted a preliminary
injunction in the suit filed there, but the ruling apparently will
only temporarily block the regulations from affecting clinics in
Colorado and Utah.
   Skinner, however, told attorneys Thursday that he believed a
single federal district court could hold ``national jurisdiction''
and issue one broad opinion that could end ``this business of
raising the same issue in 92 districts.''
   The judge gave no indication when he would release his decision
on the injunction sought by the state of Massachusetts, the
National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and 13
other local and national family planning groups.
   But attorneys speculated Skinner would rule soon since an
injunction request was scheduled to be argued late today in New
York.
   Unlike the Denver judge, who partially based her ruling on the
regulations' impact on physicians' relationships to their patients,
Skinner said, ``Medical ethics is not my problem.''
   He said the issue was whether the regulations were
constitutional.
   Congressional intent in establishing the Family Planning Program
under Title X of the Public Health Service Act in 1970 was at the
heart of Thursday's arguments.
   Skinner said, ``Nothing is clear when it comes to congressional
intent.''
   Thomas Millet, a Justice Department attorney representing the
Health and Human Services agency, contended that the law bans the
use of federal funds in ``programs where abortion is a method of
family planning.''
   Assistant Massachusetts Attorney General Paul Glickman and James
Feldesman, attorney for the family planning association, argued
that Congress was fully aware abortion counseling was being
provided through Title X programs through eight budgetary
reauthorizations over the years.
   ``Administrative agencies can't change (law) by fiat,'' Glickman
argued, contending HHS did that when it proposed the regulations
after Reagan administration attempts to change Title X through
congressional action failed.
   While federal law already prohibits spending federal funds on
abortion, the new rules say federally funded family planning
programs may not provide abortion counseling, may not refer women
to abortion providers and may not engage in lobbying or legal
action to increase availability of abortion.
   In addition, the new guidelines would require any clinics now
providing those abortion services to separate them entirely from
their federally supported operations by April.
   The Title X budget for fiscal 1988 is $137 million, down from
$142 million in fiscal 1987. An estimated 5 million poor women
receive services from the program.

   Kansas Republicans gather at five sites
Saturday to elect 15 delegates to the party's national convention
and recommend five more for ratification at the state convention in
Topeka on March 5.
   All 20 people elected Saturday will be committed to Sen. Bob
Dole in his bid for the GOP presidential nomination, which will be
decided at the national convention in New Orleans in August.
   Dole's supporters overwhelmingly control all five congressional
district conventions and the state convention, thanks to his
near-sweep of local delegates elected at county caucuses Feb. 1-7.
   Only Pat Robertson claimed any delegates among the other GOP
contenders in the county caucuses, and he won just six out of 1,249
elected at the local level. Nobody else can vote at the district

   Former Democratic Gov. Harvey Wollman
is endorsing presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt, saying the
Missouri congressman is ``one candidate running who can add and

   Wollman told about 100 people at the Bergeland Center for

   Wednesday, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., endorsed Gephardt.
   Wollman said he supports Gephardt because the congressman is
from rural America and has the common sense and knowledge to
straighten out problems in the United States. Wollman served as
governor in 1978, lieutenant governor from 1974-1978 and now farms

   Testimony by the FTC before the House Energy and Commerce

   President Reagan called to console the
family of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, stung by the double
blow of Higgins' abduction in Lebanon and the death of his father a
day later.
   ``The President telephoned the colonel's wife this afternoon and
offered all the support he knew how to give her ... I think it
helped her tremendously,'' Harold Fisher, Higgins' brother-in-law,
said Thursday.
   Fisher, noting that eight other Americans are being held in
Lebanon, said, ``one of the hardest parts is seeing how they are
held captive, with no resolution in sight. Being the ninth, you
just don't know.''
   The family learned of Higgins' kidnapping by Islamic
revolutionaries Wednesday when they telephoned his wife, Marine
Maj. Robin Higgins, who works in the Pentagon's public affairs
office, with news of the elder Higgins' imminent death.
   William F. Higgins, 72, died from cardiopulmonary arrest and
kidney failure Thursday morning without knowing of his son's
ordeal. The last time father and son saw each other was in
September 1987, when Higgins came home on emergency leave from the
Middle East.
   ``He never knew that his son had been taken captive. It was a
blessing that he didn't know,'' Fisher told a news conference.
Fisher is married to Higgins' sister, Mary, who did not attend the
news conference.
   Fisher said the family was doing well, considering the ordeal.
   ``It's difficult to accept the death of a father and then at the
same time something that's so unknown as what's really taking
place'' with the lieutenant colonel.
   Fisher said the family was happy that Higgins had chosen to
serve his country as a United Nations observer. ``We have
confidence that our government will do what is best and necessary
for our country and for his safety,'' he said.
   Higgins, 43, was abducted as he returned from a meeting in Tyre
with officials of Lebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri's Shiite
Amal militia to discuss efforts to free foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   ``It could be two days, two years or never. It's a sad
situation,'' Fisher said of prospects for Higgins' release.
   He said, however, that Higgins ``will handle the situation
better than most people because of the training he has had. He is a
very strong individual.''
   Fisher said the military had also been in touch with the family
and ``given us some telephone numbers to call for information. We
are comfortable with the arrangements they have provided.''

<HEAD>New Cabinet Has Holdovers, Hardliners in Key Posts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Roh Tae-woo unveiled a
new Cabinet today in which several key posts went to hardliners and
holdovers from the old government. Widespread hopes for major
changes were unfulfilled.
   Roh, who takes office Feb. 25, has pledged to end South Korea's
long tradition of authoritarian rule and restore full democracy.
   But Cabinet security posts went to hardliners. Technocrats,
civil servants and academics took most other posts.
   The naming of the 23-member Cabinet was closely watched for
evidence Roh would follow through on promises for sweeping reforms.
Many of the new ministers are politically unknown.
   Political observers said the new Cabinet was little different
from the one it will replace and does not appear to contain
independents or reformers.
   Roh stressed the need for stability in making the appointments,
saying the government had to ensure political and economic calm. He
also underlined the need to guarantee the success of the 1988
Olympic Games, which are scheduled for September in Seoul.
   ``I call on you new ministers to make maximum efforts to turn
the nation into an advanced country by enhancing the people's
capability and integrating national strength,'' Roh told them.
   Opposition parties charged that Roh is determined to continue
the authoritarian rule of outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan.
   ``Despite much talk, the new Cabinet falls far short of
expectations,'' said an opposition statement.
   However, the main opposition Reunification Democratic Party and
the Party for Peace and Democracy had rejected Roh's invitation to
nominate candidates for the Cabinet, saying they doubted Roh's
ability to bring about reform.
   Roh retained seven ministers from the Chun government, including
those holding the key posts of foreign affairs, home affairs and
justice.
   Home Minister Lee Sang-hee heads the police and Justice Minister
Chung Hae-chang supervised recent crackdowns on political
dissidents. The foreign minister is Choi Kwang-soo.
   New Defense Minister Oh Ja-Bok, a recently retired general and
armed forces commander, is a hardliner who has attacked opposition
parties in the past.
   Oh is expected to be Roh's link to the powerful military, which
has long dominated the country. He supported Chun and Roh and other
young generals who took power in 1980 with military backing.
   Ahn Moo-hyuk was retained as head of South Korea's powerful
intelligence agency, the Agency for National Security Planning. The
director works with the Cabinet, but is not a member.
   Roh had pledged to increase substantially the power of the
Cabinet as part of his promises to usher in full democracy.
Traditionally, ministers have had little power, with most decisions
being made by the presidency.
   The appointment Feb. 11 of noted moderate Lee Hyun-jae as prime
minister had spurred hope the new Cabinet would include people with
new outlooks.
   Roh said the new government would seek to end the political,
regional and social divisions that have long troubled South Korea.
   ``The new government should stand in the vanguard to create
conditions under which the entire people would be willing to
participate,'' he said.
   Roh won the presidential elections on Dec. 16 with 36.7 percent
of the vote. Chun had agreed to elections after huge protests for
democractic government last summer.
   Roh, saying he is determined to maintain the country's rapid
economic growth and massive exports drive, held over some key
economic experts, including Finance Minister Sakong Il.
   Outgoing Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae was promoted to the joint
post of deputy prime minister and economic planning minister.
   Business and trade groups applauded the makeup of the Cabinet,
saying it would help to bolster economic growth while stabilizing
prices and other economic factors.

   The government asked the U.S.
ambassador for the names of U.S. officials who were the sources for
a newspaper report alleging links between the Honduran military and
Colombian drug traffickers.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said in a statement
Thursday that the government also wants the names of members of the
Honduran military who were accused of involvement in the narcotics
trade and details of the illegal acts they purportedly committed.
   ``Notwithstanding the seriousness of the charges formulated
(against Honduras), for the moment what most displeases and
disturbs my government is that these are attributed to (high-level
U.S. officials),'' Lopez Contreras said.
   He said that if the names were not forthcoming, ``then we await
the satisfactions (consequences) that the case warrants.'' He did
not elaborate.
   ``This is not the appropriate moment to get into analyzing the
truthfulness or falseness of the charges provided by anonymous but
identifiable sources,'' the statement said.
   A story in The New York Times last week quoted unidentified U.S.
and Honduran officials as saying Honduras was in danger of being
overrun by Colombian drug dealers.
   The newspaper reported the sources as saying narcotics
traffickers had corrupted Honduran army officers, offered money to
political parties and bought businesses and land to launder drug
profits.
   The Honduran military denied the charges and demanded that the
government of President Jose Azcona Hoyo file lawsuits against
newspapers that report such accounts.
   Both Azcona Hoyo and U.S. Ambassador Everett Briggs held news
conferences on Tuesday at which they called the reports untrue.
   Briggs said the stories were ``very imaginative and inventive.''
   ``I am the principal and highest official of the United States
in Honduras and I totally disavow this situation that has appeared
in the newspapers of my country,'' Briggs said.

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 people evacuated after a toxic
chemical leak tainted the Sandusky River were permitted to return
to their homes today after fumes dissipated, the mayor said.
   A water emergency remained in effect in this northwestern Ohio
city of 22,000 after an estimated 100,000 gallons of flammable
toluene spilled Wednesday from a ruptured Sun Co. pipeline south of
here.
   Reserve tanks which hold about 4 million gallons of water were
expected to last until late this afternoon, Mayor Fred Singer said.
   At least three people were treated for injuries after an
undetermined amount of the chemical flowed into the river, and as
many as 5,000 residents were evacuated Wednesday and Thursday
because of the fumes, officials said.
   Toluene can produce irritating or poisonous gases, according to
an emergency response guidebook published by the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   City and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials assessed
the air quality during the night.
   ``We just returned with federal EPA people and have monitored
the situation, and we are satisfied that it will be safe for the
people to return to the evacuated areas,'' Singer said early this
morning.
   Gov. Richard Celeste on Thursday declared a state of emergency
for Sandusky County, which includes Fremont. The declaration makes
state assistance available.
   The toluene was detected Wednesday night from a Sun Co. pipeline
near Tiffin, about 20 miles upstream from Fremont.
   Bob Arnet, an environmental safety coordinator for the Tulsa,
Okla.-based Sun Pipe Line, said Thursday that authorities had
turned off the pipeline, but had not located the leak.
   The city stopped taking in water from the river before the spill
reached Fremont late Thursday, officials said. They estimated a
14-mile section of the river was contaminated.
   Under the water emergency, industries are prohibited from using
water, and residents are urged to conserve.
   Singer said city officials were considering having the National
Guard truck in water from Clyde, about 10 miles southeast of
Fremont.
   EPA officials said they believed much of the chemical would
dissipate by the time it reaches Lake Erie.
   Singer criticized Sun officials for not notifying Fremont
officials of the spill until Thursday, and said the city will seek
reimbursement from the company for expenses incurred.
   ``It's real interesting. No one contacted us until 5 p.m., and
the chemical is dangerous and highly combustible,'' Singer said.
``They acted very irresponsibly.''
   Sun spokesman Bud Davis, said the company would take ``liability
and responsibility for the leak'' and cleanup, which could cost as
much as $1 million and take three to four months.
   Two Fremont residents on Thursday filed a class-action lawsuit
in U.S. District Court in Toledo against the Sun Pipe Line Co.
   Joe Albrechta, an attorney for Lupe Avalos and Barry Halstead,
said no specific dollar amount was named in the suit, which seeks
compensation for lost wages, property damage and damages for
emotional stress created by the incident.
   The spill occurred in a swampy area in Seneca County, south of
Fremont, and then leaked into Sugar Creek, a tributary of the
Sandusky River, said Sonya Elam, a spokeswoman for the Ohio
Disaster Services Agency. The Sandusky River flows north into Lake
Erie.
   Two emergency workers were treated at Tiffin Mercy Hospital
after they fell through ice and into contaminated water, and a
volunteer firefighter was treated after inhaling the fumes. All
were subsequently released.
   Ohio EPA spokesman Allan Franks said at least 100 dead fish were
visible in the river. He said officials suspect there may be 1,000
dead fish under the ice.

   Heavy rain spread across the South today, touching off
high-water alerts, while snow was widely scattered in the Plains
and West and Southern California had high winds.
   A drenching rain fell in northern Florida. Rain spread across
Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, and prompted flood warnings in
sections of southeast Louisiana. Flash flood watches were issued in
sections of southeast Mississippi, southern and central Alabama and
the Florida Panhandle.
   A narrow band of rain and snow extended from northeast Oklahoma
across southeast Kansas and west central Missouri.
   Rain and mountain snow dotted eastern Arizona and western New
Mexico.
   Strong winds developed across much of southern California. High
wind warnings were posted for much of the region warning of gusts
of 60 to 70 mph.
   Today's forecast called for rain widespread from the middle
Mississippi Valley across the Tennessee and Ohio valleys into the
mid-Atlantic states and Carolinas; showers and thunderstorms from
the central Gulf Coast across Georgia and northern Florida; snow
over southwest Michigan and northern sections of Illinois and
Indiana; and rain and mountain snow showers across southeast
Arizona and southern New Mexico.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s from the Dakotas across the

<HEAD>Police Shoot 13-Year-Old Retarded Boy Who Aimed Toy Gun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every day, neighbors say, a retarded
13-year-old boy would go behind his house and play with a toy gun.
   Silvielo Grohse's youthful game turned into tragedy when two
officers mistook his plaything for the real thing and fatally shot
him.
   ``He was such a sweet boy,'' said Steve Diamond, the
seventh-grader's teacher. ``He loved to be hugged. He would come up
and put his head on your shoulder and just hug you.''
   The youngster was shot Wednesday by the officers after they
ordered him to drop the weapon and he instead spun around toward
them, police said Thursday.
   ``The boy is retarded, and he played back here every day because
it's not safe in front of the projects,'' said neighbor Debra
Judkins. ``The cops should know better than to gun down a child.''
   Grohse was dead on arrival at San Francisco General Hospital,
said Dr. Richard Cales. The boy stood 5-foot-8 and weighed about
190 pounds.
   Police spokesman Jerry Senkir said there was no evidence the
officers, Michael Huddleston and Janet Campbell, acted improperly.
He said Grohse's toy gun resembled a .22-caliber revolver.
   According to Senkir, the officers were answering a call of shots
being fired in the drug-plagued area when they spotted the youth
walking with the toy gun in his hand. They pulled within 40 feet of
him, got out of their patrol car and crouched behind open doors
with guns drawn, ordering the youth to drop his gun.
   ``The suspect then turned and pointed the gun at the officers,''
Senkir said. ``At the same time, he crouched down and let out a
yell. Both officers immediately opened fire.''
   The officers fired four shots from their .357-caliber Magnum
service revolvers, he said.
   ``Weren't they supposed to give him a warning or something, like
`freeze?''' asked Grohse's 12-year-old cousin. ``Couldn't they have
shot in the air first instead of killing him?''
   Police union officials have called for community meetings
between residents and police to defuse the tension surrounding the
shooting.

   The U.S. dollar rose against major foreign
currencies in Europe early today in lackluster trading. Gold prices
fell.
   The dollar was underpinned by recent signs of U.S. economic
expansion, said a trader in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Although the dollar shed some early gains, it was holding fairly
steady in the absence of market-moving news, traders said.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe compared with rates late
Thursday:
   _1.7080 West German marks, up from 1.7040
   _1.4035 Swiss francs, up from 1.4010
   _5.7735 French francs, up from 5.7555
   _1.9236 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9130
   _1,257.15 Italian lire, up from 1,254.63
   _1.2715 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2690
   The British pound fell to $1.7460 from $1.7508.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 130.53 Japanese yen, up from
130.00 yen on Thursday. In later London trading today, the dollar
was quoted at 130.35 yen.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $443.45 a troy ounce, down from $444 late Thursday.
   The metal traded at a bid of $443.30 in Zurich, down from
$447.50.
   Hong Kong markets were closed for the Chinese New Year.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.37 a troy ounce,
down from $6.43.

   A mild earthquake struck near the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, but there were no reports
of damage or injury.
   Thursday's quake had a magnitude estimated at 3.3 on the Richter
scale, meaning it was capable of causing slight damage, said Rick
McKenzie, a staff research associate at the University of
California Seismographic Stations at Berkeley.
   The quake was centered about seven miles northeast of the
laboratories, where research is conducted on nuclear weapons and
the ``Star Wars'' defense system, said McKenzie. The lab is about
40 miles east of San Francisco.
   Every increase of one number on the open-ended Richter scale
means a tenfold increase in the strenth of the quake. A quake of
magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans, while one of
magnitude 8 can cause tremendous damage.

   The presidential campaign is out of
control, said the executive editor of The Associated Press, placing
part of the blame on the media.
   The candidates, some of whom have been campaigning for two
years, can also accept blame for overexposure that has bored the
voters, Walter Mears, AP vice president and executive editor, said
Thursday in a speech to the Ohio Newspaper Association.
   ``They tend to neutralize each other ... and they tend to wear
out their public welcome'' by the time the polls open, Mears said.
Candidates have also ``debated themselves hoarse. There have been
more than 30 debates so far, which may be why nobody is listening
anymore.''
   Mears said there are too many reporters covering the race and
too little substantive reporting.
   ``There were 3,000 reporters in New Hampshire,'' he said. ``The
numbers themselves are absurd.''
   But the immediacy of television and the speed with which news is
transmitted across the nation also has played a role.
   ``The Gary Hart story was in print before Donna Rice even got
home,'' he said.
   Mears covered presidential campaigns from 1960 through 1980 for
The AP, and won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the 1976
campaign.

<HEAD>Publisher To Go Ahead With New Version Of Banned Biography</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After losing a court battle for the right to
publish an unauthorized biography of J.D. Salinger, Random House
says it will publish ``a substantially new book'' about the
reclusive author and the legal wrangling over the first book.
   The new book, ``In Search of J.D. Salinger'' by Ian Hamilton, is
slated to arrive in bookstores in May. It will be both a biography
of Salinger, author of the 1951 novel ``The Catcher In the Rye,''
and tell the story of Hamilton's unsuccessful effort in 1986 to
publish ``J.D. Salinger: A Writing Life.''
   Salinger, who rarely leaves his Cornish, N.H., home and has
given only one interview in 35 years, came to New York to give a
deposition in the lawsuit against the first book. He claimed
invasion of privacy and infringement of copyright because the
planned biography reproduced some letters he wrote to his friends
and editors between 1939 and 1961.
   The letters had been donated to libraries and were open to
scholarly perusal.
   Last October, after months of appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court
let stand a lower court ruling barring publication of the biography
unless the quotations from and paraphrases of Salinger's letters
were deleted. The court said the letters still belonged to Salinger.
   Jason Epstein, the editor of the book, said, ``The original book
essentially survives within the new book.''
   Gerald Hollingsworth, Random House's general counsel, said, ``I
can't conceive of there being any well-founded legal problems with
this book.''
   Dorothy Olding, Salinger's longtime literary agent, said she had
expected Random House to go ahead with another book and she planned
to inform Salinger's attorney. She said she was certain Salinger
would have no comment.
   In a statement issued by Random House, Hamilton said: ``The new
version is a different sort of book altogether _ more of a literary
adventure story with the biographer as a leading character. ... At
the same time it raises key questions about the whole business of
`biography' _ what is it for, why do we write it, why do people
want to read it and so on.''

<TEXT>
   About 200 employees of the country's
largest hotel went on strike after a room boy was fired for
entering the room of a pretty Japanese guest and kissing her, a
hotel spokeswoman said today.
   The strikers, demanding the room boy be reinstated, had blocked
the entrances of the posh, seaside, 673-room Philippine Plaza Hotel
since Wednesday, said Rosary Ysmael, its public relations director.
   Ysmael said that on Jan. 17, Raymundo Lacanaria, 34, entered the
room of the Japanese woman, embraced and kissed her. The woman
immediately reported the incident.
   Management gave Lacanaria a 15-day suspension after which he was
terminated, Ysmael said. Union officials called the strike after
the hotel refused to take back Lancanaria, who is a union board
member.
   Ysmael said only 200 of the union's 700 members joined the
strike.

<HEAD>Boston Globe Reporter Faces Jailing For Protecting Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter for The Boston Globe was ordered jailed
for contempt of court after repeatedly refusing to reveal the
identities of confidential sources cited in a 1982 story about a
former city official.
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge John P. Sullivan issued the order
Thursday but said he would allow Charles A. Radin to remain free
for at least a week so he could appeal to a higher court.
   Radin on Thursday refused to answer 28 questions about the
sources quoted in the story, citing First Amendment protections of
a free press and similar provisions of the state constitution.
   After Sullivan issued his order Thursday, E. Susan Garsh, an
attorney for the Globe and Radin, appealed the contempt finding to
the Appeals Court. No hearing date was set.
   In the April 1982 story, Radin said Richard J. Sinnott, a former
city licensing chief, had applied for a disability pension claiming
emotional stress suffered while attending a licensing board meeting
and two rock concerts.
   Sinnott withdrew his application shortly after the Globe
detailed his request.
   Sinnott then filed an invasion of privacy suit against several
city officials, accusing them of violating his rights by releasing
the contents of his application. Neither Radin nor the Globe are
defendants in the suit, but Sinnott's attorneys want information
about the sources to help them prepare for trial.
   Regina L. Quinlan, and attorney for Sinnott, has argued that the
right of Sinnott and others to privacy outweighs any right Radin or
the newspaper might have to conceal the names of anonymous sources.
   A state Appeals Court judge earlier this month agreed and
ordered Radin to disclose his sources.

   A Civil War-era cannonball that
was a boon to a Maryland museum might have become a boom if the
museum manager had not been suspicious and called authorities,
police said.
   The bomb squad from the Maryland Fire Marshal's Office was
called to defuse the six-inch, rusty-brown cannonball, estimated to
be about 120 years old, said Bob Thomas, a spokesman for the office.
   A clammer found the cannonball in his net in the Potomac River.
He turned it over to the St. Clements Island Museum in southern
Maryland, Thomas said.
   The museum, which collects state artifacts, displayed the
cannonball until a museum manager, whose name was not released,
``became concerned that it was live,'' Thomas said.
   The bomb squad determined the cannonball was indeed live, with
its fuse intact and apparently containing explosive black powder
ignitable by friction or a spark, Thomas said.
   The bomb squad removed the cannonball and planned to defuse it
and return the shell to the museum, Thomas said. The cannonball
would have been lethal had it exploded, he said.
   Thomas did not know when the cannonball was found or how long it
was displayed.

   Two state legislators defiantly munched cookies in
a Capitol committee room to protest a policy banning food in the
Colorado House of Representatives.
   The cookie rebellion was staged Thursday by Rep. Bill Owens and
Rep. Danny Williams. They ate while a photographer snapped pictures
and their committee deliberated a firearms bill.
   ``Excuse me,'' Owens told a witness. ``We're being photographed
breaking the law.''
   Besides prompting Thursday's cookie revolt, the decision caused
Republicans to interrupt work on one of their busiest days to
caucus for 30 minutes and discuss the subject. The matter will be
taken up again today, legislators said.
   House Speaker Carl ``Bev'' Bledsoe proposed the controversial
no-food policy after outside groups began offering legislators
breakfast in the Capitol before each morning's session. He said
crumbs and debris from the meals had gotten out of hand.
   The House Services Committee, which decides such matters,
inaugurated the ban Tuesday in the House and in House committee
rooms. The policy forced minority Democrats to abandon their
luncheon caucus that day and move it into the governor's office.
   Rep. Bonnie Allison, a Republican who opposes the ban, said
committees frequently are in session during lunch. She said it is
better to eat on the job than to leave the committee to eat ``while
your constituents are not being represented.''
   Rep. Carole Taylor-Little, another Republican, said it improves
mental health ``to have an ability to graze.''

   Doctors, accountants, and even embalmers
in Ohio are required to undergo continuing education. Now lawyers
are being added to the list.
   The Ohio Supreme Court has adopted a rule requiring the state's
35,000 lawyers to complete 24 hours of legal education every two
years, beginning in 1990.
   ``While we cannot quantify, we do know that many, many, many
lawyers today expose themselves to more continuing education than
this rule is going to require them to be exposed to in a two-year
period,'' Chief Justice Thomas Moyer said in outlining the program
Thursday.
   Joseph Cook of Akron, president of the Ohio State Bar
Association, said lawyers probably could meet the requirement by
attending seminars sponsored by the state bar.
   The rule establishes, effective July 1, a 19-member Supreme
Court commission to administer and accredit the program. It will be
financed by a $15 filing fee.
   Attorneys would have to receive 60 minutes of instruction or
take part in another approved activity to receive a cedit hour. But
they also could earn 10 credit hours for publication of an article
or book, and up to five hours for approved self study over the two
years.
   At least two of each 12 hours credit must be related to legal
ethics and professional responsibility.
   Lawyers who fail to comply with the requirements face reprimands
that range from a late filing fee of up to $500 to a suspension
from practice.

<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts from the official
English language text of Pope John Paul II's encyclical
``Sollicitudo Rei Socialis.`` The original was written in Polish.
   `` ...The social context in which we live today cannot be said
to be completely identical to that of twenty years ago ....The
first fact to note is that the hopes for development, at that time
so lively, today appear very far from being realized ....one cannot
deny that the present situation of the world, from the point of
view of development, offers a rather negative impression ...
   ``The first negative observation to make is the persistence and
often the widening of the gap between the areas of the so-called
developed North and the developing South ...in today's world among
other rights, the right of economic initiative is often supressed
....This provokes a sense of frustration or desperation and
predisposes people to opt out of national life, impelling many to
emigrate and also favoring a form of `psychological' emigration
...it often happens that a nation is deprived of its subjectivity,
that is to say the ``sovereignty'' which is its right ...
   ``It must also be restated that no social group, for example, a
political party, has the right to usurp the role of sole leader,
since this brings about the destruction of the true subjectivity of
society and of the individual citizens, as happens in every form of
totalitarianism ...
   ``The tension between the two blocs which began at the end of
the Second World War has dominated the whole of the subsequent
forty years. Sometimes it has taken the form of `cold war,'
sometimes of `wars by proxy,' through the manipulation of local
conflicts, and sometimes it has kept people's minds in suspense and
anguish by the threat of an open and total war ...
   ``Although at the present time this danger seems to have
receded, yet without completely disappearing, and even though an
initial agreement has been reached on the destruction of one type
of nuclear weapon, the existence and opposition of the blocs
continue to be a real and worrying fact which still colors the
world picture ...
   ``The tension between East and West is not in itself an
opposition between two different levels of development but rather
between two concepts of the development of individuals and peoples,
both concepts being imperfect and in need of radical correction.
This opposition is transferred to the developing countries
themselves, and thus helps to widen the gap already existing on the
economic level between North and South ...
   ``This is one of the reasons why the church's social doctrine
adopts a critical attitude towards both liberal capitalism and
Marxist collectivism. For from the point of view of development the
question naturally arises: in what way and to what extent are these
two systems capable of changes and updatings such as to favor or
promote a true and integral development of individuals and peoples
in modern society? In fact, these changes and updatings are urgent
and essential for the cause of a development common to all ...
   ``We easily arrive at a clearer picture of the last twenty years
and a better understanding of the conflicts in the northern
hemisphere, namely between East and West, as an important cause of
the retardation or stagnation of the South. The developing
countries, instead of becoming autonomous nations concerned with
their own progress toward a just sharing in the goods and services
meant for all, become parts of a machine, cogs in a gigantic wheel
...
   ``Each of the two blocs harbors in its own way a tendency
towards imperialism, as it is usually called, or toward forms of
neo-colonialism: an easy temptation to which they frequently
succumb, as history, including recent history, teaches ...It is
this abnormal situation, the result of a war and of an unacceptably
exaggerated concern for security, which deadens the impulse toward
united cooperation by all for the common good of the human race, to
the detriment especially of peaceful peoples who are impeded from
their rightful access to the goods meant for all ...Seen in this
way, the present division of the world is a direct obstacle to the
real transformation of the conditions of underdevelopment in the
developing and less advanced countries ...
   ``When the West gives the impression of abandoning itself to
forms of growing and selfish isolation, and the East in its turn
seems to ignore for questionable reasons its duty to cooperate in
the task of alleviating human misery, then we are up against not
only a betrayal of humanity's legitimate expectations _ a betrayal
that is a harbinger of unforeseeable consequences _ but also a real
desertion of a moral obligation ...
   ``If arms production is a serious disorder in the present world
with regard to true human needs and the employment of the means
capable of satisfying those needs, the arms trade is equally to
blame ....We are thus confronted with a strange phenomenon: while
economic aid and development plans meet with the obstacle of
insuperable ideological barriers, and with tariff and trade
barriers, arms of whatever origin circulate with almost total
freedom all over the world ...
   ``To all this we add the tremendous and universally acknowledged
danger represented by atomic weapons stockpiled on an incredible
scale, the logical conclusion seems to be this: in today's world,
including the world of economics, the prevailing picture is one
destined to lead us more quickly toward death rather than one of
the concern for true development ...

   ``Nor may we close our eyes to another painful wound in today's
world: the phenomenon of terrorism, understood as the intention to
kill people and destroy property indiscriminately, and to create a
climate of terror and insecurity, often including the taking of
hostages. Even when some ideology or the desire to create a better
society is adduced as the motivation for this inhuman behavior,
acts of terrorism are never justifiable ...
   ``It is very alarming to see governments in many countries
launching systematic campaigns against birth, contrary not only to
the cultural and religious identity of the countries themselves but
also contrary to the nature of true development. It often happens
that these campaigns are the result of pressure and financing
coming from abroad, and in some cases they are made a condition for
the granting of financial and economic aid and assistance. In any
event, there is an absolute lack of respect for the freedom of
choice of the parties involved, men and women often subjected to
intolerable pressures, including economic ones, in order to force
them to submit to this new form of oppression ...
   ``Also to be mentioned here, as a sign of respect for life _
despite all the temptations to destroy it by abortion and
euthanasia _ is a concomitant concern for peace, together with an
awareness that peace is indivisible. It is either for all or for
none ...
   ``Side by side with the miseries of underdevelopment, themselves
unacceptable, we find ourselves up against a form of
superdevelopment ... which consists in an excessive availability of
every kind of material goods for the benefit of certain social
groups, easily makes people slaves of `possession' and of immediate
gratification, with no other horizon than the multiplication or
continual replacement ...
   `` ... One of the greatest injustices in the contemporary world
consists precisely in this: that the ones who possess much are
relatively few and those who possess almost nothing are many. It is
the injustice of the poor distribution of the goods and services
originally intended for all ...
   ``Surmounting every type of imperialism and determination to
preserve their own hegemony, the stronger and richer nations must
have a sense of moral responsibility for the other nations, so that
a real international system may be established which will rest on
the foundation of the equality of all peoples and on the necessary
respect for their legitimate differences ... For world peace is
inconceivable unless the world's leaders come to recognize that
interdependence in itself demands the abandonment of the politics
of blocs, the sacrafice of all forms of economic, military or
political imperialism, and the transformation of mutual distrust
into collaboration ...
   ``The church does not have technical solutions to offer for the
problem of underdewvelopment as such ... for the church does not
propose economic and political systems or programs ... the church's
social doctrine is not a `third way' between liberal capitalism and
Marxist collectivism, nor even a possible alternative to other
solutions less radically opposed to one another: rather, it
constitutes a category of its own ... therefore it belongs to the
field, not of ideology, but of theology and particularly of moral
theology ... It is necessary to state once more the characteristic
principles of Christian social doctrine: the goods of this world
are originally meant for all. The right to private property is
valid and necessary, but it does not nullify the value of this
principle ...
   ``I wish to mention speifically: the reform of the international
trade system, which is morgaged to protectionism and increasing
bilaterism; the reform of the world monetary and financial system,
today recognized as inadequate; the question of technological
exchanges and their proper use; the need for a review of the
structure of the existing international organizations, in the
framework of an international juridical order..the international
trade system today frequently discriminates against the products of
the young industries of the developing countries and discourages
the producers of raw materials ... the world monetary and financial
system is marked by an excessive fluctuation of exchange rates and
interest rates to the detriment of the balance of payments and the
debt situation of the poorer countries ...
   ``Forms of technology and their transfer constitute today one of
the major problems of international exchange and of the grave
damage deriving therefrom ...
   ``In the opinion of many, the international organizations seem
to be at a stage of their existence when their operating methods,
operating costs and effectiveness need careful review and possible
correction ....
   ``Development demands above all a spirit of initiative on the
part of the countries that need it. Each of them must act in
accordance with its own responsibilties, not expecting everything
from the more favored countries ... the developing nations
themselves should favor the self-affirmation of each citizen,
through access to a wider culture and a free flow of information .
.. Other nations need to reform certain unjust structures, and in
particular their political institutions, in order to replace
corrupt, dictatorial and authoritarian forms of government by
democratic and participatory ones ...
   ``Development which is merely economic is incapable of setting
man free; on the contrary, it will end up by enslaving him further.
Development that does not include the cultural, transcendent and
religious dimensions of man and society, to the extent that it does
not recognize the existence of such dimensions and does not
endeavor to direct its goals and priorities toward the same, is
even less conducive to authentic liberation ....''

<HEAD>Truce Begins In Disputed Border Area After Last-Minute Fighting</HEAD>

   Thai and Laotian forces today began a
truce in a disputed border area, and leaders separated troops who
had fought bloody battles for 3{ months, Thai officers said.
   After the cease-fire began at 8 a.m., two parallel rows of Thai
and Laotian flags were put up to mark off a two-mile zone which
soldiers are forbidden to cross, said the army chief of staff, Gen.
Charuay Wongsayant.
   Thai and Laotian military officials agreed to the cease-fire on
Wednesday, after two days of talks in Bangkok. They decided to
separate their soldiers within 48 hours of the start of the truce.
   Hundreds of soldiers have died since fighting flared last
November for sparsely populated hills between Thailand's northern
province of Phitsanulok and Laos' Sayaboury province. Each side
claims that the area about 240 miles north of Bangkok is in its
territory.
   Col. Rithee Rungkaputi, chief of the Third Army Region's
civilian affairs department, said there was a half-hour long
skirmish in one of the contested hills an hour before the truce
began. He said there were no casualties.
   He said the clash probably was due to a delay in communicating
the cease-fire order to field troops.
   He also reported a heavy artillery exchange and two ground
clashes on Wednesday and Thursday, when Thai and Laotian military
teams were meeting in Bangkok to work out the truce.
   Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila told reporters today that
foreign ministry officials have been dispatched to Paris to seek
the French government's assistance in resolving the conflicting
claims. The Thais say a 1907 French-Thai treaty shows the disputed
area is inside Thailand.
   Meanhile, the official Laotian news agency KPL today quoted Maj.
Gen. Thonglay Kommasith, deputy head of the general political
department of the Laotian army, as saying the talks in Bangkok had
``paved the way towards negotiations, a diplomatic channel to solve
the Lao-Thai border problem.''
   Thonglay, who participated in the talks, spoke at a news
conference in Vientiane Thursday, said the dispatch monitored in
Bangkok.
   The agreement calls for the two governments to hold talks within
15 days of the start of the truce to decide the location of the
border.
   Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth, the Thai army commander, said he
would be going to Laos' capital of Vientiane within two days at the
invitation of Gen. Sisavat Keobounphan, the chief of the Laotian
army general staff and Chaovalit's counterpart at Wednesday's talks.

   Human rights violations have
increased under President Corazon Aquino's administration and the
United States shares responsibility, a leftist social action group
charged today.
   Meanwhile, suspected Communist rebels ambushed and killed a
police informant early today in Manila's Tondo district, a
stronghold of urban guerrillas.
   Petrolino Lim suffered three gunshot wounds and died a few hours
later in a hospital, police said.
   The Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates said it would
file a petition with the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in New
York asking it to condemn the U.S. and Aquino governments for
``gross and systematic violations of human rights of the Filipino
people.''
   Alvaro Senturias, an alliance official, told a news conference
that the petition would show that ``human rights violations have
increased under the Aquino government.''
   The alliance distributed copies of the petition, which cited
numerous specific allegations of abuses, including murder, the
bombing of civilians and forced evacuation of villagers.
   Most of the incidents stemmed from the government's effort to
step up the war against Communist rebels' 19-year-old insurgency _
employing armed vigilantes, for example, the group said.
   There was no immediate comment from the government, which came
to power nearly two years ago on the promise of restoring human
rights after 20 years of authoritarian rule under ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   The alliance, an umbrella group for several leading
church-affiliated human rights groups, says in the petition that
the United States ``has intensified its intervention in the
counter-insurgency program.''
   ``The Aquino government has become more subservient to the
dictation of the U.S. policy makers and counter-insurgency
experts,'' it says.
   The alliance said that despite its stated commitment to human
rights, the Aquino government had made little effort to punish
those in the military who had committed abuses under the Marcos
administration.
   The military has said that many of the church-affiliated groups
that comprise the alliance are communist-infiltrated. It says they
unfairly blame soldiers for abuses without criticizing similar
actions by the rebel New People's Army.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in a February 1986
military-civilian uprising that toppled Marcos, who lives in exile
in Hawaii.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today said
his visit to Washington is primarily aimed at pressing for Senate
ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty
without any strings attached.
   ``I came here particularly to make it clear in the Senate that
the INF treaty should be ratified without any amendments,'' Kohl
said.
   ``I am very pleased and very happy that the day yesterday has
made it very clear that there are no differences between the
(Reagan) administration and between us,'' he added in an interview
on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   When the United States and the Soviet Union were negotiating the
treaty, there was some opposition from officials in Bonn worried it
would leave the Soviets with a military advantage.
   Kohl erased doubts about West German support on Thursday when he
went to Capitol Hill and lobbied for speedy Senate ratification of
the pact, which would eliminate missiles with ranges between 300
and 3,000 miles.
   ``He put his wholehearted support behind the INF treaty,
indubitably, unquestionably and without any reservation, saying
that there should be no amendments to it,'' Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said after the private meeting.
   Kohl's spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, confirmed Byrd's account and
said the chancellor told Congress the treaty is necessary to
maintain momentum in the drive for disarmament.
   Kohl was due to meet with President Reagan today with both
military and money matters on the agenda.
   Among those Kohl saw on Thursday was Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
who has argued against the treaty on grounds it will hurt European
security. Helms did not relent in his opposition to the pact, but
said of Kohl, ``he's the most impressive head of state that we've
had in a long time. He gives detailed answers to every question.''
   West Germany is intensely active in efforts to shape U.S. arms
control strategy because its location on the frontier with Soviet
bloc nations gives it special interests and special fears about
military arrangements on both sides.
   Kohl was the last Western European leader to see Secretary of
State George P. Shultz before the secretary's departure today for
Moscow and more arms control negotiations with the Soviets.
   Highest on Shultz's arms control agenda is a U.S.-Soviet effort
to reach an agreement by a late spring summit in Moscow to cut
arsenals of intercontinental ballistic missiles and other strategic
nuclear arms by 50 percent.
   NATO has agreed the strategic arms talks are the first priority.
But West German politicians, particularly the opposition Social
Democrats, have sought more of an emphasis in negotiations on
reducing short-range systems _ the type of weapons that could be
used on German soil if a conventional war broke out and escalated
quickly.
   Officials in Bonn also have been questioning how quickly NATO
should implement a 1983 decision to modernize its force of
short-range nuclear weapons _ those with ranges below 300 miles.
   The Germans are particularly concerned about deployment of a new
generation of ground-launched rockets to replace NATO's aged force
of 75-mile-range Lance missiles with rockets capable of hitting
targets more than 100 miles away.
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, issued assurances that though the modernization will
proceed, there is no rush.
   Deployment of missiles to replace the Lance may not occur before
1995, the official said.
   ``There are no major decisions facing the alliance and so
there's not an issue here in the day-to-day working of the
alliance,'' the official said.
   Much more study of the weaponry that would replace the Lance
missile is required by the Defense Department before the new
weapons are produced, the official said.
   The view was echoed by Wim van Eekelen, the Netherlands' defense
minister and chairman of the Eurogroup _ the European members of
the NATO alliance.
   Van Eekelen, whose visit to Washington coincided with Kohl's
trip, said at a news conference that NATO should adhere to its
agreement on modernizing short-range missiles, while delaying a
final decision to deploy until the weapons are produced.

<HEAD>Communists In Crisis of Leadership, Membership As 12th Congress
Commences</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Spanish Communist Party opened its 12
annual national convention today, fighting for its political life.
Membership is on the decline and leadership wanting, party
spokesman and political analysts say.
   The once influential Communists are plagued by internal disputes
and a decline in voter support that have damaged the party's image
as a serious political force.
   Party Secretary General Gerardo Iglesias recently announced he
would not seek re-election, and no major figure has stepped forward
to take his place.
   ``It looks as if top leaders are shying away from divisive
leadership moves, and the Central Committee seeks to go to
collective leadership rather than back a charismatic-type chief, ''
said Angela Bautista, editor of the Central Committee organ Workers
World.
   About 600 delegates to the congress are to elect 90 members to
the party's central committee, which will then try to choose a
secretary general.
   The party reached its zenith in 1979, when it won 10 percent of
the vote in municipal elections.
   But its support has waned since it suffered a disastrous setback
in 1982 general elections, receiving just 3.8 percent of the vote
as Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists swept into power in
a landslide.
   Between 1979 and 1983, the party lost 65 percent of its
membership, or 120,000 people, party figures made public Friday
showed. Since 1985, it has further dropped from 67,400 to 62,300.
   Antonio Perez Henares, a political writer for the newsweekly
Tiempo, said a widespread feeling among Communists is: ``How can we
continue to believe in the party if the party leaders themselves
don't believe in it enough to want to lead it?''
   Before it was legalized in 1977, two years after the death of
dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, the party was the country's
best-organized political force. It enjoyed great support from the
young, intellectuals and artists.
   The party was at the forefront of the Eurocommunism movement,
which advocates independence from the Soviet Union and support for
democratic political procedures.
   But the party's appeal waned. When Spain entered the European
Economic Community in 1986, the Socialists consolidated their hold
on patronage and public administration.
   In the 1986 general elections, the United Left coalition, which
included Communist candiates, got only 4.6 percent of the vote and
seven deputies in the Cortes, or Spanish parliament.
   The current leadership crisis came to a head last December when
highly-respected deputy Enrique Curiel resigned as the party's No.
2 man in what was viewed as a protest of the leadership of
Iglesias, a 43-year-old coal miner who has headed the party for the
past five years.
   Since the 1982 electoral debacle, the party's strategy has been
to bring together all popular protest movements, including
pacifists, ecologists and those opposed to Spanish membership in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to the four U.S.
military bases in Spain.
   It also backed months of strikes and demonstrations early last
year by the Communist-oriented Workers Commissions trade union and
workers seeking greater pay increases and jobs for Spain's more
than three million unemployed.
   Spain currently has a 21 percent jobless rate, Europe's highest.
   But the party has failed to capitalize on the unemployment issue.
   The United Left coalition won just 6.9 percent of the vote in
June municipal elections, down from the 8.1 percent the Spanish
Communist Party won in June 1983 municipal elections.
   The party continues to make its presence felt through its close
ties with the 700,000-strong Workers Commissions, the dominant
labor force in large state industries.
   Splinter Communist groups include the tiny pro-Soviet Spanish
Peoples Communist Party, and the even tinier Spanish Workers
Party-Communist Unity, founded in 1986 by Santiago Carrillo, who
led the mainstream party throughout its underground period and into
legality.

   Two police officers who were suspended
after they became pregnant will be able to return to work and
receive back pay, in a settlement of their sex discrimination
complaint.
   ``You can only sew so many baby clothes. It tends to get
monotonous,'' one of the officers, Juliet Fabbri, 25, said Thursday.
   ``I just want to go back,'' said Ms. Fabbri, who is five months
pregnant.
   Lisa M. Brogan, 27, who gave birth Sunday to a son, Daniel
Patrick, said she probably will wait six to weeks to return to her
job.
   The women were suspended Jan. 19 by officials of this western
Chicago suburb. They filed complaints 10 days later with the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charging they had been
discriminated against because they were pregnant.
   The women had requested ``light duty'' or desk jobs, given to
employees while they recuperate from sickness or injuries.
Naperville officials first said the light-duty jobs had been
eliminated, then said they never had been sanctioned in the first
place.
   ``There may have been times in the past when it was done, but it
wasn't city policy,'' said city spokesman Charlie Pajor.
   Under the agreement disclosed Thursday by the EEOC, the
suspensions will be lifted and they will be reinstated.
   The women were receiving sick pay during the suspensions, city
attorney Eric Margolis said, but the sick pay will be credited and
full monetary relief and other benefits will be provided.
   ``The city's feeling was to settle this and move on to establish
policy for the city as a whole,'' Margolis said.
   Police Chief James Teal said he was pleased an agreement was
reached.

   Authorities today launched one of the largest
police operations in Israeli history, sending 1,500 volunteer
officers into Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods for round-the-clock
patrols to head off Arab riots.
   National Police Commissioner David Krauss said the operation
aims to curb an anticipated new wave of unrest linked to the visit
of U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is scheduled to
leave for the Middle East next Wednesday.
   Israel radio said that in the first stage of the operation, 600
officers were stationed today at the sacred Temple Mount, the site
every Friday of Moslem prayers and, since the riots began,
anti-Israeli demonstrations.
   Today's prayers took place without incident. But the prayer
leader criticized the security presence, saying it desecrated the
holy site.
   He called on the people to consider their fight against the
Israeli authorities as a holy war and to increase their struggle.
   Security at the mosque was evident but discreet. A few dozen
Arab women gathered and chanted for a few minutes but dispersed
quietly.
   At the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, several hundred
people began demonstrating after noon prayers, carrying Palestinian
flags and throwing stones. Soldiers fired tear gas at the Arab
marchers as army reinforcements arrived.
   In Gaza City, soldiers threw stones and bottles at demonstrators
leaving the mosque after prayers. They also fired tear gas.
   Krauss, speaking on Israel radio, said: ``We are carrying out
this operation ... to ensure law and order and prepare for the
Shultz visit.''
   On Thursday, Israel imposed tough rules on its occupied
territories intended to cripple the Palestinians economically
unless they stop strikes, withholding of taxes and other acts of
civil disobedience.
   Palestinians have been heeding calls for an economic boycott of
Israel to accompany violence in the streets since Dec. 8. U.N.
officials say Israeli gunfire has killed at least 55 Arabs in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   No casualties were reported Thursday. But Israel radio said
soldiers arrested 21 Arabs suspected of inciting and participating
in riots in Burka, a West Bank village.
   The radio described the police operation in Jerusalem as ``one
of the largest in the history of Israeli police.'' It said all of
the estimated 1,500 police officers had volunteered and the
round-the-clock patrols would begin Sunday.
   City spokesman Rafi Devara said the municipality had asked that
police avoid using collective punishment measures, such as curfews.
He said many Arab residents had asked for police intervention
``because they don't want some 100-200 young rioters to rule over a
whole neighborhood.''
   About 340,000 Jews and 135,000 Arabs live in Jerusalem, once
regarded as a symbol of Arab-Jewish coexistence.
   ``Coexistence between Arab and Jews has collapsed,'' Jerusalem
Mayor Teddy Kollek told reporters earlier this month as he toured a
refugee camp within city limits that had been put under curfew.
   For the first time in 20 years, curfews have been imposed on the
Shufat refugee camp and Al Tur Arab neighborhood and the 31 Arab
public schools that teach 15,000 students have been closed.
   Since the unrest began, at least 417 Arabs have been arrested in
Jerusalem.
   There have been no fatalities in the city. But in two separate
clashes in Shufat this week, police reportedly used live ammunition
for the first time since December, wounding two Arabs.
   The new economic restrictions announced Thursday on Arabs in the
territories are aimed at hindering the influx of money from the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Increasing numbers of the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza have adopted passive resistance measures to the
Israeli occupation.
   Leaflets and radio broadcasts urge them not to pay taxes to the
Jewish state, work for Israelis or buy Israeli-made goods.
   Only about half the 105,000 Palestinians who worked in Israel
before Dec. 8 now do so. Only a small percentage have paid taxes so
far this year, according to the Arab-run Palestine Press Service
and the army's information center.
   Militants put pressure on Palestinians to keep up the boycott. A
teen-ager stabbed a fellow Arab in the face Thursday, apparently
because he drove Palestinians to work in Israel, Israel radio said.
   The new rules require Palestinians to prove they have paid taxes
before they can travel abroad or import or export goods.
Palestinians also are required to register sums of $1,000 or more
they bring into the country. The previous limit was $5,000.

<HEAD>City Council Agrees To Swap Gourmet Food For Brown Bag Lunches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The City Council has determined there may be a
free lunch, but it won't be gourmet.
   The council on Thursday agreed to halt meals provided at its
meetings by members of the Dallas Restaurant Association because of
a possible conflict of interest if they consider measures affecting
restaurateurs.
   The restaurants had been serving such fare as baby spring
chicken and chocolate decadence cake since the council stopped a
city food service that had cost $4,600 per year.
   Mayor Annette Strauss has written C. Gus Katsigris, president of
the association, thanking the association for ``gracious and
delicious luncheon service.'' But she said the lunches must be
discontinued because they ``may be subject to misinterpretation.''
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Katsigris. ``I don't think we can
influence anyone with a cup of soup and some salad.''
   Although it appears the city will resume food service for the
council members, not eveyone favors the idea.

   Seven teen-agers have been arrested for
making and exploding pipe bombs for ``kicks,'' police said.
   Two boys were hospitalized with injuries when one bomb exploded
prematurely Jan. 24, Detective John Michalec said Thursday.
   ``We estimate the pipe bombs had the explosive impact of hand
grenades used in Vietnam,'' he said.
   Michalec would not identifiy the boys except to say all are 13
or 14 years old. They were turned over to juvenile authorities on
charges of conspiracy, reckless endangerment and possession of
prohibited weapons.
   The boys exploded at least eight bombs during the last eight
months in fields, playgrounds and back yards, Michalec said.
   The bombs were made from copper tubing purchased from hardware
stores, thousands of kitchen matches and a model rocket fuse or
similar detonator.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech `Whistle-Blowers' Must Await Trial To Get Jobs Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to order the
immediate reinstatement of two nuclear technicians who contend they
were fired for ``whistle-blowing'' on safety problems at the
school's reactor.
   U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans on Thursday denied a request
for a temporary restraining order by Paul B. Sharpe and Steven N.
Millspaugh, who wanted their jobs back while awaiting a trial of
their suit for permanent reinstatement and unspecified monetary
damages.
   Georgia Tech President John P. Crecine on Monday ordered the
school's 24-year-old reactor shut down indefinitely. Last month,
federal regulators had curtailed operations at the reactor because
of safety violations.
   School officials said Sharpe and Millspaugh were dismissed under
a reorganization plan under discussion since May and not because of
the safety violations.
   ``If they blew the whistle, who did they blow it to? They didn't
blow it to me, and they're required to blow it to me,'' said
Crecine.
   The university says it has a policy of finding new jobs on the
campus for people whose posts are eliminated and has admitted the
firings were mistakes. Tech offered the two other jobs on the
campus pending administrative hearings but Sharpe and Millspaugh
want their original positions back.
   Ken Clark of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Southeast
Regional Office said the organization is investigating the
possibility that reprisals may have been taken against the two but
declined further comment.
   Clark said the NRC also was checking possible procedural
problems at the reactor, which is small by commercial standards but
among the larger of about 60 research reactors in the country.
   Tech's device is used to test reactions of materials to
radioactive particles. One company is testing treatments for brain
cancer, said Robert MacDonald, associate director of Tech's Neely
Nuclear Research Center.
   In December, the NRC learned of an unreported spill of
radioactive cadmium. The substance has a half-life of 53 hours and
quickly became harmless, Clark said. Crecine and Clark said that
type of spill does not need to be reported.
   However, because of the spill, the NRC ordered a halt to
irradiation experiments in January and Crecine ordered the reactor
shut down Monday.

<TEXT>
   A reporter's videotape shows a white
supremacist who is accused of sedition telling an audience, ``Hate
is our law, revenge is our duty.''
   Peter Lake of Los Angeles taped Richard G. Butler, 69, of Hayden
Lake, Idaho, making the statement at two events in 1983: a cross
burning in Los Angeles, and the swearing in of two Aryan Warriors,
making them members of Butler's Aryan Nations group in Idaho.
   Lake was the government's first witness in the trial of 14 white
men in federal court _ 10 on charges of plotting a violent
overthrow of the government, five for plotting the murder of
federal officials, and two for transporting stolen money.
   He testified Thursday about how, using the name Peter Lawrence,
he went to Butler's Aryan Nations compound in Hayden Lake and
pretended to become a follower of the group's beliefs.
   Butler, who knew he was being taped, made the statement in a
context in which he said the Aryans had the law of hate and the
duty of revenge so long as ``the alien is in the land'' and
occupies ``the seat of power.''
   Conviction of conspiring to overthrow the government by force
has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $20,000 fine;
plotting to murder federal officials has a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment. Transporting stolen money has a maximum penalty of 10
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Lake, a writer and television producer, said he investigated
Butler for a report for a Los Angeles TV station and a magazine
published by Larry Flynt.
   Under cross-examination, Lake said that he carried three
.45-caliber pistols on an airliner in his luggage on the trip, that
he lied to Butler and others at the compound, that he took the
initiation as an Aryan Warrior insincerely, that no one ever told
him that as a warrior he would have to kill or bomb or try to
overthrow the government by violence, and that his companion on the
trip, a felon, also was armed.
   Because of the large number of defendants, opening statements
took two days, even though four defendants put off statements until
the government has finished its case.
   Defendant Ardie McBrearty made his own statement, telling the
jury that the government's case was ``a little truth here, a little
truth there, and a whole lot of imagination in between.''
   Attorney N.C. Deday LaRene said his client, the Rev. Robert
Miles, of Cohoctah, Mich., believes the races should be separate.
``He speaks of being at war with the government,'' LaRene said, but
likened Miles' rhetoric to a coach telling his players before a
game, ``cripple them, go in there and kill them.''

<TEXT>
   The country's largest opposition party
said today it will boycott provincial elections that the government
had hoped would help resolve the island's four-year ethnic conflict.
   The party believes general elections should be held before any
local contests are considered, said Somasara Dassanayake, general
secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
   The decision was made Thursday night at a meeting chaired by
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, party leader and former prime minister, he
said. The party is dominated by the island's majority Sinhalese.
   On Thursday, a moderate Tamil party appealed to the Indian
government to halt the Sri Lankan government's call for provincial
council nominations, saying that continued turbulance on the island
would prevent free and fair elections.
   The Sri Lanka Election Commission on Wednesday announced that
nominations for the nine provincial councils would be accepted
March 2-9.
   The councils are designed to appease Tamil militants by giving
Tamils greater say in local government. The militants have been
calling for self-rule or independence in northern and eastern areas.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the central
government and army.
   India last July signed a peace accord with Sri Lanka aimed at
ending the four-year guerrilla war for an independent Tamil
homeland. But the largest rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, has rejected the pact, and India has sent more than
42,000 troops to the island to curb the Tigers.
   India became involved because it has 60 million ethnic Tamils in
its southern states who are sympathetic with the Sri Lankan Tamils.
   On Thursday, members of the moderate Tamil United Liberation
Front said in the southern Indian city of Madras that the call for
provincial council nominations was premature.
   They noted that the peace accord calls for unification of
administration in the northern and eastern provinces. Front leaders
said the two regions should be formally merged before council
nominations and elections are held.
   The leaders have taken refuge in Madras because of threats from
militant Tamils.

   One-year-old Patrick Binder was doing well
after surgery to implant a metal plate over the hole in his skull
where he was attached to Siamese twin brother, Benjamin, the
hospital said.
   The West German infants, whose heads were separated in an
historic operation last fall, were listed in stable condition at
Johns Hopkins Hospital, said spokeswoman Lisa Hillman.
   Patrick's surgery was Thursday, and Benjamin underwent an
identical six-hour operation Wednesday.
   Doctors also said the twins appeared to be making better
neurological progress since the separation, Ms. Hillman said.
Doctors had feared they might suffer vision loss as a result of the
surgery, in which surgeons cut a major vein supplying blood to
their separate brains.
   Bone will grow over the titanium mesh plates, which remain in
their heads permanently, doctors said.

   Fire swept through the lobby of a
two-story college dormitory today, forcing many students to jump 20
feet to safety and injuring at least eight students, authorities
said.
   ``Most had just come from a party, so they were awake,'' when
the fire broke after midnight in Mixon Hall, a men's dormitory at
Chowan College, said police Officer Bryant Cooke.
   One student was listed in critical condition and another in
serious condition at Duke University Medical Center, said Trish
Womble, director of nursing at Roanoke-Chowan Hospital, where six
students were treated for minor burns.
   Many students jumped from second-story fire escapes and windows,
Cooke said. Cooke said one student was found unconscious, overcome
by smoke, on the second floor. Most students had evacuated on their
own by the time firefighters arrived.
   The cause of the fire was still under investigation, but Cooke
said, ``We're thinking arson.''
   The junior college has about 2,500 students.

   A hot-air balloon billed as the largest
ever built lifted off at sunrise today from a frozen lake on its
first flight.
   The Super Maine, 10 percent to 20 percent larger in volume than
the largest hot-air ballon on record, rose 50 feet off the ground
just before 6:30 a.m. with 25 crew members aboard.
   It stayed in the air, tethered to ropes, for several minutes
while 100 people watched from the western shore of Sebago Lake in
southern Maine.
   ``Everything's come together almost perfectly,'' project
coordinator and chief pilot Tom Handcock said after the flight,
which organizers hoped would earn them an entry in the Guinness
Book of Records.
   Organizers of the Super Maine project did not try to beat the
flight time of the Virgin Atlantic Flyer, which set records by
flying from Maine across the Atlantic Ocean last summer. Handcock
said they only wanted to build a balloon that was larger in volume
than the Flyer.
   To qualify as an air balloon, it had to lift off the ground, no
matter how briefly.
   The balloonists could not fly the balloon today even if they had
wanted to. Since organizers did not complete Federal Aviation
Administration paperwork in time, they were required to keep the
balloon tethered, Handcock said.
   After the first flight, organizers took the balloon up several
more times, adding more people each time to its 8-by-12-foot
gondola. At one point, 60 people were in the balloon's basket, with
one man hanging onto the side as the balloon lifted off the the
ground a few feet.
   The 210-foot-high, 168-foot-wide balloon is considered the
largest because it holds 2.6 million cubic feet of hot air, between
300,000 and 500,000 cubic feet more than the 195-foot Virgin
Atlantic Flyer, Handcock said.
   Aboard the gondola on the first flight were 25 commercial
balloon pilots, who built the balloon with the help of 25 other
balloon enthusiasts from New England, Kentucky, Maryland and Canada.
   The balloon was constructed of a polyethylene derivative called
olifin and was assembled with an adhesive the organizers developed,
said Handcock and his wife, Mig. It was constructed in four days in
a Massachusetts warehouse and trucked to Maine.
   Richard Branson and Per Linstrand flew the Virgin Atlantic Flyer
into the Guinness Book last July by taking the balloon 2,789.6
miles from Carrabassett Valley to a brief touchdown in Ireland
before it crashed into the sea. The balloon flew 87.7 mph and took
31 hours and 38 minutes to cross the Atlantic.

   Government soldiers killed 33
anti-Marxist rebels in the past week in three battles in southern
Mozambique, the national news agency reported today.
   Eleven guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance were
killed Tuesday in fighting at Bela Vista, the AIM agency said. It
cited an unidentified military source.
   In addition, 17 rebels died in a battle at Funhalouro, north of
the capital, and five were killed at Namaacha, 45 miles west of
Maputo, the news agency said.
   AIM said the two battles were fought in the past week, but did
not give the exact date. The AIM report made no mention of
government casualties in any of the conflicts.
   The rebels have been fighting for 11 years to topple
Mozambique's Marxist government. Guerrilla attacks on both civilian
and military targets have seriously disrupted the economy and food
supplies. An estimated 4.5 million of the country's 14.5 million
people are in need of food aid.
   Mozambique accuses neighboring South Africa of aiding the
rebels, but South Africa claims it stopped providing support under
the terms of a mutual non-aggresion pact signed by the two
countries in 1984.
   Both sides regularly accuse the other of violations and often
trade harsh criticism.

   A computer whiz may face the death
penalty if convicted of any of seven murder charges stemming from a
shooting rampage through the Silicon Valley plant where he once
worked.
   Richard Wade Farley, 39, was arraigned Thursday in San Jose
Municipal Court on the homicide charges, three counts of attempted
murder and a count each of felony vandalism and second-degree
burglary. He did not enter a plea.
   After the two-minute hearing, Santa Clara County Deputy District
Attorney Alan Nudelman said he will seek capital punishment in the
murder cases.
   About 200 employees at ESL Inc. on Thursday toured the building
where the attack occurred two days earlier as ``part of the healing
process,'' said company spokeswoman Edie Cartwright.
   The employees saw walls, floors and furniture riddled with
bullet holes and dozens of computer terminals with screens shot
out, Cartwright said. Many windows were shattered. Bloodstains were
painted over and most rugs removed.
   The building, where 300 of the company's 2,200 employees mainly
work on classified defense projects, was to reopen its first floor
today. Employees will return Monday to the second floor, where most
of the damage occurred.
   The first funeral for victims of the attack was scheduled later
today for Glenda Moritz, a 27-year-old planner.
   Farley was brought to court in handcuffs and shackles from an
isolation cell where guards said he has been quiet and apparently
writing letters.
   It was with rambling and threatening notes sent through the mail
that the software engineer harassed former co-worker Laura Black
before finally wounding her and two others and killing seven people
Tuesday in a six-hour siege at ESL in Sunnyvale, 40 miles south of
San Francisco.
   Investigators and colleagues said Farley apparently had no
criminal record, was honorably discharged after 11 years in the
Navy, was intelligent and had held several high-security defense
jobs.
   While in jail, Farley ``has been kind of pondering his
thoughts,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Cary Colla, who added he had asked
for envelopes to mail letters. Farley, Colla said, also inquired
about phone privileges.
   Wearing glasses and a red jumpsuit, Farley looked around the
courtroom during arraignment before Judge Hugh Mullin III, who
ordered that he continue to be held without bail. He is to return
to court March 4 to enter a plea.
   Gregory C. Paraskou, a deputy county public defender appointed
to represent Farley, said he had not spoken to his client about a
plea.
   Farley is being held in a isolation cell reserved for high-risk
inmates. It is outfitted with a large observation window which
allows guards close supervision.
   Still recovering Thursday were the four ESL employees injured in
the attack, including Black, who was in stable condition with a
gunshot wound to her shoulder.
   The 26-year-old electrical engineer, called the main target of
the shootings, said she was haunted for four years by strange
gifts, threatening letters and obsessive behavior involving a man
she never dated.

   A son of polygamist matriarch Vickie
Singer has been found in contempt for refusing to answer a grand
jury's questions about the bombing of a Mormon chapel and
subsequent two-week standoff with police.
   After a brief closed hearing, U.S. District Judge J. Thomas
Greene opened the courtroom Thursday while arguments were presented
on the government's motion seeking the contempt citation against
Hans Benjamin Singer, 15.
   Greene ordered the teen-ager under house arrest at the Fairview
home of Ramon and Harriett Swapp while the matter is under appeal
to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The Swapps are the parents of Addam Swapp, who is married to two
daughters of Mrs. Singer.
   Earlier this month, four members of the clan _ including Mrs.
Singer, widow of slain polygamist John Singer _ pleaded innocent to
federal charges stemming from the bombing of a Mormon chapel in
Marion and the 13-day siege that followed at the clan's nearby farm.
   The standoff ended Jan. 28 when Corrections Lt. Fred House was
killed and clan patriarch Addam Swapp was wounded. Swapp, 26; his
brother Jonathan, 21; Mrs. Singer, 44, and her son, John Timothy
Singer, 21, were indicted on counts ranging from conspiracy,
possession and use of a bomb and firearms violations to assault and
attempting to kill federal agents.
   A homicide charge is expected to be filed by prosecutors later
this month.
   On Feb. 5 and again Wednesday, Hans Singer refused to answer
questions from the grand jury. The boy refused to give information
on matters about which he had ``personal, eyewitness knowledge,''
Greene said.
   Greene said he had granted the youth immunity from prosecution,
a move authorized by the Department of Justice so that there could
be no question of his incriminating himself.
   Singer's refusal to answer questions from the panel came in the
wake of Greene's ruling that the boy had no rights to
``parent-child privilege.''
   The youth's attorney, Steven Kuhnhausen, argued that his client
``has deeply held religious beliefs that he believes preclude him
from being compelled to testify against his mother or members of
his extended family.''
   U.S. Attorney Brent Ward argued that there was every indication
that the boy could be a competent witness possessing first-hand
knowledge of crimes ``by persons already indicted and persons not
yet indicted.''
   According to Mrs. Singer's diary, used as evidence at a previous
hearing, the youth accompanied Addam and Jonathan Swapp when they
bombed the chapel.

   AIDS should be attacked by creating a series of
specialized institutes that bring together key scientific
disciplines, medical experts told the president's AIDS commission.
   The strategy, modeled after the comprehensive cancer center
program of the early 1970s, would provide a useful
cross-fertilization of ideas for dealing with the complex disease,
they said.
   Medical schools and universities would be logical places to
build four or five such comprehensive centers, Richard Ross, dean
of the medical faculty at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore, said Thursday.
   The centers could combine such disciplines as prevention,
education, patient care, studies in humans and basic research into
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he said
Thursday.
   Ideas developed in the laboratory could then be tested quickly
in patients, he said.
   Another AIDS expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, coordinator of federal
AIDS research for the National Institutes of Health, defended today
the rigorous testing process promising AIDS treatments must undergo
before approval.
   ``The reason that only one drug has been made available, AZT, is
because it is the only drug that thus far has been shown in
scientifically controlled trials to be safe and effective. It isn't
a question of there are a lot of drugs around and only one is being
released. That's the only one that has been shown to be
effective,'' Fauci said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   Ross told the Presidential Commission on the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic that lack of space is one obstacle
in developing comprehensive AIDS centers.
   ``We have the people, we have the interest, we have the
commitment, but we don't have the space,'' he said. ``And we need
your help in getting the space.''
   Retired Adm. James D. Watkins, chairman of the commission, asked
Ross to develop details of his proposal and supply them to the
commission later.
   In an interview, Ross said he did not know how much the proposed
centers would cost. He estimated the buildings alone would cost
some $75 million to $100 million apiece, but said he did not know
what an annual operating budget would be.
   In his testimony, he also urged that about an equal amount of
money as would go to the comprehensive centers be earmarked for
institutions proposing research in one or more subject areas, short
of the comprehensive approach.
   The idea of comprehensive centers was also proposed by AIDS
researcher Jerome Groopman of Deaconess Hospital in Boston, who
urged consideration of establishing 10 to 15 such centers.
   He also suggested federal AIDS research grants be extended
beyond the traditional three-year or five-year terms because
research toward a vaccine or cure could well take far longer.
   On testing drugs for AIDS treatment, Fauci, who also is director
of National Institue of Allergies and Infectious Disease, said in
the ABC interview, ``If you look at the clinical trials that are
going on now, there are a number of drugs that are in clinical
trial, hopefully they will be expeditiously shown to either be safe
and effective or will be discarded because they have been proven
not to be safe and effective.''

   If President Reagan's proposed budget actually
becomes America's budget for 1989, it will mean that the federal
government will collect $1,687 in individual income taxes for every
man, woman and child in the country.
   That's an increase of $65 from the budget he presented a year
ago, due almost entirely to economic growth.
   The mathematics are straightforward. Divide the $412.4 billion
expected through individual income taxes during the year by 244.4
million people, the U.S. population as of Jan. 1. Last year, when
the total population was 242.1 million, the assumption was that
individual income taxes would bring in $392.8 billion.
   According to the budget proposal Reagan sent to Capitol Hill on
Thursday, the federal government expects its total receipts in 1989
to be $964.7 billion. Besides the personal income tax, the sum
includes corporate income taxes of $117.7 billion and Social
Security taxes of $354.6 billion. The rest will come from estate
and gift taxes, customs duties, excise taxes and the like.
   Using the same population formula for this year, the total
receipts represent $3,947 for everyone from the tiniest to the
oldest centenarian.

   The source of money flowing in to the government has changed
greatly in the Reagan years, the administration points out. The
individual and corporate income tax share of total receipts in 1989
is expected to be 4.7 percentage points less than 1980 when three
out of every five dollars came from income taxes.

   The administration tagged two displaced worker programs for
extinction because they have not ``operated efficiently to help
workers adjust.''
   One provides unemployment benefit payments when unemployment
insurance runs out. The administration feels those additional weeks
of payments ``encourage workers to delay efforts to seek new
opportunities in the hope that somehow their old jobs will
reappear.'' In the current year, the program cost $48 million in
federal money.
   The second program, costing $287 million in 1988, pays states
for helping dislocated workers find new occupations that use their
skills, get training in new skills or meet the cost of looking for
jobs. That money, says the budget, should go into a new Worker
Readjustment Program.
   The administration also wants to drop a work incentive program
that provided job services, training and public service employment
to welfare recipients.
   ``Although its aim is to help curb welfare dependency, it has
not proved successful or cost-effective,'' the proposal said. The
government budgeted $93 million for the program this year.

   Reagan's budget proposal for 1988 asked Congress to tack on $1
for every ticket for international travel to and from the United
States to be used for a government program that encourages foreign
travel to the United States.
   Congress did not pass the legislation last year and the
administration wants it brought up again.

<TEXT>
   Money for recreation is to be cut back under the proposal from
$1.7 billion this year to $1.4 billion.
   To make that cut, the administration wants to reduce the amount
spent for buying land from $232 million to $51 million. And it
proposes a halt in buying some land for park and refuge purposes
through 1993 _ except for wetlands acquired with revenue from sale
of duck hunting stamps and the like.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The budget also makes clear that pardons are on the increase.
Last year, there were only 23 pardons granted by the president.
That number is estimated to increase to 50 this fiscal year and 50
again in the next. There was no explanation. The number of
``denials and no actions,'' _ 290 in 1987 _ is expected to increase
slightly to 300 this year and next.

   After a police detective was fatally shot in a
drug raid, Mayor Raymond Flynn criticized the federal government as
a missing partner in the fight against ``America's vicious cycle of
drugs and guns.''
   Detective Sherman C. Griffiths, 36, died Thursday of a head
wound suffered Wednesday night. His death and those of two other
officers since October were related to drug or weapon violations.
   Flynn and Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache on Thursday
claimed Washington is relaxing handgun controls and drug
enforcement and rehabilitation programs just when tougher measures
are needed.
   ``They've almost given up at the federal government,'' said
Roache. ``But we haven't given up in Boston. We're doing everything
humanly possible to protect our neighborhoods.''
   ``This is a very, very sad day for the Boston Police
Department,'' Flynn said. ``America's vicious cycle of drugs and
guns has claimed another victim.
   ``Great efforts are being made by our police department. They're
out there doing their job every day, but there's a partner that's
missing,'' said Flynn. ``We need allies on the federal level.''
   ``We're not satisfied here with nice catchwords about drugs, we
want good solid programs,'' said Flynn. ``At least we shouldn't
throw up our hands at our border and say nothing can be done.''
   Griffiths was shot when he and five other plainclothes officers,
armed with a search warrant, tried to force their way into an
apartment in the Dorchester section to look for illegal drugs.
   Two shots were fired from inside, and one bullet hit Griffiths.
One officer returned fire, but did not wound anyone in the
apartment.
   Griffiths, who was married and the father of two, died at Boston
City Hospital.
   Albert Lewin, 33, of Boston, pleaded innocent to a murder charge
and four other related weapons and assault charges at his
arraignment Thursday. He was ordered held without bail, a court
clerk said.
   Four other people pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy to
violate drug laws, said police spokesman James Jordan. Trial was
scheduled Feb. 29. A sixth person was arrested today and also is
accused of murder and related offenses.
   The first of the three officers to die since Oct. 26 was
Detective Roy Sergei, 42, who died three weeks after being wounded
in a shootout. His partner was also wounded but survived.
   The suspect in that shooting, Ted Otsuki, is on the FBI's most
wanted list.
   On Feb. 10, Detective Thomas J. Gill, 38, died after he was
struck by an Amtrak train while searching for guns taken in a
housebreak.
   Two officers, one on the Boston force and one with the
Metropolitan District Police, were wounded during a drug bust last
month. An alleged cocaine dealer turned a shotgun on an undercover
officer in the Jan. 29 incident and was killed in the ensuing
shootout.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said today
America faces higher risks because of President Reagan's military
budget, which kills some weapons and reduces troop strength.
   The reductions were sent to Congress on Thursday as part of the
budget's military spending package, which was cut in the effort to
reduce federal deficits.
   Carlucci said he chose to cut by eliminating some older weapons
and by small decreases in troop strength, rather than by wholesale
reductions.
   ``What it translates into is a smaller military force,''
Carlucci said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``It clearly means higher
risks. But we have elected to do this rather than hollow out the
force.''
   ``We want to maintain good people, adequate readiness, good
sustainability and we want to continue the modernization program of
those weapons that we consider absolutely essential and we want to
do so in the most cost-effective way,'' he said.
   Reagan's military budget was praised by lawmakers.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, told Carlucci on Thursday that he made ``exactly the
right choices.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a critic of past Pentagon budgets,
praised Carlucci for a ``very helpful'' budget.
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said, ``the Pentagon appears to have
taken its responsibility for budget cutting more seriously in this
proposed budget than in those of the past years.''
   The budget proposed to authorize $299.5 billion in Pentagon
spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, including $294
billion that would actually be paid out during the 12-month period.
That compares with $291.4 billion authorized for the current year.
   The overall Pentagon budget level had been set during talks
between the administration and Congress last November, when Reagan
approved the $299.5 billion level.
   He originally had wanted $332.4 billion, which would have been
an increase after three years of decreased spending. Those
reductions followed large buildups during Reagan's first four years
in office, when the Pentagon budget doubled as part of Reagan's
pledge to ``rearm America.''
   In the past eight weeks, Carlucci said, civilian and military
leaders have made ``hard choices'' to reduce spending by the $33
billion needed to reach the $299.5 billion level.
   Carlucci said he chose ``a smaller force that was fully ready to
perform its mission as opposed to a large force that was not ready.
The priorities in this budget were straightforward _ people,
readiness and efficient acquisition.''
   ``I believe these choices to be not in the best interest of our
national security posture,'' said Carlucci. ``However, I have made
them. They reflect the fiscal realities we face today and my
assessment of the direction'' the Pentagon should go.
   Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said ``in a fiscally constrained environment, we had to borrow
somewhat against the future to nourish the deterrent stance we have
today.''
   Among the choices:
   _The total strength of the four uniformed services will drop by
34,000 men and women, to a total of 2,138,000. The Air Force will
take the largest reduction, accounting for 23,000 of the total
cuts. But Carlucci also called for a 4.3 percent pay hike for the
troops and said the money is needed to keep up the high quality of
recruits and re-enlistments.
   To meet the reductions, the Army plans to cut its brigade of
motorized infantry at Fort Lewis, Wash., and cancel a previously
scheduled activation of two light infantry battalions in Alaska.
   The Navy will scrap plans to establish a 14th air wing at the
Miramar, Calif., Naval Air Station. Sixteen frigates and a
missile-firing submarine will be retired and the sailors will be
sent to other ships. The Air Force will deactivate two fighter
wings and start deactivating a third.
   Other reductions include Army plans to retire 450 Vietnam-era
utility helicopters and 170 scout copters; cancel the troubled
Aquila surveillance drone program and stop production of Copperhead
laser-guided artillery shells; cancel development of the
Anti-Tactical Missile; and develop only one new light helicopter
instead of two.
   _Delay development of the single-warhead Midgetman
nuclear-tipped missile, but include $200 million to keep the
program alive until a new administration can decide its fate. Nunn
is a supporter of the weapon. Carlucci also proposed putting all
100 MX weapons aboard trains, rather than having 50 of the
10-warhead weapons aboard trains and the other 50 in land-based
silos in Wyoming.
   _Kill the Air Force anti-satellite weapon, which Congress had
banned for two years from final-stage testing. The Pentagon had
pushed for continued development of the weapon, but Carlucci said
it was dropped this year because of the continued opposition from
Capitol Hill.

<HEAD>Reports Said to Indicate Serious Human Rights Abuses in Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry said the regime of
Cuban President Fidel Castro violates most civil and political
rights and that hundreds of thousands of people want to leave the
nation, a newspaper reported.
   The right-wing Madrid daily ABC also quoted the confidential
report as saying the United States was hoping to persuade the
United Nations to include Cuba among nations periodically studied
for possible human rights violations.
   Susana Ansorena, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, today confirmed
that a report on the overall situation in Cuba had been compiled,
but she refused to reveal its contents and described it as a
``normal, confidential ministry document.''
   ``Spain has been consistently concerned with human rights in
Cuba and has done everything within its possibilities to defend
them,'' she added.
   As reported Thursday in ABC, the document stated that, ``given
the characteristics of the Cuban regime, the number of people that
seek to leave the country is estimated at between 200,000 and
500,000.''
   ABC quoted the report as saying the Castro regime ``violates
most civil and political rights, including the rights of free
speech and assembly, has a judicial system that fails to protect
rights and currently has between 1,000 and 10,000 political
prisoners.''
   The newspaper said the Foreign Ministry also found that ``a
campaign to rectify errors'' under way for more than a year in
Cuba, had led to ``a serious economic and ideological crisis.''
   ABC said the document went on to add that ``the line adopted by
Cuba to overcome its crisis does not coincide with _ and in fact is
contrary to _ that which (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev
envisions for the Soviet Union and the Socialist bloc.''
   Ms. Ansorena said the government of Socialist Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez saw the publication of the confidential report ``as
an attempt to prejudge its position and thus pressure it into
condemning the human rights situation in Cuba'' in an upcoming
meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva.

   The independent counsel investigating the
Iran-Contra affair has retained noted constitutional scholar
Laurence Tribe to represent his office during an expected Supreme
Court review of the special prosecutor law.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh on Thursday asked the high
court for permission to allow Tribe, a Harvard University law
professor, to file a friend-of-the court brief to defend the
constitutionality of the special prosecutor law.
   Another independent counsel, Alexia Morrison, has asked the
court to review last month's decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here that struck down the contitutionality of judicial
appointment of special prosecutors to investigate alleged
wrongdoing by high government officials.
   The divided appellate panel ruled that court appointment of
special prosecutors, or independent counsels as they are formally
called, encroaches on the president's exclusive consstitutional
authority to enforce the law.
   The court could agree to take the case as early as Monday.
   Unlike Morrison, Walsh has a parallel appointment from the
Justice Department to investigate the Iran-Contra affair, so the
appeals court decision does not threaten his prosecutorial
authority.
   But his office participated as a friend of the court in
appellate court arguments last year on the challenge to the law.

   A second round of high wind blowing across
Southern California killed a child, left a boater missing and
fanned two fires that injured six people and left at least 55
homeless today, officials said.
   Hundreds of campers were evacuated from Yosemite National Park
late Thursday and early today when wind topping 60 mph knocked down
trees up to 100 feet tall, park spokeswoman Mallory Smith said.
   One tree crashed through a cabin and crushed 9-year-old Jasmine
Bitts of Garden Grove, who was staying with her mother and a
companion, who suffered minor injuries.
   At sea, the Coast Guard resumed an air-sea search today for a
lone sailor reported missing Thursday on a 30-foot boat.
   The boater, Chris Dodd, 28, of Los Altos, set sail for the
mainland Tuesday from Santa Catalina Island in 12-foot seas. He had
been rescued by the Coast Guard once before this week, when a
galley water hose broke Monday and his boat swamped, Avalon Harbor
Patrol Officer John Bray said.
   In Los Angeles, the dry Santa Ana wind blowing down out of the
Great Basin in Nevada and western Utah spread flames to houses in
two separate blazes today.
   Six people, including a firefighter, were injured when an
unfinished apartment building caught fire shortly after midnight,
and wind-swept embers spread the blaze to a 10-unit apartment
complex and four other buildings.
   Twenty-five to 30 people were left homeless and damage was
estimated at $345,000, fire spokesman Jim Williamson said.
   In East Los Angeles, a fire in a commercial building spread to
three houses early today, said Los Angeles County fire spokesman
Bob Haskell. More than 20 people were left homeless.
   That fire was blamed on electrical wires that were blown into
contact over a roofing company, sending sparks into two propane
tanks. Damage was estimated at $500,000.
   Late Thursday, the Santa Ana wind knocked out power to about
2,000 Southern California Edison Co. customers and an additional
estimated 1,500 city Department of Water and Power customers,
officials said.
   Earlier this week, in the first blast of blustery weather, wind
was blamed for four deaths.
   One man was electrocuted when a power line was blown down, and
three were killed in a highway accident triggered when a
tractor-trailer rig buffeted by wind slewed off the highway and
into two cars.

   In one moment, the shouts of happiness
turned to groans of sorrow and golden hopes became dashed dreams.
   ``Oh no, not again,'' exclaimed one hometown fan as he watched
Olympic speed skater Dan Jansen fall to the ice with about 200
meters left in the 1000-meter race at the Calgary games.
   ``He's got too much hurt,'' said another. ``He's trying too bad
to win something for his sister.''
   Jansen's friends and fans had gathered Thursday night to watch
the televised race at a tavern next to the state fairgrounds, where
earlier this month he won the world sprint speed skating
championship.
   On this night, however, they saw Jansen lose his balance just as
he did four nights earlier, trying to carry the hope for an Olympic
medal and the burden of his sister's death.
   ``Danny comes in here all the time,'' said Randy Strumberger, a
bartender at the tavern. ``When he comes in again, I'll run around
the bar and hug him and buy him his first drink.''
   For Jansen's friends and family in this Milwaukee suburb of
nearly 64,000, Thursday's race was another chapter in a week of
tragedy. On Sunday, Jansen's sister, Jane, died of leukemia. Hours
later, Jansen fell in the first turn of the 500-meter race, in
which he was favored for a medal. He did not finish.
   Between then and Thursday, the community rallied behind their
hometown hero, and thousands of people signed a banner that was
sent to Jansen in Calgary.
   The banner proclaimed: ``Dan be strong. Keep the faith.
Wisconsin is with you all the way.''
   ``It's amazing the number of people I run into who know the
Jansen family,'' said Jim Hill, a customer at the tavern. ``This is
a small community.''
   But the dreams of Jansen overcoming his emotional turmoil and
skating to victory and gold were shattered in an instant once again.
   ``It was horrifying,'' said his father, Harry Jansen, who
watched the race at home with other family members. ``It was
unbelievable, especially that it happened like that on a
straightaway.''
   Jansen spoke with his son earlier in the day. ``I asked him how
he was doing, and he said he was feeling pretty good. But then he
would read some of the nice telegrams he got and he said would
start feeling down again.
   ``I told him he's a champion in my book.''
   But while Jansen believed his son fell in the earlier race
because of pressures from the sister's death, he doubted the same
was true for Thursday's fall.
   ``He was skating too good,'' Jansen said. ``His concentration
looked good. His stamina was good. I thought he was going to skate
a good race, and he did.''
   Jansen said he would offer his son encouragement when he arrived
home today for his sister's funeral on Saturday.
   ``I'm proud of him,'' he said. ``He did well just to get out
there and set an example for everyone else.''

   Pope John Paul II today blamed the East and
West for the world's economic and social injustices and said their
``exaggerated concern for security'' widened the gap between rich
and poor.
   In his seventh encyclical, the Polish-born pontiff said the
injustices forced developing countries to be ``cogs on a gigantic
wheel.''
   The 102-page document is an authoritative statement of the
church's social doctrine. Titled in Latin ``Sollicitudo Rei
Socialis,'' meaning the social concern of the church, it represents
an effort by John Paul to give force to themes he has espoused
during the 9{ years of his papacy.
   The pontiff said the church took a critical view of both liberal
capitalism and Marxist collectivism and that both systems needed
urgent reform. He also called for democratic political change in
nations with corrupt, dictatorial or authoritarian governments.
   He called for reform of the international trade, monetary and
financial systems and free access for all to advanced technology.
   ``An unacceptably exaggerated concern for security ... deadens
the impulse toward united cooperation by all ... to the detriment
especially of peaceful peoples who are impeded from their rightful
access to the goods meant for all,'' he said.
   The document also said the church should avoid accumulating
``superfluous church ornaments and costly furnishings.''
   ``It could be obligatory to sell these goods in order to provide
food, drink, clothing and shelter for those who lack these
things,'' it said.
   At a Vatican news conference today, two prelates said the
passage on selling church property was ``prophetic'' but did not
represent a new position.
   Cardinal Roger Etchegary, president of the Vatican's Justice and
Peace Commission, said the passage was symbolic, recalling the time
John Paul gave away his pastoral ring during a visit to Brazil.
   Etchegary said the encyclical was not for the Third World or any
particular groups. ``Its strength of attraction consists in the
insistence of depicting the world in its globality and its
fundamental unity,'' he said.
   The pope reviewed problems of social development in the two
decades since the encyclical ``Populorum Progressio'' (Development
of Peoples) was published by Pope Paul VI in 1967.
   John Paul broke new ground in his forceful attack on the
division of the world into ideological and military blocs, which he
called ``a direct obstacle to the real transformation of the
conditions of underdevelopment in the developing and less advanced
countries.''
   A Vatican official familiar with the drafting of the letter said
it reflected the pope's Polish background, and addressed problems
of people living in the East bloc that had not been raised in Paul
VI's encyclical.
   John Paul complained of the suppression by some governments of
economic initiative, which he said led to emigration, and that some
countries were deprived of political and economic sovereignty.
   While the East and West blocs existed in 1967, ``in light of the
subsequent economic and political repercussions and dependencies,
the danger is seen to be much greater,'' the document said.
   ``Each of the two blocs harbors in its own way a tendency toward
imperialism ... or toward forms of neo-colonialism,'' it added.
   The pope said tension between the two blocs has dominated the
world political scene for 40 years through the ``cold war,'' ``wars
by proxy'' and the threat of nuclear war.
   John Paul said world peace won't be achieved ``unless the
world's leaders come to recognize that interdependence in itself
demands the abandonment of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of
all forms of economic, military or political imperialism, and the
transformation of mutual distrust into collaboration.''
   Noting that the danger of nuclear conflict ``seems to have
receded'' and that the superpowers recently agreed to eliminate a
class of nuclear weapons, he added, ``The existence and opposition
of the blocs continue to be a real and worrying fact which still
colors the world picture.''
   ``Conflicts ... between East and West (are) an important cause
of the retardation or stagnation of the South,'' the document said.
   ``The developing countries, instead of becoming autonomous
nations concerned with their own progress toward a just sharing in
the goods and services meant for all, become parts of a machine,
cogs on a giant wheel.''
   Explaining the church's role, he wrote, ``The church's social
doctrine is not a `third way' between liberal capitalism and
Marxist collectivism, nor even a possible alternative to other
solutions less radically opposed to one another: rather, it
constitutes a category of its own ... of theology and particularly
of moral theology.''
   The document said that 20 years after the ``Populorum
Progressio'' encyclical, hopes for development ``appear very far
from being realized,'' and for many poor people ``the situation has
noticeably worsened.''
   It also lamented an overemphasis on the economic side of
development.
   On other points, the pope denounced totalitarianism and
terrorism.
   He said government birth control campaigns subject people to
``intolerable pressures, including economic ones, in order to force
them to submit to this new form of oppression.''

   Although the Super Tuesday primaries of
March 8 are grabbing most of the campaign attention, South Dakota
will bask in a bit of the political limelight as well next week.
   ``We're suddenly involved in the process of picking the next
president of the United States,'' said Clint Roberts, the former
congressman who came up with the idea of an early primary.
   The state's presidential primary election had been held early in
June, but in 1986 the legislature moved it to Feb. 23, sandwiched
between the New Hampshire primary and Super Tuesday.
   South Dakota's decision to move the presidential portion of its
prirmary from June to February drew a steady trickle of candidates
for campaign visits last fall, but the frequency of the visits
picked up late in 1987 as candidates combined trips to Iowa and
South Dakota.
   The trickle turned into a steady stream this week.
   Officials for the campaigns of Vice President George Bush and
Sen. Bob Dole have said Dole had an early lead in South Dakota
because he campaigned and built a strong organization, but that
Bush has gained somewhat in the past month or so.
   Dole, Bush and Pat Robertson have all advertised on South Dakota
television.
   In one television ad, Dole stresses that he's the best candidate
for the Midwest because he grew up in a Kansas farm town.
   Dole has visited the state frequently, starting in 1986, when he
appeared on behalf of Republican candidates for state office.
   On the Democratic side, state party leaders believe Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis have
the best chances in Tuesday's primary because they have the
strongest state campaign organizations.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois is also seen as having strong
support.
   Gephardt and Dukakis have spent the most time campaigning in
South Dakota. Gephardt picked up the endorsement of Sen. Tom
Daschle on Wednesday.
   Following the Iowa caucuses, Gephardt, Simon and Dukakis moved
extra campaign staff into South Dakota.
   South Dakota Secretary of State Joyce Hazeltine predicted
Wednesday that almost half of the state's registered Republicans
and a third of Democrats will vote in Tuesday's presidential
primary.
   Both figures are higher than the turnout for the Democratic
primary in 1984 and the Republican primary in 1980, the years on
which Hazeltine based her predictions.
   All 18 delegates the South Dakota Republican Party will send to
the Republican National Convention will be selected in the
presidential primary. The GOP has set a 20 percent threshold in the
primary, meaning any candidate who gets less than 20 percent of the
popular vote will not get any delegates in South Dakota.
   The Democratic National Committee had objected to South Dakota's
early primary because it falls before the party's national deadline
for holding primaries, but a compromise was worked out so the
primary results could still mean something.
   As a result of the compromise, South Dakota Democrats have
agreed that Tuesday's primary results are officially non-binding,
but South Dakota party officials say the delegates eventually
selected will be apportioned according to the popular vote.
   However, the statewide caucus on March 12 will have the option
of accepting or rejecting the results of the primary. If the
primary's results are rejected, the national convention delegates
would be awarded to conform to the presidential preferences of the
people attending the caucus.
   The Democrats have a threshold of 15 percent for candidates to
begin claiming delegates.
   Of the 19 Democratic delegates from South Dakota, 10 will be
based on the primary and another five pledged delegates will be
chosen by the Democratic State Central Committee on April 23. The
four remaining delegates, top state party officials, will be
unpledged.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Mario Biaggi faces a fate that has
befallen only one congressman in the past 126 years: expulsion from
the U.S. House of Representatives.
   That expulsion came eight years ago, when Rep. Michael ``Ozzie''
Myers, a Pennsylvania Democrat, was expelled from Congress on Oct.
2, 1980, five weeks after his conviction in the Abscam bribery
scandal.
   Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., who was also convicted in
Abscam, resigned his seat on March 11, 1982, shortly before the
Senate was about to make him the first senator expelled since the
Civil War.
   In 1861 and 1862, fourteen senators and three members of the
House from the South were expelled for siding with the Confederacy
in the war between the states.
   The first expulsion took place in 1797, when William Blount, one
of Tennessee's first two senators, was turned out of office.
President James Madison had accused Blount of conspiring with the
British and the Creek and Cherokee Indians to conquer West Florida,
then under the control of Spain.
   From Blount to Myers, only 19 men _ four representatives, 15
senators _ have been expelled in the entire 200-year history of the
Senate and the House of Representatives.
   In 1967, the House voted to exclude Rep. Adam Clayton Powell,
D-N.Y., but he won a court suit prohibiting Congress from denying
him a seat.
   The list of congressman indicted and convicted in office runs
much longer. Some resigned their seats; others lost re-election
bids.
   Then-Rep. Thomas J. Lane, D-Mass., spent four months in jail in
1956 for evading $38,542 in income taxes, but was re-elected that
fall.
   Myers was one of six House members convicted and sent to prison
in the Abscam scandal. Myers and four others _ Reps. John Jenrette,
D-S.C., John Muphy, D-N.Y., Frank Thompson, D-N.J., and Richard
Kelly, R-Fla. _ lost re-election bids a few months after their
indictments in 1980.
   Rep. Raymond Lederer, D-Pa., won re-election in 1980 while under
indictment in that scandal, but was convicted two months later and
resigned his seat before going to prison.
   Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, was indicted in April 1983 and
convicted in 1984 of violating the 1978 Ethics in Government Act by
failing to report $333,978 in loans and other transactions on his
financial disclosure forms. The House voted to reprimand him in
July 1984. Hansen was freed in October 1987 after serving nearly
one year in prison.
   Last Dec. 18, the House voted 324-68 to reprimand Rep. Austin
Murphy, D-Pa., for hiring a no-show employee, misusing
congressional resources and twice having someone else cast votes
for him.
   The House ethics committee also decided last December that
former Rep. William H. Boner, D-Tenn., violated House rules by
using his campaign to obtain personal ownership rights of
equipment, a building, a car and other items worth more than
$200,000. But the committee said it ``lost jurisdiction'' when
Boner resigned last October to become mayor of Nashville.
   The Justice Department last March dropped a grand jury probe of
Boner's finances.
   The House ethics committee unanimously cleared Rep. Fernand J.
St Germain, D-R.I., last April of allegations of financial
wrong-doing, and Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, advoided
disciplinary action after she reimbursed the Treasury $45,000 paid
to an aide who had moved from Washington to New York.
   The ethics panel is investigating allegations that Rep. Charles
Rose, D-N.C., converted more than $63,000 in campaign money to
personal use, and that Fofo I.F. Sunia, American Samoa's non-voting
delegate, had ``ghost'' employees on his House payroll.
   Rep. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn., was indicted last April on charges
of bank, mail and tax fraud. No trial date has been set.
   Then-Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, D-La., was indicted in July
1979 on charges of buying votes in the 1978 elections and violating
federal campain finance laws. He was acquitted of some vote-buying
counts and the others were dropped, and a federal appeals court
dismissed the charges of campaign finance law violations.
   Then-Rep. Joshua Eilberg, D-Pa., was indicted in October 1978 on
federal charges of illegally receiving compensation to help a
Philadelphia hospital get a $14.5 million federal grant. He pleaded
guilty in February 1979 and was sentenced to five years' probation
and fined $10,000.
   Then-Rep. Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa., was indicted in the fall of
1978 on 13 counts of bribery, conspiracy and perjury. After a
mistrial, he resigned from the House in January 1980 for health
reasons after the House ethics committee had accused him of 25
rules violations. In February 1980, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy
in a plea-bargaining arrangement and was given a year's probation.
   Then-Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr., D-Mich., was indicted in March
1978 and convicted in October 1978 on 29 felony counts of illegally
diverting employees' salaries to his personal use. Censured by the
House in 1979, Diggs resigned from Congress in 1980 and served
seven months of a three-year prison sentence.
   About two dozen members of the House have been censured for
misconduct, including two for sexual misconduct in 1983: Daniel B.
Crane, R-Ill., and Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass.
   Then-Sen. Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., was censured in 1967 for paying
personal bills with campaign funds. His son, Christopher, is now a
senator.

   An armed robber locked 10 people in a bank
vault and took an undetermined amount of cash from the First State
Bank of Goltry before fleeing, authorities said.
   FBI spokesman Dan Vogel said the robber was being sought today.
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said he drove away from the bank
Thursday afternoon.
   Among the captives who spent about an hour in the vault were
five bank examiners, employees and customers, said Highway Patrol
Lt. Larry Bennett. No one was injured.
   They were freed when a bank employee called her husband from a
phone hidden in the vault and gave him its combination, said Betty
Johnson, an administrative officer for the state banking department.
   She said the captives tried to call the sheriff's department,
but couldn't get through.
   Vogel said the robber represented himself as a loan applicant
interested in starting a small business. ``He sat down ... and at
that point he pulled his gun out,'' Vogel said.
   Ms. Johnson said the robber ordered people into the vault,
``tossed a briefcase in and told them to fill it.''

   Police fatally shot a man early today when he
allegedly cut one officer with a knife and threatened the officer's
partner, following a high-speed chase, police said.
   It was the second fatal shooting by Dallas police within 30
hours and the third this year. Two officers were killed last month
in separate shootings.
   The chase, which began when officers noticed that a car's
license plates were covered with cloth, ended on the Southern
Methodist University campus, the scene a few hours earlier of a
debate among Democratic presidential candidates, police said.
   The man, identified as Thomas Holloway, 34, of Dallas, was
pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital, said Bill White of
the Dallas County Medical Examiner's office.
   During the chase, police Sgt. R.D. Houston said, the officers
were told that the driver may have committed one or two armed
robberies involving a man with a knife. Houston declined to
identify the officers.
   When the car was stopped, the man got out and cut one officer on
the hand, police said. The officer fired once, striking the man,
police said. The officer's partner then opened fire when the man
allegedly threatened him with the knife.
   At least five shots were fired, police said.
   On Wednesday night, a man who pointed a loaded pistol at an
officer was shot dead by the officer's partner.
   Police Chief Billy Prince ordered two-officer patrols after two
officers were shot to death within nine days last month.
   A transient was killed by police Jan. 23 after he shot and
killed Officer John Chase in a downtown parking lot. In that
incident, officers said some bystanders had urged the transient to
shoot the officer.
   On Jan. 14, off-duty police Cpl. James Joe was killed in a
shootout with two burglary suspects in an apartment complex parking
lot.

   South Korea said today it plans to
lower import tariffs between 2 percent and 20 percent on cars and
more than 400 other products next month.
   The Ministry of Finance said the decision was part of efforts to
help curb inflation and reduce the country's trade surplus.
   A year ago, the United States formally asked South Korea to cut
tariffs and dismantle other import barriers for 982 items as a way
to correct the trade imbalance between the two countries. As a
result, South Korea slashed import tariffs between 5 percent and 20
percent on 266 items.
   Under the latest action, tariff rates for passenger cars will go
down from the current 50 percent to 30 percent.
   Some of the other 435 tariff cuts include: pianos, to 15 percent
from 20 percent; color TV sets to 15 percent from 30 percent;
computers, to 15 percent from 20 percent; film to 15 percent from
20 percent; cosmetics, to 25 percent from 30 percent; tiles, to 10
from 20 percent; and wheat and corn to 5 percent from 10 percent.

<HEAD>PLO Leader Addresses Human Rights Panel, U.S. Walkout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat made his debut before the
U.N. Human Rights Commission today and likened Israeli practices in
the occupied territories to the Nazi extermination campaign.
   Arafat also called for the formation of an ``international
force'' to protect Palestinian residents.
   The United States, he said, was encouraging Israel to ``carry on
with aggression and crimes'' by giving the Jewish state ``unlimited
support.''
   The U.S. delegation left the crowded conference hall before
Arafat began to speak from the dais.
   A member of the U.S. delegation, Marshall Breger, declined to
call it a walkout, saying only: ``We are not present.''
   The seat of the Israeli delegate, who has observer status in the
43-nation commission, remained empty. The delegate, Ambassador
Pinhas Eliav, said in a press statement that Arafat's presence at
the commission ``makes a mockery of everything that body stands
for.''
   In his speech, Arafat said the Israeli methods of dealing with
the recent Arab unrest in Gaza and the West Bank were ``operations
of collective extermination''.
   He said Israel was carrying out ``heinous massacres and crimes''
and was ``repeating today the same crimes committed against
humanity at the hands of the Fascists and the Nazis.''
   Arafat said more than 120 Palestinians had been killed in the
recent waves of unrests and more than 3,000 wounded. In addition,
he charged, 7,000 others were held in ``six new concentration
camps'' set up by the Israeli authorities.
   U.N. officials say Israeli gunfire has killed at least 55 Arabs
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since protests began Dec. 8. Israel
seized the territories during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Arafat charged that arms used by Israel in quelling the unrest
included ``internationally prohibited gases.'' He said he was
calling on the world to ``guarantee international protection for
our people'' against a ``terrorist and racist enemy who is
indifferent to international law.''
   Such protection could be assured, he said, through the formation
of an international force to enable the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state ``with Jerusalem as its capital.''
   When asked at a press conference to clarify his call for an
international force, he said no new forces would be needed because
U.N. peacekeeping troops were already in the area.
   Arafat reacted heatedly when another questioner asked him
whether he was hurting the situation by comparing Israeli practices
to the extermination of 6 million Jews by the Nazis.
   ``Have you been commissioned by Israel to ask the question?'' he
countered.
   Arafat said the U.S. threat to close the Palestine Liberation
Organization mission to the United Nations in New York was a
``threat against any other state that may have views divergent from
those of the United States.''
   He said a closure would be a violation of international law. As
a last resort the case should be taken to the International Court
of Justice, he said.

   Here are highlights of Pope John Paul II's
social encyclical released by the Vatican Friday:
   _ Problems caused by the East and West:
   ``Each of the two blocs harbors in its own way a tendency toward
imperialism ... or toward forms of neo-colonialism. ... Conflicts
... between East and West (are) an important cause of the
retardation or stagnation of the South.''
   _ Reforms of international economic and financial systems:
   ``The world monetary and financial system is marked by an
excessive fluctuation or exchange rates and interest rates, to the
detriment of the balance of payments and the debt situation of the
poorer countries.''
   _ The church's role:
   ``The church's social doctrine is not a `third way' between
liberal capitalism and Marxist collectivism, nor even a possible
alternative to other solutions less radically opposed to one
another.''
   _ Church property:
   ``Faced by cases of need, one cannot ignore (necessities) in
favor of superfluous church ornaments and costly furnishings for
divine worship; on the contrary, it could be obligatory to sell
these goods in order to provide food, drink, clothing and shelter
for those who lack these things.''
   _ Dangers of totalitarianism:
   ``No social group, for example a political party, has the right
to upsurp the role of sole leader, since this brings about the
destruction of the true subjectivity of society and of the
individual citizens.''

   Central Bank officials said today
the $8 million stolen from a U.S. currency shipment to the bank was

   The money, stolen in Brazil on Feb. 4, was part of $52 million

Argentina is the developing world's third largest debtor after
Brazil and Mexico.
   Thirteen sacks stuffed with $4 million dollars cash each were en

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old accused of fatally
shooting a high school official and wounding two teachers has been
moved to a medical unit because a psychologist termed him a suicide
risk.
   ``In my opinion, at this time, Jason Harless presents an
increased suicidal risk. I am recommending that the necessary
protective measures be taken,'' psychologist Robert Clapp wrote in
a report.
   Juvenile court administrative Judge Jack Page ordered Harless
moved Thursday from a juvenile detention center to the medical wing
of the Pinellas County Jail.
   Clapp said Harless became more despondent after learning of the
Wednesday death of Richard Allen, 53, assistant principal at
Pinellas Park High School.
   Allen was shot in the head when he and two teachers tried to
break up a fight between Harless and another youth in the high
school's packed cafeteria on Feb. 11.
   The teachers also were shot; both have been treated and released
from a hospital.
   Harless has been charged with five counts of attempted
first-degree murder, for the shootings in the lunchroom and shots
fired at two policemen. His friend Jason McCoy was charged with
three counts of the same offense although he is not accused of
firing a weapon.
   A grand jury that meets March 1 will consider charges against
the youths. If indicted, they will be tried as adults, said Richard
Mensh, Pinellas-Pasco chief assistant state attorney.

<HEAD>Four Infants Evaluated for Liver Transplant from Brain-Dead Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four infants in need of livers are
being evaluated for transplant after a baby kept on life-support
systems as a potential organ donor was declared brain dead, a
hospital official said.
   The brain-dead diagnosis for the 7-pound infant born Tuesday,
was confirmed Thursday after examinations by three neurologists,
said Joyce Peabody, chief of neonatology at Loma Linda University
Medical Center.
   The boy's heart was beating, and a respirator supplied oxygen to
his organs, but he had no higher brain activity, she said. The
child was born Tuesday.
   The boy's condition, known as anencephaly, kills most babies
within days after birth. Their healthy organs can be transplanted
if organ damage is prevented by maintaining the infants on
life-support.
   The Southern California Organ Procurement Center would choose
organ recipients, Ms. Peabody said. Liver and heart were the most
likely organs for transplant, she said, adding that Loma Linda
officials know of one baby in need of a heart but not of the right
blood type.
   The names of the baby's parents were withheld to protect their
privacy, but Ms. Peabody said the mother had expressed satisfaction
with the procedure.
   The National Right to Life Committee, which accused Loma Linda
of going beyond prevailing medical ethics, denounced the procedure.
Protesters said doctors at the hospital hadn't done enough to
ensure that organs weren't removed from live children.
   However, Ms. Peabody said, the case may have answered several
medical and ethical questions about the practice of maintaining
anencephalics in order to use their organs.
   It demonstrated that the baby didn't suffer discomfort or
distress, she said. It also indicated organs can be kept in
condition suitable for transplant, and that the life-support
apparatus didn't artificially prolong the time until the baby
suffered brain death.
   One of the hospital's 13 heart transplant patients under age 4
received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year from a
donor child in Canada.

<HEAD>Eds. Subs graf 18, If projections, to CORRECT both figures to

<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1.3 billion that President Reagan
proposes to spend fighting AIDS next year _ his ``highest public
health priority'' _ would be by far the largest percentage increase
in any major federal program.
   But the 38 percent boost over current AIDS spending of $951
million approved by Congress would pale if compared with the $534
million that the president initially requested last year.
   By that measure, Reagan could just as well have boasted that he
was more than doubling his AIDS request. But that would have drawn
attention to the reality that Congress has consistently voted much
more for AIDS research and education than the president has
requested.
   For fiscal 1987, for example, Reagan sought $213 million and
Congress appropriated $502 million.
   With the White House calling for a drastic increase in AIDS
spending next year, Congress is considered unlikely to approve any
significant increase on top of that, as it has in the past.
   One reason is that the overall fiscal 1989 budget plan was
written in consultation with congressional leaders in
deficit-reduction negotiations prompted by the October stock market
crash.
   Another is that both administration and congressional leaders
have said the proposed budget is calculated in part to avoid a
knock-down fight in an election year.
   But a high-ranking administration official said Reagan gave a
hint of his plans for a dramatic increase in AIDS spending during a
meeting last summer when the president decided to appoint a White
House commission on the deadly disease.
   This official, who discussed the budget only on condition that
he not be identified, quoted Reagan as saying, ``I want it (the
commission) to have whatever money it needs.''
   The official, who helps referee spending fights among federal
health agencies, remembered thinking at that moment: ``There goes
my budget.''
   The 38 percent rise in AIDS spending compares with a net
proposed increase of 5.8 percent for the 250 programs administered
by the Department of Health and Human Services under the fiscal
1989 budget plan that Reagan sent Thursday to Congress.
   Nearly 95 percent of the huge department's proposed $396.8
billion budget, which represents about one-third of all federal
spending, goes for so-called entitlement programs such as Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
   The administration has relatively little control over
entitlement programs because eligiblity criteria are fixed by law.
   Social Security spending alone is expected to grow by $14
billion, or 6.4 percent, to $233.8 billion during the new fiscal
year which starts Oct. 1.
   Medicaid, the state-federal health program for poor people, will
cost the federal government $32.7 billion in 1989, up 7 percent
from the current $30.7 billion. Much of the increase is attributed
to heavier spending on AIDS patients, from $375 million to $600
million.
   Medicare spending for 33 million retirees and disabled workers
is projected to rise to $84 billion from $78.9 billion this year.
   The most controversial part of the HHS spending plan is likely
to be Reagan's request for $1.2 billion in Medicare cuts which he
says are required to meet an agreed target of a $3.5 million
reduction.
   If projections of overall Medicare spending by the Congressional
Budget Office are correct, the $3.5 billion reduction target
already has been met. If the administration is correct, an
additional $1.2 billion in cuts would be needed.
   Of that $1.2 billion, the administration proposes to cover about
$1 billion by reducing payments to large teaching hospitals that
help them with educational costs.
   HHS chief of staff Thomas Burke said a recent internal study
showed that the Medicare profits of teaching hospitals are 2{ times
higher than those of non-teaching hospitals.
   ``It would seem these hospitals are going to be able to absorb
this reduction,'' Burke said.

   A computerized robot named Robodoc may one
day help surgeons perform hip replacements in an operating room of
the future, University of California researchers say.
   Orthopedic surgeon William L. Bargar and veterinarian Howard
Paul said Robodoc's ability to drill and measure precisely will
prove valuable in assisting physicians in hip replacements and
other types of surgery.
   Bargar and Paul showed off the machine Thursday at a news
conference at the university's Davis campus, about 15 miles west of
Sacramento, where Bargar is an assistant clinical professor and
Paul is an assistant research veterinarian.
   The robot, which was billed as the first of its kind and is at
least five years from use in hospitals, looks and sounds in its
current phase much like a giant dentist's drill.
   Bargar and Paul developed the computerized mechanical arm to
drill deep holes down through thighbones during hip replacement
surgery so they could slip artificial hip joints inside.
   Currently, surgeons must use a mallet and metal rasp to bore
holes under the socket, at the risk of cracking the leg bone and
getting a poor fit.
   In 1985, Bargar began testing custom-made hip implants that
eliminate the need to take several standard sizes of artificial hip
joints into the operating room and fit the patient during surgery.
   ``So we thought, if a machine can make a prosthesis accurately,
why can't a machine make the same envelope so that (the joint) will
just press in,'' said Paul, who replaces hips in one to two
arthritic dogs every week.
   The better the fit, the surgeons reasoned, the easier the bone
will grow onto the artificial joint and the longer it will last.
   Traditional hip surgery is fine for older, sedentary people, but
younger, active or overweight patients face a 40 percent risk of
having their implants loosen within five years, Bargar said.
   About 120,000 people undergo hip replacement surgery every year.
   In early laboratory tests, Bargar said, the robot drilled with
accuracy up to seven-thousands of an inch, nearly 60 times as
accurate as the hand-held rasp and mallet.
   Such accuracy could be a boon to other surgery, such as removal
of brain tumors or implanting of teeth in the jaw, he said.
   ``We hope it's going to be picked up by oral surgery,
opthmology, neurosurgery,'' said Bargar. ``Each of these
disciplines has some procedure where the accuracy they need is
better than what they can achieve.''
   The researchers stressed that the robot is intended to assist
human surgeons, not replace them.
   ``I initially didn't even want to use the word `robot,' because
I was afraid it would scare people,'' Bargar said.

<HEAD>Celebrated Formerly Homeless Woman Lashes Out At New York City
Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A formerly homeless woman who challenged
New York City's policy of forcibly hospitalizing mentally ill
street people told a Harvard Law School audience the policy was
more humiliating than helpful.
   ``I will never, never, ever forget what happened to me and what
Mayor (Edward) Koch's program did to me,'' Joyce Brown, 40, said at
a Harvard Law forum.
   Ms. Brown, who also has called herself Billie Boggs, called for
more affordable housing and criticized government programs for the
homeless, particularly New York's Project Help.
   Ms. Brown was the first homeless person picked up under Koch's
program to remove the mentally ill from the streets for treatment.
   A former secretary in New Jersey, Ms. Brown lived for months on
a sidewalk in Manhattan until Oct. 28, when city workers took her
to Bellevue Hospital, where she was kept in a locked psychiatric
ward.
   She protested in court, and on Jan. 19 she was released after a
judge ruled she could not be treated with drugs against her will.
   Ms. Brown said programs like Project Help only exacerbate the
problem of the homeless.
   ``Mayor Koch wants to pick you up, humiliate you, degrade you
and embarrass you by taking you to the hospital and forcing you to
take medication,'' she said.
   Since being released from the hospital, Ms. Brown has moved to a
New York hotel for formerly homeless women where she receives meals
and social services and says she is looking for work. She was
accompanied to Harvard by her two lawyers from the New York Civil
Liberties Union.
   She urged governments to build more housing for people with low
and moderate incomes and described her experiences in shelters for
the homeless as ``not good at all.''
   ``There are murders, theft, rapings,'' she said. ``It is a very
dangerous place to live.''
   Before her speech, she told the New York Post she wishes she had
a family.
   ``If I could pick anything I want to be right now, I'd be
married with children,'' she said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed with flashlights, walkie-talkies, and in
some cases, police escorts, more than 100 volunteers took to the
streets and alleys of Boston today to count the number of homeless.
   The 117 census-takers were instructed to look behind buildings
and trash bins, in doorways and all-night movies.
   ``We just about walked every street in the city,'' said Allan
Stern, the city's director of data processing, who will tally the
findings.
   The homeless were recorded by gender and whether adult or child,
but names were not taken. Totals, which will include the number of
homeless who spent the night in shelters and detoxification units,
were to be calculated during the day, with a final analysis
expected in about one week, said Stern.
   The city's first census, conducted last year, found about 2,860
homeless, Stern said.
   Drinking coffee to help them stay awake, the census-takers
gathered before midnight at City Hall. Temperatures hovered around
freezing outside.
   ``It's important to be able to speak with authority,'' Mayor
Raymond Flynn told the group. ``People rely on the city of Boston
for these kinds of figures. When we start making statements about
the homeless population in America, we can speak about it with
actual statistics.''
   Boston is the only city in the country which takes to the
streets to count the homeless, Stern said.
   ``It shows the concern for the issue to have so many people come
out here between the hours of 1 and 3,'' said Richard Weintraub,
34, director of the 360-bed Long Island shelter.
   Most of the volunteers were homeless workers or advocates,
recruited through word-of-mouth and posters. The Boston Fire
Department donated two cars and two drivers, and police escorted
some groups.
   In the Boston's South End, a book and sweater scrunched on top
of a stove in an alcove built of discarded appliances alerted
Weintraub's three-person group to signs of occupancy.
   A quick hop up on the stove and a peek into the makeshift
dwelling found two people fast asleep.
   ``We still don't get all the homeless. There are people hidden
away in buildings we'll just never find,'' Weintraub said.
   The volunteers were told to be inconspicuous and not to disturb
the homeless unless they were in need of assistance.
   At 3 a.m. a man was spotted hobbling on crutches, and the group
radioed for a rescue van, which took him to a shelter, Weintraub
said.
   Weintraub's group finished searching its 30-block area in the
South End at 4 a.m., finding 10 men and one woman.
   ``If we don't find a lot of people on the street, that's
successful,'' he said.
   The city uses the statistics to help determine the number of
beds, resuce vans, food and medical supplies needed to care for the
homeless, said Ann Maquire, executive director of the city's
Emergency Shelter Commission, which organized the survey.

<HEAD>Chrysler Will Consider Extending Production At Wisconsin Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp., under fire for planning to
close a plant it acquired in its buyout of American Motors, will
consider a ``modest, short'' extension of production there,
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca says.
   He made the announcement after meeting Thursday in Washington
with Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who has threatened to have the state
sue Chrysler.
   The meeting ``got very heated'' while Wisconsin officials gave
Iacocca their opinion of Chrysler's plans to close the factory in
Kenosha on Sept. 30 and throw 5,500 people out of work, Thompson
said.
   The state accuses the company of violating a 1987 promise to
maintain production for five years in exchange for $5 million in
job-training funds.
   ``I had some things I wanted to get off my chest,'' the governor
said.
   Iacocca said after the meeting he had agreed to requests by Rep.
Les Aspin, D-Wis., to look elsewhere in the company for work that
might be transferred to Kenosha when production of Omni and Horizon
models ends there.
   ``We don't hold hopes too high but they specifically asked if we
could have a modest, short extension,'' Iacocca said. ``We're going
to look and see if we can seriously do that.''
   Asked if Iacocca meant weeks or months with the term ``modest,
short extension,'' the governor said, ``He didn't put it in those
kinds of terms.''
   While talking to reporters, Iacocca mentioned ``a couple
months.''
   Thompson said talks will continue with Chrysler in hope of
averting a breach-of-contract suit against Chrysler.
   Thompson said he hopes Iacocca's promise to look for new work
for Kenosha can prolong operations for more than a month or two but
realizes ``it's not going to be five years.''
   In a telephone interview from Washington, the governor said the
meeting ``started out very rocky. It got very heated. At times we
thought the meeting was going to break up.''
   ``I reiterated my positions to him about how they treated the
state, the city, the county and the union,'' Thompson said. ``We
are a long way from reaching an agreement (but) it was a positive
meeting.''
   Chrysler denies making a written commitment to maintain
production for five years. Iacocca says company officials are
guilty of nothing more than being ``cockeyed optimists'' in
originally planning to keep the plant open that long.
   When the 86-year-old factory closes, about 1,800 workers would
be eligible for pensions, leaving 3,700 facing unemployment. State
officials say the unemployment rate in the city of 75,000 could
rise past 20 percent.

<TEXT>
   The only defendant in U.S. custody of those named
in the drug indictment of Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega pleaded innocent today in federal court.
   Brian Alden Davidow, 26, a student at Florida International
University, had turned himself in to authorities last week, four
days after being indicted for racketeering and drug trafficking
along with Noriega and 14 other people.
   Davidow, free on a $500,000 bond, pleaded innocent to two
indictments in a brief hearing before U.S. Magistrate Linnea
Johnson.
   He could face up to 60 years in prison and fines of $750,000 if
convicted of conspiring with Noriega to smuggle drugs from Panama
to the United States for the Colombia-based Medellin Cartel, which
supplies up to 80 percent of this country's cociane imports.
   According to prosecutors, Davidow is a Miami-based cocaine
distributor who worked with Cesar Rodriguez, Ruben Diario Paredes
Jimenez and others. Davidow allegedly met with Noriega and others
in Panama to arrange transportation of cocaine to Florida, the
indictment says.
   The defendant also entered an innocent plea in a second
indictment accusing him of conspiracy and distribution of cocaine
in 1983 and 1984.

<HEAD>Two Judges Declare New Federal Rules Invalid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal guidelines intended to bring
consistency to sentencing for those who commit federal crimes have
been declared invalid by two U.S. district judges.
   Judge Rudi Brewster concurred Thursday with arguments that the
commission that issued the guidelines violated separation of powers
among government branches.
   Brewster found that the U.S. Sentencing Commission was
unconstitutional because it was placed under the wing of the
judicial branch of government, when the power of that branch is
limited to resolution of cases, not rule-making.
   Shortly after Brewster filed his opinion, Judge John Rhoades
issued a brief order adopting Brewster's findings.
   The rulings came one day after Brewster, Rhoades and six other
federal judges for the Southern District of California heard
arguments on the valididity of the commission created by the
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.
   The act was intended to bring consistency to sentencings and
affects those who commit federal crimes after Nov. 1, 1987.
   Challenges to the new rules have been filed throughout the
country, but the San Diego hearing was the first to reach trial.
   ``I think it's a well-written opinion and I think it will be
influential,'' said Judy Clarke, executive director of Federal
Defenders of San Diego, which argued against the federal sentencing
mandates.
   It tells district court judges they are not alone in concluding
that an act of Congress is unconstitutional, she said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Haines Jr. said he was
disappointed with the rulings, but predicted that when other judges
rule, the ``government's position will be vindicated.''
   Defense and government attorneys have agreed that constitutional
issues ultimately must be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. Haines
said Thursday that the Justice Department is investigating the best
strategy for appeal.
   In the meantime, different judges may use different sentencing
standards. Haines said it will cause no practical problems, but
Clarke contends there will be ``chaos'' in the courts.
   The San Diego judges, who normally hear pretrial motions
individually, joined in a time-saving maneuver to hear arguments
raised in eight cases by 16 defendants awaiting trial on offenses
ranging from drug to immigration violations. Rulings from the other
judges are pending.
   The Justice Department and the commission sought to preserve the
new rules, but relied on different arguments.
   Attorney Kenneth Geller, representing the commission, said the
guidelines brought order to the inconsistent sentencing system and
defended the commission as independent of the executive branch.
   Douglass Letter, the Justice Department's appellate litigation
counsel, conceded that there could be constitutional problems
because of the commission's assignment to the judicial branch.
   He said it should have been placed in the executive branch,
under which it could legally execute laws.

<HEAD>Shultz `Most Likely' To Visit Syria Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``most
likely'' will visit Syria when he goes to the Middle East next week
to weigh prospects for an Arab-Israeli negotiations, a U.S.
official said today.
   Shultz' purpose would be to discuss the situation with President
Hafez Assad, whose support for any long-term sattlement of the
Arab-Israeli dispute is considered essential by experts in the
State Department's Near East Bureau.
   A stop in Damascus would be a major prestige boost to Syria and
mark an improvement in its U.S. relations. The country is one of
six listed by the State Department as a supporter of terrorism. In
November 1986, President Reagan imposed sanctions against Syria.
   Among the punitive measures was a ban on high-level meetings
with Syrians. But Shultz sent Richard W. Murphy, the head of the
Near East bureau, to Damascus two weeks ago to confer with Assad.
   The U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said Shultz was
``most likely'' to schedule a stop in Syria on his trip to the
Middle East beginning next Thursday.
   Another U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said restrictions
on visas for Syrians to visit the United States are likely to be
lifted.
   Ambassador William Eagleton was sent back to his post in
Damascus last September, after a year's absence, and U.N.
Ambassador Vernon A. Walters also visited the country.
   Shultz's other stops will be Egypt, Jordan, Israel and probably
Saudi Arabia. He is trying to set up negotiations between Israel
and a mixed delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians to deal
especially with the troubled West Bank and Gaza.
   The immediate aim is some form of self-rule for the 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs who have lived under Israeli control since Egypt
and Jordan lost the territories in the 1967 Six-Day war.
   The long-range goal is to hold a second stage of talks _
possibly in the format of an international peace conference _ by
the end of the year to consider an overall settlement.
   Shultz plans to be in the Middle East until March 2 when the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization holds a summit meeting in
Brussels. President Reagan will attend.
   He is making a separate trip to the Soviet Union, starting out
today for Helsinki, Finland. Shultz will be in Moscow for talks
Sunday and Monday, report to the NATO countries in Brussels on
Tuesday and return home for a brief rest before heading for the
Middle East.

<HEAD>Communist Party Weekly Criticizes 1968 Anti-Semitic Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential Communist Party weekly
criticized the official anti-Semitic campaign in 1968 that led to
the flight of most of the country's surviving Jewish population.
   The article in the Feb. 20 issue of the weekly Polityka, seen
today, was the first in an official publication to offer a detailed
account reappraising the 1968 events and referring specifically to
an ``anti-Semitic'' campaign.
   Its publication comes before the 20th anniversary of March 1968
student protests against censorship, which sparked what authorities
then called an ``anti-Zionist'' campaign that led to the dismissal
of thousands of Jews from official posts.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban on Tuesday promised a
``detailed discussion'' of the 1968 crisis in official
publications. The government condemns ``any manifestations of
anti-Semitism, both in the past and at present,'' he said.
   A party source close to Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
said the Polityka article was the first in a series of reappraisals
that will appear in the press, radio and television, including a
major commentary planned for the party's official newspaper Trybuna
Ludu.
   ``This is the time of perestroika (reconstruction) and it is
time to liquidate the mistakes, the black points on the moral
side,'' said the source, requesting anonymity.
   Perestroika describes the social and economic reforms promoted
by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviet Union has been
re-evaluating its history in a more critical light.
   ``We will take a clear position against anti-Semitism,'' the
source said. ``We want to close this chapter, which was a very
unhappy chapter in our history.''
   In a front-page introduction to a chronology of events connected
with 1968, two Polityka staff members, Wieslaw Wladyka and Zbyslaw
Rykowski, wrote that ``March (1968) has been an embarrassing issue
for 20 years.''
   ``The legacy of March remains: the shame of the anti-Semitic
fuss, the reform of socialism buried for years, the intelligentsia
left at odds with the working class, human damage.''
   They wrote that the crisis was triggered by the failure of
then-Communist Party leader Wladyslaw Gomulka to make basic
political and economic reforms, partially under the influence of
conservative Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. As the country
stagnated, Gomulka reacted with repressive measures against
reformers and dissident intellectuals.
   They said the ``anti-Semitic syndrome in political thinking''
was part of a power struggle within the party leadership aimed at
unseating Gomulka. His opponents tried to appeal for popular
support with nationalist slogans.
   The anti-Semitic campaign was ignited after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war when some Polish officials and army officers of
Jewish origin were accused of celebrating the Israeli victory over
the Soviet-backed Arab armies.
   But the campaign did not pick up momentum until after the March
1968 student riots, which authorities blamed on ``Zionist
traitors.'' About 9,000 Jews were dismissed from posts in the
party, party, government, army and other institutions.
   The campaign led to the emigration of most of the 30,000 Jews
living in Poland. Before the Nazi Holocaust of World War II, Poland
was home to about 3.5 million Jews, or 10 percent of the population.
   Polityka said the precise number of emigres is unknown, but
cited various estimates saying that 12,000 to 20,000 Jews left
Poland in 1967-69.

<HEAD>Report: Prime Minister Expected To Call For Treaty Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva
likely will call for a review of a treaty allowing the United
States to use a mid-Atlantic air base if Washington refuses a large
increase in aid, a newspaper said today.
   Cavaco Silva planned to visit to Washington next week for talks
with U.S. leaders. The talks are expected to center on a 1983
bilateral accord that gives the United States use of the Lajes Air
Base in the Azores islands.
   Today, the left-of-center Lisbon weekly O Jornal reported
sources close to the government expect ``the Prime Minister will
officially call for a formal review of the (Lajes) agreement if
Washington refuses a substantial increase in aid'' during his U.S.
trip.
   Two weeks ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci paid a
one-day visit to Lisbon to discuss Portuguese complaints over
recent drops in U.S. assistance.
   Carlucci and Portuguese Defense Minister Eurico de Melo
announced after intensive meetings in the Portuguese capital Feb. 3
that both sides had agreed to form a joint task force to study
alternative forms of U.S. aid to Portugal.
   Congressional cuts dropped Washington's military and economic
assistance totals to Portugal from $208 million in 1985 to $117
million for fiscal 1987.
   Carlucci's visit to Lisbon followed months of public complaints
by Cavaco Silva and other Portuguese leaders that the United States
had failed to live up to its pledge in the 1983 base accord to
provide increasing amounts of aid.
   The U.S. State Department announced Thursday the administration
would seek $163 million in aid to Portugal for fiscal 1988, which
begins Oct. 1.
   The United States first received base rights at Lajes in 1951,
and the U.S. presence at the Portuguese-run base on the Azores'
Terceira island has been extended in a series of subsequent accords.
   The latest extension agreement for use of the refuelling depot
and submarine reconnaissance facilities at Lajes was signed in
December 1983, and expires Feb. 4, 1991.
   In a major address Thursday night, Foreign Minister Joao de Deus
Pinheiro reiterated Portugal's strategic role in the Atlantic
alliance but signalled increasing concern in Lisbon over the cuts
in aid.
   ``Portugal proclaims itself the true connecting link between the
American and European pillars'' of NATO, the minister said in a
speech before students of the National Defense Institute at the
northern city of Oporto.
   But the minister said, ``it is only normal'' that Portugal and
the United States ``desire an update'' of their existing bilateral
defense accord in the wake of the recent U.S.-Soviet agreement
removing intermediate-range nuclear weapons from Europe.
   ``The upcoming Portuguese-American negotiations shouldn't be
dramatized,'' he said, because ``our common interests and views far
exceed any possible bilateral difficulties.''

<TEXT>
   Axel Ax:son Johnson, one of Sweden's
leading industrialists, died today in his vacation home in Naples,
Fla., a spokesman for his company said. He was 77.
   Johnson headed Sweden's biggest family-owned conglomerate, the
Axel Johnson Group and Nordstjernan AB, until he retired in 1979,
said the spokeswoman, Elisabeth Bergstrom.
   She said his health had been weak for the past few years, but
did not say why he died. Johnson lived in Stockholm.
   The two industrial groups, with operations in construction,
shipping, stainless steel and trading, have annual revenues of $5
billion and 22,000 employees.
   The Johnson empire was founded by Johnson's late grandfather,
Axel, who founded A. Johnson & Co. in 1873 as a trading company.
The company gradually diversified into two groups which are still
controlled by the family.
   Johnson's only child, Antonia Ax:son Johnson, owns 100 percent
of the Johnson Group, which consists of Axel Johnson AB in Sweden
and Johnson Inc. in the United States. Their combined annual
revenues are about $2.5 billion.

<HEAD>Artificial Heart Pioneer Says Donor Shortage May Lead to Permanent
Implants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The surgeon who pioneered use of the
artificial heart as a ``bridge'' until a human heart can be
obtained for transplant says he is re-examining the idea of
permanent implantation because of a shortage of donor hearts.
   ``I think the bridge-to-transplant scenario becomes less tenable
than it was, and if you're going to get into a bridge to transplant
it better be with a perfect candidate,'' Jack G. Copeland, head of
the University of Arizona's heart transplant and artificial heart
teams, said Thursday.
   In August 1985, Copeland became the first cardiac surgeon to use
an artificial heart successfully as a bridge to transplant. Michael
Drummond was kept alive for nine days on a Jarvik-7
plastic-and-metal pump before receiving a donor organ.
   Copeland has long held that such devices are unsuitable for
permanent implantation in their current state because of
complications, including development of potential stroke-causing
clots, and of infections that inevitably develop over time and
because the patient's lifestyle is hindered by constant tethering
to an immobile drive unit.
   But Copeland said he is rethinking his position because of the
shortage of human donors.
   His comments came during the first day of a three-day conference
on thoracic organ transplantation. Other surgeons attending said
that the more than 100 medical centers now performing heart
transplants in the United State are vying for a constant or even
declining number of donor hearts, estimated at no more than 1,500
annually.
   A candidate for an artificial heart as a bridge ``has to be
perfect in every way, before you commit that much of your resources
and before you put that guy on the top of the list ahead of the
five other people that are in ICU (intensive care unit) waiting for
a heart,'' Copeland said.
   He also said transplant surgeons are ``being pushed by the laws
of supply and demand,'' with the death of many young people from
heart disease, ``toward a relook'' at prolonged circulatory support
with mechanical devices.
   That is happening ``even though we don't have a device that's
really ready for permanent implantation,'' he said. ``I think we're
being pushed toward that as a solution.''

   The leader of South Africa's
smallest and poorest black homeland today told President P.W. Botha
that dividing the nation into tribal states will not solve the
political problems of apartheid.
   Kenneth Mopeli, chief minister of Qwaqwa, spoke after Botha
dedicated a new government building on a hill overlooking the
capital of this 240-square-mile homeland in the dusty foothills of
the Drakensburg mountains.
   Qwaqwa is one of 10 tribal homelands covering 13 percent of the
nation. Four are recognized as independent republics by the South
African government, and six, including Qwaqwa, are classified as
``self-governing states.''
   Botha told 80 black legislators that ``the self-governing areas
have a proud history'' and that development in Qwaqwa had convinced
him the homeland wanted to be more self-sufficient.
   ``Those self-governing states desiring independence will be
encouraged and assisted toward achieving it,'' Botha said.
``However, those areas that do not wish to take this step will
remain an inextricable part of South Africa.''
   He said homeland leaders such as Mopeli, who have rejected
independence, will be invited to ``share in discussions on
continued constitutional reform for all the black communities.''
   Mopeli thanked Botha for the government's funding of the
legislative building and described the president as one of South
Africa's best leaders, but he challenged Botha's view of the future
of the homelands.
   ``The self-governing states as they exist today are apartheid''
structures, he said, referring to the government's policy of racial
segregation in which the 26.5 million blacks have no voice in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
government.
   ``We are still convinced that our political salvation does not
lie in the partitioning and fragmenting of the country into various
parts,'' Mopeli said. ``We need ... a more viable formula. We would
rather see the homelands develop as regional governments within a
greater federal South Africa.''
   Botha at one point mentioned the proposed National Council, an
advisory body intended to negotiate a political system that would
for the first time bring blacks into national politics.
   Some council members would be chosen by Botha and others would
be elected. Most prominent black leaders, including Mopeli, have
rejected the proposal.
   ``No black leader wants to be seen promoting apartheid in any
form,'' he said.

   Democratic presidential candidate Paul Simon set aside his
qualms about early disappointments and said today ``I'm in it until
the finish line in Atlanta,'' as Republican Bob Dole derided the
now two-man GOP debate in Dallas tonight as ``a Bush pep rally.''
   An invigorated Simon, encouraged by an outpouring of cash and
support, changed his mind about needing a win in Minnesota or South
Dakota next Tuesday to stay in the race.
   ``Candidly, I was at first frustrated by the razor thin margins
that separated me from victory in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' the
Illinois senator said in Minneapolis. ``I was tempted to bow to the
convention wisdom ... This is a marathon race for the heart and
soul of the Democratic Party, and I'm in it until the finish line
in Atlanta.''
   In Florida, Dole denied he and fellow Republican Pat Robertson
coordinated their decision to skip tonight's Dallas debate, leaving
only George Bush and Jack Kemp to share the stage with two empty
chairs.
   Dole said his campaign received only 60 of the 2,600 tickets
available, leading him to the conclusion that the forum in the vice
president's one-time home state would be ``a Bush pep rally.''
   Debate organizers said the campaigns were all allotted the same
number of tickets, and criticized Dole, saying he had lobbied
Robertson to stay away too.
   Southerner Albert Gore Jr., who was mainly on the sidelines in
early campaign contests, came out swinging as Democrats sparred at
their leadoff debate of Super Tuesday season on Thursday night.
   In Nevada, Bush won a non-binding GOP presidential straw poll
Thursday night. But his tally was nearly equaled by undecided votes
_ many of which were believed to have been cast by supporters of
Robertson in a bid to control later balloting. Robertson also got a
large chunk of votes outright.
   The presidential candidate ranks thinned by two on Thursday as
Bruce Babbitt and Republican Pete du Pont made their exits. Neither
expressed regret about his underdog candidacy.
   Babbitt called his quest for the nomination ``the greatest joy
of my entire public life'' and du Pont declared: ``Our campaign
lowers its flag, but our crusade continues to march.''
   That marked a trio of withdrawals from the White House race in a
week _ Republican Alexander Haig, the former secretary of state,
bowed out last Friday in New Hampshire.
   At the Dallas debate Thursday night, Gore quickly took the
offensive, asking Michael Dukakis why he was willing to tolerate a
Soviet client state in Central America.
   ``I never said that, Al,'' snapped Dukakis, who racked up a big
win in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
   Gore also scrapped with Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Democratic
winner in Iowa, taking the Missouri congressman to task for shifts
on issues.
   That got a rise out of Gephardt, who retorted: ``Maybe you ought
to start looking at your own record first,'' and went on to claim
that Gore has moved to the right on military issues since entering
the race.
   ``Lately you've been sounding more like Al Haig than Al Gore,''
Gephardt said sharply.
   ``That line sounds more like Richard Nixon than Richard
Gephardt,'' Gore fired back.
   Gary Hart, mired at the back of the Democratic pack, got in a
few digs, saying if Gephardt's trade bill ever took effect it would
be ``a catastrophe.''
   And Jesse Jackson, who has a big Southern following, drew
applause when he criticized wasteful military spending.
   Gore, who bypassed the Iowa caucuses and ran only a limited
campaign in New Hampshire, is staking his hopes on a Southern
strategy. The setting of the debate _ in the biggest Super Tuesday
state _ underscored the Tennessee senator's urgent need for a
strong showing in the region.
   At one point, Gephardt jabbed Gore for playing down the early
contests.
   ``I don't think people vote for political strategies,'' he said.
   The Democrats had another confrontation scheduled tonight, this
one in St. Paul, Minn.
   The debate debate wasn't the only contention within Republican
ranks.
   Bush, campaigning in Missouri, insisted ``I'm telling the
truth'' about Dole. The Kansas senator has been complaining about
11th-hour ads Bush ran in New Hampshire, attacking Dole's stand on
taxes, oil import fees and arms control.
   Dole, in North Carolina, made it clear the commercials were
still a sore point.
   ``I wanted to get here before the TV ads,'' the Kansas senator
said in Charlotte. ``Before you see some TV ad saying Bob Dole will
raise your taxes, say you've heard it from the candidate himself.
... We don't need any more tax increases.''
   Kemp, campaigning in South Carolina, was asked about his
prospects in the state. ``We expect to be very competitive,'' the
New York congressman said. ``We're going all the way to New
Orleans,'' site of the GOP national convention.

<TEXT>
   A man has been charged with murder in the death
of his wife, who two months ago requested leniency for him in a
shooting that left her wounded.
   Linda Joyce Hubert, 26, was shot to death Thursday in her
apartment.
   She had survived two bullet wounds in December and asked that
her husband be offered probation. She said she would not testify
against him and hoped he would ``get help.''
   Kenneth Leon Hubert, 27, surrendered Thursday to police.
Homicide Sgt. Jerry Novak said Hubert had heard he was being sought
but insisted he was innocent.
   Hubert was charged with murder and denied bond. He had been free
on $5,000 bond on an attempted murder charge in the Dec. 18
wounding of his wife, and on $2,000 bond on a charge of kidnapping
his girlfriend in November.
   On Monday, Hubert was to have entered a plea in the December
shooting.
   The Huberts had been separated for about three years. A neighbor
said Hubert often came by Ms. Hubert's apartment.
   ``I thought the husband was a boyfriend trying to make up with
her, because he was always coming around harassing her,'' said Ola
Aubrey. ``He would come every day and stay in that car and blow his
horn. She would just stay inside. She would never let him in her
apartment.''

   Ten Soviet and four Canadian skiers who plan to
cross the North Pole on skis are finishing up training on Dikson
Island in the far north of the Soviet Union and plan to depart
March 1, it was reported Friday.
   The official Tass news agency said the group arrived at Dikson
on Thursday and that final preparations for the 1,240-mile ski trip
were under way.
   Earlier this week, Laurie Dexter of the Canadian team said the
group's departure from Moscow had been delayed because some
equipment and food was lost. Tass did not indicate whether the
supplies had been found or replaced.
   The skiers will travel in about a week to Cape of the Arctic,
the northernmost point of the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago that
stretches into the Arctic Ocean.
   From there, they will set out on the trek, which is expected to
last 100 days.
   Tass said the skiers would carry 99-pound backpacks. The
expedition is to conclude at Cape Columbia in Canada.

   Divers said Friday they found silver
bullion on the wreck of a Dutch trading ship that sank off western
Australia in 1712.
   The wreck of the Zuypdorp lies at the bottom of a cliff about
400 miles north of Fremantle in only 10 feet of water, but the area
is constantly buffeted by heavy seas.
   Graham Henderson, curator of maritime archaeology at the
Maritime Museum in Western Australia state, said the conditions
make it possible to dive there only a few times a year.
   He said the ship was headed for what is now Indonesia when it
foundered on a reef.
   He put no value on the silver coins, which along with
spoon-shaped ballast blocks, clay pipes and glassware are to be
displayed in the museum.

<TEXT>
   Heavy-metal rockers Motley Crue offered
condolences to the 12-year-old who set his legs on fire while
trying to imitate a stunt shown on one of the group's music videos.
   Bryan Tucker, who had burns over 10 percent of his body, was
reported in good condition Friday at Memorial Hospital.
   ``The members of Motley Crue are very sorry to learn that a
young fan was injured trying to copy the `human torch' stunt as
seen on the Live Wire video taped in 1982,'' said the statement
released Thursday by management firm McGhee Entertainment Inc. in
Los Angeles.
   ``Various of Motley Crue's show stunts require special
equipment, clothing and other materials ... and should not be
attempted at home. Fire stunts are especially dangerous,'' the
statement said.
   Bryan's mother, Wendy Tucker, said he was in great pain but that
Motley Crue was not to blame for her son's experiment at their home
Wednesday.
   ``In my day, my mom would not let me watch Superman, because he
jumped out of buildings,'' she said. ``It's just a different time.
If you think, some of these cartoons are really rough. It didn't
start with rock videos.''
   Tucker, who takes electric guitar lessons and wears an earring
in the shape of a cross, is known around Apollo Middle School as a
``headbanger,'' or heavy-metal rock fan, friends said.
   The boy poured rubbing alcohol on his jeans and torched them. He
put the flames out in a filled bathtub.

   A man sought in five bank robberies in the San
Diego area, including three committed in one day, was tracked to an
apartment where he barricaded himself before apparently committing
suicide, the FBI said.
   The man, identified as William Patrick McGrovern, 43, was found
dead inside his San Diego apartment Thursday night, said FBI
special agent James Bolenbach.
   ``Apparently he had shot himself shortly after barricading
himself in the apartment,'' Bolenbach said. No hostages were taken,
and no one else was injured.
   FBI agents and police officers from San Diego and El Cajon
staked out McGrovern's apartment Thursday after tracing a license
plate number on a getaway car used in one of three robberies that
same day.
   A bank in El Cajon and two in San Diego were robbed within a
1{-hour period and police and FBI investigators found that the same
person was responsible, Bolenbach said.
   When the officers attempted to arrest McGrovern, he fired a shot
and fled into his apartment.
   ``Throughout the afternoon, further attempts to contact him and
negotiate received no response,'' Bolenbach said.
   Officers heard a single shot at about 5 p.m., and when they
entered about three hours later they found McGrovern dead of a
gunshot wound, he said. Several weapons, ammunition and an unknown
amount of money were found in the apartment.
   McGrovern also is suspected of robbing a bank in Escondido and
one in Poway last month, Bolenbach said.
   It is not believed that McGrovern had any accomplices, he said.
The FBI did not disclose the amount of money taken in the five
robberies.

   A traditional keepsake certificate that
McLean County has been giving to newlyweds is pitting clergy
against one another in a debate over the separation of church and
state.
   The controversy also has sparked an angry response from the
public, including threatening phone calls to public officials,
ministers and others involved.
   At issue is the religious nature of the elaborate certificates,
which declare a couple united in ``holy matrimony, ordained by
God.'' They also bear a Bible passage from the book of Matthew.
   ``I think it's inappropriate for the county to be distributing
religious materials,'' said David Robins, minister at the Unitarian
Church of Bloomington.
   Robins says the keepsake is a Christian document and that its
distribution by the county displays a lack of sensitivity toward
religious minorities who don't share the same beliefs.
   He said the county should leave such religious keepsakes to the
churches rather than involve government in the issue.
   ``I realize I'm a religious minority in a Christian society and
I'm sorry if this curtails the pleasure of the majority of the
people in the county,'' Robins said. ``But I just think this is an
inappropriate activity for the county to be involved in.''
   Robins enlisted the support of Rabbi Clifford Librach of the
Moses Montefiore Temple in Bloomington, and together they
complained to the county.
   McLean County Clerk Jeanette Barrett decided to end distribution
of the keepsakes on the advice of Eric Ruud, assistant state's
attorney.
   However, that brought about 50 angry phone calls to the clerk's
office, as well as several ``vicious, venomous'' calls to Ruud and
Robins, Librach said.
   ``We've decided to give them their choice,'' Mrs. Barrett said.
``I'm going to issue one without all the religious references. If
they don't want either one, they don't have to take one.
   ``I think people should have a choice. They don't think the
county should be in the religion business. But I don't think we've
done anything wrong.''
   Robins and Librach think Mrs. Barrett is missing the point. They
don't think it's proper for the county to hand out any religious
certificates, whether Christian, Unitarian or Jewish.
   ``If the majority of the people in McLean County were Jewish,
I'd be offended if the county issued a Jewish-style keepsake,''
Librach said.
   The Rev. Ron R. Lee, pastor of St. John's Lutheran Church, said
his church strongly supports the separation of church and state
government.
   ``Freedom of religion means each group is allowed to pursue its
own beliefs in a free and open environment,'' Lee said. ``The
government does not promote religion. Any document the government
produces should be free of religious statements.''
   Ralph E. Wingate, pastor at the Calvary Baptist Church,
disagreed with Robins, Librach and Lee.
   ``The whole thing is ridiculous to me,'' Wingate said. ``They
might have an argument about espousing the Bible, but I think it's
a non-issue.''
   Librach said the keepsakes go further than a simple ``In God We
Trust'' as appears on U.S. currency.
   ``These certificates contain excerpts from the Gospel of Matthew
and clearly are Christian documents,'' he said. ``It's a violation
of the Constitution. We may have to look to the courts, where I
have no doubt as to what the decision will be.''

<TEXT>
   Rotten Row, which is said to be the world's oldest
urban horseriding path, may get back its bollards and railings 47
years after they were ripped out for the World War II effort.
   The Rotten Row Tercentenary Committee, set up to restore the
bridle path to its former glory by its 300th anniversary in 1991,
launched an appeal Friday for $260,000 to finance the fence.
   The mile-long sandy path through Hyde Park in central London
will be lined on each side with 1,000 cast-iron bollards linked by
metal railings.
   Major donors will have their names inscribed on the black,
3-foot high bollards, said committee chairman Neil Mitchell.
   Built by King William III and originally called the King's Road,
the path stretched four miles from Westminster to Kensington Palace
and was the first continuously lighted thoroughfare in Britain.
   Scholars have never agreed on the origin of the name Rotten Row.
   Some trace it to ``route du roi,'' French for king's road.
Others say it comes from ``rotteran,'' a German verb meaning to
muster, because it was used for military parades.
   Today it is open to any horserider free of charge and is part of
a network of bridle paths used as a basis for designing Central
Park in New York.
   Mitchell said he has invited the Claremont Riding Academy in New
York to join in the tercentenary ceremonies.

   The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 11 let stand a federal judge's
decision freeing Carter, who had served 19 years of a life term.
The judge found Carter's conviction was tainted by racism and by
prosecutors witholding information from the defense.
   The ruling left to the Passaic County prosecutor's office the
decision on whether to seek another trial for Carter and Artis,
whose convictions were first overturned by the New Jersey Supreme
court before a 1976 retrial.
   Defense attorneys had considered a third trial unlikely because
the eyewitness testimony had been so discredited during appeals.
   Goceljak made the decision on a third trial in consultation with
the state's director of criminal justice, Donald R. Belsole.
   Belsole had said the decision would be based in part on the
state of 22-year-old evidence and ``the impact of another trial on
society.''

his wife of long standing or his girlfriend of short standing, or a
deadly combination (of both),'' she said.
   Miss Landers said she has used her syndicated column to educate
and credited her readers' wisdom with helping her.
   ``If I could give just one piece of advice to everyone in the
world, it would be just two words: Be kind,'' she said. ``It is the
greatest gift you can give, and it costs you nothing.''
   Miss Landers, whose real name is Eppie Lederer, spoke at a

   James Meredith, who broke the
color barrier at the University of Mississippi 26 years ago, said
education remains the best vehicle to break the cycle of poverty
and oppression.
   Meredith, 54, was the first black student to attend the
University of Mississippi in 1962. Violence broke out on the Ole
Miss campus, and President John F. Kennedy called in federal troops
to maintain order.
   Meredith graduated from the university and went on to earn a law
degree at Columbia University.
   In a speech to Air Force Academy cadets Thursday, Meredith said
American blacks need to take more advantage of their citzenship
rights to improve their economic and political opportunities. By
seeking a state-funded education at Ole Miss, Meredith said he
chose to challenge white supremacy.

   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro says life at her Fire Island summer home is no day at the
beach _ in fact, she can't even go to the beach because she's so
recognizable.
   That's why Ms. Ferraro and husband John Zaccaro are asking for a
variance to build a swimming pool on their property and provide
them with some privacy.
   ``Because of the burden of celebrity, we are unable to take
advantage of the beach except for early morning or late evening,''
Ms. Ferraro told an unusual Manhattan meeting of the Saltaire
Village Board of Zoning Appeals on Thursday.
   Under village laws, an owner must have at least 10 lots to build
a pool; the former congresswoman and her husband own nine. The
board has reserved decision on the request, but it was not met
enthusiastically by some members.
   ``When we give variances it's usually because of hardship, and I
don't see the hardship here,'' said board member Hilliard Farr, a
summer softball teammate of Zaccaro and his wife.
   Ms. Ferraro ran unsuccessfully in 1984 on the Democratic ticket
headed by Walter Mondale.

<HEAD>Jackson Rates an A-Minus, Gary Hart Fails in Rhetoric Critique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush must tone down his whining, Paul
Simon should aim for a less professorial sound and Albert Gore Jr.
could help his campaign with a little humor, says a University of
Pittsburgh rhetoric expert.
   Ted Windt, professor and editor of two books on presidential
rhetoric, rated the candidates' speaking style in this campaign's
early grading period, giving Democratic hopeful Jesse Jackson the
best mark, A-minus, and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart an F.
   ``Regardless of whether people vote for him or not, they respect
and respond to his speaking,'' Windt said of Jackson. ``I do think
rhyming periodic sentences will grow thin after a while. He should
beef his theme up with some less soaring statements.''
   Hart, meanwhile, fails in Windt's grade book.
   ``He's had four years to answer the question, `Where's the
beef?' He's still unable to do it,'' the professor said. ``Although
he talks new ideas, he's talking about the past. In debates he
cannot reply on the sensitive ... issue without attacking the
media.''
   On the Republican side, Bush ``frequently sounds like he's
whining,'' according to Windt, who gave the vice president a
C-minus. However, in New Hampshire, Bush changed his style which
enabled him to capture the primary.
   ``In New Hampshire he began to speak rather than whine. He
recognizes he's going to have to fight for the nomination with
Dole, and has begun to mix it up,'' Windt said.
   The rhetoric expert gave Bush's chief rival, Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole, a B for the theme ``I'm one of you,'' which played so well in
the Iowa caucuses. The slogan, however, may prove short-sighted, he
said.
   Dole also ``has an incisive sense of humor that some think is
mean,'' Windt said.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson gets a B as ``a
natural TV performer.''
   ``He's attempting to soften the hard image of a self-righteous
evangelical who's out to vanquish evil. In softening his image, he
has not yet developed a clear-cut image or person,'' Windt said.
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp, although hard to grade, gets a C plus
for being ``lackluster in debates,'' Windt said.
   Among the other Democrats, Simon gets a C for being
``professorial, more a lecturer than a speaker,'' Windt said of the
Illinois senator. ``He should remember that a campaign is not a
required course for students, but an elective that voters can
choose to attend or skip,'' he said.
   Gore gets an incomplete for campaigning so little in Iowa and
New Hampshire, Windt said. ``He doesn't project any sense of
humor'' and ``still looks like he's running for class president of
a very expensive, preppy school,'' Windt said.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis gets a C for coming across as
a ``technocrat and a manager without human warmth,'' said Windt.

   The University of California faces a
growing admissions crisis that threatens to set black, white,
Hispanic and Asian students competing against one another for
admission, officials said.
   Three years into the system's 15-year growth plan, enrollment
has already reached levels predicted for 1995, and the university
could be forced for the first time to turn away qualified high
school graduates, the Board of Regents said at a special meeting
Thursday.
   The university has 140,000 undergraduates on its nine campuses.
   Part of the reason for the soaring applications is the
university's success at recruiting minority applicants, said
university President David P. Gardner.
   ``There needs to be very strong leadership by the regents and
the administration to reduce the growing tension between
affirmative action and ... the concerns among white students over
their declining enrollment at the university,'' said Henry Der, a
member of the Asian-American Task Force on University Admissions.
   Der, one of a panel of educational leaders that addressed the
regents, has accused the Berkeley campus of setting informal quotas
denying admission to Asian students, who have been gaining entrance
in greater and greater numbers during the past decade.
   He predicted such policies will lead to ``political and social
wars'' if uniform admission standards are not adopted throughout
the system.
   ``We have to ask whether this university is ready to let Asian
and white students compete on a color-blind basis,'' said Der.
   The regents discussed raising entrance requirements but that
could further widen the gap between the percentages of black and
Hispanic students enrolled compared to whites, they said.
   Five percent of Hispanic high school graduates and about 4
percent of blacks meet entrance requirements consisting of a
combination of high school courses, a 3.3 grade point average and
Scholastic Aptitude test results. This compares to 15 percent of
white students and 32 percent of Asian graduates, according to
figures compiled by the California Post Secondary Education
Commission.

   Ford Motor Co. earned the highest profits in
automotive history in 1987, out-earning General Motors Corp. for
the second straight year and generating record profit-sharing
checks for its workers.
   Ford workers will receive an average of more than $3,700 each in
profit-sharing checks as a result of Ford's 1987 earnings of $4.6
billion, the company said today.
   The No. 2 automaker's fourth-quarter earnings rose 19 percent
from a year ago and full-year earnings jumped 41 percent over 1986,
but some analysts said they had expected Ford to earn even more.
   For the final three months of 1987, Ford said it earned $932
million, or $1.87 a share, on revenue of $18.8 billion, up from
$785 million, or $1.50 a share, on revenue of $16.26 billion in the
final quarter of 1986.
   For the year, Ford earned $9.05 a share, on revenue of $71.6
billion, up from 1986 earnings of $3.29 billion, or $6.16 a share,
on revenue of $62.7 billion.
   Ford's 1987 earnings topped the previous record of $4.5 billion
set by GM in 1984. Earnings for the fourth quarter were a Ford
record, Ford said.
   Per-share earnings in 1986 were readjusted to reflect a
two-for-one stock split on Dec. 10, 1987.
   GM's 1987 earnings rose to $3.6 billion, or $10.06 per common
share. At No. 3 Chrysler Corp., earnings fell slightly to $1.3
billion, or $5.90 a share.
   Market expectations that Ford's earnings would be somewhat
higher for the year and quarter depressed the price of Ford stock
after the announcement, said Douglas Laughlin, industry analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. Ford's stock closed
down $2.25 per share at $42.25.
   ``The stock's mostly down on a gut reaction to the number but
not on any real conclusive detail. It was a very respectable
quarter and the year has been excellent,'' Laughlin said.
   Thomas O'Grady, an analyst with Integrated Automotive Resources
Inc. of Wayne, Pa., said the weaker-than-expected fourth quarter
may have been caused by sales incentive programs, which were
unnecessary a year ago when buyers were flooding showrooms to beat
1988 tax reforms.
   By the end of 1987, Ford's nest egg of cash and marketable
securities had grown to nearly $10.1 billion from $8.6 billion a
year ago.
   Ford will distribute a record total of $635 million in
profit-sharing on March 8 to salaried and hourly workers. Ford
announced the preliminary figures today to workers at its Michigan
Truck Plant in Wayne. More than 160,000 workers received an average
of $2,100 for 1986.
   ``The company's U.S. employees can take pride in their
performance as members of the Ford team. It is fitting that they
will share in the results by receiving their largest profit-sharing
checks ever,'' Ford Chairman Donald Petersen said.
   GM workers received no share of 1986 or 1987 profits because the
company's U.S. auto earnings were too low.
   Ford's profit-sharing also is based on U.S. earnings, which
jumped nearly 40 percent to $3.44 billion in 1987 from $2.46
billion in 1986 due to higher car and truck sales and increased
production efficiency, Ford said.
   Ford was the only Big Three automaker to sell more cars and
trucks in 1987 than in 1986.
   Ford attributed its performance to improved sales worldwide,
strong earnings by subsidiaries and a comfortable relationship with
the United Auto Workers union.
   Early in the fourth quarter, Ford signed a three-year,
job-protecting UAW pact that was negotiated without a strike and
helps the company improve production efficiency and cut costs.

<HEAD>Homeless Not Sought as Voters Although They Make Up Large Bloc</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The homeless, a group of Americans with a
major stake in the outcome of this year's election, may find
themselves unable to exercise much political muscle at the polls.
   These cold and hungry people have attracted added attention this
year as their growing visibility on city streets has brought them
before both voters and those seeking votes.
   A recent survey by a coalition of national organizations found
that most voters believe helping the hungry and homeless should be
one of the top priorities of the next administration.
   But while the poll called on politicians to give some attention
to the homeless, the question remains whether the homeless can
return the attention on election day.
   Theoretically they could make up a significant bloc.
   Estimates of the number of homeless Americans vary widely, from
the 360,000 reported in a 1986 economic research study to up to 3
million claimed by some advocacy groups.
   ``It's a very difficult number to get at, because it's a
difficult population to count,'' said James Stimpson of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Whatever their number, it's not likely that many will be able to
sign up and cast ballots.
   In general, registration and voting hinges on residence and the
rules vary widely from state to state, according to Craig Donsanto
of the Justice Department.
   In states such as Mississippi, the rules can be very strict,
while in some other parts of the country anyone who can show up at
the polls may be able to vote, Donsanto explained through a
department spokesman.
   In places like New York City, for example, the homeless can use
a shelter for an address, while others may even be able to list a
grate on a street corner as their usual place of residence, he said.
   The question for New York homeless was settled by a federal
court ruling in 1984, said Bill Kimberling of the Federal Election
Commission.
   He said the ruling requires the state to allow people to
register to vote even if homeless. They must list an address where
mail can be sent, he said, but that can be a shelter or some other
location where people agree to hold the mail for them.
   Their residence can then be listed as a separate place, wherever
they are usually to be found, he added.
   While that court case established the homeless' right to vote in
New York, Beth Gorey of that city's office of the National
Coalition for the Homeless, said she was unable to estimate how
many may have done so.
   ``We do take advantage of opportunities to encourage them to
register, at meetings and so forth, and we always provide voter
registration cards. But we don't know how many have'' registered,
she said.
   Tim Hager of the coalition's Washington office said voting
registration efforts also have been undertaken in Washington and
some other areas, but he had few details.
   Chris Sprowal of the Philadelphia-based National Union of the
Homeless said that outside of major cities such as New York,
Chicago, Philadelphia and a few others, homeless people generally
find themselves barred from voting.
   ``For the most part, if they would go in and say, `I stay on the
river' or `in a cardboard box' they would be denied the right to
vote. They have to lie and give a residence,'' he commented.
   Sprowal said his group is planning a meeting in Atlanta to
discuss launching a nationwide fight for voting for homeless people.
   An added problem is the near-homeless, pointed out Linda
Davidoff of the group Human Serve.
   Many people are doubled up in tight housing markets, living with
friends or relatives in violation of leases, she commented. If they
register and turn up on voter lists at the address where they are
living, the landlord could then evict them, she said, resulting in
these people being disenfranchised just like the homeless.
   Despite their reportedly large numbers, at least in major
cities, there are ``not a lot of aggressive efforts to organize''
the homeless into voting blocs, said Keith Summa of the Coalition
for the Homeless Atlanta Office.
   Deborah Livingston of the Churches Committee for Voter
Registration said a drive was conducted in New York and there have
been smaller efforts in other cities.
   But neither major political party and none of the presidential
campaigns is currently targeting formal registration drives at the
homeless.

   The awards were being presented Friday night to the
superintendents by the center's Alliance for Arts Education at the
American Association of School Administrators' convention in Las
Vegas.
   Among the highlights of arts education program in each of the
winning districts were:
   _Newport News has established a six-week summer enrichment
program in the arts, and an art magnet program for high school
students.
   _The Postal Service is considering drawings from two
first-graders at Tulakes Elementary School in a competition for a
future postage stamp, and another elementary student's drawing
served as the state's Christmas seal.
   _The Abbott Union schools use the arts to bolster instruction
for at-risk youngsters in primary and secondary schools.
   _The Independence, Mo., schools sponsor a Michelangelo Project
of art lessons for talented youngsters from low-income families and
also help expose students to ballet, theater, symphonies and
museums through a program called Art Partners.
   _District No. 16 in Spring Lake Park, Minn., employs a visual
arts curriculum for grades K-6 and an artist-in-residence.
   _District No. 28 in Camden, Me., has added staff to all arts
departments and given students in the rural area access to a
mini-theater, music facility, acoustically renovated gym and visual
arts facility.
   _The Fayette County schools in Lexington, Ky., have visual arts
specialists who instruct all elementary students one hour each
week; it also has an ``Arts in Basic Education'' program to
integrate music, drama, visual arts and movement with other
subjects.

   Two convicted killers took the witness
stand today to testify that an inmate trying to escape the death
penalty had loaned them money and had been kind and friendly in
prison.
   Darrell Edwin Hoy and Arthur Rutherford were among eight current
or former death-row convicts brought from Florida State Prison near
Starke to testify about the character of James Ernest Hitchcock, 31.
   Hitchcock was convicted and sentenced to death 10 years ago for
the murder of his 13-year-old step-niece.
   The U.S. Supreme Court overturned his sentence and ordered the
circuit court to hold a new sentencing hearing to determine if he
will die in the electric chair or receive life in prison.
   Hoy and Rutherford were brought into court today singly in
handcuffs, shackles and blue prison uniforms. They were seated in
the witness stand before the jury was brought in.
   Prosecutors asked the inmates their feelings on the death
penalty.
   ``I feel that's wrong for certain reasons, if I may say so,''
said Hoy, whose death sentence for the 1975 slayings of two
teen-agers was changed to life in prison.
   Rutherford, who faces electrocution for a 1986 murder, agreed.
   ``I'm in Florida State Prison on hearsay, no evidence, no
nothing,'' said Rutherford. ``I'm against it.''
   Both described how Hitchcock had loaned them money for canteen
items. Hoy said the defendant had given him his own radio after
Hoy's was stolen. He also said Hitchcock helped him study for a
General Education Degree.
   Hitchcock spent more than a decade in a one-man cell just a few
feet from Florida's electric chair for the 1976 rape and
strangulation of Cynthia Driggers.
   The jury now is getting a shortened version of trial testimony
and hearing more than 20 witnesses testify for and against
Hitchcock in his effort to escape death.
   The jury recommendation _ life or death _ is only advisory to
Circuit Judge Gary L. Formet Sr.
   Extraordinary security was in force at the Orange County
Courthouse as a result of the appearance of the inmates. Six of
them are awaiting electrocution; two have had their sentences
reduced to life in prison.
   Defense attorneys, who argued successfully for their appearance,
pointed out that they knew Hitchcock well because they lived near
him for more than a third of his life.
   The jury also heard a tape-recorded confession by Hitchcock in
which he admitted the raping and killing. He later recanted,
claiming the confession was given under duress because he was held
for four days in solitary confinement.

<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-Iranian group said today it kidnapped
a U.S. Marine colonel serving with the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon and released identity cards bearing his photograph.
   The Oppressed of the Earth accused Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
43, of using his leadership of a group attached to the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon to mask undercover work for the CIA.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman denied Thursday
that Higgins had any links with the CIA.
   In a rescue attempt, Shiite Amal militiamen today seized six
activists of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the
southern port of Tyre. The Amal sealed off a 300-square-mile area.
   The Amal, the main Shiite militia in Lebanon, is headed by
Lebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri. It has fighting Hezbollah
for control of southern Lebanon.
   The claim by Oppressed of the Earth was made in a typed
Arabic-language statement delivered to a Western news agency in
Beirut. It was accompanied by two identity cards, one in English
and one in Hebrew.
   Both bore photographs of Higgins, a native of Danville, Ky., and
what appeared to be his signature.
   It was the second claim of responsibility for Wednesday's
abduction. The first was made by a previously unknown group calling
itself the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades.
   ``William Higgins, agent of the Central Intelligence Agency who
uses his U.N. observer's work as a cover for his dangerous
espionage role, is in the hands of our heroic Mujahedeen (Holy
Warriors),'' the statement said.
   The group said it would release Higgins following a complete
Israeli withdrawal from its security zone in south Lebanon. It also
demanded the release of an estimated 300 Lebanese and Palestinian
prisoners held in Khiam detention camp in south Lebanon and the
immediate cessation of U.S. activity in Lebanon.
   Oppressed of the Earth is believed made up of Shiite Moslem
zealots loyal to Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   It has claimed responsibility for hijackings, bombings and and
kidnappings including the abduction of 12 Lebanese Jews in Moslem
west Beirut since 1984, eight of whom it said it killed.
   Oppressed of the Earth also claims to have staged the June 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
   During the hijacking, the captors demanded Israel free several
hundred Arabs it held. Although Israel denied any deal was made,
prisoners were released in batches in the weeks that followed the
Americans' release.
   In Washington, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said today U.S.
officials are studying whether Americans should be withdrawn from
the U.N. observer group in light of Higgins' abduction.
   But later, President Reagan said Americans will not be
withdrawn. ``No. We are going to meet our obligations to the United
Nations,'' he said during a White House photo session.
   Carlucci, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said
``everything possible'' is being done to secure Higgins' release.
   Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran, heads a 76-man observer
group that operates along the Lebanon-Israel border and has its
headquarters in Jerusalem.
   He was kidnapped by gunmen as he was driving from Tyre to UNIFIL
headquarters in the border town of Naqoura. At the time he was
violating U.N. rules for travel by Americans.
   An Amal spokesman said the Hezbollah fundamentalists were
rounded up in pre-dawn raids on houses in the port city.
   ``We suspect they were monitoring Higgins' movements in Tyre
before his abduction. They will be interrogated,'' said the
spokesman, who refused to be identified.
   ``We want Higgins back and we have no red line as far as his
case is concerned,'' Amal's military commander, Daoud Daoud, said
Thursday.
   Today, Daoud told reporters: ``We have clear clues about the
identity of the kidnappers. We're still optimistic.'' He did not
elaborate.
   The comment came after a 30-minute meeting between Amal's
military, security and political chiefs in Tyre and senior UNIFIL
commanders.
   The abduction brings the number of foreign hostages in Lebanon
to 25, including nine Americans. Most are believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite extremists.
   On Thursday, a man speaking Arabic telephoned a Western news
agency in Beirut, said the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades had
kidnapped Higgins and accused him of being a CIA agent. He did not
identify himself.
   When Higgins was seized, he was violating U.N. rules for travel
by Americans in dangerous areas, UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel
said. But, the spokesman added, the colonel ``felt he couldn't
abide by these restrictions.
   ``Higgins felt that as chief, he should be out with his men and
know what they are doing.''
   American members of U.N. forces are restricted to the
headquarters area and are permitted to travel in Lebanon only with
a U.N. military escort, he said.
   Higgins was the third U.N. official kidnapped in Lebanon this
month.
   The other two, a Swede and Norwegian of the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency, were seized Feb. 5. After that abduction, the U.N.
put plans to revive a development program in Lebanon on hold.
   Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest held of all the hostages. He was
abducted March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Specialists Say Lung Transplants Still Years Behind Heart
Replacements</HEAD>

   The surgeon who has performed the largest
number of successful lung transplants says the procedure is at a
stage comparable to that of heart transplantation 10 years ago.
   Since 1983, Dr. Joel D. Cooper, chief of thoracic surgery at the
University of Toronto and Toronto General Hospital, has performed
15 single-lung and seven double-lung transplants.
   Of the single-lung patients, 11 are long-term survivors,
including the world's longest-living at 4{ years, and six of the
seven two-lung recipients are still living.
   About 10 or 11 other double-lung transplants and six single-lung
procedures have been attempted elsewhere during the same time, said
Cooper, who also has done heart-lung transplants.
   He said lung transplantation is no more difficult than heart
transplantation, ``just different.''
   ``The next five years will tell us how to use these transplants:
singles, doubles, heart-lungs,'' Cooper said Thursday, the first
day of a three-day international conference on thoracic organ
transplantation.
   Dr. Kathryn A. Hale, a pulmonologist at the University of
Minnesota, said she hopes the next three to five years will bring
lung transplantation ``to the stage where it is no longer
considered experimental.''
   Cooper said heart transplantation clearly has ``hit the end of
phase one. Clearly there will have to be more education'' to
increase the availability of donor organs.
   And ``there will have to be other strategies developed,''
including such approaches as the use of animal organ grafts, to
increase the number of transplants, he said.
   Dr. William A. Baumgartner of Johns Hopkins University, who last
year performed a ``domino donor'' transplant in which a cystic
fibrosis sufferer received the heart and lungs of a brain-dead
donor after his own heart was donated to a second recipient, said
that operation, and a second, have shown the procedure works.
   Part of the reason for the double-organ procedure was a belief
that a heart-lung transplant was easier and safer than a straight
lung transplant.
   ``As these transplants evolve, there's going to be a role for
all of these procedures,'' unilateral lung, double lung, heart-lung
and domino donor, he said.
   He said the domino donor procedure is one ``that can be done
with good results.''
   But Cooper said ``it's probably not good science'' in the sense
that lungs now can be transplanted without the heart being removed,
and the domino donor procedure ``may be a ripple of the past.''
   Cooper called the first Johns Hopkins domino donor procedure
last May ``high drama'' because of the news coverage it engendered,
but he said he feels it is best to leave the lung recipient with
his own heart whenever possible.
   Cooper said he was not trying to be critical of the Johns
Hopkins team, but that he viewed the procedure from his perspective
as a lung transplanter.

   A jury today ruled that the Battle
Creek Enquirer libeled a man who was arrested during an
investigation of rape but never was charged with the crime, and
awarded him $1 million.
   The six-member jury deliberated four hours over two days before
finding that the paper had libeled cereal company mechanic David
Rouch when it reported on his 1979 arrest during the investigation
of a rape case.
   Jurors found that the Enquirer published false information and
failed to exercise reasonable care.
   The case set a new standard for libel in Michigan when the state
Supreme Court ruled Rouch did not have to prove malice, that the
report was published with knowledge of its falsity or reckless
disregard for the truth. That is one of the elements generally
required for a private citizen to prove libel.
   Rouch, 52, had sought $500,000 each for punitive and actual
damages. Calhoun County Circuit Court Judge Stephen Miller Thursday
threw out his claim for punitive damages after the newspaper argued
Rouch hadn't proven malice, a requirement of a punitive damage
award.
   Robert Bernius, an attorney for the Gannett Co. Inc.-owned
newspaper, said he would appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.
He and publisher Robert Miller Jr. declined further comment.
   During closing arguments, Rouch attorney John Jereck blasted the
paper for ``bulldozing'' over his client's rights. ``It was a
flagrant disregard under the camouflage of the claim of the
public's right to know, freedom of the press,'' Jereck said.
   Bernius cited testimony from experts who said the Enquirer
followed standard practice by making routine checks and accurately
reporting the assault and the arrest of Rouch as described by
police. Bernius also urged the jury to focus on what the newspaper
knew when the story was printed and not on subsequent developments.
   Rouch, 52, was arrested on suspicion of raping a 17-year-old
babysitter. A magistrate approved by telephone an interim personal
recognizance bond and he was released. The newspaper reported his
arrest and release.
   Before he was arraigned, the investigation changed and Rouch
never was formally charged. Because there was no arraignment,
Miller ruled that the state's ``official proceedings'' act didn't
protect the newspaper.
   The Enquirer didn't learn through its daily police calls that
there was another arrest in the case and neither Rouch nor his
attorney complained until nearly a year had elapsed and the lawsuit
was prepared.
   Rouch sued the city for false arrest and received a $4,000
settlement.

   Volunteers armed with flashlights, walkie-talkies
and, in some cases, police escorts combed the city's streets and
alleys early Friday in an effort to find out exactly how many
people have nowhere to call home.
   In the city's South End, a book and sweater in an alcove built
of discarded appliances alerted a volunteer to the presence of
life. A quick peek into the makeshift dwelling found two people
fast asleep.
   They were left undisturbed while three volunteers recorded them
by gender and approximate age.
   Similar groups throughout the city gathered such information to
be compiled into what the city believes is the country's only
hands-on homeless count. A similar attempt in January to quantify
the number of homeless in Pennsylvania tallied only those in
shelters.
   Boston's first such count, conducted last year, found about
2,860 homeless people.
   The volunteers took a census of shelter occupants Thursday
night, then headed into the streets at midnight to look for others
occupying makeshift accommodations.
   ``It's important to be able to speak with authority'' about the
extent of homelessness, Mayor Raymond Flynn told the 117 volunteers
before they set out in the freezing night.
   ``People rely on the city of Boston for these kinds of
figures,'' he said. ``When we start making statements about the
homeless population in America, we can speak about it with actual
statistics.''
   The city uses the statistics to help determine how much food,
beds, rescue vans and medical supplies are needed to care for the
homeless, said Ann Maquire, executive director of the city's
Emergency Shelter Commission, which organized the survey.
   The volunteers were given maps outlining their assigned search
areas.
   ``We just about walk every street in the city,'' said Allan
Stern, the city's director of data processing who is charged with
compiling the statistics. Rough numbers are expected this weekend
and a final analysis is expected in about one week, he said.
   ``It shows the concern for the issue to have so many people come
out here between the hours of 1 and 3'' in the morning, said
Richard Weintraub, 34, director of the 360-bed Long Island shelter.
   The Boston Fire Department donated two cars and two drivers.
Police in the downtown area introduced the census-takers at roll
call, alerting officers that people would be poking through the
district's nooks and crannies on a legitimate city mission.
   Most of the volunteers were people who regularly work with the
homeless and were recruited through word-of-mouth and posters.
Their experience proved an asset to the thoroughness of the count.
   One man walking slowly down a South End street hardly appeared
to be homeless, but Weintraub recognized him from one of the
shelters. He was included in the count.
   ``We still don't get all the homeless. There are people hidden
away in buildings we'll just never find,'' Weintraub said.
   The volunteers were told to be inconspicuous and not to disturb
people unless they needed help. At 3 a.m., a man was spotted
hobbling on crutches and the volunteers radioed for a rescue van,
which took him to shelter, Weintraub said.
   Weintraub's group finished searching its 30-block area in the
South End at 4 a.m., finding 10 men and one woman.
   ``If we don't find a lot of people on the street, that's
success,'' he said.

   Some people with dangerously weakened blood
vessels in the head may benefit from a new therapy that permanently
inserts balloons in the arteries that supply the brain with blood,
researchers said Friday.
   The technique appears a highly effective way of preventing
strokes in people with bulging arteries at the base of the brain,
the researchers said.
   Doctors have experimented with the technique for several years,
but they say the latest refinements have overcome earlier drawbacks
and should make it a safe way to stop lethal attacks in some people.
   The treatment is designed to block off vessels that are likely
to burst, flooding the brain with blood. Doctors from the
University of Illinois in Chicago said they have tried it on 14
people, and in 13 of them it appears to be working well.
   All of the patients had giant aneurysms. These are bulging weak
spots, often an inch across, in one of the two internal carotid
arteries that supply blood to the brain.
   About 1,500 people are diagnosed with this condition in the
United States each year. Even with standard treatment, the weakened
artery eventually bursts in about 30 percent of them, flooding the
brain with blood and causing disabling and often fatal injury.
   The treatment is not intended for people with smaller aneurysms
that can be treated in other ways.
   The results of the latest study, directed by Dr. Jafar J. Jafar,
were presented at a stroke conference sponsored by the American
Heart Association.
   ``We can do it with far less mortality and morbidity than
before,'' Jafar said. ``Patients are very grateful.''
   The balloon therapy represents one of several new medical and
surgical approaches being developed to prevent strokes or minimize
the damage once they occur.
   Strokes are the third-leading cause of death in the United
States after heart disease and cancer. They kill about 150,000
people annually.
   Most strokes occur when a blood clot blocks an artery in the
brain, starving the tissue of oxygen. However, about 10 percent
result from burst blood vessels that cause bleeding, or hemorrhage,
inside the head.
   Earlier attempts to block off giant aneurysms with balloons have
been marred by small strokes called transient ischemic attacks,
among other problems.
   ``In the past, there have been a lot of complications with this
approach,'' said Dr. Vladimir C. Hachinski of University Hospital
in London, Ontario. ``This paper seems to be saying that there are
instances where it will help.''
   Four main arteries supply blood to the brain. Even when one of
these arteries is shut off with a balloon, enough blood reaches the
brain from the other three.
   ``It's like the water system of a city,'' Jafar said. ``Four
viaducts bring the water in. You shut one of them off, and the
others can still supply enough water to the city.''
   Jafar said he was able to avoid complications with a series of
refinements in the technique, including measuring the brain's blood
supply before permanently inserting the balloon.
   The patient first receives a blood-thinning drug. While the
patient is awake under local anesthesia, doctors use a thin tube
called a catheter to push a deflated balloon through the arteries
into the head. It stops just before the aneurysm, which usually
occurs at the base of the brain in one of the carotid arteries.
   Then the balloon is filled with fluid, shutting off the artery.
Next, the doctors check the flow of blood to the brain from the
other arteries. If it is adequate, the balloon is left in place.
But if it's too weak, the balloon is removed.
   When this happens, the patient is given a drug called mannitol,
which increases the flow of blood through the other three arteries
to the brain. In a day or two, the balloon is put back and
re-inflated.
   The one patient in whom the treatment failed suffered a mild
stroke during the procedure. All the other paients are doing fine
during follow-up periods ranging from six months to four years.
   ``This series was very effective,'' said Dr. Louis R. Caplan of
Tufts Medical School in Boston. ``It's not applicable to all people
with run-of-the-mill aneurysms.''

   The U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms treaty has major
military and political gains for the NATO alliance and should be
approved without delay, a group of arms control experts told the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Friday.
   ``The overriding question is whether it lessens the risk of
nuclear war,'' said Paul. C. Warnke. ``By getting rid of a category
of nuclear weapons that are particularly vulnerable and adapted for
first use, the treaty admirably meets this test.''
   Warnke formerly served as director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency. His testimony, along with the other three
experts, concluded a third week of hearings by the committee, which
is one of three in the Senate considering the pact.
   The treaty also was criticized Friday by William Van Cleave, of
the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He told the panel
that ``it is not in our interest.''
   The accord was signed in December by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Reagan. It eliminates U.S. and Soviet
nuclear-tipped missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles.
   The administration has pushed hard for Senate ratification,
which will require a two-thirds vote of the 100-member chamber.
Senate leaders say approval is likely.
   Warnke told the panel that ``from the standpoint of strategic
policy, intermediate and shorter-range missiles fail to meet the
basic criteria strategic stability.''
   ``Because of their areas of deployment, many of them are highly
vulnerable,'' he said. ``Moreover, because of the shorter ranges
involved, ballistic missiles in these categories can strike their
targets within a few minutes and thus provide virtually no warning
time.''
   The treaty also offers political gains, Warnke said, because it
shows the ability of the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to stand together and face down political opponents
who opposed the U.S. weapons that were deployed starting in 1983,
he said.
   Ralph Earle Jr., policy director of the Lawyers Alliance for
Nuclear Arms Control, a private group, echoed Warnke's comments.
   ``To discard the treaty now would undermine the solidarity and
support the United States has received from our allies around the
world,'' Earle said.
   ``What this treaty does is put arms control back on the track
following a hiatus of eight years,'' he told the panel. ``It puts
the signature of a conservative American president on an arms
control pact, lending the process further credibility with the
public and in Congress.''
   ``This treaty can, and should, be used to galvanize support for
further reductions in conventional and strategic nuclear arms,''
Earle said.
   Jonathan Dean, arms control adviser to the Union of Concerned
Scientists, said the treaty ``has done more than any event of the
past 40 years to promote a European feeling of responsibility for
their own defense and for intra-European defense cooperation.''
   The chief military effect ``is to improve NATO's theater-range
nuclear position while enhancing crisis stability,'' Dean told the
panel. ``Consequently, the agreement creates no new need to improve
NATO's nuclear forces. It makes no sense to build down nuclear
weapons with one hand and build them up with the other.''
   William Schneider Jr., chairman of the U.S. General Advisory
Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament, praised the treaty's
verification provisions, which include short-notice inspections and
on-site inspections.
   He noted the Soviets' ``abysmal record'' of complying with past
arms control agreements and noted the new treaty ``provides an
important opportunity to begin to correct this problem.''
   Van Cleave, criticizing the treaty, said he believes the main
Soviet aim is to cripple Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile defense
research program and other U.S. efforts aimed at building up
western defenses.
   ``Virtually every western modernization program, particularly in
the nuclear areas, would be greatly dampened by the current climate
of arms control,'' he told the panel.

   New Jersey has decided not to try Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter a third time for murder, ending the former
boxer's 22-year legal saga, a prosecutor said today.
   John Goceljak, acting prosecutor in Passaic County, said the
decision was based on the long period of time since the 1966
murders, the unavailability of witnesses, the likely exclusion of
the only eyewitness testimony and the decision by a federal judge
that Carter's conviction was racially tainted.
   Goceljak said his office today was filing a motion in Superior
Court in Paterson to dismiss the indictment against Carter and John
Artis, accused of being his accomplice.
   Goceljak said the decision was made in consultation with the
state's criminal justice director, Donald R. Belsole.
   ``It's not a relief,'' said Belsole, ``it's the way the system
works. It's the right thing to do. It's time now to close the book
on the case.''
   A judge must sign the motion to finalize dismissal of the
indictment, and attorney Myron Beldock, in a statement on behalf of
Carter and Artis, said he hoped for quick consideration by the
court.
   ``We are extremely pleased with the decision of the state of New
Jersey to dismiss the case against our clients, and hope that the
appropriate orders will be signed promptly,'' said Beldock.
   On Jan. 11, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a federal judge's
ruling that cleared Carter. The lower-court judge found Carter's
conviction was tainted by racism and by prosecutors withholding
information from the defense. Carter had been free on bail pending
appeal after serving 19 years of a life prison term.
   The Supreme Court ruling left to the Passaic County prosecutor's
office the decision on whether to seek another trial for Carter and
his alleged accomplice, whose first convictions were overturned by
the New Jersey Supreme court before a 1976 retrial.
   Defense attorneys all along had considered a third trial
unlikely because the eyewitness testimony had been so discredited
during appeals.
   Carter, a former middleweight contender now 50, has been living
in seclusion since being freed by U.S. District Judge H. Lee
Sarokin in 1985.
   His cause was taken up by Bob Dylan, who wrote and sang ``The
Ballad of Hurricane'' in the 1970s, actress Ellen Burstyn, boxer
Muhammed Ali, singer Joan Baez and others who elevated Carter as a
symbol of racial injustice.'
   But after a few highly publicized fund-raising events _ some
touched by scandal _ Carter's all-star backing faded.
   The legal odyssey began on a hot night June 17, 1966, when two
black gunmen entered the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson and
killed the bartender and two patrons. Hours earlier, a black
Paterson bartender had been shot to death by a white man.
   Carter and Artis were arrested three months later and convicted
by an all-white jury in May 1967.
   But two witnesses later recanted, saying they had been pressured
by detectives into giving false testimomny at the trial, and the
case was reopened in 1974. The state Supreme Court threw out the
first verdict in 1976.
   The state put Carter and Artis back on trial and they were
convicted again in 1976, in part with the testimony of one of the
recanting witnesses who retracted claims he was coerced. This time,
the state's highest court upheld the convictions by a 4-3 vote in
1982.
   The case went to federal court and Sarokin found that the 1976
convictions were tainted by ``racial stereotyping, fear and
prejudice,'' and by the defense not having the full results of a
lie detector test given to one of the recanting witnesses.

   Impeached Gov. Evan Mecham says acting
Gov. Rose Mofford is replacing his administration before the Senate
can decide whether to remove him permanently, but a Mofford aide
said she has ``bent over backward'' to be fair.
   ``May I ask you to recognize that I have only been accused and
not convicted of any act,'' Mecham said Thursday in a letter to
Mofford. The embattled Republican also demanded that Mofford
forward all his mail unopened.
   ``I must convey my deep disappointment and surprise at the way
your people are turning a temporary acting governorship into a
complete disruption and replacement of my administration,'' Mecham
said.
   The Republican-controlled House impeached Mecham on charges he
concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, misused $80,000 in state money
and obstructed justice. His impeachment trial in the Senate is
scheduled to start Feb. 29. He also faces a criminal trial in March
in connection with the campaign loan.
   Mecham also faces a recall election May 17, and today former
U.S. Rep. John Rhodes, a Republican, announced he would be a
candidate.
   ``Our state needs effective gubernatorial leadership to help our
legislators solve our problems,'' said Rhodes, 71, who retired from
Congress in 1982. ``We cannot afford continued paralysis.''
   Mecham is guaranteed a spot on the recall ballot, and the only
other major announced candidate is Carolyn Warner, a Democrat who
lost to Mecham in 1986 in a three-way race. About 80 people have
picked up packets to collect the 3,336 petition signatures that are
needed by March 18 to get on the ballot.
   Mecham's letter came as Mrs. Mofford, a Democratic secretary of
state who became acting governor upon Mecham's impeachment,
accepted the resignation of Washington lobbyist Fred Craft.
   Last week, Mecham urged Mrs. Mofford to retain Craft, who has
helped Arizona lobby for the federal superconducting super collider
and rented part of his law offices for use by Arizona. Craft
tendered his resignation Feb. 11.
   Mecham's efforts to use Craft on the superconducting super
collider and other issues were controversial and stirred
allegations that he had tried to get around the state procurement
code.
   Mrs. Mofford issued a statement Thursday, saying, ``Members of
the (Arizona) congressional delegation have promised to continue to
be especially vigilant with the issues facing Arizona, especially
the supercollider.''
   Mecham's letter criticized the way mail has been handled since
his impeachment.
   ``What I protest the most is the sudden ordering of the mail
room staff to vacate Tuesday afternoon,'' he wrote.
   ``I realize that your people said that mail marked PERSONAL OR
CONFIDENTIAL would not be opened but I insist that all mail
addressed to me is to be forwarded without opening,'' he wrote.
   Mrs. Mofford's chief of staff, Andy Hurwitz, confirmed that
state Department of Administration officials were brought in to
handle the mail but said he would be willing to work out further
compromises if needed.
   ``We have, I think, bent over backward to try and accommodate
him,'' Hurwitz said of Mecham, noting that only those who offered
resignations had actually been let go.
   Acting Mofford press secretary Athia Hardt said Mecham aide
Bonnie Simons and her aides were reassigned after Ms. Simons took
the position that any mail addressed to office of the governor
should go to Mecham first.
   Much of the mail requires immediate action and ``it would be
irresponsible for us to bundle it up and send it off to Glendale,''
Ms. Hardt said, referring to the suburban offices Mecham has
referred to as his government-in-exile.

   A leftist social action group on
Friday called for an international investigation of human rights
violations by President Corazon Aquino's government.
   The Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates said it was
filing a petition Friday asking the Geneva-based United Nations
Human Rights Commission to investigate Mrs. Aquino's human rights
record.
   The petition, copies of which were released at a news
conference, alleges that ``human rights violations have increased
under the Aquino government.'' It asks that the commission condemn
the Aquino and U.S. governments for allegedly abetting them.
   There was no immediate comment from the Aquino government.
Military officials had earlier denied allegations of human rights
violations and said they were concocted by communist rebels and
their supporters.
   The Philippines' House of Representatives is investigating
charges that some of the 20 alleged rebel leaders arrested in raids
early this month had been tortured.
   The alliance is an umbrella organization of church-affiliated
human rights groups which the military claims are infiltrated by
members of the rebel New People's Army.
   In its petition, the alliance cited specific allegations of
abuses, including extra-judicial executions and torture of
suspected rebels, bombing of civilians, forced evacuation of rural
villagers and use of armed civilian anti-communist vigilantes.
   It said it included the United States in the petition because
the U.S. government ``has intensified its intervention in the
counter-insurgency program of the Aquino government.''
   Judge Maximiano Asuncion of the regional trial court in suburban
Quezon City said the trial of 20 alleged rebel leaders will begin
next month. Six of the defendants pleaded innocent to charges of
illegal possession of firearms.
   In a televised interview after the arraignment, Asuncion said he
supports a proposal that trials of rebels be conducted by military
tribunals instead of the civil courts because the military is in a
better position to handle possible reprisals.
   Also Friday, suspected communist rebels killed a police
informant in an ambush in Manila, and three men shot and killed a
major in the southern province of Zamboanga del Sur, police and
military officials said.
   Informant Petronilo Lim died in a Manila hospital a few hours
after suspected communist urban guerrillas gunned him down in the
capital's Tondo district, police said.
   In Zamboanga del Sur province on Mindanao island 500 miles
southeast of Manila, three unidentified men shot Maj. Carlos Pumano
after they called him out of his home after midnight Thursday,
military officials said. Pumano was operations chief of the
Philippine Constabulary command in the province.

   Flocks of pesky pigeons seem impossible to
scare away and killing them is messy, but some Oklahoma legislators
think they've hit on a way to limit the feathered population ...
birth control.
   State Sen. Leo Kingston introduced an amendment that would allow
game officials to use birth control-treated feed instead of poison
for pigeon control.
   His proposal was approved as an amendment to a House bill passed
by the Senate on Thursday that removes pigeons from the status of
game birds. Such status has meant they can't be shot except during
hunting season. The measure would allow pigeons to be eradicated or
removed from areas where they have become a nuisance.
   State Sen. Gilmer Capps raised one question about the birth
control idea that wasn't fully answered: what will happen to the
population of stray cats that catch and eat pigeons that are ``on
the pill?''

   Annette Himmelein only met Perri
Doughty of Australia one week ago, but on Saturday Doughty will
serve as bridesmaid at Himmelein's wedding.
   Six years ago, the young women became pen pals through a project
at Himmelein's high school and they later vowed to stand up for
each other when they married.
   Doughty arrived last Saturday to fulfill her part of the bargain
and one of the first things that struck her was the difference in
climate between her 21-year-old pen pal's home and her own native
city of Goondiwindi in the state of Queensland.
   ``I've never seen snow before,'' said Doughty. ``I left a nice
hot summer to come here.''
   Australia isn't the only foreign nation to be represented at the
wedding of Himmelein and Mark Shepherd.
   Also attending are Nanna Rintala, 20, of Kauhava, Finland, and
Patrick Coenen, 22, of Lamaken, Belgium. Both are former exchange
students who lived with the Himmelein family.
   ``My parents' house is sort of like the U.N. right now,'' said
Himmelein, an assistant nurse. ``I sent all of them invitations. It
was just the natural thing to do, because I consider all the
exchange students we've had here my brothers and sisters.''
   Doughty said she was flabbergasted by the scale of the wedding.
   ``I nearly fell over when she told me she was going to have 700
people there,'' Doughty said.

<HEAD>Former Tamil Militant Groups Applying to Become Political Parties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of two former Tamil rebel
groups that surrendered their weapons to peacekeeping troops said
Friday they have applied to have the groups recognized as political
parties.
   Spokesmen for the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization and the
People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam said they supported
the peace accord signed in July to end the four-year war by
minority Tamils seeking an independent homeland.
   The Election Commission announced Wednesday that nominations for
nine provincial councils would be accepted March 2-9. The council
elections are a part of the peace accord.
   The commission has already granted political recognition to the
former militant group Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front.
   ``We have applied to the Election Commission for recognition as
a political party,'' said Subramanian Haridarraj, a politburo
member of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization. He said his
group fully backed the peace accord and wanted to turn its military
organization into a political movement.
   When asked what the once gun-wielding members are doing now,
Haridarraj said, ``We have got fairly large-scale poultry projects
going on in Mannar and Vavuniya in the north and east. Our members
are keen to develop this kind of self-employment.
   ``And right now chicken prices are good in Colombo,'' he added.
   A leader of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam
said, ``We are not signatories to the peace accord, but we back it.
We are gearing ourselves to participate in the political process.''
   The leader identified himself by his military code name, Haran.
   The peace accord has been rejected by the largest and most
powerful Tamil militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   More than 45,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to disarm the
Tigers and enforce the pact, which was mediated by India.
   India is Sri Lanka's northern neighbor and has a large Tamil
population of its own. In Sri Lanka, Tamils comprise 18 percent of
the 16 million population and claim they are discriminated against
by the majority Buddhist Sinhalese.
   The leaders of the less militant Tamil groups both demanded that
986 rebel suspects being held in Sri Lankan jails be released as
stipulated by the accord.
   ``We cannot afford to lose sight of our cadres yet behind bars.
This is the only sore point,'' Haridarraj said.
   The Sri Lankan government released hundreds of suspects
immediately after the accord was signed July 29 but later stopped
the process when the Tigers refused to surrender arms.
   Sri Lanka's largest opposition party, the Sri Lanka Freedom
Party, announced it would boycott provincial council elections,
saying general elections should be held before any local polls.
   The moderate Tamil political party Tamil United Liberation Front
also has said the elections be postponed because of the turbulence
in the north and east, the Tigers' stronghold.

<HEAD>New Cabinet Lineup Unveiled; Hard-Liners Hold Security Posts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Roh Tae-woo announced
his new cabinet lineup Friday by retaining seven ministers from the
old cabinet and placing three hard-liners in top security posts.
   Roh, who takes office Feb. 25, has pledged to usher in full
democracy but political observers said the makeup of the cabinet
indicates Roh is favoring stability.
   Roh urged new ministers to maintain administrative continuity in
the face of legislative elections, economic problems and the
Olympic Games in Seoul.
   The former general demanded the next government establish a
fresh moral standard to gain public trust but opposition parties
said his cabinet lacked freshness in its character and background.
   The new lineup of 20 ministers plus a prime minister and deputy
prime minister contained many technocrats and academics. Five
figures with military backgrounds were appointed as ministers of
defense, labor, communications, transportation and government
administration.
   Opposition parties rejected an invitation to field candidates
for the cabinet, charging that Roh would continue the authoritarian
rule of outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan no matter what they did.
   The move obviously limited the opposition's effect on the
cabinet's formation. But it also removed the opposition from any
responsibility in the policies of the new government.
   Roh, who helped Chun seize power in 1980 with military backing,
won presidential elections last December after promising to end the
country's long tradition of military domination.
   He was opposed by two opposition candidates, Kim Young-sam and
Kim Dae-jung, who split the opposition ticket thereby allowing Roh
to win.
   Roh gave the top security posts to three hard-liners: new
Defense Minister Oh Ja-bock, Home Minister Lee Sang-hee and Justice
Minister Chung Hae-chang.
   Oh retired as chariman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in December
and retains considerable influence in the military. He is expected
to be Roh's link to the armed forces.
   Ahn Moo-hyuk was retained as head of the powerful intellignece
organization, the Agency for National Security Planning, whose
director works with the cabinet but is not a member.
   Roh stressed his desire to ensure sustained economic expansion
by filling economic posts with noted experts.
   His economic considerations were underlined Feb. 11 when he
named Lee Hyun-jae, a political moderate and noted economics
professor, as prime minister.
   Roh has said he would reduce presidential power and increase the
influence of the prime miniser and his cabinet. Ministers held
little power in the past, with most decisions being made by the
presidency.
   The top economic post went to a leading technocrat, Rha
Woong-bae, who was promoted from trade minister in the old cabinet
to deputy prime minister and economic planning minister.
   ``Right now, we are on the threshold of entering from a
developing country to an advanced country,'' Roh told the new
cabinet in calling for a renewed export drive.
   Economic ministers pledged to give top priority to ensuring
price stability. Roh has promised development projects but the new
government is expected to adopt a tight money policy with limited
spending.
   There has been growing concern that high inflation could damage
the economy. Another thorny economic issue is growing trade
friction with countries that have trade deficits with South Korea.
Seoul is under strong pressure from the United States to open its
markets wider to U.S. goods.

   The State Department denied today reports that
the U.S. government has approached Panama about the possibility of
dropping charges against Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega if he and his military associates withdrew from politics.
   According to reports in Newsday and The New York Times,
Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams had discussed the
possibility of a deal during a meeting this week in Miami with
Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   But State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Abrams ``made
no deal, offered no deal and was not in a position to offer a deal''
   He said that in response to a Panamanian inquiry, Abrams told
Delvalle that it was legally possible for the United States to drop
the indictments against Noriega. Two Florida grand juries handed
down a series of drug-related indictment against Noriega earlier
this month.
   ``We have every intention of carrying through on the
indictments,'' Redman said.
   But Justice Department spokesman John K. Russell earlier today
did not dispute an account in today's New York Times that quoted
him as saying Abrams had notified senior department officials that
he would seek to have the indictments dropped if Noriega left the
country.
   ``We told him we would be against the idea,'' Russell told The
Times.
   Redman said Russell's account was ``slightly wrong.'' Redman
added that he stood by his own version of what happened.
   At the White House, President Reagan refused to discuss the
subject.
   ``This is a case before the courts and I am not going to
comment,'' the president said in response to a reporter's question
during a picture-taking ceremony in the Oval Office with West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Delvalle is Panama's titular leader, but political authority
rests largely with Noriega, the general who heads Panama's Defense
Forces.
   Noriega was indicted Feb. 5 by federal grand juries in Miami and
Tampa, Fla., on racketeering and other narcotics-related charges.
His extradition appears highly unlikely because a 1904 treaty
between the two countries does not oblige either state to extradite
its own nationals.
   The Times reported that Abrams had told Delvalle the charges
might be dropped if Noriega and his top associates withdrew from
politics and go into exile. Newsday published a similar report in
Thursday's editions.
   The Times said the Justice Department told Abrams it would
oppose any move to drop the indictments, and that any decision to
drop the indictments would have to be made by President Reagan.
   Newsday, quoting unidentified sources close to Delvalle, said
that Delvalle agreed to discuss the offer with Noriega in Panama.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified State Department official
as saying that Abrams and Delvalle ``discussed the situation and
(Abrams) urged Delvalle to take a larger role as a civilian in a
move to get the military to step back.''
   ``The question of Noriega's indictment did come up in the
discussion,'' the newspaper quoted the official as saying. ``It is
not correct to say that deals are being made.''
   Newsday quoted a source as saying Abrams had asked Delvalle to
fly to Washington after the meeting and telephone Noriega with the
offer. Delvalle declined and returned to Panama.
   The Times said the proposal for a deal was initiated by
Delvalle, not by Abrams. Officials said Abrams had told Delvalle
that the State and Defense Departments probably would be receptive
to a dismissal of the indictments if Noriega left Panama, but that
the Justice Department would oppose it.

<TEXT>
   A judge said Friday he would rule March 7
on Union Carbide Corp.'s appeal of a court order that it pay $270
million in interim relief to victims of the Bhopal gas leak.
   Another judge hearing the government's $3 billion damage case
against Union Carbide adjourned proceedings until March 16 to await
the decision in the appeal.
   High Court Judge S.K. Seth heard closing arguments on the appeal
of the interim relief order, which Carbide says is unfair until
liability in the 1984 disaster is determined.
   More than 2,800 people died and at least 20,000 were seriously
injured when gas leaked from a Carbide subsidiary in Bhopal, in
central India.
   Attorney F.S. Nariman, representing the Danbury, Conn.-based
company, told the court Friday that the order would not be
enforceable in the United States, the United News of India reported.
   But Indian government attorney K. Parasaran said India had
succeeded in previous claims cases, the news agency said.
   Meanwhile, Bhopal District Judge M.W. Deo adjourned hearings in
the main damages case until after the appeals verdict is issued.
   It was Deo who ordered Carbide last December to deposit $270
million to be used as ``interim relief'' payments for victims. He
said the victims were in great need and could not wait for help
until the damages case was settled.
   The government filed its suit on behalf of the victims Sept. 5,
1986, accusing Carbide of negligence. Union Carbide claims the
accident was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee.

   The leader of South Africa's
poorest black homeland told President P.W. Botha on Friday that
partitioning the nation into such ``self-governing'' states won't
solve its political problems.
   Kenneth Mopeli, chief minister of Qwaqwa, was essentially saying
``No thanks'' to plans Botha had outlined for more self-sufficiency
and eventual independence for the tribal areas.
   The territories comprise 13 percent of South Africa's land and
are meant to be homelands for the nation's black majority, which
has no voice in national affairs.
   Mopeli called Botha one of South Africa's greatest leaders but
challenged his view of the future for the 10 homelands.
   The president was in Phuthaditjhaba to dedicate a new
government-funded Legislative Assembly building for the tiny
homeland in the dusty foothills of the Drakensberg mountains. The
president also unveiled a bust of Mopeli.
   Botha told the 80 black legislators that the self-governing
areas ``have a proud history.''
   He said development taking place in Qwaqwa _ which means
``whiter than white'' in southern Sotho dialect _ had convinced him
the homeland wanted to be more self-sufficient.
   Mopeli has steadfastly resisted independence for Qwaqwa, saying
it does not have enough land or industry to be economically or
politically viable.
   Qwaqwa, covering 240 square miles, is the smallest of the
homelands, and many of its workers earn about $30 a month. It is
one of six homelands classified as ``self-governing states.'' Four
homelands are recognized as independent republics by South Africa.
   ``The self-governing states as they exist today are
apartheid-affirmed structures,'' Mopeli said, referring to the
government's policy of racial separation.
   ``We are still convinced that our political salvation does not
lie in the partitioning and fragmenting of this country for various
groups,'' he said. ``We need ... a more viable formula.''
   Botha said homeland leaders such as Mopeli, who have rejected
independence, will be invited to ``share in discussions on
continued constitutional reform for all the black communities.''
   He specifically mentioned the proposed National Council, an
advisory body intended to negotiate a political system that would
for the first time bring blacks into national politics.
   Currently, the 5 million whites lead the government and control
the economy, while the 26 million blacks are not represented in
Parliament.
   Most prominent black leaders, including Mopeli, have rejected
the National Council idea.
   ``The national council that is being envisaged as an instrument
of negotiation shall always be viewed with suspicion, since
according to its chief spokesman (Botha), it is intended to design
a constitution that will be built on the group concept,'' Mopeli
said. ``The fears we harbor are that once the group concept has
been entrenched in the constitution, some groups may find
themselves being more equal than others.''

   A legislative committee beat a retreat Friday
after Republicans and Democrats alike threatened rebellion over a
policy to ban food from committee rooms and the House chamber.
   The four-member House Services Committee reversed itself on a
3-1 vote, allowing legislators to have their cake and eat it, too,
while working.
   The vote came early Friday morning after majority Republicans in
the House stalled work Thursday on dozens of major bills awaiting
action. Instead, the legislators went into caucus to argue over the
no-food policy.
   The lone holdout on the committee was Rep. Tom Ratterree, a
retired Air Force colonel who has strong feelings about the subject.
   ``When I came up here several years ago, before I was elected, I
was amazed at what I saw, people eating in committee meetings and
leaving a mess,'' he told a reporter Thursday.
   At that time Ratterree vowed not to change his position.
   ``I think it's a mess,'' he said. ``I don't know of any
businesses that allow that to happen.''
   No vote was taken in the caucus, but several members circulated
letters and gathered names in support of a reversal.
   Several hours after the caucus at least two lawmakers defiantly
munched cookies in a House committee room.
   Earlier this week, House Speaker Carl ``Bev'' Bledsoe proposed
the no-food policy when outside groups began offering legislators
breakfast in the Capitol before each morning's session. He said
crumbs and debris from the on-the-job meals had gotten out of hand.
   The policy forced minority Democrats to abandon their luncheon
caucus and move it into the office of Gov. Roy Romer.

   A U.N. spokesman said Friday that a
kidnapped U.S. Marine serving with a peacekeeping force in Lebanon
was not violating travel restrictions when he was abducted,
contradicting an earlier U.N. report.
   U.N. spokesman Mario Zamorano said Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
who disappeared Wednesday, was operating within U.N. guidelines
when he drove from Tyre to the headquarters of the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon in the border town of Naqoura.
   Thursday UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said that American
members of U.N. forces are restricted to the headquarters area and
are permitted to travel in Lebanon only with a U.N. military escort.
   Zamorano called Goksel's report ``totally inaccurate.''
   ``As all his predecessors, he travelled freely in the area
without escort,'' Zamorano said.
   Higgins, chief of the observer group, was the 10th American to
head the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization in Lebanon in the 40
years since it was formed. The 76-man group, with eight other
Americans besides Higgins, is attached to UNIFIL in south Lebanon.
   For 40 years, he said, U.N. observers in the Middle East have
had a ``categorical rule: They do not carry weapons or move with
armed escorts. That is something they want themselves.
   ``They believe their protection comes from being unarmed,'' he
said.
   In times of danger, it has been suggested that the observers
should have armed escorts,'' he said, but added, ``They always have
rejected this.''
   Zamorano said that U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding
met Higgins' fellow officers Friday and was told ``even after the
abduction that they do not, repeat do not, want to be armed or have
armed escorts.''
   The U.N. spokesman said that on Thursday Higgins' U.N. observer
force was pulled out of the U.N. peacekeeping area in south Lebanon
and withdrawn to the headquarters near Naqoura.
   The U.N. spokesman in New York had no comment on claims of
kidnap responsibility by two groups. He said the matter was under
investigation.
   The spokesman said Higgins had gone to Tyre for a meeting with
Amal militia leaders as part of his official duties.

   The second court-martial of Marine Cpl.
Lindsey Scott on controversial charges of raping and trying to kill
a fellow Marine's wife went to a military jury Thursday as his
father predicted acquittal.
   ``I am very confident that we will win it,'' James Scott said
after deliberations began. ``I just think there's justice in the
world.''
   Scott, 32, of Louisville, Ky., was convicted of abduction, rape,
sodomy and attempted murder in an April 20, 1983, attack at the
Quantico Marine Base.
   That verdict was overturned in 1987 by the U.S. Military Court
of Appeals on grounds Scott had not received adequate counsel from
his first civilian attorney.
   Meanwhile, civil rights activists established a legal defense
fund for Scott, and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a story on the
case. Jesse Jackson directed aides to lobby the Congressional Black
Caucus to pressure the Pentagon for a new trial for the black
serviceman.
   Scott had become a suspect almost immediately after the woman,
the 23-year-old wife of a military policeman who worked with him,
was found dazed and bleeding.
   She told investigators she had been lured from her apartment by
a telephone call from a man who said her husband had been in an
accident and who offered to take her to the hospital.
   Instead, the man drove her to a remote spot, raped her, choked
her, stabbed her in the neck and left her for dead, she said.
   The white woman picked Scott from a group of photographs and
then from a lineup, but each time she equivocated, saying other men
in the groups resembled him. Once she picked out Scott because she
said he ``scares me the most.''
   Investigators said she also identified his car.
   The 17-day retrial ended with civilian defense attorney John
Leino arguing there was a lack of evidence against his client.
   Leino repeated his charge that the Naval Investigative Service
used improper lineup techniques and led the victim to her
identification of Scott.
   The victim picked Scott because ``in her mind, someone has to
pay,'' he said.
   Lieno said the only bit of forensic evidence presented in the
case _ a hair taken from the victim's clothing _ did not belong to
Scott.
   ``We think that the motive in this case was sex ... and we
believe that the intent was murder,'' military prosecutor Maj. Ron
McNeil told the jury of seven Marines.
   ``Was there a conspiracy here to make this up? Absolutely not.
There's no conspiracy here.'' McNeil said.
   A crucial part of Scott's defense was the testimony of a
department store security guard who said she saw Scott in a store
at the time of the attack.
   The prosecution said the testimony of Cynthia Ausby was
``incredible.'' McNeil said Ms. Ausby did not firmly recall seeing
Scott until almost 10 months after the crime. She did not testify
in the first court-martial.
   The defense argued that Ms. Ausby's recollection was aided by
her checking of store arrest records.

<HEAD>Justice Department To Steer Clear of Further Shuttle Settlement
Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Friday it is
declining to participate in any further settlements with families
of the seven astronauts killed in the Challenger shuttle crash.
   The department negotiated settlements with four of the seven
families in December 1986.
   The Justice Department's position is that it would be unfair to
contribute to any settlement higher than the amounts negotiated in
1986 and that the government has no legal liability in the
accident, said department spokeswoman Amelia Brown.
   Last week, the father and brother of mission specialist Judith
A. Resnik signed an agreement with shuttle contractor Morton
Thiokol Inc. for payment of from $1.5 million to $2.5 million. The
Justice Department declined to participate in the negotiations
leading to that settlement.
   Resnik's relatives weren't involved in the 1986 settlement.
   In addition to Resnik, the federal government didn't make
payments to the family of Ronald E. McNair, who also settled
separately with Thiokol.
   The widow of Challenger pilot Michael Smith has sued the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Thiokol.
   Brown said the Resnik family had rejected a ``generous'' offer
prior to the 1986 settlement, which was made on behalf of NASA and
Morton Thiokol.
   Brown said the offer took into account the different financial
needs in the families based on the number of dependents and also
took into account the requests from the families that they be
treated as similarly as possible in the settlement. Resnik was the
only Challenger crew member who was not survived by a spouse and
children.
   The Justice Department has never released the terms of the
settlements, citing the survivors' privacy, but Justice Department
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the amount
was at least $1 million for each of the four families.

   A burglar with an eye for art stole an
original watercolor by Thomas Hart Benton valued at $46,000, an
autographed color photograph and two other paintings, police said.
   The Benton watercolor, ``Trading at Westport Landing,''
apparently was a detailed study for Benton's mural ``Old Kansas
City,'' commissioned by the River Club and completed in 1956.
   The most recent appraisal of the study put its value at $46,000.
   Also stolen in Monday's break-in was a color photograph of
``Persephone,'' signed by the artist. ``Persephone'' is a 1939
Benton painting bought by the Nelson Gallery last year for a
reported $2.5 million.
   A painting of streetcar tracks by Duard Marshall and a work
depicting a cherry tree by an artist identified only as Winchell,
also were taken, but nothing else in the house was touched.
   Sgt. Bob Watts, of the Metro Patrol burglary unit, said the fact
that only the paintings and photo were stolen during the break-in
``seems to indicate they went there for the specific purpose of
stealing his art.''
   The owner, who asked not to be identified, and his family were
friendly with Benton and the owner's father bought the Westport
landing painting and bequeathed it to his son.

   Some Israeli soldiers who confront Arab rioters
are firing soft-nosed dumdum bullets, which have an exploding
effect on impact and make large, tearing wounds, British opposition
leader Neil Kinnock said Friday.
   Kinnock, leader of Britain's Labor Party, said he saw an X-ray
taken of the wound that forced doctors to amputate the lower part
of a Palestinian's leg.
   He said it ``showed shattering of the bone and flesh consistent
with the use of an explosive bullet.'' At another point in the news
conference, he said the injury also was consistent with ``the wound
inflicted by a dumdum bullet.''
   Smaller caliber ammunition is being modified to make it more
dangerous, he said, and displayed two .22-caliber bullets that had
been filed to give them rough edges.
   ``The filed-down bullet with its extra effects of internal
wounding is deliberately done ... and that conforms to many of the
definitions of dumdum,'' Kinnock said the third day of his visit
here.
   Since November, Israeli snipers have used .22-caliber rifles
under supervision of their superiors to hit leaders of Palestinian
protests.
   Dumdum bullets are outlawed by the Geneva Conventions for use in
warfare.
   Israeli officials have denied the army uses them, but
Palestinian doctors have said for several weeks that only dumdums
could have caused some of the wounds they treat.
   Kinnock, who has met with Israel's top leaders during his visit,
said none denied such bullets were being used.
   ``On the occasions on which I've put the point, I've received
rationalizations and descriptions of the terrible pressures under
which the Israeli Defense Forces are operating, but no one has
attempted to deny that the bullets are used,'' he said.
   Kinnock added, however, that he believed such ammunition was
``being used without any form of permission or direction or
acceptance or endorsement by the Israeli army and the Israeli
authorities. Of that I have no doubt.''
   Kinnock also said there was ``clear evidence, irrefutable
evidence'' that Israeli soldiers had shot Arab protesters in the
back since Arab riots began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   On visits to two hospitals in the occupied territories, Kinnock
said, he saw seven Palestinians hospitalized with bullet wounds in
the back.
   He said he expressed his concern about the use of modified
bullets and the back wounds to Israeli officials and ``it is
possible that these tactics may be adjusted, are indeed possibly in
the process of being adjusted now.''
   Kinnock arrived in Israel after visits to Jordan and Egypt, and
has toured both the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEAD>Man's Dying Wish For Book Comes True</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EULESS, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A book collector has written a happy ending
to a dying man's quest for a rare book to complete his collection
of works by western novelist Zane Grey.
   Mack Landers' quest for a copy of ``Don, The Story Of A Lion
Dog,'' of which only an estimated 100 copies exist in this country,
got national publicity when syndicated columnist Bob Greene wrote
about him.
   After hearing about Landers, Dr. James H. Vickers, president of
the National Zane Grey's West Society in Ijamsville, Md., sent a
copy to Greene, who will deliver it to Landers on Sunday at his
home in this Fort Worth suburb.
   ``Anybody that thought that much of Zane Grey, I'm happy to send
it to him,'' Vickers, 57, said Thursday. ``I hope he gets a lot of
enjoyment out of it.''
   Doctors gave Landers, 73, less than three months to live in
January, after they found that cancer had spread in his body.
   Landers was near tears when he learned that a copy of ``Don''
soon would be added to his 92-book collection of Grey's books.
   ``I don't have the vocabulary to express how I really feel,''
said Landers. ``I know it's true, but I can't believe I'm going to
get it. It's wonderful that someone would do that for an old man.''
   Out of appreciation for Greene's efforts, Landers said he will
accept the copy the Chicago Tribune columnist is delivering rather
than one offered by a Fort Worth woman or those offered by people
from California, Colorado, Connecticut and several other states.
   ``We're going to go with Mr. Greene because he was the one who
instigated the story in the first place,'' said Landers' wife,
Alliene. ``Everyone is being so kind. We're real grateful.''
   Greene said he even was contacted by Zane Grey's granddaughter,
who offered to give Landers a copy.
   Greene said he was surprised by the response to his column that
appeared last week in about 200 newspapers.
   ``The books are starting to pop up,'' he said. ``It's been
estimated to me that there are only about 100 in the country. We
had no idea we'd have this kind of response.''
   ``Don'' is a limited-edition tale about a hunting expedition
Grey and friends took to the Grand Canyon area in the early 1920s.
The men were hunting mountain lions, not to kill but to sell to
zoos and circuses.

<HEAD>Students From Tufts, Moscow State To Discuss Arms Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 350 students from Tufts University
will discuss the Cold War and nuclear arms race in a classroom
session with undergraduate counterparts in the Soviet Union via
television, the school said.
   The March 5 teleconference is the first of three scheduled
sessions between students from Tufts and Moscow State University in
a jointly run course on the superpowers' arms buildup.
   Tufts professor Martin J. Sherwin, course instructor and
director of Tufts' Nuclear Age History and Humanities Center, said
the project coincides with the rise of glasnost, Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   ``Given the new climate in the Soviet Union, this appears to be
the right step at the right time,'' he said.
   An American panel of historians and foreign policy experts is
scheduled to discuss the arms race with a panel of Soviet
counterparts.
   ``These programs will be lively discussions,'' Sherwin said.
``Panelists will be directed to engage in a dialogue rather than to
present set pieces.''
   Students will have an opportunity to question both countries'
panelists, he added.
   The first session will focus on the history of the nuclear age,
including the consequences of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in World War II, the first United Nations' arms control
debates and the origins of the Cold War, Sherwin said.
   The 1962 Cuban missile crisis and current nuclear policy issues
_ including the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative program, the
Geneva arms talks and the December signing of an intermediate range
missile reduction treaty _ will be discussed at April 9 and April
30 sessions.

<HEAD>Rundown Housing Project Is Added To National Register of Historic
Places</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rundown housing project that some critics say
should be razed has been placed on the National Register of
Historic Place, a move hailed by residents and other opponents of
demolition.
   ``Thank the Lord,'' Shirley Johnson, treasurer of the Allen
Parkway Village Residents Council, said after getting word of the
decision Wednesday.
   ``I just hope this helps to end all that demolishing business.
This is my home, and although a lot of the project is boarded-up
now, it could some day be home to a lot of the homeless who have no
shelter,'' she said.
   However, a Texas Historical Commission official said the
designation doesn't mean the project won't be demolished.
   The National Register's Austin office was notified Wednesday by
the National Parks Service, which makes the final determination,
that the project had been put on the register, said Marlene
Casarez, the office's administrator.
   The project was nominated for the designation by Stephen Fox of
the Anchorage Foundation of Texas, which backs architectural
preservation and architectural history projects.
   The project is architecturally significant because ``it is a
very fine example of modern architecture design in the field of
public housing,'' Fox said. The project was built in 1942 and 1944
as housing for war-industry workers and their families.
   Allen Parkway also met the state and national registers'
standards of being a significant example of community planning and
for social and humanitarian purposes, he said.
   About 130 mainly black and Vietnamese families live in the
1,000-unit project today.
   As other residents moved out, the city's Housing Authority
sealed the empty units in anticipation of federal approval of a
plan to raze the project and sell the prime 37.5-acre tract west of
downtown for development. This could still be done, officials said.
   ``Everyone has to understand that listing in the National
Register is no protection per se,'' said Jim Steely, director of
National Register Programs for the Texas Historical Commission.
   ``But it does ensure that documentation will exist for posterity
showing that Allen Parkway was here and that it was important in
the history of Houston, of Texas and of the nation.''
   Steely said Texas preservationists will work with the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation, an independent agency set up by
the federal government, to monitor the spending of any federal
funds on Allen Parkway.

<HEAD>Husband Held in Killing of Wife Who Once Requested Leniency for
Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been charged with shooting his wife to
death two months after she asked prosecutors to treat him leniently
on charges that he had wounded her, officials said.
   Linda Joyce Hubert, 26, was found dead in her apartment Thursday
shortly after neighbors heard several shots and saw a man get into
a car and speed away.
   Kenneth Leon Hubert, 27, surrendered to police a few hours later
and was charged with murder. He was ordered held without bond.
   Homicide Sgt. Jerry Novak said Hubert surrendered after hearing
he was being sought and that Hubert insisted he is innocent.
   Hubert had been free on $5,000 bond on an attempted murder
charge in the Dec. 18 wounding of his wife, and on $2,000 bond on a
charge of kidnapping his girlfriend in November.
   Ms. Hubert asked prosecutors for leniency and said she would not
testify against her husband about the Dec. 18 shooting.
   ``She wanted us to offer the guy probation,'' assistant Harris
County District Attorney Mike Anderson said. ``We contacted her and
she said: `Oh, no, he just needs help. I don't want to prosecute
unless he'll get help instead of prison time.'''
   ``She seemed very forgiving,'' he added.
   The Huberts had been separated for about three years. A neighbor
said Hubert often drove by the apartment where Ms. Hubert lived
with her two sons, ages 2 and 9.
   ``I thought the husband was a boyfriend trying to make up with
her, because he was always coming around harassing her,'' Ola
Aubrey said. ``He would come every day and stay in that car and
blow his horn. She would just stay inside. She would never let him
in her apartment.''
   Anderson said he had two other cases this week in which women
injured by their husbands refused to testify against them.
   Rhonda Gerson, director of Aid to Victims of Domestic Violence,
a non-profit agency in Houston that offers legal information and
services, said various things influence a woman's decision not to
testify against her husband.
   ``She may feel that she's the one sending him to jail, rather
than his own behavior,'' Ms. Gerson said. ``Or she doesn't want the
father of her children in prison.
   ``Sometimes, there is a lot of fear and intimidation'' from the
husband not to testify, she added. Or, a woman may be hoping to
reconcile with the husband and doesn't want to make matters worse
by testifying against him.
   ``Or she may be afraid of what's going to happen when he comes
out (of prison),'' said Ms. Gerson, who was not involved in Ms.
Hubert's case.

<TEXT>
   A hot-air balloon billed as the world's
largest strained into the air carrying as many as 60 people at a
time Friday in a bid for the record books, even though it was
firmly tethered to the ground.
   The balloon, the Super Maine, is bigger even than the Virgin
Atlantic Flyer hot-air balloon which crossed the Atlantic last
summer.
   ``It was immense, it was incredible,'' said Gary Lovell, who
flew a regular-sized hot-air balloon alongside the Super Maine.
``It was very impressive being in the air next to something that
large and be a fellow balloon. I've had 747s go overhead before;
this would dwarf that.''
   The Super Maine, 10 to 20 percent larger in volume than the
Flyer, established its flying ability by rising 50 feet off frozen
Sebago Lake with 25 people aboard. It remained aloft, tethered to
ropes, for about five minutes while 100 or so balloon enthusiasts
watched.
   ``Everything's come together almost perfectly, ... we're very
happy,'' project coordinator and chief pilot Tom Handcock said
after the flight, which he hoped would earn an entry in the
Guinness Book of Records.
   ``You can only do so much with good planning and a lot of it is
up to Mother Nature, and Mother Nature cooperated,'' he added.
   After the initial flight, organizers took the balloon up several
more times, adding more and more people to its 8-by-12-foot
gondola. At one point, 60 people were in the basket, with one man
hanging onto the side while the balloon lifted off the ground a few
feet, said one organizer, Ruth Ludwig.
   The Virgin Atlantic Flyer carried crew members Richard Branson
and Per Linstrand 2,789.6 miles from Carrabassett Valley, Maine, to
a brief touchdown in Ireland last July.
   The designers, builders and supporters of the 210-foot-high,
168-foot-wide Super Maine simply wanted to construct a balloon that
was larger in volume than the Flyer. The Super Maine was built to
hold 2.6 million cubic feet of hot air, between 300,000 and 500,000
cubic feet more than the 195-foot-high Flyer, Handcock said.
   Lovell said he could fit 40 regular-sized balloons, which are
the size of two or three tractor-trailer trucks, inside the Super
Maine.
   The balloonists could not release the ropes holding the craft to
the ground because organizers did not complete Federal Aviation
Administration paperwork in time to launch a free flight.
   No one seemed to mind.
   ``The thing went great. We wish we could have flown it away, but
our good old government wasn't into that,'' said Brian Boland, a
Burlington, Conn., resident who has designed and flown hot-air
balloons for 17 years.
   ``The champagne corks are poppin' left and right,'' Boland said
in a post-flight telephone interview from a nearby bar. ``It's an
incredible thing. Everybody's just glowing.''
   The balloon and gondola, which cost a total of $7,000, were
built with the help of volunteers, mainly commercial balloon pilots
from New England, Kentucky, Maryland and Canada. They assembled the
balloon in four days last month in a Massachusetts warehouse and
trucked it to Maine.
   Handcock said he probably will not attempt to assemble the
balloon again for another launch, citing the time and work
involved, but offered to permit other pilots with the skill and
knowledge required to give it a try.
   ``We (did) it mostly for our personal pleasure _ just to say we
flew the largest balloon in the world,'' he said. ``I know that
doesn't make sense. But it's a long winter up here.''

   President Reagan named former Cabinet
secretaries Caspar Weinberger and Drew Lewis on Friday to a
commission charged with seeking ways to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
   Completing the makeup of the bipartisan panel, Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole and House Republican Leader Robert Michel also
appointed members. Democrats announced their members late last year.
   Dole chose Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, and Dean Kleckner, president of the
American Farm Bureau Federation.
   Michel selected Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., a member of the
House Ways and Means Committee, and Donald Rumsfeld, a former
defense secretary and congressmen who also served as director of
the Office of Economic Oportunity and as White House chief of staff
under President Ford.
   The panel, known as the National Economic Commission, is
supposed to issue a report on March 1, 1989, after Reagan has left
office.
   Lewis, now the head of Union Pacific Corp., was Reagan's first
secretary of transportation. Weinberger was Reagan's secretary of
defense for seven years.
   In a statement announcing the appointments, the president said,
``I believe when all aspects of the budget are reviewed the primary
policy problem will be viewed not as a lack of revenues, but an
inexorable growth in spending.
   ``Over the last seven years, revenues have increased by $250
billion but spending has increased by $325 billion,'' he said.
   ``And while defense has necessarily grown, it accounted for only
$125 billion, or less than 40 percent of the increase.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan defended his tax and budget
policies Friday in an election-year economic report to Congress,
saying his administration had turned economic despair into hope.
   Reagan's seventh annual economic report brushed off accusations
by Democratic presidential candidates that a $2.4 trillion national
debt and record trade imbalances during the Reagan years had
hobbled the country and eventually would reduce Americans' standard
of living.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said the
new economic report was aimed at debunking ``myths'' that the
country had become a second-rate economic power.
   He said that in reality the United States had out-performed the
rest of the world, producing 2{ times the number of jobs as the
other top six industrialized countries combined since the end of
the 1981-82 recession.
   The president, in an eight-page introduction to this year's
report, said the country is in a lot better shape than when he took
office seven years ago.
   ``It is hard to believe that at the beginning of the 1980s, the
prevailing attitude toward the economy could best be described as
despair,'' the president said. ``Inflation and interest rates had
ratcheted higher with each successive business cycle and ... the
goal of sustainable growth appeared increasingly elusive.''
   In a theme sure to be sounded by the eventual Republican
presidential nominee, the report asserted, ``The past five years of
sustained and vigorous growth in production, income and employment
did not occur by accident. They were shaped by government policies
explicitly directed toward fostering the inherent dynamism of the
private sector.''
   The report sought to downplay any problems associated with the
doubling of the national debt under Reagan and the string of
foreign trade deficits that has transformed the United States from
the largest creditor country to the largest debtor nation.
   The country's debt to the rest of the world stands at around
$400 billion, the amount of foreign holdings in the United States
that exceed American investments in other countries.
   Sprinkel, in a briefing for reporters, said that the net
payments to foreigners needed to service the country's foreign debt
represented just 0.1 percent of the $4.6 trillion U.S. economy.
   ``Disaster does not loom in our future. This current level of
(international) indebtedness is not worrisome,'' he said. ``The
argument that we can't grow and make economic progress because we
are debt-ridden is wrong.''
   Sprinkel said that the recent string of three consecutive
declines in the Index of Leading Indicators was signaling slower
growth in the first half of 1988 but not a recession this year.
   He also discounted recent big declines in housing construction
in December and January, a key economic sector that is often the
first to turn down at the start of a new recession.
   Sprinkel blamed the housing declines on a too-restrictive
monetary policy being pursued by the Federal Reserve in the months
before the record collapse of stock prices that occured last Oct.
19.
   Sprinkel said by late spring construction should start rising
again in response to recent declines in mortgage rates, which have
now dipped back to single-digit levels, falling to 9.84 percent
last week.
   A draft version of the president's economic report was critical
of the Federal Reserve for tightening credit conditions in
December, after initially pumping money into the economy
immediately following the stock market crash.
   However, the final version of the report said that more recent
actions of the Fed this year indicate the central bank is again
promoting lower interest rates as a way of stimulating economic
growth.
   Sprinkel said he was now satisfied with the Fed's performance,
calling their action in the past six weeks ``quite appropriate.''
   The economic report claimed that significant progress has been
made in reducing both the budget and trade deficits and predicted
further gains on both fronts.
   Sprinkel predicted that an improving trade deficit would provide
about half of the country's overall economic growth this year,
which the administration is forecasting will slow to a 2.4 percent,
as measured by the gross national product. That is down from 3.8
percent in 1987.
   The president repeated his warnings that Congress should not try
to reduce the trade deficit by passing either of the omnibus trade
bills now being considered by a House-Senate conference committee.
   Reagan said unless the measures were substantially modified he
would veto the legislation because of objectionable protectionist
provisions.
   The president also repeated his pledge, made in his State of the
Union address, to veto another 11th-hour, catchall spending bill
such as the one passed by Congress last December.
   In a chapter on airline deregulation, the report maintained that
consumers are reaping a $15 billion annual windfall in lower fares.
It said that while a 28 percent increase in the number of flights
had raised concerns about safety, accidents had declined steadily
since 1978.

   The Ohio Supreme Court unveiled a
continuing legal education program Thursday that would require some
35,000 attorneys in the state to head back to school to keep their
licenses.
   Chief Justice Thomas Moyer said the new rule, adopted
unanimously by the high court, requires every attorney to complete
24 hours of legal education every two years beginning in 1990.
   Lawyers who fail to comply could be faced with fines of up to
$500 and even suspension from practice.
   Ohio is the 30th state to adopt such a program, which Moyer said
would maintain and improve the quality of legal services.
   ``Let me say that this is not a panacea,'' Moyer said at a news
conference. ``... But what it means is that we are making a minimum
effort to assure people who use the services of lawyers that the
lawyer they employ has been required to stay current.''
   The rule was developed in cooperation with several state
attorney groups. Representatives of four of them who joined Moyer
at the briefing welcomed the court's action.
   Joseph Cook of Akron, president of the Ohio State Bar
Association, said the requirement would not be a burden to most
attorneys: ``Most laywers have already been getting more
(continuing education) than the rule requires.''
   He said attorneys probably could meet their yearly requirements
by attending seminars sponsored by the state bar at its annual
meeting.
   The rule establishes, effective July 1, a Supreme Court
Commission on Continuing Legal Education that will administer and
accredit the programs.
   The program will be financed by a $15 filing fee.

   Two convicted killers testified Friday as
character witnesses for a fellow convict trying to avoid the death
penalty, telling the jury that the man lent them money and aided
them with other acts of kindness.
   James Ernest Hitchcock, 31, was convicted and sentenced to death
for the 1976 rape-murder of his 13-year-old stepniece, Cynthia
Driggers. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a new sentencing hearing
last April.
   Inmates Darrell Edwin Hoy and Arthur Rutherford, wearing solid
blue prison uniforms, were brought into the courtroom in chains and
handcuffs that were removed before the jury was seated.
   The short, stocky Rutherford, 38, awaiting death in the electric
chair for a 1986 murder in Santa Rosa County, said Hitchcock helped
him upon Rutherford's arrival on death row by lending him money to
buy tobacco and other items.
   Hoy, soft-voiced and polite, said he and Hitchcock had
side-by-side cells on death row for three years in the early 1980s
and that Hitchcock had given him his radio after Hoy's was stolen,
that he had lent him money and had helped him study to get a
general education degree.
   On the death penalty, Hoy said, ``I feel that's wrong for
certain reasons, if I may say so.''
   Hoy was convicted in Pinellas County of raping a teen-ager in
front of her fiance and then shooting and killing them both. His
sentence was overturned, and he was removed from death row in 1984.
   Asked by Prosecutor Belvin Perry for his views on the death
penalty, Rutherford sat up straight, crossed his arms, raised his
voice and replied, ``I'm in Florida State Prison on hearsay _ no
evidence, no nothin' ... I'm against it.''
   Extraordinary security measures were in place at the Orange
County Courthouse, where a shootout several years ago left one
bailiff dead and three people wounded, including the gunman.
   Among the 50 courtroom spectators were 10 armed deputies in
civilian clothes. Another dozen uniformed and armed guards
accompanied the prisoners or were posted at the front and sides of
the courtroom.
   Defense lawyers had argued for the appearance of the present and
former death row prisoners because Hitchcock had spent a third of
his life on death row.
   Circuit Judge Gary Formet told attorneys he would not permit
them to disclose the nature of the prisoners' crimes.
   Hitchcock spent more than a decade in a cell just a few feet
from Florida's electric chair before his sentence was overturned.
   The 12 jurors are getting a shortened version of trial testimony
and then hearing more than 20 witnesses testify for and against
Hitchcock in his effort to escape the chair. The jury's
recommendation _ life or death _ is only advisory to the judge.
   One of Hitchcock's two public defenders, Robert Wesley, told the
jury in his opening remarks that the defendant's brother, Richard _
the victim's stepfather _ beat and strangled the girl after he
found Hitchcock and the girl having sex.
   Wesley said his client ``is not saying he is innocent. ... He
participated in the crime. But he asks to live his life in prison.''
   Richard Hitchcock took the witness stand earlier and denied that
he killed his stepdaughter.
   The jury also heard a tape-recorded confession by James
Hitchcock in which he admitted raping and killing the girl. He
later recanted the confession, claiming it was given under duress
because he was held for four days in solitary confinement.

<HEAD>First American Film Festival Opens To Traditional Clamor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stars and searchlights added a touch of Hollywood
to Friday's opening of the first-ever American film festival here,
but a clutter of ticket-seekers and security men lent the event a
distinctive Soviet air.
   More than 30 major American films are to be shown in seven
Moscow and Leningrad theaters through March 2, ranging from the
1939 classic fantasy ``The Wizard of Oz'' to last year's sensitive
portrayal of a deaf woman learning survival in ``Children of a
Lesser God.''
   Actor Richard Gere, puppeteer Jim Hensen, actress Daryl Hannah
and a cast of other Hollywood figures added to the glitter
attracting mobs of Muscovites to the floodlit Rossiya Theater.
   ``I love all American films. They're great,'' said 37-year-old
Ina Pozdnyakova, as she stood outside the theater pleading each
passerby for the chance to buy a spare ticket. She didn't even know
what film was to be shown.
   Asked whether the ticket distribution system is fair, she
snapped back: ``Absolutely not.''
   The festival was announced in this week's edition of Leisure
Time in Moscow, but the times and theaters where specific films
were to be shown have not been made public.
   Guides listing the films, participating theaters, guests and
workshops were released only hours before the opening and only for
organizers and foreign visitors.
   Other films to be shown during the festival include ``A Chorus
Line,'' ``An Officer and a Gentleman,'' ``Singin' in the Rain'' and
``King's Row,'' a 1942 film regarded as Ronald Reagan's best.
   Nearly every Western cultural offering in Moscow draws overflow
crowds, though the festivals and concerts are given little, if any,
publicity in the state-run press.
   The well-developed gossip grapevine and an entrenched system of
favor-trading ensure that connections far outweigh currency in
securing entrance to a popular event.
   Festival spokesman Peter Fleischer said fair distribution of
tickets for the films, selected by the private American groups and
entertainers who organized the festival, had been agreed to by the
Soviets.
   Fleischer said he was led to believe about 50 percent of the
tickets went to the general public, but said the Americans had no
control over ticket sales.
   ``Of course we can't satisfy all those who want tickets,'' said
Alexander I. Kamshalov, head of the Soviet State Committee on
Cinematography, serving as host for the festival.
   In the minus 5-degree chill outside the Rossiya, Alyona
Narishkina shivered and stamped her feet.
   ``Sure you can get tickets through your work enterprise, if they
happen to get any and you manage to find out in time,'' Ms.
Narishkina, a lawyer who waited for more than an hour Friday night
for tickets to ``Roxanne.''
   Circling among the ticket-seekers were a handful of young men
who had bought up some of the $2.60 tickets from those with extras.
   They conducted a brisk business reselling them for about three
times the price to the film buffs. The scalpers moved about warily,
avoiding the gaze of plainclothes policemen always stationed where
crowds assemble.
   A sign outside the Rossiya gave no indication when tickets for
other films would be on sale, but assured would-be buyers that 45
percent of the seats are sold in public kiosks. Half are
distributed to unspecified enterprises and 5 percent are reserved
for decorated heroes, war veterans and invalids, the sign explained.
   Those with tickets for the opening night film were more
supportive of the current system.
   ``You can always find out what is playing if you want to,''
explained Slava Belyankin, an 18-year-old student. ``You just have
to be patient.''

   A beer bottle packed with gunpowder
exploded Friday and injured five Madrid University students, one
seriously, police said.
   Police said the bottle exploded in a first-floor bathroom of the
university's chemistry department during non-class hours at midday,
apparently while the group took part in a prank.
   Joaquin Francisco Pereda Gomez, 22, underwent surgery for
serious injuries to his hand at Clinico Hospital in Madrid. A
hospital spokeswoman quoted doctors as saying he later may have to
have his hand amputated.
   The others were treated for minor eye and ear injuries and
released, the spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Commentator Says U.S. Backtracking on `Star Wars'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet Arms, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet news commentator on Friday accused U.S.
arms negotiators in Geneva of trying to make a ``massive
departure'' from an understanding on space defenses reached during
the superpower summit.
   Vladimir Bogachev blamed the United States for what he called a
worsening atmosphere at the Geneva talks. The commentary was
distributed by the official Tass news agency two days before the
arrival of Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Among other issues, Shultz is to discuss with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top officials efforts to cut the
superpowers' long-range missiles by 50 percent.
   The Soviet Union argues that an understanding on President
Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program for a space-based missile defense
must be a part of the agreement.
   They say Reagan and Gorbachev reached a basis for agreement on
strategic weapons and space defenses during their December summit
meeting in Washington.
   ``In recent weeks the situation at the talks has noticeably
worsened,'' Bogachev said. ``The U.S. side is trying to effect a
massive departure from the accords which are explicitly spelled out
in the joint statement at the summit level.''
   The Soviet Union claims the ``Star Wars'' program is a violation
of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   The U.S. delegation in Geneva is acting as though Reagan and
Gorbachev did not make any connection between strategic weapons and
space defenses in their talks in December, Bogachev said.
   ``The militarization of outer space according to the `Star Wars'
plans will lead to a sharp destabilization of the
military-political situation in the world,'' he said.
``Militarization of outer space and a cut in strategic offensive
weapons on Earth are incompatible.''
   He said the United States also was seeking to arm long-range
sea-based missiles with conventional warheads, even though the
non-nuclear warheads can be replaced quickly with nuclear charges.

<HEAD>Brazil Rules Out Foreign Investigators From Case of Missing
Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal police said Friday they
won't allow foreign investigators to join the search for $8 million
stolen from a commercial flight that originated in New York.
   Geovani Azevedo, federal police spokesman in Rio de Janeiro,
told The Associated Press, ``If we discover foreign investigators
working on this case, we will expell them. This includes FBI
agents.''
   On Thursday it was revealed that two canvas sacks containing $4
million each in U.S. currency were separated from a shipment of 13
such bags. The bags were being flown from New York to Buenos Aires,
Aregentina and contained a total of $52 million.
   Central Bank officials said the money was being sent by the
United States to help Argentina pay foreign bonds but that it was
insured and the loss wouldn't hurt Argentina.
   The bags were loaded as personal baggage on a Varig flight out
of Kennedy International Airport on Feb. 5 and arrived at Rio's
international airport, where they were to be transferred to another
Varig flight to Buenos Aires.
   Varig is Brazil's national carrier, but Brink's, the U.S.-based
security company, was imn charge of the shipment.
   Varig said a passenger known only as Mr. Denisco paid standard
overweight charges for the bags and that Brink's was in charge of
transfering them from one plane to another in the airplane parking
area at Rio's international airport.
   ``The baggage never entered the terminal. Brink's was entirely
responsible for the operation,'' a Varig communique said.
   Brazil's federal police chief, Romeu Tuma, said Thursday night,
``There obviously was a security failure.'' He said he also wanted
to know ``why we only heard about this disappearance two weeks
later.''
   The money came from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
The other $44 million arrived safely in Buenos Aires.

<TEXT>
   A 21-year-old sailor whose cargo
boat overturned in the Caribbean Sea survived eight days floating
on a raft with shipmates who suffered a ``psychosis'' and bit him,
authorities said.
   The sailor's eight shipmates died.
   Authorities said an unidentified West German vessel brought the
sailor, Jorge Eliezer Torres Mejias, to Puerto Rico Wednesday after
rescuing him earlier this week.
   Torres Mejias was released Thursday from Puerto Rico's Medical
Center and was turned over to Teresa Berardinelli, Colombia's
consular officer in Puerto Rico.
   Torres Mejias was not available for an interview, despite
several attempts to reach him at the Colombian diplomatic office in
San Juan.
   Details of what happened tothe sailor are sketchy. The U.S.
Coast Guard office in San Juan could only confirm that Torres
Mejias had been brought to Puerto Rico and had received medical
attention.
   Dr. Carlos Gomez Marcial, medical director at the Puerto Rico
Medical Center, said Torres Mejias told him that he and the eight
others left Barranquilla, Colombia, for another coastal town
carrying a load of food on a cargo vessel, the Marlon David. The
craft overturned about 10 miles offshore and the nine boarded a
raft.
   Gomez Marcial said ``apparently his eight friends suffered a
general psychosis and they started to bite him.'' He quoted the
young man as saying some threw themselves into the ocean and
drowned. Others died aboard the raft and he had to push the bodies
overboard.
   The German ship spotted him at sea and rescued him.
   Torres Mejias suffered bite wounds on his arm and right hand,
according to the doctor. He also suffered from dehydration and
severe sunburn.

   Pope John Paul II on Friday blamed the
rivalry between East and West for social and economic ills in the
Third World and delivered a sweeping indictment of totalitarianism,
materialism and the ``all-consuming desire for profit.''
   In his seventh encyclical, the pope accused both the U.S.- and
Soviet-led blocs of imposing ``imperialism'' and ``structures of
sin'' on developing nations, reducing them to ``cogs on a gigantic
wheel.''
   He also said the rivalry between the East and West was main
reason for the widening gap between rich and poor countries.
   ``An unacceptably exaggerated concern for security ... deadens
the impulse toward united cooperation by all,'' he said.
   This obsession, he said, works to ``the detriment especially of
peaceful peoples who are impeded from their rightful access to the
goods meant for all.''
   The encyclical called for reform of the international financial
system and said the church could do its part by selling its
``superfluous'' goods to help the poor.
   The 102-page document also called for democratic political
change in nations with corrupt, dictatorial or authoritarian
governments.
   The pope said the church took a critical view of both liberal
capitalism and Marxist collectivism, saying both systems are
imperfect and in need of urgent ``radical correction.''
   The encyclical, titled in Latin ``Sollicitudo Rei Socialis,'' or
the social concern of the church, included some of the strongest
statements on social and economic issues made by John Paul during
his 9{ years as pope.
   An encyclical is a formal pastoral letter written by the pope
for the entire church. While encyclicals are not infallible
pronouncements, Catholics are expected to heed the message.
   The pope said his letter was addressed to all followers of the
world's great religions.
   The letter painted a bleak picture of the process of development
since the publication of Pope Paul VI's encyclical ``Development of
Peoples'' in 1967.
   Twenty years later, hopes for development ``appear very far from
being realized,'' and for many poor people ``the situation has
noticeably worsened,'' John Paul said.
   A Vatican official familiar with the drafting of the encyclical
said it reflected the pope's Polish background and addressed issues
facing people living in the Soviet bloc that were not raised in
Paul VI's document.
   Breaking new ground, John Paul singled out East-West rivalry as
the cause of many of the world's problems.
   ``The conflicts ... between East and West (are) an important
cause of the retardation or stagnation of the South,'' he wrote.
``The developing countries, instead of becoming autonomous nations
concerned with their own progress ... become parts of a machine,
cogs on a gigantic wheel.''
   ``The present division of the world,'' the document added, ``is
a direct obstacle to the real transformation of the conditions of
underdevelopment in the developing and less advanced countries.''
   ``World peace is inconceivable unless the world's leaders come
to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment
of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of economic,
military or political imperialism, and the transformation of mutual
distrust into collaboration.''
   In an apparent reference to conditions in his native Poland, the
pope complained of the suppression of economic initiative, which
leads people to emigrate, and the denial of political and economic
sovereignty in some countries.
   Condemning totalitarianism, he said, ``No social group, for
example a political party, has the right to usurp the role of sole
leader.''
   The pope said the church itself should avoid accumulating
``superfluous church oranments and costly furnishings for divine
worship.''
   ``On the contrary it could be obligatory to sell these goods in
order to provide food, drink, clothing and shelter for those who
lack these things,'' he said.
   Cadinal Roger Etchegary said the statement was mainly symbolic,
recalling the time John Paul gave away his pastoral ring during a
trip to Brazil. Etchegary, president of the Vatican's Justice and
Peace Commission, spoke at a news conference.
   The pope lamented the overemphasis on economic development,
writing, ``Development which is merely economic ... will end by
enslaving (mankind) further.''
   The document denounced the phenomenon of ``superdevelopment,''
or the excessive availability of material goods in some areas that
makes people ``slaves of possession.''
   It also condemned ``all-consuming desire for profit'' and
``thirst for power'' that afflicts both individuals and nations.
   ``If certain forms of modern imperialism were considered ... we
would see that hidden behind certain decisions, apparently inspired
only by economics or politics, are real forms of idolatry: of
money, ideology, class, technology.''

   Congress' chief budget writers said Friday
that President Reagan's conciliatory spending plan for fiscal 1989
should make for the least contentious and most bipartisan session
since he took office.
   ``As he goes out the door, his last budget does what he railed
against for seven years,'' House Budget Committee Chairman William
H. Gray III, D-Pa., said, citing the restraints on defense spending
and increases in many domestic programs in the $1.1 trillion plan.
   Reagan actually will prepare one more budget just before leaving
office, although the next president will take over and put his
stamp on it.
   Gray said in an interview that this Reagan budget was so much
less hostile than his past efforts, some lawmakers were unsettled.
   ``People are so used to a set pattern ... battle lines drawn and
grenades thrown,'' he said. They look at Reagan's new plan and say,
``Something is wrong here. ... What's going on?''
   At a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee, lawmakers
questioned White House budget director James C. Miller III about
the optimism behind Reagan's projection of a $129.5 billion deficit
in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   ``All the hot-wired calculators in the country won't hide the
fact that the deficits are still high, and the national debt is a
monster,'' said committee chairman Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.
   Miller assured lawmakers that the administration would work with
Congress this year. If official estimates due in August show the
deficit is above the $146 billion threshold for automatic spending
cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law, the White House will cooperate in
solving the problem, Miller said.
   Chiles and others complimented the administration on the budget
priorities, although making clear some changes will be made.
   ``After eight years, it looks like you've finally seen the light
on education, drug enforcement, health and the environment,''
Chiles said, noting increases in those areas.
   ``We're about ready to welcome you to the ranks of the faithful,
even though you have a few more things to learn _ like how to
restore the two-thirds you cut from programs to help the
homeless,'' he said.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Republican on the panel,
said the president's plan ``set a formula for Congress to act
quickly on the budget and appropriations.''
   ``If ever there was a year we could complete our work on time,
it's this year,'' he said.
   The primary reason the president's budget is closer to Congress'
priorities is because of the deficit reduction pact Reagan struck
with congressional leaders last fall. The agreement set overall
figures for Pentagon, domestic and foreign aid spending in fiscal
years 1988 and 1989.
   ``What we're doing now is the second stage'' of the agreement,
Gray said. ``The whole debate now is going to be over the small
details of the domestic part'' of the budget, he said.
   Gray said he would expect Congress to add money back to the
urban programs Reagan wanted to cut, such as mass transit and
housing.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, the chairman of the House narcotics
committee, said Friday he was ``obliged to acknowledge that
President Reagan ... appears to be moving off the fence with
respect to this country's drug crisis'' by asking for a 13 percent
increase in those efforts.
   But the New York Democrat criticized the package for not
including money to help state and local governments with their drug
eradication efforts.

<TEXT>
   Spanish Communists opened their 12th
congress Friday amid uncertainty over who would lead the party out
of its worst crisis since it returned to legal political activity
11 years ago.
   Secretary General Gerardo Iglesias, a 43-year-old miner, has
made it clear he will step down this year as head of the party that
is fighting for its political life.
   Fierce internal squabbling and poor electoral showings have
caused a sharp decline in voter support and membership, party
spokesman and political analysts say.
   The Communist-oriented United Left coalition holds only seven of
the 350 seats in the Spanish parliament, down from the 20 seats the
Communists held nlone after general elections in 1979.
   The party suffered another defeat with the announcement by Julio
Anguita, leader of Communists in southern Andalucia, that he had
made ``an irrevocable decision'' not to accept Iglesia's job if
nominated.
   Both Iglesias and 92-year-old honorary party president Dolores
Ibarruri, the legendary ``La Pasionaria'' who became a symbol of
Loyalist resistance to Franco forces during the civil war in the
1930s, called on the 619 party delegates to work for greater unity
among Communists to face the current crisis.
   ``This congress should and can put an end to any hint of
confusion, confirming the political unity and internal democracy of
the Spanish Communist Party,'' Iglesias said in his opening speech
Friday.
   He $dded that the party had managed to overcome ``the most
difficult problems, including the real threat of disappearing
altogether.''
   Acco,ding to political scientist Ramon Garcia Cotarelo, the lack
of a clear-cut choice of a leader to replace Iglesias was a sign
that the party's top echelons had no confidence in the party's
future.
   He said it would not be clear who the new party chief would be
until Sunday when party delegates choose the new 90-member Central
Committee, and it elects a new secretary general.
   Data made public Friday showed that from its peak in 1979
through its sharp decline to 1983, the party lost 65 percent of its
membership or 120,000 people. As the crisis deepened after 1985,
membership has further declined from 67,400 to 62,300.
   In its heyday, the party was at the forefront of the
Eurocommunism movement, which advocated independence from the
Soviet Union and democratic elections.
   The current imbroglio stems from Iglesia's replacement of
historic Spanish Communist leader Santiago Carrillo at the 11th
Congress in December 1983, after Carrillo resigned following the
party's electoral debacle in 1982 general elections.
   Carrillo, 73, headed the party from 1960 to 1982 and was a main
proponent of Eurocommunism. He led the Spanish party in its
clandestine years from exile in Paris and after it was legalized in
1977, two years after the death of Gen. Francisco Franco ended the
36-year military dictatorship.
   The party reached its zenith in 1979 when it got 10 percent of
the vote. But in the 1982 general elections the Socialist party
headed by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez swept into power with a
landslide victory, while the Communists got only 3.8 percent of the
ballots.
   The debacle led to Carrillo's resignation and the ascendance of
Iglesias, his young protege.
   But when Iglesias attempted to move the party away from its base
among the working class to weave together emerging non-Communist
social movements such as pacifists and ecologists, the two leaders
clashed.
   In 1985, the party ousted Carrillo and many of his followers.
   Attempts in the last two years to overcome their differences and
to bring Carillo and his supporters back into the fold have failed,
costing the party prestige and votes, Garcia Cotarelo said.

<HEAD>Report Says Postal Service Saves Money By Using Cluster Boxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delivering mail to cluster boxes instead of to
the door or a curbside mailbox saves the Postal Service more than
$11 million annually, the General Accounting Office reported Friday.
   Cluster boxes are centralized mailbox groupings used in many
apartment and townhouse developments, and some new residential
areas. They allow letter carriers to deliver mail for several homes
at one spot, saving time on their rounds.
   The GAO, which does investigations for Congress, studied the use
of the boxes at the request of Reps. William D. Ford, D-Mich.,
Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Robert Garcia, D-N.Y.
   The report covered fiscal 1985, when about 1.9 million of the 53
million daily city mail deliveries involved cluster boxes.
   According to the study, in areas of detached homes, delivering
mail to a cluster box instead of to a curbside mailbox saved about
$10 per customer, for a saving of $4.5 million.
   In townhouse sections, the Postal Service saved about $11 per
customer by delivering to clusterboxes instead of to mailboxes
located by the door of the home. That netted a saving of $6.9
million, the report said.
   For low-rise apartment buildings, the cost of delivering to a
cluster box was about the same as bringing mail to a group of boxes
in the lobby.

<HEAD>Spy's Parents Claim Navy Considered Prominent Jews as Suspects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of convicted spy Jonathan J.
Pollard said Friday that Navy investigators showed him a list of
names of 25 American Jews and asked him to identify those who
helped him commit espionage for Israel.
   ``They kept badgering him to indicate which of those on the list
was involved in the spy plot,'' said Morris Pollard, a professor of
microbiology at the University of Notre Dame.
   Both the senior Pollard and his son denied that Jonathan Pollard
had an accomplice in spying for Israel. Their statement came after
The Washington Post reported Friday that government investigators
had concluded that someone in the CIA or Defense Department also
had spied for Israel.
   Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there are differing views within the department on the
question of whether there is another spy. While there appear to be
some solid indications that there was another operative, some
officials have doubts about whether that is the case, said the
sources.
   Neither the Navy nor the Justice Department or its Bureau of
Prisons had any immediate comment on the Pollards' charges.
   ``We can neither confirm nor deny this,'' said Lt. Janet Mescus,
a spokesman for the Navy. ``At this point, we have no comment.''
   Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland also declined
comment.
   The Post story, by reporters Bob Woodward and Walter Pincus,
quoted unidentified sources as saying government investigators have
dubbed the alleged second spy ``Mr. X.''
   But Jonathan Pollard, a former civilian intelligence analyst for
the Navy who was sentenced in March to life in prison, said he knew
of no ``Mr. X.'' He admitted selling American defense secrets to
Israel over a period of 15 months until his arrest in November 1985
outside the Israeli embassy in Washington.
   His wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, was sentenced to five years in
prison for helping him.
   ``I gave no information suggesting the existence of a Mr. X in
government,'' Pollard said in a statement he telephoned from prison
to his mother, who conveyed it to The Associated Press. Under a
plea-bargaining agreement, Pollard is not allowed direct contact
with the news media.
   ``This was confirmed by nine months of polygraphing. Having said
that, I obviously have no knowledge of whether any other person or
persons was helping Israel,'' the statement said.
   Pollards' parents said their son had been held in a psychiatric
ward at the federal prison in Springfield, Mo., for 10 months as
Navy investigators tried to force him to implicate others.
   Pollard's parents said the authorities hoped to ``break'' their
son by surrounding him with mental patients. His attorney, Richard
Hibey, said, however, he believed the idea was to keep him in
protected surroundings to prevent him rom revealing national
security secrets.
   George Diffenbaucher, head of the penitentiary's social services
department, said Pollard was assigned to the Diagnostic and
Observation Unit, a psychological evaluation and treatment unit. He
said Pollard was not ``a mental patient'' but ``there are other
considerations for keeping him there.''
   Hibey said the prosecutors had told him they were satisfied that
Pollard had told them all he knew about the affair during nine
months of polygraph exams and debriefings.
   No evidence has been developed yet that points to the specific
identity of a second person, the Post said, citing unidentified
sources for its information.
   Pollard's mother, Molly Pollard, said that when a list of 25
names was shown to him and he was told they were prominent members
of the American Jewish community, he recognized only one name. She
did not know what that name was.
   In the prison mental ward, Pollard is ``surrounded by demented,
screaming people'' in a cell that measures six by nine feet, his
father charged. ``They hoped to break him,'' he said.
Diffenbaucher, asked if that charge was true, said, ``Of course
not. Break him of what?''
   The prison authorities ``told us they were upset with his being
in a mental ward. They said it was like KGB tactics,'' said the
father. ``But they also said they could not do anything about it
because they had orders from the Navy to keep him there.''
   Morris Pollard wrote to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., asking him to
intercede on his son's behalf.
   An aide in Hamilton's office, who asked not to be identified,
said the congressman promised he would try to help. ``He felt
Pollard should not be discriminated against compared with other
prisoners,'' the aide said.
   In his statement, Pollard said the Post based its report on
claims by Justice Department officials ``who could not prove the
existence of such a person on the basis of fact. So now, they are
simply inventing him or her out of thin air and hoping to give
their spectral image an air of substance.''
   The Post said the belief that a Mr. X must exist grew out of a
massive debriefing and polygraphing of Pollard over many months.
   Pollard told authorities that his Israeli handlers often
specified by date and control number the highly sensitive U.S.
documents they wanted him to acquire, the newspaper said.
   The handlers once showed Pollard a top-secret U.S. document to
which he did not have access, the Post said. It identified the
document as an index or catalog that Pollard then could use to
obtain other documents from U.S. intelligence agencies.
   Investigators concluded that another American _ ``Mr. X'' _ had
provided that index and other specific information on U.S. secrets
that Pollard learned from his Israeli handlers, the newspaper said.

   Madame Chiang Kai-shek made a brief visit
Friday to the mausoleum of President Chiang Ching-kuo, her stepson
who died last month at the age of 77, the official news agency
reported.
   The 86-year-old Madame Chiang, accompanied by unidentified
family members, prayed in silence before Chiang's bronze coffin at
the Tahsi Mausoleum in a small rural town 30 miles southwest of
Taipei, the Central News Agency reported.
   The news agency said Madame Chiang made her first visit to the
mausoleum shortly after she visited the mausoleum of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek, the late president's father who died in 1975.
   The two mausoleums are a little more than a mile apart.
   Madame Chiang did not attend her stepson's funeral on Jan. 30,
three days after newspapers linked her to an unsuccessful
last-ditch effort to delay newly installed President Lee Teng-hui
from being appointed head of the ruling Nationalist Party.
   Chiang Ching-kuo had tapped Lee as his successor.
   Madame Chiang, who is chairman of the ruling party's Central
Advisory Committee, also did not appear at earlier memorial
services for Chiang Ching-kuo.
   She left Taiwan for a mansion on Long Island in New York soon
after her husband's death, reportedly because of difference in
opinion with her stepson. She returned in 1986 to attend ceremonies
marking the late generalissimo's 100th birthday.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``most
likely'' will visit Syria when he goes to the Middle East next week
and is leaving his options open for a return to the region after a
NATO summit meeting in early March, U.S. officials said Friday.
   As Shultz set out for Moscow on a trip in which he will seek
Soviet backing for his peace-making venture, his Mideast journey
was taking on dramatic new proportions.
   Shultz's purpose in going to Damascus would be to discuss the
U.S. drive for Arab-Israeli negotiations with President Hafez
Assad, whose support for any long-term settlement in the Middle
East is considered essential by specialists in the State
Department's Near East bureau.
   Reinforcing the impression that U.S.-Syrian relations are
warming was a disclosure Friday by State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley that one of several sanctions the United States has
imposed against Syria has been ended.
   She said security clearance requirements on Syrian applicants
for U.S. visas have been lifted. Under the sanction, all such
applicants had been subjected to lengthy background checks to
qualify for a visa.
   A visit by Shultz to Damascus would be a major prestige boost to
Syria and mark an improvement in its relations with the United
States. The country is one of six listed by the State Department as
a supporter of terrorism, and President Reagan imposed sanctions
against it in November 1986.
   In that action, Reagan banned the sale of sophisticated
technology, such as computers, aircraft and related spare parts;
ended the financing of exports to Syria by the U.S. Export-Import
Bank; canceled the U.S.-Syrian air transport agreement; reduced the
U.S. Embassy staff in Damascus and pressured American oil companies
to halt their operations in Syria.
   The State Department had linked Syria to some 40 incidents of
terrorism. Reagan said the sanctions were intended to express
``outrage'' at what he called Syria's involvement in international
terrorism _ charges the Syrians denied.
   Among the punitive measures was a ban on high-level meetings
with Syrians. But Shultz sent Richard W. Murphy, the head of the
Near East bureau, to Damascus two weeks ago to confer with Assad.
   U.S. Ambassador William Eagleton was sent back to his post in
Damascus last September, after a year's absence, and U.N.
Ambassador Vernon A. Walters also visited the country.
   A U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said Shultz was ``most
likely'' to schedule a stop in Syria on his trip to the Middle East
beginning next Thursday.
   Another official said Shultz was ``leaving his options open'' to
return to the area for a few days in early March.
   Shultz plans to be in Brussels with Reagan for a summit meeting
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on March 2-3. But the
official said Shultz could go to the Middle East from there if
needed and then return to Washington in time to greet visiting the
Chinese foreign minister on March 7.
   Shultz's other stops next week will be Egypt, Jordan, Israel and
probably Saudi Arabia. He is trying to set up negotiations between
Israel and a mixed delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians to
deal especially with the troubled West Bank and Gaza.
   The immediate aim is some form of self-rule for the 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs who have lived under Israeli control since Egypt
and Jordan lost the territories in the 1967 Six-Day war.
   The long-range goal is to hold a second stage of talks _
possibly in the format of an international peace conference _ by
the end of the year to consider an overall settlement.
   Shultz's separate trip to the Soviet Union began Friday with a
flight to Helsinki, Finland. He will be in Moscow for talks Sunday
with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Monday with
Shevardnadze and General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Shultz is due to report to the NATO countries in Brussels on
Tuesday and return home for a brief rest before heading for the
Middle East.
   The Middle East is one topic on the Shultz's agenda for Moscow.
So is Afghanistan, where Gorbachev said he would begin a withdrawal
of the Red Army over 10 months, beginning May 15, if a settlement
is reached by March 15.
   Shultz said Thursday in a telecast to Asia that he would ask for
a timetable with ``definite proportions.'' He warned that U.S. aid
to the Afghan rebels would end only if the Soviets stopped helping
the Kabul government.
   The Afghan rebels have been at war with the Kabul government
since 1973. The Soviets sent about 120,000 troops into the country
to back the government in December 1979.
   Shultz supported the establishment of an interim government,
which Pakistan has demanded before an agreement on a Soviet troop
withdrawal is signed. That would mean a coalition government
acceptable to the guerrillas and to the Afghan refugees, about 3
million of whom are in Pakistan.
   In discussing the Middle East in a separate Voice of America
interview, Shultz indicated he was prepared to accept an active
role for the Soviets in the search for a settlement of the
Arab-Israeli dispute.
   ``Obviously, the Soviet Union is a major power, and we will have
to see how this whole process develops,'' he said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is resisting an active
role in the Middle East for the Soviets, who do not have relations
with his country and regularly support Arab positions. Shultz said
on his last trip to Jerusalem last October that he agreed with
Shamir.
   Jordan and Egypt, however, are demanding an international peace
conference with the Soviets participating.

   The Democratic and Republican parties
will be forced to give serious consideration to the candidacies of
Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson despite labels that they are
unelectable, says a former presidential candidate.
   ``People are saying that the candidates with the largest
following, Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson, have the lowest
probability of success,'' Shirley Chisholm told a Black History
Month audience Thursday night.
   ``But whether you like them or not, their parties will just have
to deal with them when the time comes because they'll both bring a
large block of delegates to the convention,'' she said.
   Robertson finished second among the Republican candidates in the
Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Jackson, a
Democrat, finished fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Ms. Chisholm, the first black woman ever to win a seat in the
House of Representatives, became known nationally for her fiery
speeches and 1972 campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   She drew a crowd of about 300 people to the University of

   Organizers of Vice President George Bush's
campaign said Friday they are confident of carrying Massachusetts
on Super Tuesday, but are running as if they're scared.
   ``I think it's important that the vice president win all of his
six home states,'' Ron Kaufman, the Bush political director for the
Northeast, told reporters in a wry reference to Bush's claim to his
Massachusetts birth and his links to other states.
   ``We feel he'll do well here,'' Kaufman said. But he said the
campaign has done no polling that would help define ``well,'' and
he refused to set a specific goal in the Republican voting on March
8.
   On that day, Republicans in 17 states _ most of them in the
South _ will vote on their presidential preferences. Fifty-two
delegates are at stake in Massachusetts.
   ``Political contests are always a challenge,'' said Andy Card,
who was Bush's campaign manager in New Hampshire, where the vice
president won the primary. ``We're going to compete as if we're

<TEXT>
   A seven-officer Marine Corps jury Friday
acquitted Marine Cpl. Lindsey Scott in his second trial on charges
he sexually assaulted and tried to kill the wife of a fellow Marine
in 1983.
   When the verdict was announced, Scott turned to the jury and
said, ``Thank you, sirs.''
   Scott's mother screamed three times, ``Thank you, Jesus.''
   Later, Scott told reporters, ``A weight that has been on my
shoulders the last five years has been lifted.''
   Maj. Ron McNeil, the Marine prosecutor, said the investigation
of the attack was closed.
   ``We'll probably never know what happened,'' he said after the
verdict. ``After almost five years after the facts, the issue is
dead.''
   It took the jury 11 hours to reach the verdict on charges of
rape, kidnapping, sodomy and attempted murder.
   Scott, 32, of Louisville, Ky., had been convicted of the same
charges in 1983 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. That verdict
was overturned July 7 by the U.S. Military court of Appeals on
grounds that Scott had not received adequate counsel from his
civilian attorney.
   Although Scott supporters have alleged racism was involved in
the earlier conviction, because he is black and the victim white,
Scott said his feelings for the Marine Corps have not changed.
   ``The Marines are the best fighting force in the world and the
best branch of the service. There were six whites and one black on
the jury. If it was racially motivated, I would have been
convicted,'' Scott said.
   During the 17 days of testimony, the defense attacked the Naval
Investigation Service's handling of the crime probe. John Leino,
one of Scott's civilian attorneys, charged that investigators used
an improper lineup and manipulated the victim into identifying
Scott.
   The defense presented witnesses who said the victim was
uncertain when she picked Scott from the lineups, and also
identified other men as resembling her attacker.
   McNeil denied the investigation service conspired against Scott.
   The victim positively identified Scott as her assailant from the
witness stand and picked Scott from both a physical lineup and
photographic lineup in 1983.
   Also at issue was the testimony of Cynthia Ausby, a security
guard at a Woodbridge department store. She testified at the first
trial that Scott was in the department store, but could not
remember the exact date.
   In the second trial, Ms. Ausby testified she was certain Scott
was in the store at the time the victim was attacked the night of
April 20, 1983.
   McNeil said Ms. Ausby's sudden certainty was not credible, but
the defense argued that Ms. Ausby's recollection was aided 10
months after the crime by her checking of store arrest records.
   Ms. Ausby said the records showed she had mistaken Scott for a
similarly dressed shoplifter she was pursuing the night of the
assault. She also was aided by pictures of Scott that were better
than one shown her before the first trial by an NIS agent.
   The victim of the attack, who now lives with her family in
Rochester, N.Y., testified that she was lured from her off-base
apartment by a telephone caller who said a Marine would be over to
give her a ride to her husband, who had been injured.
   Her husband, another member of Scott's battalion, was unhurt.
She was driven by her escort to a remote section of the northern
Virginia base, where she was sexually assaulted, stabbed and left
for dead.
   Two other Marines found her that night bloodied and dazed and
brought her to a base clinic for treatment.

<HEAD>Exports Sales of Wheat, Soybeans Rise for Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buying by the Soviets, China and Morocco
propelled export sales of U.S. wheat to more than twice the
four-week average last week, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Soybean and sorghum sales also climbed, but corn, barley and
cotton fell compared to the four-week average, the department said.
   Wheat sales climbed sharply to 1,178,100 metric tons, primarily
because of purchases of 308,500 tons by the Soviets, 299,000 by
China and 220,800 by Morocco, the department said.
   It said sales of sorghum totaled 347,100 tons, the most in the
current marketing year. The increase was attributed primarily to
purchases by Japan, Venezuela and Israel.
   Sales of 589,500 tons of soybeans were 56 percent over the
previous week's mark and 72 percent above the four-week average.
Japan was the main purchaser followed by Romania, the Netherlands
and Mexico.
   Corn sales fell to 777,400 tons, 14 percent below the previous
week and 44 percent lower than the four-week average, despite
substantial purchases by Japan and South Korea. Barley sales were
down. Tunisia purchased all of the 25,000 tons sold last week.
   The report said cotton sales totaled 55,700 bales, 13 percent
below the previous week's mark and 50 percent off from the four
week average.
   Rice sales of 23,900 tons were 56 percent above the previous
week but 46 percent below the four-week average. Trinidad, Canada
and Saudi Arabia were the main purchasers.
   Among other commodities, soybean cake and meal sales were up for
the week but still well short of the four-week average while
soybean oil sales were down. Sales of hides and skins were lower
for the week but a shade above the four-week average.

   The head of the President's AIDS Commission said
Friday he would push for more money to help the Food and Drug
Administration review growing numbers of experimental AIDS drugs.
   Research into AIDS drugs has been expanding quickly, and FDA is
reaching the point where ``they will not be able to handle the load
and do the kind of regulatory work that's needed'' to make
appropriate drugs available to people with AIDS, retired Adm. James
D. Watkins said.
   A few tens of millions of dollars would help the FDA handle the
load, said Watkins, chairman of the Presidential Commission on the
Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic.
   The FDA approves drugs for marketing and also can allow expanded
use of drugs still being tested.
   Adequate money for the FDA is very important to conquer acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, Watkins said in an interview during
commission hearings.
   Without such help, the agency might have to divert resources
from evaluating other drugs for diseases that affect millions of
people, he said.
   During the hearings, Watkins asked FDA Commissioner Frank Young
to work with the commission in detailing its needs in such areas as
personnel and scientific facilities.
   He told Young he wanted the commission to be ``your advocate''
in its report to the president.
   ``The needs are growing faster than we were able to calculate,''
Young said at the hearing. ``I never thought we'd see this many
drugs under development.''
   Approvals for experiments to try potential AIDS drugs in humans
have soared in recent years, Young said. As of Jan. 31, he said,
the FDA approved 45 such applications for drugs to boost the immune
system, 35 for chemicals to fight the AIDS virus, 31 for chemicals
to treat infections that accompany AIDS and four for drugs to fight
AIDS-related cancer.
   The FDA looks at results of such experiments when it decides
whether to approve a drug for marketing.
   While funding for AIDS research at the National Institutes of
Health has jumped from $135 million in 1986 to $468 million in
1988, the FDA's regulatory budget to handle the potential new drugs
has gone from $10 million to only $25 million, Young said. And
private companies do more AIDS research and request more human
experiments than NIH does, he said.
   Fifty-five pharmaceutical companies are developing or have
developed 77 products aimed at diagnosing, preventing or treating
AIDS, testified Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association.
   ``I don't want FDA to be the bottleneck'' in getting effective
drugs to people with AIDS, Young said.
   Earlier testimony Friday about use of unapproved AIDS drugs by
some people shows ``a frustration on their part'' about lack of
access to approved drugs, Watkins said.
   One witness, Michael Callen, a founding member of the People
with AIDS Coalition in New York, said the six-month-old PWA Health
Group in New York has sold more than 11 tons of one alternative
treatment, egg lipids.
   The lipids appear to repair damage to cell walls, he said. The
treatment seems to help in AIDS cases, although no formal
experiments have been done, and it has no side effects, he said.

<HEAD>State Won't Try Rubin `Hurricane' Carter A Third Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey prosecutors announced Friday they
won't seek a third murder trial against Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter,
ending the former boxer's 22-year campaign for freedom that became
a popular celebrity cause.
   The passage of time, problems finding witnesses, court decisions
discrediting previous testimony and the burden posed by a third
prosecution were cited in legal motions seeking dismissal of the
indictment against Carter and his alleged accomplice, John Artis.
   Acting Passaic County Prosecutor John Goceljak, in papers filed
in Paterson, also said other reasons supporting dismissal were the
intense scrutiny given the case.
   ``It has received the attention of more courts and proceedings
than probably any other case in the history of this state and
possibly any other state,'' the court papers said.
   In addition, Goceljak noted that Carter served 19 years of a
life prison term before a federal judge ordered his release and
Artis has been paroled on the murder conviction. Artis is serving a
six-year term on an unrelated drug conviction.
   A federal judge's finding that their latest conviction was
racially tainted would likely exclude testimony about the motive
for the killings, Goceljak said.
   Three whites were shot by black men on June 17, 1966, hours
after a black man was slain by a white assailant. Carter and Artis
are black.
   Carter's cause was taken up in the 1970s by celebrities such as
Bob Dylan, who wrote and sang ``The Ballad of Hurricane,'' actress
Ellen Burstyn, boxer Muhammed Ali and singer Joan Baez.
   They lionized the former middleweight contender and elevated him
as a symbol of racial injustice. But after a few highly publicized
fund-raising events, some touched by scandal, Carter's all-star
backing faded.
   Goceljak's decision to seek dismissal was made in consultation
with the state's criminal justice director, Donald R. Belsole.
   ``It's time to say enough is enough,'' Belsole said. ``I think
society is served, the system is served and the defendants are
served.''
   A judge must sign the prosecutor's motion to finalize dismissal
of the indictment, and attorney Myron Beldock, in a statement on
behalf of Carter and Artis, said he hoped for quick consideration
by the court.
   ``We are extremely pleased with the decision of the state of New
Jersey to dismiss the case against our clients, and hope that the
appropriate orders will be signed promptly,'' said Beldock.
   Carter, now 50, has been living in seclusion since being freed
in November 1985 by U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin. His
whereabouts could not be determined Friday, and Beldock declined to
give out Carter's home phone number.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 11 had let stand Sarokin's
finding that Carter's conviction was tainted because prosecutors
withheld information from the defense.
   Sarokin said the convictions were based on ``an appeal to racism
rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure.''
   Defense attorneys all along had considered a third trial
unlikely because testimony from the only eyewitness, Alfred Bello,
had been discredited during appeals.
   ``Resultingly, admission of any relevant testimony by him at a
new trial must be considered problematical at this point,''
Goceljak said in court papers.
   The case began when two black gunmen entered the Lafayette Bar
and Grill in Paterson and killed the bartender and two patrons.
Hours earlier, a black Paterson bartender had been shot to death by
a white man.
   Carter and Artis were arrested three months later and convicted
by an all-white jury in May 1967.
   But Bello and another witness later recanted, saying they had
been pressured by detectives into giving false testimony at the
trial, and the case was reopened in 1974. The New Jersey Supreme
Court reversed the convictions March 17, 1976.
   In a second trial, Carter and Artis were convicted again Dec.
21, 1976, in part with the testimony of Bello, who had retracted
his claims that he was coerced. This time, the state's highest
court upheld the convictions by a 4-3 vote in 1982.
   From there, the case went to federal court and Sarokin's ruling.

   An attorney for American Brands Inc. has
admitted that company representatives talked with jurors during the
trial of a $16.5 million damage suit against the cigarette
manufacturer, but he says the plaintiffs are wrong to call it jury
tampering.
   The family of deceased smoker Nathan Horton, of Durant, had
claimed American Brands should be held liable for his illness and
death. Horton, 50, died Jan. 29, 1987, of emphysema and lung cancer
after 35 years of smoking two packs a day of Pall Mall unfiltered
cigarettes, which are made by American Brands.
   The trial ended Jan. 29 with a hung jury.
   ``There's no question that it's a serious matter to file a
motion of this kind,'' said plaintiff's attorney Don Barrett. He
filed documents Thursday alleging improper jury contact by the
American Brands representatives and seeking a default judgment and
other sanctions against the defendant.
   But Ed Blackmon, one of several local attorneys hired by
American Brands, called the allegations of improper jury contact a
joke.
   ``What you have is a clear attempt by the plaintiff to keep us
from getting a fair trial,'' Blackmon said.
   Blackmon said the alleged improper contact with jurors was to
let jurors know there wouldn't be court that particular day because
the judge was ill.
   ``When you try to make that into a tampering argument, it's what
their case was about: Take what amounts to nothing and turn it into
something,'' he said.
   The Horton family's motion, filed Thursday in Holmes County
Circuit Court, is based on information contained in affidavits
given to District Attorney Frank Carlton.
   It seeks a judgment in the Hortons' behalf on the basis of
American Brand's alleged liability for Horton's lung cancer and
death, as well as attorneys' fees, court costs and expenses in
preparation of the case.
   At issue are allegations that two paid representatives of
American Brand contacted three jurors during the trial, said
Carlton.
   Barrett said Friday four affidavits filed with the court
indicate ``that more than one paid agent of the American Tobacco
Co. illegally and improperly contacted certain members of the
jury'' during the trial.
   ``This agent was not an attorney, but he was mighty well paid,''
said Barrett, declining to name the person.
   Barrett said he had also filed a motion asking the court to
force the tobacco company to provide names ``of each person known
or suspected by either defendant to have been hired or paid by
anybody as a `jury consultant' or otherwise to assist either
defendants or their attorneys in trial preparation or at the trial
... and to state the sums of money paid or owing to each person so
hired, including all persons paid simply to be present in the
courtroom during the trial.''
   Carlton said he picked up four affidavits Tuesday from Holmes
County Circuit Judge Gray Evans, who presided over the monthlong
trial.
   Jurors gave two of the sworn statements, in which they said an
individual contacted them one day during the trial about a
scheduling change in court, Carlton said. Two other affidavits were
made by people who heard an American Brands adviser bragging that
he had been paid $2,700. One of those people also said the adviser
was talking to a juror.
   ``You're not supposed to contact jurors,'' Carlton said.
``You're not even supposed to say, `Good morning.'''

Anti-Intellectualism'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says that
rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork was the target of ``a
perverse campaign of anti-intellectualism and politically motivated
character assassination.''
   Meese, in a speech to the Republican National Lawyers
Association, also was critical of Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., saying
that the Senate confirmation process for Bork resulted in ``grave
injustices'' being done ``to one of the foremost judicial thinkers
of our time.''
   The Senate Judiciary Committee that Biden chairs conducted the
confirmation hearings on Bork and recommended rejection of the
nomination. The Senate on Oct. 23 turned aside the nomination on a
vote of 58-42.
   Meese, in the speech delivered Thursday night, said that Bork
was unfairly criticized during his confirmation hearings because he
declined to take an expansive view of the role of the judiciary and
of the Ninth Amendment dealing with rights not enumerated in the
Constitution.
   The attorney general said Biden suggested that ``the courts
exist to discover and define our inalienable rights and to enforce
them and implied that this was so whether or not they are found in
the written texts of the supreme laws of our land.
   ``Such ideas not only represent a gross misunderstanding of the
American political process and tradition but also ... if carried
into effect would seriously threaten our liberties as a
self-governing people,'' Meese said.
   Biden is hospitalized while recovering from surgery to correct a
blood vessel problem near his brain and is unable to comment, said
his press secretary, Pat Baskette.
   Meese said the courts have a role in protecting rights, but that
the rights themselves, to be valid, must be derived from written
legal documents.
   ``Most of us here agree that grave injustices were done to one
of the foremost judicial thinkers of our time'' during Bork's
confirmation process, Meese said. ``He was the victim of a perverse
campaigan of anti-intellectualism and politically motivated
character assassination, that I hope will never bear a repeat
performance in the future history of our country.''
   Another unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee, Douglas Ginsburg,
was in the audience for Meese's speech and the two men spoke
briefly after the attorney general's remarks. Ginsburg's
nomination, which followed Bork's, collapsed Nov. 7 after Ginsburg
acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana while he was a law
professor.
   Reagan's third nominee for the post, Anthony Kennedy, won swift
Senate approval and was sworn in as a justice on Thursday.

   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon said Friday he
would remain in the Democratic presidential race until the party
convention in July.
   ``This is a marathon race for the heart and soul of the
Democratic Party, and I'm in it until the finish line in Atlanta,''
Simon told the Minnehaha County Democratic Forum. The national
convention will be held July 18-21 in the Georgia capital.
   ``The response I have received here in the past few days, plus
the outpouring of encouragement from my home state of Illinois and
from Democrats throughout the land, has convinced me that a great
many Americans want a clear-cut choice next November,'' Simon said.
   ``They want a make-no-apologies Democratic nominee. I intend to
offer that choice, waging a fight for the heart and the soul of the
Democratic Party.''
   After placing third among Democrats in this week's New Hampshire
primary, Simon had said he would drop out of the race if he did not
win South Dakota's primary or Minnesota's caucuses Tuesday.
   The senator said Friday that he initially decided on that path
because of financial reality. ``I didn't want to end up with a huge
debt,'' he said, adding that he did not make the statement as a
ploy to get more money for his campaign.
   Simon said cash pledges have increased dramatically in the last
few days, but he would not say who had contributed. Simon's staff
has said the campaign received at least $300,000 in the past week
and $250,000 the week earlier.

   Gene R. Carter, superintendent of the Norfolk,
Va., public schools, was named the first national Superintendent of
the Year on Friday by the American Association of School
Adminstrators.
   The award, announced at the educators' convention in Las Vegas,
includes a gold medallion and a $1,000 U.S. savings bond for Carter
and a $10,000 college scholarship that will go to Carter's hometown
high school.
   Carter attended Booker T. Washington High School in Staunton,
Va., which in those days of legal segregation was for blacks only.
It no longer exists.
   The scholarship will go instead to a student from Robert E. Lee
High School, which now serves all the youths of Staunton. The rules
for deciding who will win the scholarship have not been determined.
   A panel of business, government and education leaders chose
Carter from four finalists, who had been selected earlier from a
field of 38 state finalists.
   The runners-up were: Jack C. Dulaney of the Monongalia schools
in Morgantown, W.Va.; Scott N. Rose of the Pinellas County schools
in Clearwater, Fla., and Robert D. Tschirki of the Littleton,
Colo., schools. Each received a silver medallion and $500 U.S.
savings bond.
   Carter outlined his educational philosophy in this statement:
``Education is power. The belief that knowledge empowers people and
nations is the foundation upon which we must build our commitment
to education. Those of us who lead American public education must
safeguard what could be termed an educational bill of rights for
each student. We need to guarantee simultaneous equity and
excellence for every young person in our nation.''
   Carter said teachers and students need administrators ``who help
them learn. They also need leaders who create a positive and
constructive tone, a climate that will support educational
excellence.''
   The award, sponsored by the ServiceMaster Co. of Downers Grove,
Ill., is patterned after the long-established National Teacher of
the Year competition.

<TEXT>
   The editors of the opposition daily
Extra said Friday that the government closed down their publication
again, three weeks after it reopened.
   Cristobal Sarmiento, Extra's publisher, said in an interview
that government officials arrived Thursday night and sealed the
door with an adhesive tape that read ``Closed by the Attorney
General of the Nation.''
   The paper had reopened in January, six months after it was
closed in a general crackdown by the government on opposition news
media after protests started against the leadership of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, the nation's military chief, is considered the de facto
ruler of Panama, nominally governed by civilian President Eric
Arturo Delvalle.
   A document ordering Extra to be closed said this was done ``to
obtain elements that might serve to prove a punishable deed or to
uncover its authors and participants.''
   Editors said government officials confiscated material ready for
publication in Friday's editions before sealing the door.
   Extra is printed in the opposition daily La Prensa next door,
but is a separate publication. La Prensa reopened last month and
continues to publish.
   Besides Extra, the newspaper El Siglo and the radio stations KW
Continente, La Exitosa and Radio Chiriqui have been closed down by
the government this year.
   Sarmiento was accused last year of publishing information
against the interests of the national economy, but the case was
suspended as part of an amnesty ordered by the national legislature.
   Six news media that had been closed last July reopened as part
of that amnesty.
   The National Banking Commission meanwhile announced Friday that
nearly 50 percent of the local deposits withdrawn from banks in
Panama were returned in the past four months.
   People had withdrawn banking deposits since unrest started last
June with allegations that Noriega had been involved in a wide
range of illicit activities.
   The banking commission said about $103 million of the $208
million withdrawn up to last October had been recovered by private
Panamanian banks and that as a result they had ``strengthened their
liquidity.''
   The commission's statement said about 40 percent of the recovery
was registered during the past five weeks.
   ``By continuing in this way, or better yet, accelerating this
rhythm of recovery, the private Panamanian banks surely will be
able to reactivate soon their credit lending as much for commercial
purposes as for mortgage holders,'' the statement said.
   There are 20 Panamanian and 98 foreign institutions in Panama.

<TEXT>
   The marine radio in Qatar issued warnings
Friday to vessels in the Persian Gulf after a ship reported what
appeared to be a mine in the shallows off the sheikdom's west coast.
   The radio advised ships to stay clear of that area between
Qatar, which juts north into the gulf from the Arabian Peninsula,
and the island state of Bahrain.
   Shipping executives said a ship that did not identify itself
reported sighting an object that was ``black, with points,'' at
about 4 p.m. There was no confirmation that it was one of the
numerous mines sown in the gulf since the Iran-Iraq war began in
September 1980.
   Waters in that stretch are too shallow for major shipping and
unlikely to have been mined, but a few mines have been found off
Bahrain and Qatar, apparently after drifting down from the northern
gulf.
   Most sightings have turned out to be floating debris ranging
from oil drums to dead sheep with their feet sticking out of the
water.
   A French corvette, the Montcalm, used gunfire to destroy a
floating mine north of Bahrain on Thursday, according a report by
the Kuwaiti news agency that quoted French navy officials in Paris.
   The United States and five European countries are decreasing
their mine-sweeping forces in the gulf after declaring the threat
posed by Iranian mines to be under control.
   Iran said its navy intercepted five foreign ships Thursday in
the Strait of Hormuz, the gulf's narrow southern gate, but let all
of them go when it was found they contained no cargo bound for Iraq.
   Iranian frigates and armed speedboats patrol the strait, which
leads into the Gulf of Oman. They stop ships suspected of trading
with Iraq and sometimes attack neutral vessels in retaliation for
Iraqi air strikes on Iranian coastal shipping.

   A crowd of 75 people waved signs and released blue
balloons Friday in support of Dallas police, after officers killed
two men who threatened them with weapons in separate incidents.
   Minority leaders and the City Council have berated the
department for the past two years for being too trigger-happy when
confronting suspects, especially blacks and Hispanics, but others
have rallied around police.
   There have been police casualties, too, including two officers
slain last month.
   Police credited new two-person patrols, begun after the second
officer's death, with averting officers' death or serious injury in
the latest incidents.
   Early Friday, police shot and killed a white man who used a
hunting knife to cut an officer who had chased the man's car during
a robbery investigation.
   Wednesday night, police fatally shot a black man they said
pointed a loaded semiautomatic pistol at an officer who had slipped
and fallen on a dark residential street and was unable to draw his
gun.
   The department placed the officers on routine administrative
leave while it conducts an internal investigation.
   Tension flared last month when Police Chief Billy Prince accused
council members of fostering anti-police sentiment that led to the
Jan. 23 death of Officer John Chase, who was gunned down by a
deranged, homeless man. Some witnesses said a few youths egged on
the gunman, though others said they heard nothing of the kind.
   Since then, however, the city has seen repeated shows of support
for the department.
   At Friday's noon rally at the John F. Kennedy Memorial, the
mostly white crowd held signs and released balloons in support of
the double-patrol system police say may have saved the life of one
officer Wednesday and prevented further injury to the other officer
Friday.
   ``We are here today to thank each and every peace officer across
this nation for doing the job that no one else is brave enough to
do,'' said Terri Kleinmeier, president of Citizens Offering Police
Support.
   E.L. Crenshaw, a retired Dallas police officer, called the
double patrols ``the best thing since flush toilets'' and attacked
police critics by saying ``you don't put down these Indians until
you've walked in their moccasins.''
   ``The two-man element at the scene prevented more injury to the
officer. It's very possible that the injury would have escalated to
a severe and critical injury,'' homicide investigator Don Ortega
said.
   Dorothy Johnson, one of the few blacks to attend the downtown
rally, said there has been racial tension in the city, ``but I
don't take sides. A tragedy can happen to either side.''
   Ronnie Lewis Jones died about an hour after he was shot
Wednesday by Officer Brian Wolff, who said Jones pointed the pistol
at his partner, Steven Johnson.
   ``If it had not been a two-man element, Johnson could be dead
right now,'' said Capt. John Holt, head of the department's Crimes
Against Persons section.
   Early Friday, police killed Thomas Holloway, 35, after stopping
him on the Southern Methodist University campus. The car's license
tags were covered with cloth.
   Holloway emerged from his car, carrying a hunting knife, and cut
one officer's hand, police said. The officer and his partner fired
at the man, Ortega said. At least five shots were fired, police
said.
   Police were paired as a safety precaution after two officers _
Chase, who was white, and James Joe, who was black _ were killed in
nine days last month.
   On Jan. 14 Joe, who was off-duty, was killed as he confronted
burglary suspects in a northeast Dallas apartment complex's parking
lot. Nine days later, a mentally ill man took Chase's gun and shot
him to death before being killed by pursuing officers.

<TEXT>
   Arizona's national image is suffering,
former Rep. John Rhodes said Friday in announcing he will run
against impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, a fellow Republican, in the May
17 recall election.
   ``If there is an election on May 17, my name will be on the
ballot,'' the 71-year-old former U.S. House minority leader said at
a news conference. ``I don't like to lose. In fact, I'm not going
to lose.''
   Rhodes will oppose Mecham, Democrat Carolyn Warner and a number
of lesser-known potential candidates in the winner-take-all recall
vote. Mrs. Warner, a former state school superintendent, lost to
Mecham in the three-way 1986 gubernatorial race.
   Mecham also faces a March 9 criminal trial on charges of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and a Feb. 29 impeachment trial
in the state Senate.
   Mecham and his staffers did not return phone calls seeking
comment on Rhodes' entry into the race.
   Rhodes, who served 30 years in the House before retiring in
1982, said that ``because of the current acrimonious climate, the
important issues facing the state are not being addressed
adequately. ... We cannot afford continued paralysis.''
   Mecham is guaranteed a spot on the recall ballot. Other
candidates must submit 3,336 signatures of registered voters by
March 18. The secretary of state's office said 86 people, including
Mrs. Warner and Rhodes, had picked up packets to collect signatures
thus far.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin has issued a non-binding opinion
saying that if Mecham resigns or is removed from office before the
recall vote, the election still must be held even though the
governorship would have been turned over to acting Gov. Rose
Mofford.
   However, a number of lawmakers and others have said the matter
is likely to be settled in court.
   Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, has declined to say if she will run in
a recall election.
   Rhodes declined to criticize Mecham or Mrs. Warner, who has
labeled him a candidate of the power brokers because he is backed
by people like developer J. Fife Symington and Keith Turley,
chairman of Pinnacle West, the parent firm of Arizona Public
Service Corp. Symington is Rhodes' finance chairman, and Turley was
among the first people to urge Rhodes to enter the race.
   ``My service in the Congress should be adequate proof that I
don't wear anyone's collar,'' Rhodes said.
   Rhodes said former Sen. Barry Goldwater has promised his
support, and current Sen. John McCain, a Republican, said Friday he
also backs Rhodes. Goldwater previously said Mecham should resign.
   State Republican Chairman Burton Kruglick said the party has not
endorsed either Mecham or Rhodes in the recall campaign.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Mofford on Friday disputed Mecham's claim that
she has been dismantling his administration since she took over as
acting governor following his Feb. 5 impeachment by the House.
   ``I am responsible for acting as the chief executive of this
state during that period,'' Mrs. Mofford said in a letter to
Mecham. She said she had replaced only one department head and had
given Mecham everyone he wanted for his personal staff.
   Also on Friday, a recall petition was taken out against Rep.
Sterling Ridge, a Republican who voted to impeach Mecham, making
him the 10th lawmaker to face a recall drive because of his recall
vote.

   The first of seven memorial services for
victims of the rampage at a Silicon Valley defense plant took place
Friday while officials maintained a suicide watch on the gunman
charged with their deaths.
   About 600 mourners jammed a funeral home for services for Glenda
Moritz, a 27-year-old planner at ESL Inc., the top-secret
electronics plant where police say Richard Wade Farley shot seven
workers to death and wounded three others, including a woman whose
rejection of Farley's advances apparently sparked the massacre.
   Jeanne Pilling, Moritz's roommate and best friend, said the two
spent the night before Tuesday's shooting talking about their
destinies.
   ``Glenda said, `We never know what the future holds for us.
Don't you wish you knew what the future holds?''' Pilling recalled.
``I still don't believe it really happened. She was my very best
friend. I've never been that close to a person in my life.''
   There was no casket; a private burial is planned. Mourners paid
their respects before a display of photos surrounded by dozens of
bouquets.
   ``You've Lost That Loving Feeling,'' by the Righteous Brothers,
was played during the service. Friends said it was one of Moritz's
favorite songs.
   Additional services are planned this weekend for the six others
killed before the computer expert surrendered after 5{ hours.
   Medical authorities said three ESL employees wounded in the
attack, and a fourth who broke her arm trying to escape, are all
recovering, including Laura Black, a 26-year-old technician whom
Farley had pursued relentlessly for four years.
   Farley, 39, was fired from the company 21 months ago for
harassing her, ESL officials said.
   He is being held without bail in solitary confinement in Santa
Clara County Jail, where he has requested a telephone and envelopes.
   He was being held in an isolation cell under a ``welfare
watch,'' which allows guards to maintain close supervision in case
he attempts to take his life and also protects him from attacks by
other inmates, said San Jose County Sheriff's Sgt. Cary Colla.
   ``He has been quiet. He's been polite to staff. As one officer
described it, he seemed to be going through a lot of
self-thought,'' said Colla.
   The docile and quiet portrait of Farley contrasts markedly with
the man police say tormented Black by following her, phoning her,
joining her aerobics class and sending her more than 300 letters.
   ``I want to warn you how far I'm willing to go if you continue
to push me,'' he wrote in one note. ``I once told you I will do
whatever is necessary to see you. Let's say you don't back down and
pretty soon I crack under the pressure and run amok destroying
everything in my path until the police catch me and kill me. ...''
   Black finally obtained a court order to prevent Farley from
bothering her further. The order was final on Wednesday, 12 hours
after Farley marched into the ESL plant carrying 98 pounds of
weaponry and opened fire with a repeating shotgun.

<HEAD>Gingrich To Ask House Ethics Committee To Investigate Speaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said Friday he will
ask the House ethics committee next month to launch a formal
investigation into allegations of corruption that have been leveled
against Speaker Jim Wright in published reports over the past 10
years.
   Gingrich, a leader of Republican right in the House and a
frequent critic of the ethics of House Democratic leaders, said the
news accounts outline ``clear violations of House rules'' by
Wright, D-Texas, and deserve to be investigated.
   ``The problem that this House faces is that they now have a
speaker who has real problems,'' he said. ``We're going to have to
at least, at a minimum, insist that we find out what the truth is,
and on March 3 I intend to create that opportunity.''
   Neither Wright nor his spokesman were immediately available to
comment on Gingrich's plan to request an investigation.
   Under House rules, any member can ask the ethics committee _
formally called the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct _ to
investigate another member. The panel, composed of six Democrats
and six Republicans, can reject such a request only by a majority
vote.
   Gingrich said it would be ``inconceivable'' that the committee
would refuse to investigate the allegations. But if that happens,
he said he intends to force the issue on the House floor with a
series of privileged votes that could tie up the House for months.
   Gingrich, who lost a House vote last year on his proposal to
create an outside commission to investigate ethics complaints
against Wright and other Democratic leaders, said he was announcing
his intentions to seek an ethics committee investigation now so
other House members could familiarize themselves with the
allegations against Wright.
   He said he chose March 3 as the date to file his complaint
because he wants the committee to have time to complete at least a
preliminary investigation before Congress adjourns for the year.
   Gingrich cited two specific published reports which he said
provide clear evidence that Wright violated House rules. The first
involved Wrights's failure since 1980 to file the required
financial disclosure reports for a company in which he is a partner.
   The second involved 55 percent royalties Wright received for a
book published by a friend whose printing company worked for
Wright's campaign committee. Gingrich said House rules prohibit
members from receiving royalities in excess of ``the usual and
customary value for such services,'' and most authors receive
royalties of 6 percent to 8 percent.
   Gingrich and a political action committee he heads were accused
last month by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee of
mail fraud for soliciting more than $200,000 in contributions for
conservative candidates through the mails and then providing only
$3,000 to such candidates.
   Gingrich denied the DCCC accusations Friday, characterizing them
as an attempt to discredit him politically so he could not pursue
the ethics complaints against Wright. He also denied that his
actions against Wright were politically motivated.

   Vice President George Bush said
Friday that the rodeo of the political campaign is filled with hard
knocks, and suggested that his chief rival Bob Dole is still
smarting from his New Hampshire fall.
   In a thinly disguised barb directed toward the Kansas senator,
Bush suggested to a crowd at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame that
his opponent is brooding over his second-place finish in the New
Hampshire Republican primary.
   ``You learn that the rodeo is full of hard encounters with the
ground and you learn to pick yourself up and dust yourself off and
get back on the horse again,'' Bush said.
   ``And there's a lesson in that for everybody in public life and
it's a lesson that the people of Iowa reminded me of 10 days ago,''
Bush said. ``So you don't get angry and bitter when you get
defeated. You pick yourself back up and get back on the horse and
go on and win the next election.''
   Bush said earlier in the day that he is bewildered by Dole's
refusal to debate him Friday night, but said he will ``let them
worry'' about the wisdom of that strategy.
   At the start of a campaign tour in Oklahoma City, Bush said that
despite the pre-Super Tuesday jockeying by Dole and Pat Robertson,
``All I know is to concentrate on the positive and take my message
to the people.''
   A senior Bush campaign aide, talking to reporters on grounds of
anonymity, said there had been talk of Bush withdrawing from the
Dallas debate. But the official said Bush killed that idea, telling
aides that ``I gave my word'' to take part in the face-off.
   Seeking votes in Oklahoma, a state that has suffered from
declining U.S. oil production and price drops, Bush told reporters
at Will Rogers World Airport that if elected president, he would
push for ``a newer and more visionary'' energy policy.
   Bush did not elaborate on that point. He told an audience in
Dallas on Thursday that the United States must free itself of
dependency on foreign sources of oil. In the New Hampshire
campaign, he said he was against a $10 per barrel import fee.
   The vice president's plane landed in Oklahoma City in clear,
springlike weather under sunny skies. Bush strode over to waiting
reorters, and he was besieged with questions about Dole's refusal
to meet him in the Dallas Republican presidential debate later in
the day.
   ``I honestly cannot interpret what it's about,'' Bush said of
the Dole campaign strategy. ``I'm simply confused by what it is.
... I'll let them worry about their campaigns and we'll keep on the
positive track.''
   He emphatically denied allegations from rival campaign camps
that his campaign had been given advance notice of the questions to
be asked in the debate.
   ``I can't believe that somebody would make that kind of
accusation,'' he said. ``It's certainly not true. There is no
evidence of truth whatsoever in that.''
   Bush also said ``no way'' when asked whether he was worried
about being upset by Robertson in the March 5 South Carolina
primary.
   But the vice president did acknowledge that ``he's strong there.
But we will fight hard.'' Bush is scheduled to visit South Carolina
on Monday after campaigning over the weekend in his hometown of
Houston.
   Bush began his Oklahoma City tour by visiting a Control Data
Systems computer components manufacturing plant.
   At one point, the vice president sat down next to a woman,
wearing a blue work blouse, and accepted her invitation to try his
hand at assembling a component. He manually installed a computer
chip into a circuit board.
   After touring the plant, Bush went to the Cowboy Hall of Fame,
where he joined in a tribute to the late Malcolm Baldrige, the
Reagan administration commerce secretary who was killed in a fall
from horse in northern California last year.
   Baldrige, an accomplished rodeo rider, was enshrined in the hall
during a private ``hat hanging'' ceremony.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Support Plebiscite For Reforming Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla
group said Friday it supports President Virgilio Barco's attempt to
combat violence by reforming the constitution so he will have more
power.
   The Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, known as the FARC,
said it believes ``a vast majority of the people'' support such a
plebiscite.
   The communique, from the FARC's chiefs of staff, was published
by Colombia's leading daily, El Tiempo, of Bogota.
   The Supreme Court has thwarted Barco's attempts to use state of
siege powers to move against drug traffickers, leftist guerrillas
and right-wing death squads. It found about half of his decrees
unconstitutional.
   Barco proposed last month that Colombia's 1886 Constitution be
reformed through a referendum.
   A 1957 amendment to the constitution prohibits referendums, so
there must first be a plebiscite to lift that ban. Once the ban was
lifted, a constituent assembly would be held to decide how the
constitution should be reformed.
   Barco has not spelled out the reforms he wants, but indicated he
wants to change Colombia's two-chamber congress to one chamber to
speed up legislation; to change the overburdened and corrupt court
system, and to get more power in issuing decrees under a state of
siege.
   A state of siege is on now in Colombia. There has been a state
of siege for all but a few months of the last 40 years.
   Barco belongs to the Liberal party. The opposition Conservative
Party refused to support a plebiscite. Barco has delayed setting a
voting date in hope of promoting national unity on the issue.
   The plebiscite could be as early as March 13, coinciding with
the nationwide election of mayors.
   The FARC said Barco should ignore the Conservatives and see ``if
the people want a new constitution or if they want to stay with the
anachronistic and feudal one of 1886.''
   The FARC is the largest of five guerrilla groups in Colombia.
The army says the FARC has about 5,000 members. FARC leaders claim
to have about 20,000 combatants.
   By reforming the constitution, Barco hopes to have the tools to
stop violence which has been wracking the country for four decades.
   The left has been particularly hurt. More than 400 members of
its Patriotic Union Party were killed in the last two years. Many
of the party's leaders and other members are former FARC guerrillas.
   The party says right-wing death squads run by the military are
behind the killings.
   About 100 members of the Liberal and Conservative parties also
have been killed in the last two years. In many of those cases the
military has blamed leftist guerrillas.
   Colombia also has been hit hard by drug trafficker violence.
   The government says that the traffickers killed a justice
minister, an attorney general, several judges, two newspaper
editors and many others who opposed them over the last four years.

<HEAD>Ford Workers to Receive Average $3,700 in 1987 Profit-Sharing</HEAD>

   Thousands of Ford Motor Co. workers learned
Friday their share of the automaker's record $4.6 billion in 1987
earnings will average more than $3,700 each when profit-sharing
checks are handed out next month.
   Ford will distribute $635 million in profit-sharing to hourly
and salaried workers March 8. The No. 2 automaker said it is
believed to be the largest one-year payout ever by a major U.S.
corporation.
   Ford's chief financial officer, Stan Seneker, announced the
figures to cheering workers at Ford's Michigan Truck plant in
Wayne, just west of Detroit. The announcement was broadcast live to
200 Ford facilities nationwide.
   Ford, which earned the highest profits in automotive history in
1987, will know in coming weeks exactly how many of its 180,000
workers will receive a share, said Ford spokesman Mike Moran said.
   ``The company's U.S. employees can take pride in their
performance as members of the Ford team. It is fitting that they
will share in the results by receiving their largest profit-sharing
checks ever,'' Ford Chairman Donald Petersen said.
   United Auto Workers Vice President Stephen Yokich, who heads the
union's Ford department, said the UAW was pleased with the payouts,
which were first negotiated in 1982 for 1983 earnings.
   But he added, ``We would again urge Ford Motor Co. to allocate
much more in capital investments from its huge profits into
U.S.-based production of vehicles and components.
   ``The real `reward' sought by U.S. workers, consumers and
communities for their contributions to Ford's success should be
sizeable additional U.S. investments by Ford toward securing jobs
for the future,'' Yokich said.
   Ford has added no assembly plants of its own in the United
States in recent years. Instead, it is building some cars in
Mexico, and its new Ford Probe sporty coupe is built at a Mazda
Motor Corp. plant.
   Ford also imports cars from Korea and West Germany and plans to
build a new Lincoln-Mercury luxury convertible in Australia.
   In 1987, Ford outearned industry-leader General Motors Corp. for
the second straight year, its profits jumping 41 percent over 1986.
   Workers at GM, which earned $3.6 billion, will receive no share
of profits for the second straight year. No. 3 Chrysler Corp. made
$1.3 billion in 1987.
   Although the formulas for profit-sharing at Ford and GM differ,
both are based on the company's U.S. performance. Ford improved its
U.S. earnings in 1987; GM's fell by nearly half from 1986.
   The lack of profit-sharing at GM at the same time that the
corporation handed out millions of dollars in executive bonuses
angered workers. GM has switched to the Ford formula for the
contract covering 1988-90.
   But GM said that even under the Ford formula, it wouldn't have
earned enough in the United States to pay profit-sharing for 1987.
   More than 160,250 Ford workers received record profit-sharing
payments averaging $2,100 for 1986, when Ford earned $3.29 billion.
   In 1985, Ford profit-sharing averaged $1,200 per worker, $2,000
in 1984 and $400 in 1983. In the past five years, Ford said it has
given out more than $1.6 billion to its workers.

<HEAD>U.N. To Meet Over U.S. Move To Close PLO Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Nations plans to reconvene the
159-member General Assembly in an emergency session to consider the
U.S. move to close the Palestine Liberation Organization mission,
U.N. officials said Friday.
   The effort by the U.S. Congress has placed America on a
collision course with the world body. The PLO has formidable
support at the United Nations, which generally votes against the
United States and Israel on Middle East issues.
   Under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987, passed by Congress
and signed by President Reagan on Dec. 22, 1987, the PLO mission at
the United Nations was ordered closed by March 22.
   On Thursday, Arab nations demanded a resumed session to fight
the U.S. action which the United Nations and the U.S. State
Department say violates a legal agreement on the right of missions
to operate.
   In a letter to Peter Florin of East Germany, president of the
General Assembly, the Arab group requested reconvening of the
General Assembly as soon as possible and no later than Feb. 29.
   The 42nd General Assembly completed its agenda in December but
technically is still in session. It can be reconvened at any time
with a request by members and consent of the president.
   Reconvened sessions are not uncommon, but the PLO issue is one
of the most controversial and divisive to be considered.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``feels the request
for a resumed session is both timely and understandable,'' U.N.
press spokesman Mario Zamorano told reporters at a briefing Friday.
   Florin will return Wednesday from a visit to Egypt and will
consult with the Arab countries on reconvening the world body, his
spokeswoman, Nadia Youssef, told reporters Friday.
   The PLO and the Arab League previously said they might ask the
assembly to leave New York and meet in Geneva if the PLO Mission is
closed.
   After Congress passed the anti-terrorism measure, the General
Assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging the United
States to leave the PLO mission open.
   The U.S. government itself is divided on the issue. The State
Department has said repeatedly that the treaty obliges the United
States to allow all U.N. missions, including the PLO, to function.
   It now is up to Attorney General Edwin Meese III to decide
whether the mission can remain open.
   Several members of Congress have said Meese told them he would
close the mission, despite the treaty.
   The treaty provides for binding arbitration of disputes between
the United States and the United Nations. Perez de Cuellar said the
United States has so far not agreed to arbitration.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has said the PLO may take the dispute
to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a crowded
bank near a military base during lunch hour Friday and killed 14
people. It was the deadliest civilian attack in the territory's
22-year guerrilla war for independence.
   The blast in the northern town of Oshakati killed 10 women,
three men and a child and injured 31 people, most of them
seriously, said an army spokesman, Commandant Lieb Bester.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, which
destroyed the First National Bank building. Five people were
injured when the same bank was bombed a year ago.
   All those killed, a white woman and 13 blacks, were civilians,
Bester said. Most were believed to be government workers who had
just received their paychecks.
   A police inspector, Keirie Du Rand, said about 55 pounds of
plastic explosives were used in the blast, which occurred shortly
before 1 p.m. Anfire raged for several hours after the explosion,
hampering police access.
   Oshakati is about 25 miles south of the Angolan border and is
home to the largest military base in the region, a staging point
for South Africa's military intervention in Angola's civil war.
   Guerrillas of the South-West African People's Organization
(SWAPO), based in Angola, frequently operate in the Ovambo region
around Oshakati.
   SWAPO has been fighting since 1966 to gain control of South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia. The territory is administered by
South Africa in violation of a United Nations resolution.
   A statement received in Windhoek, the territorial capital, from
a SWAPO office in Luanda, Angola, denied involvement. The statement
said the blast was part of a South African propaganda campaign to
``smear the name of SWAPO.''
   SWAPO has claimed responsibility for previous bombings in the
territory, including a blast last month at a store at a military
base in Windhoek. The bombing, which caused no injuries, was
intended to protest the visit to Namibia of conservative West
German politician Franz Josef Strauss.
   The worst previous bombing in the region occurred in 1986 in the
port town of Walvis Bay, a South African enclave near the center of
Namibia's Atlantic Coast. Five people were killed and 23 injured in
that explosion at a crowded butcher shop. No group claimed
responsibility for that blast.
   SWAPO has attacked both military and civilian targets during its
sabotage and bombing campaign. An estimated 20,000 people have died
during the bush war, about half of them guerrillas, about 700 of
them security forces, and the rest civilians.
   South African and South-West African troops have been fighting
for about five months in Angola on behalf of the UNITA rebel
movement. South African officials say they will not grant
independence to Namibia until after withdrawal of the 40,000 Cuban
troops fighting in support of Angola's Marxist government.
   Only about 70,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people are white, and
the South African government has installed a multiracial
transitional administration to run the territory's affairs.
   SWAPO has refused to negotiate with the transitional government,
citing the U.N. resolution demanding free elections.
   The South African Press Association said the doors of the bank
may have been locked at the time of the explosion. It said guards
often locked the doors when the bank was busy in order to keep the
office from becoming too crowded.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday rejected an
attempt by America West Airlines Inc. to block the planned merger
of USAir and Piedmont Aviation, saying the Phoenix-based airline
had no legal standing in the case.
   In a brief opinion, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here refused to grant America West's petition to
review the Transportation Department's approval of the merger.
   America West contended that the merger will inhibit its ability
to expand to eastern cities.
   But the court said ``America West's generalized allegations
about flying eastward are neither causally related to the
department's final order nor redressable by reversal of the order.''
   ``Even if the merger were overturned by the court, America West
would be no better off because it has not identified any interest
in serving any identified market actually affected by the merger,''
the court said.
   In a statement, America West's chairman, Edward R. Beauvais,
said the company was disappointed by the decision.
   ``We are in the process of reviewing the decision to determine
our future course of action with respect to the case,'' he said.

   Air traffic will increase steadily over the
next dozen years with air traffic controllers handling a third more
planes in 1999 than they do today, the Federal Aviation
Administration forecast Friday.
   The FAA forecast also shows that the number of people flying
commercial jetliners will grow from about 445 million passengers in
1987 to nearly 765 million in 1999.
   The commuter aircraft are expected to have an even sharper
passenger growth from carrying 27 million people last year to
carrying 58 million annually just before the turn of the century,
according to the FAA's latest aviation forecasts.
   ``What we see is a situation of growth, substantial growth, for
the industry and the FAA,'' John Rodgers, the agency's deputy
director for aviation policy and plans, told an aviation planning
conference.
   The conference focused on problems stemming from the expected
growth in aviation in the coming years. Most aviation experts have
predicted that either through government regulation or some form of
market incentives the nation's aviation system will have to be
constrained because of a shortage of airports and air traffic
control limitiations.
   In a speech, however, Robert Crandall, chairman of American
Airlines, told the group that more attention should be placed on
``how to avoid (air traffic) constraints rather than using up too
many resources talking about how to operate within constraints.''
   Crandall acknowledged that some limitations on aviation growth
might be necessary in the short term, but he said in the long run
``bold action'' is needed to increase airway and airport capacity.
   ``We should not become so focused on constraints that we lose
sight of the need to build an aviation system capable of operating
in the long term ... without the constraints which are increasingly
reducing the industry's efficiency, stifling its growth and
frustrating its customers,'' said Crandall.
   The FAA growth forecast was based on an assumption of an average
3 percent annual economic growth and the absence of intense fare
wars among the airlines. The growth likely would be dampened by
slower economic growth and likely be greater if the airlines were
to engage in a fare battle that would attract more travelers.
   According to the FAA forecast, the number of domestic
enplanements will increase 4.6 percent a year through the end of
this decade while the number of revenue passenger miles - a figure
that reflects a single passenger traveling one mile - will increase
4.8 percent a year.
   The number of flights, however, are expected to increase at a
slower rate, 2.3 percent annually, indicating that airlines will
fly with fewer empty seats and likely move somewhat to larger
aircraft, said the forecast.
   During the next dozen years there will be almost no increase in
the number of general aviation aircraft, although the number of
more sophisticated turbine-powered business aircraft is expected to
increase by about 50 percent, the FAA said.
   ``The demand for FAA operational services is anticipated to
increase over the forecast period as a result of continued strong
growth in aviation activity,'' predicted the FAA.
   The total number of aircraft operations - both commercial and
private -handled at FAA towers and at enroute air traffic control
centers will increase by about 2.4 percent a year, the agency said.
   FAA towers at airports will handle 81.4 million flight
operations by 1999, compared to 61 million last year, the forecast
predicted. The increase in operations handled by enroute air
traffic control centers will stem primarily from increased air
carrier and commuter traffic, the FAA said.

   The head of Israel's government broadcasting
authority has banned a satirical song about alleged Israeli
indifference to the violence in the occupied Arab territories, a
spokeswoman said Friday.
   ``What's Burning'' is about members of a family who intently
watch the American television show ``Dynasty'' while their house
goes up in flames.
   The song is a satirical commentary on the way normal life has
continued for many Israelis during 10 weeks of violence in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. More than 50 Palestinians have
been killed by Israelis in the unrest, according to U.N. figures.
   It was to have been performed on the Friday night entertainment
show ``From Me, Manny,'' one of the highest-rated shows on state
television.
   Spokeswoman Sari Timerman said the song was banned by Uri Porat,
chief of the Israel Broadcasting Authority, who described it as
``maccabre anti-Israeli propaganda in the guise of social satire.
It is based on the lying thesis that the Israeli public is
indifferent ... to what happens here.''
   Several daily newspapers gave front-page coverage to the ban and
published the words of the song in full.
   Four well-known comedians, including Tuvia Zafir, whose
specialty is mimicking Israel's political leaders, act out the
lyrics.
   Zafir portrays the father in a family of four that includes a
wife, a son serving in the army and a younger boy.
   The father, determined to watch ``Dynasty,'' ignores the the
warnings of his younger son about the flames outside.
   Father: ``Don't worry. It won't last. It will be over in a few
minutes.''
   Verse: ``Nothing's burning. Nothing's burning. No reason to get
up. No reason to hurry.''
   Father: ``And as the mature, responsible and experienced one my
motto is: `Sit still and don't do anything.'''
   Even when his clothes catch fire the father doesn't worry. Zafir
sings:
   ``You're so silly, fire, so silly. What do you think, that just
because you're burning me I will think you're endangering my
health? Really now! Go ahead, spread as much as you like. We'll see
which one of us tires faster.''
   The house burns down.
   Father: ``The fire, as I said, will finally be extinguished and
of course time will be on our side.''
   Son: ``But father, we have burned the time.''
   Father: ``Shut up!'' (Slaps him.) ``And whoever takes a look
around''
   Mother: ``Will see that father, as always, is right.''
   Ms. Timerman said Porat was especially angered by a passage in
which the father tells his elder son to get up and put out the
flames, ``but try not to block `Dynasty.'''
   She quoted Porat as saying: ``This is an insult to every Israeli
family. It portrays them as not caring about their soldier-sons and
sending them to do their dirty work.''

<HEAD>Goria Wins Vote Of Confidence In The Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Giovanni Goria won a vote of confidence in
the Senate on Friday that completed the resurrection of his shaky
coalition government.
   The Senate voted 170 to 91 to back Goria. The Chamber of
Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, voted 364-208 with four
abstentions on Thursday to support the return of the premier.
   Although the votes of confidence have supported Goria, the
problems that led to his resignation have not been resolved.
   Goria, a Christian Democrat, resigned Feb. 10 after defectors in
his party helped defeat the government 17 times in the Chamber
during secret votes on the proposed budget and spending for
government ministries.
   President Francesco Cossiga rejected the resignation and told
Goria to remain premier to get the budget passed by Parliament
before the April 30 deadline.
   Goria's five-party coalition, Italy's 47th postwar government,
has been shaky since he took office last July. The coalition
includes the Christian Democrats, the Socialists and three tiny
parties, the Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals.
   The premier, who at 44 is the youngest to ever hold the post,
also resigned in November during a dispute with the Liberals.
However, Cossiga later persuaded him to withdraw his resignation.

   Jesse Jackson on Friday asked for the support
of homosexuals during a presidential campaign appearance at an
inner-city church led by a lesbian pastor.
   ``I stood with you,'' the Democratic candidate said. ``Now make
me a president.''
   The Rev. Arlene Ackerman, pastor of All God's Children
Metropolitan Community Church, said Jackson was the only
presidential candidate to join gays and lesbians when they marched
on Washington, D.C., in October.
   ``He's not afraid to dignify us by championing our causes,''
said Bill Dorn, a former Catholic priest who is gay.
   Jackson, who drew a capacity crowd of about 1,000 to the church,
said other candidates have avoided making appearances with gay and
lesbian groups.
   ``They were afraid that being close to you would make them look
unpresidential,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson said he supports legislation in Congress that calls for
an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation. He also said
he supports a massive, federally funded AIDS prevention and
education campaign.
   ``I hope you do consider me to be your friend,'' Jackson said.
``I affirm your humanity and your rights under the law.''
   Jackson urged the crowd to attend Minnesota's precinct caucuses
on Tuesday.
   ``Don't pull for me and vote for someone else,'' he said. ``Put
your oath and votes in the same trough.''

   Peace talks between the leftist Nicaraguan
government and Contra rebels broke down Friday and their mediator
indirectly blamed the Sandinistas for not accepting a new
cease-fire proposal.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the head of the Roman Catholic
Church in Nicaragua, abruptly suspended the talks in mid-afternoon,
expressing disappointment that his proposal had not been accepted
``in principle'' by both sides.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, said
the cardinal called off the talks before he could deliver a formal,
written response that would have accepted the mediator's five-point
plan.
   The plan, offered by Obando y Bravo on Thursday, called on the
Contras to accept a cease-fire in exchange for four major
concessions by the Sandinistas, including a total amnesty for all
political prisoners and full freedom of the press.
   Contra negotiators told a news conference Thursday night that
they accepted the cardinal's proposal ``in principle,'' while
Tinoco called it ``interesting and constructive'' but said it
needed clarification.
   Paul Reichler, a Washington, D.C., attorney adivising the
Sandinistas, said earlier Friday that President Daniel Ortega had
initially instructed his negotiators not to discuss Obando y
Bravo's proposal at the bargaining table with the Contras.
   Reichler said Ortega's instructions came by telephone Thursday
night, shortly after Obando y Bravo offered his plan to break what
he called an impasse in a discussion on defining the objectives of
a cease-fire.
   The attorney said Ortega suggested that Roger Fisher, a Harvard
professor who heads the Institute for Conflict Resolution in
Boston, draw up a new cease-fire plan, drawing on the proposals of
the government and the Contras.
   In a communique, Obando y Bravo rejected that suggestion.
   No new date was set for further negotiations, although both
sides expressed their willingness to continue the talks.
   The cardinal's communique said that ``after all the meetings
that they have had, the mediators believe that the acceptance, in
principle, of its proposal would favor the rapid advance of the
cease-fire negotiations.''
   The communique also said the government and the Contras should
give their negotiators ``enough decision-making ability to resolve
problems that present themselves in the negotiations.''
   In a news conference after the talks ended, Jaime Morales, the
chief Contra negotiator, said his team had the ability to make
decisions on the spot, noting that the rebels had accepted Obando y
Bravo's proposal Thursday night.
   ``We accepted the proposal in principle, and the other side did
not,'' Morales said.
   Tinoco, on the other hand, blamed the Contras for the breakdown
in the negotiations.
   ``It was our impression that the Contras were systematically
rejecting all discussion of a cease-fire,'' he told reporters.
``The Contras continue to be advised by people in the (Reagan)
administration who want to continue the war.''
   The U.S.-supported rebels expressed reservations Friday about
the proposal. They said they saw potential danger in the mediator's
request for their acceptance of an as yet undefined cease-fire in
exchange for concessions.
   During a break in the talks Friday morning, Reichler told
reporters that Ortega felt the Guatemala City talks should be
confined solely to the mechanics of establishing a cease-fire and
not become a forum for political discussions.
   The attorney quoted the Nicaraguan president as saying he was
willing to talk personally with Obando y Bravo about his proposal
but did not want his negotiators to discuss it at the talks.
   Later in the day, however, the government apparently switched
positions. But by the time it could get its new response to the
cardinal, he had already called off the negotiations.
   Tinoco said the government's formal response accepted the
cardinal's five-point proposal in principle but said it was
``indispensable to arrive at a definition and agreement'' on his
cease-fire plan.
   Under the cardinal's plan, the rebels would be confined to
certain ``enclaves or zones'' during a 30-day cease-fire, while
talks on a permanent truce continued.
   In exchange for the cease-fire, the government would:
   _ Grant a ``full, general amnesty'' to several thousand
political prisoners in Nicaraguan jails, including members of the
National Guard of former dictator Gen. Anastasio Somoza, whom the
Sandinistas overthrew in 1979.
   _ Permit unrestricted freedom of the press, a right now granted
only to some media.
   _ ``Reconsider'' a mandatory military draft law, which has
provoked violent protests in several Nicaraguan cities.
   _ Reopen talks with the internal opposition, represented by 14
political parties and a coalition of business, labor and political
groups known as the Democratic Coordinate. Those talks broke off
late last year.
   The first round of direct peace talks between the two sides took
place in San Jose, Costa Rica, in late January, a week before the
U.S. House rejected President Reagan's latest request for $36.2
million in Contra aid.
   Participants characterized that meeting as cordial but lacking
in progress.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras came to Guatemala City stating
that they were still far apart on the question of which should come
first, a cease-fire or democratic reforms in Nicaragua.
   The negotiations are being held in accordance with a Central
American peace plan signed by five of the region's presidents last
August.

   The Reagan administration was accused in court
papers Friday of continuing to force employees to sign agreements
not to disclose classified information despite a one-year
moratorium imposed by Congress.
   The American Foreign Service Association filed a motion in U.S.
District Court for a preliminary injunction to force Secretary of
State George Schultz to stop ordering State Department employees to
sign one of the non-disclosure forms.
   The injunction sought by the plaintiffs would also direct CIA
Director William Webster and Steven Garfinkel, head of the
Information Security Oversight Office, to order other federal
agencies to stop forcing employees to sign the forms.
   One of the forms, SF 189, binds federal employees never to
divulge classified or classifiable information without permission.
More than 1.7 million federal employees in sensitive jobs have
signed the form.
   The other form, SF 4193, also requires employees to seek
``prepublication review of contemplated disclosures.''
   Critics in Congress contend the forms violate the First
Amendment rights of government employees. These critics argue that
inclusion of ``classifiable information'' give agencies the power
to punish whistleblowers by classifying information after it has
already been disclosed.
   When it passed the continuing resolution for the 1988 fiscal
year, Congress said no money could be used during the fiscal year
to force employees to sign the agreements or other nondisclosure
forms.
   The brief charged that ``numerous employees have been required
to sign forms SF 189 and SF 4193 since the passage of the
continuing resolution.''
   The plaintiffs charged that a division of the Navy last month
ordered its employees to sign one of the forms and the Air Force
issued a directive last month saying ``that signing SF 189 is a
prerequisite to access to classified information.''
   Foreign service officers, who are members of the American
Foreign Service Association, are still being required to sign SF
4193, the court papers charged.
   ``The administration has continued to implement the standard
forms at issue in this case, despite Congress' explicit direction
in the continuing resolution that all such implementation efforts
must cease. Such illegal conduct should not be allowed to
continue,'' the lawsuit said.

   Sikh separatists set off bombs near
courthouses in four major cities in Punjab state Friday, killing
nine people and injuring more than 60, police said.
   Three other people were shot to death in separate attacks in the
northern state, where militant Sikhs are waging a war for an
independent homeland. More than 230 people have been killed this
year in violence blamed on Sikhs.
   Police in New Delhi issued a ``red alert'' after the explosions
and asked people not to touch abandoned objects such as boxes, bags
and briefcases.
   Ravi Pawar, a police spokesman, said intelligence information
indicated that Sikh terrorists may be planning to explode bombs in
busy areas in the capital.
   The bombs in Punjab blew up in or near courthouse compounds in
the cities of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Patiala and Hoshiarpur, killing
nine people. Fifty people were detained in the Sikh holy city of
Amritsar for questioning in connection with one explosion, police
reports said.
   In Patiala, a powerful bomb blew up in a soda water factory in
front of the district court building, killing three Hindus and
injuring one.
   The blast at a courthouse in Hoshiarpur killed three people,
including a woman, police said. Two others were injured.
   J.P. Birdhi, senior superintendent of police in Gurdaspur, said
two people died and 33 people were injured, six of them seriously,
in a blast there.
   In Amritsar, assailants lobbed a bomb over a wall into a crowd
outside the court. One person was killed and 19 others were
wounded, said Izhar Alam, the city police chief.
   He said a homemade bomb was discovered inside a liquor bottle
left in a cinema hall filled with 200 people. It was turned over to
bomb experts and no one was injured.
   Also Friday, four Sikh extremists gunned down a security guard
at a bank in Patiala, police said.
   Sikhs are a religious minority in India, representing 2 percent
of the 780 million population, but they are a majority in Punjab
state.
   The state has been under direct federal rule since Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi dismissed the moderate Sikh state government
last year for failing to curb terrorism.
   More than 1,000 people were killed last year in attacks blamed
on Sikhs.

   The Pentagon acknowledged late Friday that the
Marine officer kidnapped in Lebanon earlier this week was a former
military aide to the secretary of defense.
   A spokesman dismissed suggestions, however, that the capture of
Lt. Col. William ``Rich'' Higgins posed any type of major security
risk to the United States.
   Higgins was the junior military assistant to Defense Secretary
Caspar W. Weinberger for two years, said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's
chief spokesman. Weinberger resigned Nov. 5 and was succeeded by
Frank Carlucci.
   As Weinberger's assistant from June 1985 to June 1987, Higgins
had access to and handled a variety of classified documents, but
was only one of 36 individuals ``who worked in the immediate office
of the secretary handling administrative work,'' Howard said.
   Higgins was kidnapped on Wednesday in Lebanon, where he was
assigned to temporary duty with the United Nations heading a group
of observers attached to the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization.
   Howard provided a statement to reporters late Friday after Radio
Free Lebanon broadcast a story in Arabic quoting unnamed Amal
Shiite Moslems as saying Higgins had ``an association with
Weinberger.''
   The spokesman said the Pentagon had played down Higgins'
background over the past two days because it did not want to
aggravate the situation surrounding his kidnapping.
   But the United States does not believe he was kidnapped because
he once worked for Weinberger, Howard said, nor were any
restrictions violated in allowing him to leave a post in the
defense secretary's office for another assignment in a country like
Lebanon.
   ``There was no restriction that was broken by his accepting this
assignment,'' Howard said. ``He (previously) handled paperwork and
other administrative duties.
   ``There are no restrictions on where middle-grade officers like
Lt. Col. Higgins can be assigned following Pentagon duty. His
understanding of political-military affairs and his administrative
abilities made him well suited for the (U.N.) position.
   Howard said that ``for the moment, we prefer to focus our
attention on his prompt and safe return, rather than on
unproductive speculation on how and why this particular individual
found himself in this predicament.''
   Asked then if the administration equated Higgins' disappearance
to the kidnapping of William Buckley several years ago, Howard
replied: ``No.''
   Buckley was the CIA station chief in Lebanon and was later
tortured and murdered by his kidnappers.
   Higgins, 43, is a native of Danville, Ky., whose wife and
daughter now live in northern Virginia. His wife, Robin, is a major
in the Marine Corps.
   A decorated combat veteran of Vietnam, Higgins has alternated
between field positions and staff jobs in Washington through most
of his career. After graduating from the Air Force Command and
Staff College in 1980, Higgins assumed a post in the plans division
at Marine Corps headquarters.
   In June 1981, he was transferred to the Pentagon and to the
second-level staff serving the secretary and deputy secretary of
defense. In 1982, he became the military assistant for interagency
matters under the Pentagon's executive secretary, meaning he was
responsible for coordinating Weinberger's meetings with other
Cabinet officials and the National Security Council.
   After leaving that post and graduating from the National War
College in 1985, Higgins became the junior military assistant on
Weinberger's personal staff.
   The secretary of defense normally has two such personal military
aides _ one an admiral or general and the other a lower-ranking
officer such as Higgins.
   Higgins remained in the job with Weinberger until June 1987,
when he assumed the U.N. assigment.

   President Reagan said Friday that Americans
will not be pulled out of the U.N. observer group in Lebanon
despite the threat of terrorism and the kidnapping of Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins.
   Reagan made his statement after Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci said in a television interview that U.S. officials were
studying whether Americans should be withdrawn from Lebanon because
of the abduction of Higgins by gunmen in southern Lebanon.
   The president said he was reluctant to answer questions during a
photo-taking session in the Oval Office, but that ``on this
particular subject, I feel I must straighten it out.''
   Denying that Americans would be pulled out, Reagan said, ``We
are going to meet our obligations to the United Nations.''
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon acknowledged Friday evening that Higgins
had been a military aide to the secretary of defense. A spokesman
dismissed suggestions that Higgins' capture posed a major security
risk to the United States, and said he did not believe Higgins'
capture had anything to do with the fact that he had been a junior
military assistant to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon spokesman, said Higgins ``handled
paperwork and other administrative duties'' for Weinberger from
June 1985 to June 1987. He said the administration did not equate
Higgins' capture to that of William Buckley several years ago.
Buckley was the CIA station chief in Lebanon when he was captured,
tortured and murdered by his kidnappers.
   The Pentagon provided a statement on Higgins' background after
Radio Free Lebanon broadcast a story quoting unnamed Amal Shiite
Moslems as saying Higgins had ``an association with Weinberger.''
   Fewer than 20 Americans are assigned to U.N. duties along the
Lebanese-Israeli border, according to the State Department.
   Reagan said U.N. forces had been in Lebanon since 1949. ``We're
very definitely a part of the United Nations.''
   Speaking about the threat of terrorism, the president said, ``Of
course we worry because we know that terrorists around the world
targeted us as one of their targets.''
   As reporters left the room, Reagan turned to his guest, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and said, ``They didn't ask the
question I wanted them to ask.'' Reagan indicated he wanted to
elaborate on his comment Thursday that he wanted to ``rescue''
Higgins.
   However, when reporters shouted a question about the ``rescue''
remark as the president left for a weekend at Camp David, he did
not respond.
   Administration officials already had clarified Reagan's remark,
saying he was referring to diplomatic efforts through the United
Nations and governments in the region. Reagan's comment to Kohl was
picked up by a boom microphone.
   Earlier in the day, Carlucci had said ``everything possible'' is
being done to secure the release of Higgins, the head of a 75-man,
multinational observer group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon.
   Higgins was abducted Wednesday in southern Lebanon.
   Asked on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show if other Americans assigned to
the effort would be withdrawn, Carlucci said: ``No decision has
been made. We are examining their security situation.''
   Carlucci said that while the Americans' safety is the
responsibility of the U.N., ``obviously we are concerned about our
people and will work with the U.N. on it.''
   Meanwhile, in Lebanon, a pro-Iranian group calling itself the
Oppressed of the Earth said it had kidnapped Higgins, and released
identity cards bearing his photograph.
   It claimed that Higgins was doing undercover work for the CIA.
However, the State Department has denied that Higgins had any links
with the CIA.
   The group said it would release Higgins following a complete
Israeli withdrawal from its security zone in south Lebanon. It also
demanded the release of an estimated 300 Lebanese and Palestinian
prisoners held in Khiam detention camp in south Lebanon and the
immediate cessation of U.S. activity in Lebanon.

   Sen. Bob Dole said Friday he is not shaken
by his loss in the New Hampshire presidential primary and will fare
well in South Dakota and Minnesota, adding ``we'll see who's
dispirited Wednesday morning next week.''
   Dole also predicted he would do well in the South on Super
Tuesday because many voters ``are last-minute Christmas shopping''
for a candidate.
   ``We would have liked to have won New Hampshire, but we didn't.
So you back off a couple of days and get charged up again,'' Dole
said.
   ``We're ready to go. We're ready for the next round in South
Dakota and Minnesota and we'll see who wins those two. We'll see
who's dispirited Wednesday morning next week.''
   The Bush campaign said Friday it was pulling out of South
Dakota, bowing to Dole's strength there.
   In Tampa, Fla., Dole said he decided 10 days ago to skip the
Friday night debate in Dallas, but he never tried to persuade
fellow Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson to do the
same.
   ``We decided one Houston was enough,'' Dole said of his own
decision during a news conference. In Houston, he said the audience
was stacked with backers of rival GOP candidate Vice President
George Bush.
   Dole denied news reports that he tried to persuade Robertson to
join him in dropping out of Friday night's debate in Dallas, which
Dole has criticized as being stacked in favor of Bush.
   Dole said he and Robertson recently had a 20-minute talk and a
couple of brief hallway encounters in New Hampshire while they were
snowbound at the same hotel.
   ``We talked about the campaign. That's about it,'' Dole said. He
denied a report that he tried to influence Robertson to skip Dallas
during one of the hallway meetings.
   ``I just gave him the facts,'' said Dole, adding that he told
Robertson of the ticket allocation, which he has said favors Bush.
   Dole said it appeared he would get 60 tickets out of some 2,600
available. ``It didn't seem fair to us and there'd be other
opportunities for debate,'' Dole said.
   Burl Osborne, editor of the Dallas Morning News, one of the
debate's sponsors, rejected as untrue Dole's complaint that his
campaign didn't get as many tickets to the event as Bush's forces
did.
   Osborne said Friday it appeared Dole and Robertson ``made their
decision together.'' He said he asked both camps to reconsider, but
Robertson said he would attend only if Dole did.
   Dole labeled as incorrect published reports that he and
Robertson were teaming up to try to stop Bush in the South.
   A somber sounding Dole brought his campaign to Florida,
stressing themes of leadership and issues. He refrained from
attacking Bush, a formidable foe in the Sunshine State where son,
Jeb Bush, is state commerce secretary and Gov. Bob Martinez, a
Democrat-turned Republican, has publicly stated his support for the
vice president.
   ``Obviously Florida is a big cog. It's very important to all of
us,'' the Kansas senator said of Super Tuesday, the March 8 primary
in 20 states, including 14 in the South.
   ``In Florida, we'll discuss issues, issues of concern to the
people,'' including deficit reduction, trade, agriculture, drugs,
Medicare and Social Security, Dole said.

   A pro-Iranian group Friday claimed
responsibility for kidnapping a U.S. Marine colonel serving with
U.N. peacekeeping forces and released identity cards bearing his
photograph.
   It alleged that Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was a spy for the
``Satanic CIA.'' U.S. and U.N. officials denied the charges.
   In a rescue attempt, Shiite Moslem militiamen spent a second day
searching citrus groves and cave-lined valleys for Higgins, who
disappeared Wednesday.
   The searchers, who belong to the Amal militia headed by Justice
Minister Nabih Berri, also seized six activists of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah in pre-dawn house raids in Tyre and
accused them of involvement in the plot.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was head of a 76-man United
Nations observer force in south Lebanon. About 15 of the observers
assigned to the force are Americans.
   Observers from the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization
work alongside the 5,800-strong United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon, deployed in 1978 at the Lebanon-Israel border.
   Gunmen abducted the colonel south of Tyre as he drove to UNIFIL
headquarters in the border town of Naqoura. U.N. officials
initially said that Higgins was violating U.N. rules for travel by
Americans.
   But a U.N. spokesman in New York said Friday that Higgins did
not violate travel restrictions.
   ``As all his predecessors, he traveled freely in the area
without escort,'' said Mario Zamorano, a spokesman for the U.N.
secretary-general.
   In Washington, President Reagan said the United States will not
withdraw Americans from the U.N. observer group in Lebanon despite
the abduction. Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
had said U.S. officials were studying a withdrawal plan.
   The reponsibility claim came in a typewritten Arabic statement
from the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth. It called Higgins
``one of the biggest spies planting daily terror in our land.''
   It alleged that Higgins used his oberver role as a cover for
espionage work.
   U.S. officials have denied that Higgins has links with the CIA,
and U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding echoed that denial
Friday in a news conference at Naqoura.
   ``We do not recruit spies. Everyone here works for the United
Nations,'' he said.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, acknowledged in
Washington Friday that Higgins for two years was junior military
assistant to then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. Howard
dismissed suggestions, however, that Higins' capture posed any
major security risk to the United States.
   He provided a statement to reporters after Radio Free Lebanon
broadcast a story in Arabic quoting unnamed individuals as saying
Higgins had an association with Weinberger.
   The Oppressed of the Earth said it would release Higgins
following a complete Israeli withdrawal from its security zone in
south Lebanon. It also demanded the release of an estimated 300
Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in the Israeli-supervised
Khiam detention camp in south Lebanon and the immediate cessation
of U.S. activity in Lebanon.
   The communique was delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut
along with photocopies of two identity cards, one in English and
one in Hebrew. Both carried a picture of Higgins and a signature.
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said the number on one of the cards
matched the number of a card that had been issued to Higgins by the
United Nations. Officials said Higgins had a Hebrew identity card
because U.N. forces often come into contact with Israeli troops.
   ``We have caught the throat of the American serpent, criminal
agent of the Satanic CIA,'' said the statement of the Shiite
extremist group.
   It was the second responsibility claim in two days, but it was
the first to be accompanied by any proof. The first came Thursday
in a call from a man claiming to speak for a previously unknown
group calling itself the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades.
   The Oppressed of the Earth is comprised of zealots loyal to
Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   It has claimed responsibility for hijackings, bombings and
kidnappings including the abduction of 12 Lebanese Jews in Moslem
west Beirut since 1984, eight of whom it said it killed.
   The group also claims responsibility for the June 1985 hijacking
of a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was slain.
   The Higgins abduction brings the number of foreign hostages in
Lebanon to 25, including nine Americans. Most are believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite extremists, whose main Hezbollah militia has
been challenging Amal's dominance in south Lebanon.
   Amal militiamen sealed off a 300-square-mile area around Tyre to
block escape routes for the captors.
   ``We have done everything possible to prevent the kidnappers
from moving Col. Higgins around,'' Goulding said at the Naqoura
news conference.
   Higgins was the first American whose abduction was claimed by
the Oppressed on Earth and the third U.N. official to be abducted
in south Lebanon in two weeks.
   A Swede and a Norwegian serving with the U.N. Relief and Works
Agency that cares for Palestinian refugees were kidnapped near the
south Lebanon city of Sidon on Feb. 5.
   Their alleged captors have released two statements in which they
accused the two Scandinavians of espionage activities. UNRWA has
blamed their abduction on Palestinians acting without political
motivation or links to any organization.

   The AFL-CIO called Friday on Honduras
to deny use of its territory to Nicaraguan Contra rebels and said
it wants an investigation of allegations that high-ranking Honduran
military officers are involved in drug trafficking.
   In an intensely negotiated statement on Central America, the
U.S. labor federation also condemned what it called the Nicaraguan
government's continued political imprisonment of 16 trade union
leaders.
   After supporting the withdrawal of U.S. military aid to the
Contras for the first time at its convention in October, the
AFL-CIO said it is time to exert increased public pressure for
ending Soviet and Cuban military aid to Nicaragua.
   As usual, foreign policy issues proved to be the most
contentious among the labor leaders at the meeting of the AFL-CIO
executive council.
   Jack Sheinkman, president of the 300,000-member Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union, wanted the AFL-CIO to call on
President Reagan to undertake negotiations with the Soviet Union on
withdrawal of all outside military involvement in Central America.
   The AFL-CIO council overwhelmingly rejected Sheinkman's
proposal, but it did include his language in a four-page policy
statement noting that the Sandinista government has ``belatedly
ended its state of siege'' in Nicaragua.
   Earlier this week, the federation criticized ``the use of
excessive force'' by Israeli military forces against Palestinian
civilians over the past two months in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But at a reception Thursday night hosted by Israeli trade
unions, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland complained that the
criticism _ the first ever by the federation of Israeli actions in
the Middle East _ had been misinterpreted as a condemnation of
Israel itself.
   He called the federation's statement ``one of the strongest
reaffirmations of AFL-CIO support for the democratic state of
Israel ... that we have ever made.''

   A trader implicated in Wall Street's
insider-trading scandal was accused Friday of plotting to shoot
financier Ivan Boesky and charged with weapons possession and
trying to intimidate a government witness.
   John A. Mulheren, a general partner in the firm Jamie Securities
Co., was arrested near his Rumson, N.J., home Thursday in
possession of an Israeli-made semiautomatic rifle, said Monmouth
County Assistant Prosecutor Alton Kenney.
   The loaded rifle and Army fatigue-type clothing were found in
his car, authorities said.
   Mulheren was ordered held at Monmouth County Jail on $17,500
bond Friday on charges of illegal weapons possession.
   A complaint filed against Mulheren alleged the weapon was to be
used ``against the person or property'' of Boesky, who is at the
center of an insider-trading scandal that has shaken the financial
world.
   The complaint also mentioned a possible attack against Michael
Davidoff, a former head trader for Boesky who is cooperating in an
investigation of the financial scandal.
   Authorities declined to say why they believed Mulheren was
plotting against Boesky and Davidoff. Mulheren once was a close
associate of Boesky and has been implicated in the government's
investigation of Wall Street corruption.
   In September, the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified
sources as saying Mulheren was cooperating with the government as a
result of Boesky's disclosures. It said the investigation could
lead to charges against Mulheren.
   Meanwhile in New York City, federal prosecutors charged Mulheren
with attempting to intimidate a government witness formerly
employed by Boesky.
   The witness was identified in court papers only as ``Witness
X.'' Prosecutors refused to say whether the witness is Davidoff.
   The complaint quoted Mulheren's wife as telling police he had
been ``extremely upset by the Boesky situation'' and ``was armed
and was going to get'' the witness.
   Kenney said police went to Mulheren's home Thursday and seized a
9mm pistol, a .357-caliber Magnum revolver and a shotgun from the
family car, but Mulheren was not arrested then because he was
licensed for the weapons.
   In April, Boesky pleaded guilty to a criminal charge in the
insider-trading scandal and was sentenced in December to three
years in prison. He is scheduled to begin serving the sentence next
month.
   His whereabouts were not immediately known Friday. His attorney,
Harvey Pitt, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Fred M. Stone, a lawyer for Jamie, said the company's partners
are discussing possible action as a result of Mulheren's arrest.
   Stone also released a statement from Mulheren's attorney Otto
Obermaier, who said: ``It is known that John Mulheren has been
upset by the investigation by regulatory authorities of securities
activities and by the rumors and publicity which developed which he
felt unfairly impugned his honesty and integrity.
   ``The important thing now is for him to get help and support to
permit him to resume a normal and constructive life. He is in the
process of seeking required medical assistance.''

   The United States and the four other
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council tentatively agreed
on a draft working paper calling for an arms embargo of Iran,
sources said Friday.
   The diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
called the draft a significant step toward an embargo sought by the
United States and other Western nations.
   Both Iran and Iraq, at war since September 1980, depend on arms
imports.
   The Soviet Union and China have been reluctant to implement an
embargo before further diplomatic efforts by U.N Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz is expected to discuss
the proposed embargo when he goes to Moscow on Sunday.
   The sources said the draft resolution may be the subject of long
negotiations before the 15 council members come to any agreement.
   ``It is a `nonpaper' on which the five will continue to work and
on which the opinions of the other 10 members are welcome,'' one
source said.
   The sources said the council was expected to discuss whether to
identify Iran by name and whether to mention an international naval
peacekeeping force in the Persian Gulf, as proposed by the Soviet
Union.
   The sources said the ``big five'' agreed Thursday on the working
paper calling for an arms embargo against Iran. The paper was
distributed Friday to the other 10 council members, the sources
said.
   The five permanent members are the United States, Britain,
China, France and the Soviet Union. The other 10 are Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal, West Germany, Senegal,
Yugoslavia and Zambia.
   The United States is president of the Security Council this
month.
   The specific contents of the working paper were not known, but
it was based on a British proposal for a two-year arms embargo
against Iran unless that country makes peace with Iraq.
   The British proposal would have the Security Council order all
nations to stop supplying war materiel and military training to
Iran and cancel military contracts.
   On July 20 the Security Council adopted Resolution 598,
demanding an immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, a troop
withdrawal, prisoner exchange and other measures. It also called
for enforcement steps if either party did not comply.
   Iraq has said it accepts the resolution as written. But Iran has
sought to rearrange various elements in it and to brand Iraq the
aggressor.
   Despite the secretary-general's consultations with both sides
and his mission to the gulf in September, the Security Council
initiative has foundered.
   The Soviet Union and other nations that seek better ties with
Iran have been reluctant to push for punitive enforcement and to
offend the Tehran government.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and several European nations
have naval fleets in the Persian Gulf to protect their shipping
from attacks related to the war.
   Iran raids third-country ships to retaliate for Iraqi attacks on
its oil targets. Iran focuses its raids on ships linked to Kuwait
or other gulf Arab countries that it accuses of aiding iraq.

<TEXT>
   A man who was briefly jailed on
suspicion of rape but never charged was libeled by a newspaper that
reported his arrest, a jury found Friday in ordering the paper to
pay him $1 million.
   The verdict against the Battle Creek Enquirer came under a new
standard for libel set by Michigan's Supreme Court.
   ``I'm just so happy. It's been a long time coming,'' said the
plaintiff, David Rouch, 52. ``I just know it's going to help other
people, too.''
   The six-member Calhoun County jury deliberated nearly four hours
over two days before returning the verdict. Rouch, a mechanic for a
cereal company, had sought $500,000.
   The newspaper, which is owned by the Gannett Co., will appeal,
said Robert Bernius, attorney for the Battle Creek Enquirer.
   The suit claimed Rouch suffered humiliation, emotional distress
and damage to his reputation because the newspaper reported his
1979 arrest on suspicion of raping a 17-year-old baby sitter.
   The suit initially sought $1 million, but Judge Stephen Miller
on Thursday threw out the half of the suit asking for punitive
damages, which he said could not be awarded because Rouch had
failed to prove the paper acted with malice.
   But Rouch was able to seek actual damages under a new standard
for libel set by Michigan's Supreme Court, which ordered the case
to trial.
   The high court said libel could be found in cases in which a
publication was negligent, or in which it failed to exercise
reasonable care in publishing information.
   That ruling set aside an earlier standard that said the
information, to be libelous, had to be published with malice, or
with knowledge of its falsity.
   After his arrest in 1979, Rouch spent about seven hours in jail,
then was released on personal recognizance bond and ordered to
appear for arraignment, or formal charging.
   The case against against went no further, and police four months
later arrested and charged another man. Charges against the second
man later were dismissed.
   The newspaper printed a retraction one year later after
receiving complaints from Rouch and his attorney.
   Rouch wiped his eyes after the verdict was read and rushed to a
telephone to call his son with the news.
   ``About this retraction, if they had printed it three or four
days later, I wouldn't have sued,'' Rouch said at a tavern where he
celebrated with friends. ``I wouldn't have done anything.''
   Bernius and newspaper publisher Robert Miller Jr. declined
comment beyond saying there would be an appeal.

   A teen-ager was charged Friday in the ax
slayings of his parents, a brother and sister as friends puzzled
over the change in the studious, churchgoing boy who gave himself a
punk haircut the day of the killings.
   David Brom, 16, who had shaved the sides of his head and
fashioned his hair into a spiked style, was arrested after an
all-night manhunt.
   ``There's a lot of tears here,'' said Mike Leahy, principal at
Lourdes High School, where Brom was a sophomore. ``There is
surprise, shock and disbelief. ... It may subside for a short
while, but it will return.''
   Brom appeared calm during a 15-minute arraignment in which he
was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and eight
counts of second-degree murder. The charges allege different
degrees of premeditation or intent. He did not enter a plea.
   County Attorney Raymond Schmitz said the boy was ordered to
undergo psychiatric examination and was being held under a 24-hour
watch at the Olmsted County jail.
   According to the complaint, ``One person indicated that on Feb.
17, David Brom said he was going to kill his parents that night,
and another person indicated that she had a telephone conversation
with David Brom on Feb. 18 during which he told her he had killed
his parents.''
   ``No one knew except the friends he told, and they didn't tell
anyone,'' said Charles Von Wald, Olmsted County sheriff. A rumor
about the killings finally reached teachers at Brom's school, and
they notified authorities.
   The bodies of Bernard Brom, 41, his wife, Paulette, about 40,
and children Diane, 14, and Rick, 9, were found in their
nightclothes Thursday evening at their home in suburban Cascade
Township, Von Wald said.
   The four were believed to have been slain early Thursday
morning, he said. A bloody, 28-inch ax was found in the basement.
   Another 16-year-old who spoke with Brom hours before the bodies
were found told authorities there had been a dispute between the
boy and his father.
   ``He indicated he was having some trouble with his parents,''
Von Wald said. ``One student said he was having trouble with his
dad because of a tape he had bought, and he didn't want him
listening to it.''
   Von Wald and police officials declined to say what the tape
contained or whether it had been seized by authorities.
   The killings cast a pall over this southwestern Minnesota city
of 60,000, which prides itself on being the home of the Mayo Clinic
and on its highly educated population.
   Classmates wept at a Mass at the Roman Catholic school, and
neighbors said they had no reason to believe the family was
anything but close-knit and loving. About 20 students attended the
hearing and tried to hand the boy notes of support.
   ``There's no indication there was any difficulty in the
family,'' said the Rev. Syl Brown of the Pax Christi Roman Catholic
Church. ``It's an exemplary family ... very active in every aspect
of the parish. It's a mystery to me.''
   Brom attended church every week, he said.
   Added Von Wald: ``He babysat for the neighbors, and recently
babysat for another neighbor.''
   Each victim had been hit in the head at least once, the sheriff
said. Bernard and Rick Brom's bodies were found in their upstairs
bedrooms, and Paulette and Diane Brom's bodies in an upstairs
hallway, the sheriff said.
   ``We believe the father and son were probably surprised and
didn't have a chance to defend themselves,'' Von Wald said. ``We
believe the mother and daughter were going to investigate and were
confronted.''
   Richard O'Dell, a neighbor, recounted how Brom had shoveled his
driveway two weeks ago during a heavy snowstorm. ``He was a very
pleasant fellow. He always had a smile,'' O'Dell told the Rochester
Post-Bulletin.
   Police were called to the house about 5:30 p.m. on a tip from an
unidentified school official. After a nightlong search, Brom was
apprehended at a post office.
   The boy had purchased a wig and makeup, possibly for use as a
disguise, Von Wald said.
   Authorities have talked with another son, Joseph, 19, who does
not live at home, ``and are satisfied he was not involved,'' Von
Wald said.

   The Pentagon on Friday released videotape and
still photographs of last week's incident in which two Navy
warships were deliberately bumped by Soviet vessels in the Black
Sea.
   The photographs document the Pentagon's assertion the destroyer
USS Caron and cruiser USS Yorktown were hit on purpose by the
Soviet ships.
   Indeed, the videotape shows the Yorktown was bumped not once as
originally reported, but twice as it steamed on a straight course.
   The Feb. 12 confrontation occurred off the Soviet Union's Crimea
peninsula after the two Navy vessels were ordered to assert their
international navigation rights by sailing within 12 miles of the
Soviet coast.
   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territorial
limit, the Soviet Union claims a 12-mile limit along its coast. The
United States insists that any country claiming 12 miles must still
allow for ``innocent passage'' by foreign ships through waters
beyond three miles.
   The Soviets have charged the Navy warships provoked the incident
by ignoring warnings to move beyond 12 miles and by maneuvering
dangerously around their ships.
   The videotape does not show the American vessels maneuvering at
all, but rather the two Soviet ships approaching them on an angle
and then moving in for the collision.
   In the footage shot aboard the Yorktown, American sailors can be
heard in the background swearing and yelling, ``He's going to hit''
and ``Brace, brace.''
   While only minor damage was caused, the first collision between
the Yorktown and a Soviet frigate was sufficiently strong that the
cameraman lost control of his camera.

   Rene Char, called ``the greatest French poet of the
20th century'' by Premier Jacques Chirac, died in Paris Friday,
according to the publishing company Gallimard. He was 80.
   Gallimard said he died at the military hospital of Val-de-Grace.
It did not disclose the cause of death.
   Among Char's most famous poems are ``Hammer Without a Master,''
written in 1934, and ``Return Uphill,'' written in 1966.
   ``Hammer Without a Master'' was later set to music by Pierre
Boulez.
   Char also wrote criticism and plays for nearly half a century.
   ``Rene Char was without doubt the greatest French poet of the
20th century,'' Chirac said in a statement.
   Char is to be buried Tuesday in Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, the
Provencal village where he was born on June 14, 1907.
   His poetry borrowed imagery from nature and from his childhood
in southern France.
   After completing his education at the university in
Aix-en-Provence, he moved to Paris where he became friendly with
the Surrealists Andre Breton and Paul Eluard.
   Char also was friends with the artists Pablo Picasso, Georges
Braque and Nicolas de Stael.
   He fought against the forces of rebel General Francisco Franco
in the Spanish Civil War and led a Resistance unit in the French
Alps during World War II under the nom de guerre ``Captain
Alexander.''
   He was later awarded the Medal of the Resistance and the Croix
de Guerre and was named to the Legion of Honor.
   In 1945, Char moved to the Luberon mountains, not far from his
birthplace.
   ``In our darkness, there is not a place for beauty,'' he once
said. ``Every place is for beauty.''

   Vice President George Bush suggested Friday that GOP
presidential rival Bob Dole was ``angry and bitter'' over his loss
in New Hampshire but Dole countered ``we'll see who's dispirited''
after Tuesday's Midwestern contests. Democratic National Chairman
Paul Kirk told his squabbling presidential candidates to cool it.
   The Democratic candidates save Sen. Albert Gore Jr. debated in
St. Paul, Minn., ahead of the South Dakota primary and Minnesota
caucuses, while the Republicans debated over a debate that dwindled
to just two candidates.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
drew fire from their Democratic presidential rivals in the
free-wheeling debate that indicated their status following wins in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
   At the Republican debate in Dallas, reduced to a one-on-one
event by the refusal of Dole and Pat Robertson to participate, both
Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp said they regretted the boycott and said it
would hurt their opponents.
   Bush and Kemp clashed bitterly over nuclear defense strategy, as
Bush asserted the New York congressman won't understand war until
``you've seen your fellow man drop dead.''
   In Oklahoma City earlier, Bush suggested that Dole was brooding
over New Hampshire.
   ``You learn that the rodeo is full of hard encounters with the
ground and you learn to pick yourself up and dust yourself off and
get back on the horse again,'' Bush said.
   ``So you don't get angry and bitter when you get defeated. You
pick yourself back up and get back on the horse and go on and win
the next election.''
   But in Lexington, Ky., Dole shrugged off Bush.
   ``We're ready to go. We're ready for the next round in South
Dakota and Minnesota and we'll see who wins those two. We'll see
who's dispirited Wednesday morning next week,'' he said.
   With only a few days to go, a Bush aide said the campaign was
``pulling out'' of South Dakota.
   ``We're going to concentrate our resources on the South. And
Dole got an enormous bump from Iowa,'' said the aide, who did not
want to be identified.
   Gore skipped the Democratic debate to make a money run to
California, where he took a question about which of his rivals were
Democratic deadwood.
   ``Mike Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Dick Gephardt _ all three
represent an old approach that has been associated with losing four
out of the last five elections,'' he said.
   And rival Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois reversed his earlier
statement that he could not continue his campaign unless he won
either South Dakota or Minnesota next week.
   ``I'm in this race until Atlanta,'' Simon said first in Sioux
Falls, S.D., then in Minneapolis. ``And we're going to begin with
the strongest show of support we can muster from committed
Democrats in South Dakota and Minnesota who seek a fundamental
change in America's direction.''
   After watching Republican bickering from afar, Kirk wrote a
``Dear Candidate'' letter that said, ``I simply want to urge all
our candidates to resist any ... kind of negative personal attacks
that smack of desperation and do nothing to enhance the opportunity
for a Democratic victory in November.'' The letter was written
Thursday _ just hours before the Democratic candidates fought out
their Dallas debate.
   With the letter in the mail, longshot candidate Gary Hart made
it clear he hopes for a brokered convention, which would be Kirk's
worst nightmare.
   ``It will be for the convention to decide,'' Hart said in
Minneapolis. ``There is the chance now, for the first time in 30 or
40 years, for a convention to decide this nomination.''
   The Democrats focused on Midwestern voters, hoping that good
showings in Tuesday's South Dakota primary or Minnesota caucuses
would serve as an image and momentum booster.
   Jesse Jackson drew hoots from the crowd during the Democratic
debate when he asked Gephardt if he was ``proud of your vote for
the Reagan tax cut in 1981.''
   The Missouri congressman defended his overall tax voting record,
saying most of that tax cut ``went to ordinary people.''
   ``That was the trigger of this whole deficit crisis,'' Jackson
said.
   Dukakis, the winner of the New Hampshire primary, complained
that ``my name was taken in vain'' by Hart, who demanded to know
why Dukakis had not followed his example and released a budget
proposal.
   ``The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is because
they don't want to tell the American people the facts,'' Hart said.
   ``I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced a
budget,'' retorted Dukakis.
   On the Republican side, Friday night's Dallas debate dwindled to
a cozy twosome between Bush and Kemp. The Bush campaign considered
standing up the Dallas crowd but decided to go through with it. For
his part, Kemp openly relished the opportunity of a one-on-one with
Bush.
   ``They couldn't get me out of here with a crowbar,'' he said.
   In an exchange over the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty
and other arms issues, Bush pointed out that Kemp opposes the INF
treaty and said it would be wrong to support ``premature
development'' of a defense shield. ``I want to reach out for peace,
and I'm sorry, but I think it is good to be doing that,'' Bush said.
   Kemp told Bush, ``you have yet to mention how important it is
for this country to stand up for something other than peace.''
   The vice president shot back: ``I was in combat (during World
War II). I don't think you know what it is until you've seen your
fellow man drop dead.''
   Dole, campaigning in Tampa, Fla., denied he had collaborated
with Robertson to boycott the Dallas debate. Dole said he didn't
want to be part of a Bush ``pep rally'' in a state where the vice
president once lived and was elected tothe U.S. House.
   Bush, on the campaign trail in Oklahoma City, denied Dole's
assertion that the Dallas event would be stacked against Dole
because more tickets were given to Bush supporters.
   In Nevada, Bush took the lead in a presidential straw poll
tallied in the early morning hours, with 27 percent of the vote.
   But Robertson backers claimed a delegate victory by combining
undecided ballots (23 percent) and votes for their candidate (15
percent).
   Dole had 22 percent and Kemp was the choice of 13 percent.
   Steve Wark, Robertson coordinator in Nevada, claimed most of the
undecided votes, saying they were cast by Robertson supporters as
part of a strategy to keep Bush and Dole guessing until upcoming
county conventions.

   The second blast of fierce Santa Ana winds in
a week raked southern California, felling trees that killed a
child, downing dozens of power lines and fanning fires that left 56
people homeless Friday.
   Damage to campuses and danger from flying debris forced a school
district to cancel classes for 20,000 students, and the Coast Guard
searched the stormy ocean for a missing yachtsman.
   The latest blast of high wind hit late Thursday and before dawn
Friday and reached 70 mph at Monument Peak in San Diego County,
where Interstate 8 was temporarily closed, and 50 mph at Ontario
International Airport, the National Weather Service said.
   However, high wind warnings were canceled when the
wind-generating high pressure system over Nevada and Utah weakened.
The wind whistling over the mountains, deserts and coastal canyons
was expected to end by Saturday morning.
   Santa Ana winds are caused by high pressure areas over Utah and
Nevada which send air flowing down into California. Although they
are commonly associated with insufferable summer heat, Santa Anas
are very common in February, said weather service forecaster Bob
Grebe.
   The death toll for the week's winds reached five late Thursday
when gusts up to 60 mph hit Yosemite National Park, knocking down a
180-foot ponderosa pine that crushed 9-year-old Jasmine Bitts of
Garden Grove, Calif., when it fell on a cabin. The girl's mother
and a companion suffered minor injuries.
   Hundreds of campers were ordered from the area, but it was
reopened by midmorning, said park spokeswoman Lisa Dapprich.
   Twenty trees fell in the area, damaging five cabins and a number
of vehicles, she said.
   Thirty utility poles toppled in the morning in San Bernardino
County, blacking out 6,300 Southern California Edison customers in
the Rialto area, said spokeswoman Pat Messigian. The Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power reported 28,000 customers with
outages. In all, 112,000 customers lost power at one time or
another.
   SoCal Edison area manager Ray Gonzalez estimated gusts ranged
from 80 mph to 90 mph where the poles were downed. He said he came
across 22 downed poles on his way to work and saw other poles fall
when he went out on a survey.
   ``I heard a snap, looked behind me and noticed that six poles
just fell down,'' he said. No one was hurt.
   Offshore, Coast Guard aircraft and a cutter searched for Chris
Dodd, 28, of Los Altos, who was reported overdue Thursday. His
30-foot boat failed to show up Wednesday in San Pedro after setting
sail from Santa Catalina Island in high seas, said Petty Officer
James McPherson.
   The Fontana school district, below the San Gabriel Mountains 50
miles east of Los Angeles, gave 20,100 students the day off Friday
because of the wind, said Carl Coleman, a district planning
official.
   One school had roof damage and gusts destroyed covered walkways
at a high school, he said.
   In Los Angeles, six people were injured when an unfinished
apartment building caught fire shortly after midnight and
wind-swept embers spread the blaze to a 10-unit apartment complex
and four other structures.
   Twenty-four people were left homeless. Damage was put at
$345,000.
   In East Los Angeles, an early morning fire in a commercial
building spread to three houses before firefighters doused it, said
Los Angeles County fire spokesman Bob Haskell.
   Twenty-three people were left homeless by that fire, which was
caused when wind-blown electrical wires touched and created a short
circuit over a roofing company, sending sparks onto two propane
tanks. Damage was estimated at $500,000.
   Another fire in the Mount Washington area forced nine people
from their homes.
   Fallen power lines set a home ablaze in suburban La Canada
Flintridge but firefighters stopped the flames from spreading. A
family of four was treated for smoke inhalation.
   ``We were lucky. It could have been a major disaster,'' said
fire Battalion Chief Frank Reavis.
   Earlier in the week, the high wind caused four deaths.
   One man was electrocuted when a power line blew down and the
other three were killed in a highway accident triggered when a
truck buffeted by wind slewed off a highway and into two stopped
cars.
   An estimated 500,000 utility customers lost power during
Wednesday's wind.

   U.S. Air Force fighters intercepted two Soviet
bombers off the east coast of Canada on Friday evening, according
to a brief statement issued by the Canadian Department of National
Defense.
   NORAD, the North American Air Defense Command, detected the
long-range Tupolev Bears by radar when they entered the Canadian
Air Defense Identification Zone without notification, the
department said.
   The incident marks the fifth time this year that Soviet military
aircraft have been intercepted. The interception was under
operational control of the Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters in
North Bay, Ontario, the statement said.
   Interceptor aircraft stand on 24-hour alert to be scrambled
within five minutes if an incoming aircraft is detected by radar
and cannot be correlated with a flight plan.
   The interceptor force carries out the NORAD task of controlling
access to sovereign Canadian and U.S. airspace in peacetime and, in
the event of hostilities, would provide defense against an attack
on North America from bombers and cruise missiles.
   NORAD, based in Cheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs, Colo.,
controls Canadian and American air defense.

   Republican presidential candidates George Bush and
Jack Kemp clashed bitterly over nuclear defense strategy Friday
night, as Bush asserted the New York congressman won't understand
war until ``you've seen your fellow man drop dead.''
   At the outset of the debate, reduced to a one-on-one event when
Sen. Bob Dole and Pat Robertson canceled a day earlier, both Bush
and Kemp said they regretted the boycott and said it would hurt
their opponents.
   ``I think they made a big mistake,'' Bush said. ``I'm
disappointed they're not here.''
   Kemp, who has finished far behind Bush and Dole in the Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primaries, drew laughter from the
audience when he said, ``I'm glad to see the race coming down to a
two-man race.''
   A former professional football quarterback, he referred to
comments by Dole and Robertson that they feared the audience would
be weighted heavily in favor of Bush, who claims Texas as one of
his homes.
   ``I have played a lot of stadiums (where) I didn't particularly
appreciate the response,'' Kemp said. ``But if you're competitive
you play where the action is.''
   As the two debated, Robertson was holding a rally with
supporters at the same posh Dallas hotel where Bush and his
entourage were staying. Dole returned to Washington from a campaign
trip.
   Bush, his presidential candidacy revived last week with a
victory in New Hampshire, portrayed himself as loyal to President
Reagan on numerous questions. But in their close, it was Kemp who
sought to snatch the mantle of Ronald Reagan.
   ``I believe in the Reagan revolution and I want to carry it into
the 1990s,'' he said.
   He made a similar statement during the testy exchange on nuclear
defenses, prompting Bush to snap back, ``Then why don't you support
the INF (intermediate nuclear force) treaty?''
   Kemp came to the debate seeming to relish the opportunity to
confront Bush without his other rivals on national television.
   He took the offensive when a question was raised about creation
of a ``limited missile defense'' instead of the wide-ranging
Strategic Defense Initiative now being pursued as a nuclear defense.
   ``I'd build one if the SDI research ended up suggesting we could
have a sound, perfected defense,'' the vice president replied.
   There exchange grew more intense as Bush said the Joint Chiefs
of Staff would oppose a more limited defense system and that the
administration was trying to produce ``an impenetrable nuclear
shield.''
   Kemp shot back that the Soviet Union has ``already broken out
of'' the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty and said, ``I strongly
differ with the vice president on this issue. ... If elected
president, I would research, test and develop a nuclear missile
defense.''
   Bush said it would be wrong to support ``premature development''
of a defense shield.
   ``I want to reach out for peace, and I'm sorry, but I think it
is good to be doing that,'' Bush said.
   Bush's reference to his World War II record came after Kemp
asserted that the country must ``stand up for something'' beyond
peace alone.
   The vice president shot back: ``I was in combat. I don't think
you know what it is until you've seen your fellow man drop dead.''
   Kemp snapped: ``I don't need a lecture.''
   The absent Dole and Robertson came in for criticism too. Kemp,
at the invitation of a questioner, said Dole had supported ``five
major tax increases.''
   Kemp displayed mock outrage when asked about the discussions
Dole and Robertson held before both pulled out of the debate.
   ``I would be shocked if there was an alliance between Bob Dole
and Pat Robertson,'' Kemp said.
   His comments had a touch of irony because he for a time had an
alliance with Robertson to try to stop Bush in Michigan's
complicated delegate-selection system.
   Dole pulled out of the debate saying he feared it would become a
pep rally for Bush.
   Robertson, the former television preacher who finished second
ahead of Bush in Iowa but trailed badly in New Hampshire, followed
Dole in pulling out. His aides said they thought the event was
stacked in Bush's favor.
   The result was a rare and unexpected opportunity for Kemp to
share the stage with only Bush in an event televised nationally on
selected public broadcasting stations. The debate was held on the
Southern Methodist University campus.
   Kemp has sought to establish himself as the conservative
alternative to Bush and Dole. But he finished a distant fourth in
Iowa's caucuses and third, with 13 percent of the vote, in New
Hampshire.
   Across town, Robertson attended a rally with 1,200 supporters
and told them, ``There was a debate tonight and we understood they
weren't going to give our supporters but 60 tickets to sit up in
the balcony, and I wasn't about to go because you needed to be
represented and I'd rather be with you here.''
   Earlier in the day Dole denied the assertion of the debate's
sponsors that he had tried to persuade Robertson to join him in
dropping out of the debate. He acknowledged discussing it with
Robertson while in New Hampshire, however.
   ``I just gave him the facts,'' said Dole.
   Burl Osborne, editor of the Dallas Morning News, one of the
debate's sponsors, rejected as untrue Dole's complaint that his
campaign didn't get as many tickets to the event as Bush's forces
did.
   Osborne said after talking with Robertson Friday that it
appeared Dole and Robertson made their decision ``in concert.''
   ``The only assumption that I can make is Dole has written Texas
off,'' Osborne said.
   The fifth GOP candidate dropped out of the presidential race a
day before the debate, former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware.

   A Soviet rocket failed after its launch and
destroyed three satellites, and U.S. defense officials said Friday
the accident sent large chunks of debris hurtling to Earth.
   The official Tass news agency, in a rare report of mishap in the
Soviets' commercial space program, gave few details of the
accident. The untimely release of the satellites suggests the
unmanned Proton rocket exploded.
   Tass said in its dispatch Thursday that the destroyed satellites
_ named Cosmos 1917, 1918 and 1919 _ were designed to test elements
and equipment of a space navigation system.
   Kremlin officials have touted the Soviet space program as a
reliable means of deploying weather and navigation equipment for
foreign organizations in the wake of similar failures in the U.S.
space program.
   In Colorado Springs, Colo., U.S. Space Command officials said
debris believed to be from the blast landed off Australia and
somewhere between Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
   The largest chunk, believed to be the fourth stage and payload,
re-entered the earth's atmosphere Friday afternoon between Saudi
Arabia and Turkey, said spokesman Cmdr. Dugald Gillies.
   It was not known whether any of that debris, estimated to
measure about 100 square feet, actually hit the earth's surface,
said Gillies.
   Bob Hollie, another Space Command spokesman, said the portion of
rocket that landed near Australia measured about 72 square feet.
   ``We do have another piece up there but it is significantly
smaller and still orbiting with no predicted re-entry time. It is
maybe a meter (yard) by a meter'' in size, said Hollie.
   Tass said the Proton rocket was launched Wednesday, ``but
because of a malfunction in this unit the sputniks could not be
placed on the required orbit.''
   Tass said the rocket placed the separation unit holding the
satellites on an interim orbit, but the system then malfunctioned
and the satellites fell from orbit.
   ``On February 18 the sputniks entered dense layers of the
atmosphere and ceased their existence,'' it said.
   Soviet rockets each year carry dozens of satellites into orbit
for national use and for foreign contractors, primarily from
Kremlin-allied nations.
   Tass announced last August that a 10-ton satellite had failed to
reach orbit. The report apparently was the first time Soviets
announced beforehand that one of its satellites was dropping from
orbit.
   That satellite fell into the ocean without causing any damage or
injuries.

only the second since the Civil War to be drummed out of Congress

officers will patrol Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods around the
clock to head off Arab riots.
   National Police Commissioner David Krauss said the operation
aims to curb an anticipated new wave of unrest linked to the visit
of U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who is scheduled to
leave for the Middle East next Wednesday.

``detectable'' _ though virtually harmless _ contamination had been

reinforcements moved into Jerusalem.
   No deaths or serious injuries were reported during clashes in

<HEAD>Eli Wallach _ The Consummate Professional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS F. McELROY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Wallach has deemed Barbra Streisand nuts.
   Not exactly. But as Dr. Herbert A. Morrison in the movie,
``Nuts,'' Wallach portrays a psychiatrist who is truly convinced
that Claudia Draper, a former call girl accused of murder, is
insane and therefore must be locked away. Streisand, as Draper,
believes otherwise.
   ``As a heavy I am not well liked in the movie,'' Wallach said.
``But I approached the character with the conviction that he is a
professional and he made this diagnosis based on years of
experience. The more this girl rants and raves, the more I am
convinced of my diagnosis.''
   The consummate professional, Wallach has brought to the screen
more than 40 years of acting experience.
   ``You know, originally I prepared for a teaching career, but due
to several circumstances I missed the exam,'' he said. ``So I
decided to do what I most wanted to do and that was to act.''
   He began his career with a scholarship to the Neighborhood
Playhouse in New York and made his first appearance in the Equity
Library production of Tennessee Williams' ``This Property Is
Condemned.''
   This became an important turning point in Wallach's life, for
the only other performer in the show happened to be the actress,
Anne Jackson, who later became his wife.
   Wallach made his Broadway debut in 1945 in ``Skydrift'' a
short-lived production. But soon thereafter, he was cast in the
Broadway production of ``Mister Roberts,'' which starred Henry
Fonda and ran for two years.
   He then went on to receive a Tony award for Tennesse Williams'
``The Rose Tattoo.''
   ``It's a shame that shows have become so expensive here in New
York, because we would have less problems if everybody were able to
go to the theater _ rich, poor, black, white, minorities _
everbody,'' he said.
   ``Theater is not a luxury but a necessity, for theater helps
people understand the human condition.''
   This belief in the power of theater to reach out to people has
led Wallach through many plays in his long career, including
``Camino Real,'' ``Henry VIII,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' ``Waltz
of the Toreadors,'' ``Luv'' and ``The Teahouse of the August Moon.''
   Wallach's movie career began with Elia Kazan's debut as a
director in ``Baby Doll'' in 1956, for which he won Britain's
highest film acting honor.
   ``I used to sneer at the screen,'' Wallach said, ``then I
realized how hard it is.
   ``A movie has many layers _ the director wheels the baton and I
play the instrument. Although it's a lot of hard work, I have fun
and that's important.
   ``Let me tell you this,'' he continued. ``The most important
things in life are the right partner and your work. If you find a
lifelong partner and you love your work, you are a most fortunate
person.''
   The 72-year-old Wallach has indeed been fortunate. He and
Jackson have raised two daughters and a son. He has also appeared
in aproximately 50 motion pictures since ``Baby Doll.'' He is most
recognized for his role in the spaghetti Western, ``The Good, the
Bad and the Ugly.''
   ``People all over the world still come up to me on the streets
and mention that movie with Clint Eastwood,'' he said.
   His other films include ``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The
Misfits,'' ``How the West Was Won,'' ``Cinderella Liberty,'' ``The
Deep'' and ``Tough Guys.''
   His most recent TV appearances include ``The Executioner's
Song'' and an HBO movie, ``The Impossible Spy.''
   Even though he's busy with films and television _ he's also the
sponsor for Toyota Trucks _ he still manages to keep one foot in
the theater.
   ``I am like a farmer who rotates his crops, I always allocate a
certain period of my time to go back to my roots _ the theater.''

<HEAD>Half Century After Famed Flight, Beryl Markham's A Heroine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She soared west across the Atlantic on a
celebrated dare 52 years ago, and then fell into obscurity.
   But decades after flyer Beryl Markham was forgotten, Hollywood
is showing a renewed interest in the heroine. Several movies of her
wildly adventurous life are underway or planned, including a
four-hour CBS-TV special starring Stefanie Powers, and at least two
feature-length films.
   In 1986, public television presented the film, ``World Without
Walls: Beryl Markham's African Memoir,'' shortly after her death at
the age of 83. The movie reconstructed her life from old film
footage and interviews with her gossipy contemporaries in Kenya,
where she once hunted barefoot with African friends.
   ``She represented some kind of magical-like past, something that
a woman did but that can't ever be done again because the world in
which that took place is gone,'' said George Gutekunst, who
rediscovered Markham's memoirs, ``West With the Night,'' and helped
get them republished in 1983.
   The book chronicled her Kenyan childhood and historic flight.
Praised by Ernest Hemingway as ``bloody wonderful,'' it became a
best seller in both Britain and the United States when it was
republished. ``She's caught the imagination of much of this country
and the world since then,'' Gutekunst said.
   Gutekunst met Markham in Kenya before her death. With his
partner, Albert del Masso, he later secured movie rights to the
book.
   In some cities, such as San Francisco, fascination with Markham
approaches cult status, according to Berniece Green, a New York
publicist for CBS, which in January began filming in Africa on
``Beryl Markham: Shadow on the Sun.''
   Markham was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in England,
and was brought to Kenya at age 4 by her divorced father, retired
British Army Capt. Charles B. Clutterbuck, who purchased a farm.
She learned to fly and became a bush pilot.
   
   By 1936, several planes had successfully crossed the Atlantic
westward from Europe. But all the aircraft had at least two people
aboard. Markham, in a single-engine Percival Gull monoplane,
departed Britain's Abingdon Royal Air Force aerodrome on Sept. 4,
1936. Low fuel forced her to land in a bog in Nova Scotia. She
later received a ticker tape parade in New York, her original goal.
   She had less than four years of formal education but said her
father made her read widely. Later, she was given a crash course in
literature and music by an Oxford-educated aristocrat and
professional hunter, Denys Finch-Hatton, the lover of the Danish
writer Karen Blixen, whose pen name was Isak Dinesen. The Academy
Award-winning movie, ``Out of Africa,'' was based on Blixen's life.
Markham was apparently Finch-Hatton's last love.
   Markham's poetic account of her childhood and famed flight was
largely ignored when first published in 1942. But following its
re-release and then her death, the book's sales soared. It has been
on the New York Times best-sellers list since November 1986,
according to North Point Press.
   In 1936, Markham became the first person to fly solo
east-to-west across the Atlantic, accepting a challenge from
England's Lord John Carberry. She had grown up in Kenya with Masai
children, become a winning horse trainer and also one of the
continent's premier ``bush pilots.''
   Kenya in the 1920s and '30s was a haven for titled Europeans,
and Markham _ who spent much of her youth hunting wild boar and
fending off lions _ lived with them. She took up thoroughbred
training to support herself at 17 when her bankrupt father
immigrated to Peru.
   CBS' story, based on English journalist James Fox's book,
``White Mischief,'' will portray Markham's three failed marriages,
affairs with flyers Finch-Hatton and Tom Campbell Black and her
years in Santa Barbara, where she taught flying for Paramount
Pictures.
   Actress-producer Diane Baker of Artemis Productions, which
optioned the movie rights to Markham's book from Gutekunst and
Masso, said her company plans to begin filming ``West With the
Night'' in Kenya in June.
   Nelson Films plans to film ``The Lives of Beryl Markham'' this
fall. It is based on a book by Errol Trzbinsky to be published next
year, according to producer Anthony Rufus-Isaacs, who knew Markham
in Africa.
   No stars have been named for either film project.
   Lindsay Wagner has optioned Mary Lovell's 1986 biography of
Markham, ``Straight On Till Morning,'' for a possible leading role
for the actress, according to St. Martin's Press.
   Markham's ``amazing freedom'' in the African outback is what
captivates people, said Lovell in a telephone interview from her
home in England.
   An accountant who quit her job to travel to Kenya to meet
Markham, Lovell found the flyer in 1985 living in a tiny house
outside Nairobi at a track where she had trained some of Kenya's
greatest race champions.
   ``Here was a woman who I found had lived the way we all would
have if we had the courage,'' she said.

   ``I'm the No. 1 attraction in every supermarket parkin' lot.
   ``I'm the king of Kansas City, no thanks, Omaha, thanks a lot.''
   _ Roger Miller.

<TEXT>
   Willard Scott is a national version of Roger
Miller's ``Kansas City Star,'' the quintessential local celebrity
who turns down a better deal in a bigger city because, among other
things, ``I got credit down at the grocery story and my barber
tells me jokes.''
   ``I think about that a thousand times a day,'' Scott says with
customary exaggeration when reminded of the song. He loves
everyone. Every town is his favorite. Every organization the
greatest. His secret is that it's all true.
   ``I guard against being cynical or smart, I just don't like that
whole approach to life,'' he says, sitting in his small NBC office,
crammed full of memorabilia and gifts.
   In 1980, Scott moved to NBC in New York from the relative
small-towniness of the local affiliate in Washington, D.C., where
he had been Bozo the Clown on a kiddie show, and later the local
weatherman. In the big city, a lot of people thought he was a
phony, he said.
   ``In the beginning, I really ran into that, especially around
here. But that didn't last but about six months to a year. I have a
pretty good sense of what's going on.''
   He knocks on wood and adds, ``As soon as you say that you get
the slip. But in the first three months, the mail was tremendous.
Eight hundred letters a day, about half of 'em negative. But that
didn't bother me. Worse than gettin' bad mail is no mail.''
   Scott, who has made several appearances as neighbor Mr. Poole in
the hit NBC sitcom ``Valerie's Family'' this season, is negotiating
a new contract with ``Today.'' Executive producer Marty Ryan says
Scott is close to signing a new, long-term deal.
   Scott, who likes to tell how he once turned down an offer of
McDonald's stock now worth $7 million and passed up 3,000 acres of
prime Blue Ridge Mountain land worth $25 million, said he
nevertheless will stay with ``Today'' rather than take a new gamble
_ on his own sitcom.
   The producers of ``Valerie's Family,'' Tom Miller and Bob
Boyett, liked him as recurring character Peter Poole so much they
are considering a spinoff.
   Miller calls a spinoff of the Pooles a ``definite possibility.''
   Meanwhile, he said, ``we think he's a terrific addition to
`Valerie's Family.' He's a very hard person not to like. He has no
airs. He really is one of the most genuine and open and kind men
that I've ever met in this business.''
   Scott has appeared on the sitcom three times this season, and
one more appearance is in the works.
   One obstacle to a sitcom is Scott's insistence that he stay in
the East. He goes home to Virginia every weekend, usually doing his
``Today'' weather segments from Washington, D.C., on Friday and
Monday.
   ``What I'm saying is if I have a choice of doing a sitcom or
staying on the `Today' show, I'd rather stay on the `Today' show,''
Scott said.
   ``I'm 53. I mean, I get one cell or one heart muscle thump the
wrong way, and I'd be deader than hell, and I don't want to do that
and be out there (in California), I want to be home.''
   While it's an ``an effort for me to act,'' he says, the
``Today'' show routine is ``like water off a duck's back.''
   ``And besides,'' he says, ``it's all over at 9 o'clock. I can
hop on the plane and get out of there, go home. That's what I want.
I want time. But I don't want to give up the money, I don't want to
give up the ego, I don't want to give up the notoriety, the
publicity, you know, that's a very seductive force.''

<HEAD>When Budget ``Cuts'' Lead To More Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Of all the financial and statistical delusions
practiced regularly in Washington, none has the impact of the
annual budget ``cuts'' that lead to greater spending.
   In truth, federal spending hasn't been cut during any year of
the 1980s, but that doesn't mean there haven't been spending
``cuts.'' There have been, on a regular basis, and they have been
proclaimed to the skies.
   How, then, can it be that the federal government spent $591
billion in 1980 and $1.06 trillion in 1988, an average of $59
billion additional spending a year, and amounting to a total
increase in this decade of more than 79 percent?
   Answer: Because ``cut'' means something in Washington that it
means nowhere else. It has the same sound and appearance as the
version used throughout the rest of the nation, but its practical
meaning is opposite to what you think.
   Daniel J. Mitchell of the Citizens for a Sound Economy, a
Washington-based think tank, tackled the problem in pursuit of the
foundation's public interest, which is to penetrate economic
obfuscation and educate the citizenry.
   ``Cut'' means increase, he explains.
   The term, he states, has become twisted because of its
association with what is called the current services budget. This
budgeting technique assumes spending will rise in the following
year.
   Therefore, proposed spending levels for one year are compared
not to what was spent in that year, or in previous years. Instead,
they are compared to what was foreseen in earlier projections of
spending for that year.
   Thus, says Mitchell, the foundation's director of tax and budget
policy, a 4 percent increase can become a 6 percent cut. He
explains:
   If the current services budget projects that a program's budget
for the next year could have risen by 10 percent, and proposals
call for a 4 percent increase, that 4 percent increase is
considered a 6 percent cut.
   Clearly, this sort of mathematics has limited application. You
could not get away with it at the bank. You couldn't manipulate
your household budget that way unless you were seeking to misinform
your spouse, or go bankrupt.
   But what it considered foolhardy and possible a crime on a small
scale, seems to be tolerated on a larger one. Says Mitchell:
``Every time a budget is passed that does not spend as much as the
current services budget estimates, it is reported as a spending cut
_ leading to the popular perception that the budget has been cut.''
   The misinforming of the public doesn't originate with the
concept of the current services budget. It is a useful tool. It is
the misuse of that useful tool that brings the confusion.
   A current services budget guides policymakers by telling them
what spending increases would be required to keep a program current
with inflation, changes in population makeup and changes in the law.
   However, says Mitchell, ``by making it a yardstick against which
all budget proposals are judged, the process has misled the public
into believing spending has been cut.''
   Why does the usage persist?
   The answer is strangely clear for things involving the budget:
It serves the purpose.

<HEAD>Once Again, Budget Marksmen Aim at Venerable Conservation Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As federal budget proposals go, the
Agriculture Department comes off reasonably well in President
Reagan's recommendations to Congress.
   Total spending for the 1989 fiscal year would be cut only 5
percent to around $48.3 billion. And virtually all of the sensitive
crop programs, with the exception of sugar, would suffer reductions
that already have been approved by Congress.
   Sugar is a different thing entirely. The administration is dead
set against the current program, claiming the supports are to high
and the quotas on imports of foreign sugar too restrictive.
   There are other smackeroos in the Reagan budget, to be sure. The
White House still wants the Rural Electrification Administration to
turn most of its business over to private lenders, and the Farmers
Home Administration would see its housing program dismantled.
   Still, compared with some other years when Reagan has urged
cutting school lunch subsidies to rich kids and charging user fees
for meat and poultry inspection, the 1989 edition may be pretty
tame.
   But when it comes to the old Agricultural Conservation Program,
or ACP, some things don't seem to change at all. Once again Reagan
has plotted the end of one of the true survivalists of federal farm
programs.
   The ACP was started in the 1930s to help farmers pay the cost of
carrying out approved conservation practices on their land. Through
Republican and Democratic administrations alike, White House budget
proposals for many years have recommended cutting or ending the
program, which has been running at around $200 million a year.
   Each time, however, Congress has insisted that ACP be kept, and
funded at approximately the same level.
   A year ago, in his budget for 1988, Reagan asked Congress to
rescind most of the ACP money and also to hold bank funds for a
number of other conservation programs, none so big as ACP but still
notable as having their own constituencies.
   The programs are operated by two USDA agencies, the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, and the Soil Conservation
Service.
   As in the past, Congress didn't go along with last year's budget
proposal, so Reagan is trying again. But you have to look at more
than the bottom line in the USDA's budget book.
   Soil and water conservation programs are grouped together into a
single category. For 1989, according to the Reagan proposal, the
programs would be operated at a level of about $2.76 billion, an
increase from an estimated 1988 program level of $2.74 billion.
   The slight increase, however, reflects the impact of the giant
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which was included in the 1985
farm law as a plan to take up to 45 million acres of marginal,
highly erodible cropland from production for periods of 10 years.
   About 23 million acres have been signed up, and department
officials are confident that further signups will produce the
objective.
   In return for contracting to take land out of crops, farmers get
USDA assistance for half of the costs of converting the acreage to
grass and trees. Thereafter, they get annual rental payments
averaging around $50 per acre a year.
   According to department budget analysts, the CRP operated at
about $677 million in 1987, will grow to more than $1.86 billion
this year and to $2.16 billion in 1989. Some have argued that the
growth of CRP, which requires farmers to treat land and water in a
kindly way, has made some of the old-line programs such as ACP
obsolete.
   Budget analysts point out, however, that serious moves were
afoot to kill ACP long before Congress passed the 1985 farm law
authorizing long-term conservation contracts.
   Other programs fated to end if Congress goes along, include the
Water Bank Program, Emergency Conservation Program, Forestry
Incentives Program, and the Colorado River Salinity Control Program.
   However, there are a couple of survivors. The Water Resource
Management Program operated by the Soil Conservation Service for
the development of small watersheds has been recommended at $116
million in 1989. Although that is down from $187 million estimated
this year, officials noted that Reagan in the past has wanted to
eliminate the program entirely.
   The same goes for Resource Conservation and Development, also
handled by SCS. It would be continued at $25 million next year
under the budget proposal.
   Overall, the proposed reduction in SCS conservation programs and
in FmHA's rural housing would mean fewer people working for those
agencies. Full-time employees in SCS would be reduced to about
12,395 next year from 14,177 in 1988. The FmHA would need 11,700
employees, compared with 12,675 this year.

<HEAD>Dow 2,000 Becoming a Familiar Number</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just a little more than a year after the Dow
Jones industrial average first reached 2,000, the stock market has
adopted that level as a regular hangout.
   Since the crash in October that sent the average tumbling into
the low 1700s, the market has rallied back to around 2,000 four
separate times. On each of those occasions, the advance has bogged
down at that point.
   Now, Wall Streeters hope, it may be ready to clear that obstacle.
   Many stock market analysts say it is simplistic or even silly to
talk about round-number levels in the Dow as measures of any
significance for the market outlook.
   When investing institutions measure their performance against
the market as a whole, these analysts point out, they usually don't
use the Dow, but rather the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock
composite index.
   Nevertheless, Dow 2,000 appears to provide a good reference
point for the current state of the market.
   It served as one of the landmarks of the great 1982-87 bull
market when the average first surpassed it on Jan. 8 of last year.
   And one emphatic message of the crash on Oct. 19 seemed to be
that the Dow in the 2000s was too high.
   Now that a semblance of stability has returned to the
marketplace, a new symbolic appraisal has been made: Improvement in
the trade deficit and a decline in interest rates have warranted a
return to the threshold of 2,000 at least.
   But to buy stocks much above that level is still considered a
risky proposition.
   ``When the market rallies almost to 2,000 one contingent
believes _ loudly _that it is already running into trouble,''
observed Justin Mamis in a current market commentary for the
investment firm of Cowen & Co.
   ``Another group quickly gets labeled on TV as `emergent bulls'
and insists they've never given up faith in new Dow highs.''
   In the past week the industrial average closed above 2,000 on
Tuesday and Wednesday after the Washington's Birthday holiday,
slipped back briefly, and then jumped ahead again. It closed Friday
at 2,014.59, up 31.33 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.10 to 146.96;
the American Stock Exchange market value index 3.16 to 280.16, and
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market 3.85 to
357.12.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 160.98 million shares a day,
against 179.43 million the week before.
   Of course, there are many more elaborate ways to measure the
level of the market than simple gauges of stock prices.
   By some of those yardsticks, argues Suresh Bhirud at Oppenheimer
& Co., stocks ``appear attractive relative to both bonds and their
own historical average valuation level.''
   For instance, Bhirud figures that the S&P 500 now stands at 12
times projected earnings for this year _ a price-earnings multiple
he calls attractive in a period of low inflation.
   If you adjust the S&P 500 for inflation, he adds, it is 30
percent below where it was in 1968. And the market value of stocks
is now 58 percent of the nation's gross national product, compared
with 118 percent at the 1968 peak.
   ``There's no magic in comparing the current inflation-adjusted
price levels with 1968,'' he says. ``It's just a way of
demonstrating that the price appreciation in the stock market for
the last 20 years has probably lagged price appreciation in other
aspects of the economy.''

<HEAD>Isuzu Makes Ad Featuring Reagan, Ortega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Reagan compared Nicaraguan leader
Daniel Ortega to ``that fellow in the Isuzu commercial'' in a
recent speech, he gave the car importer's admakers an idea.
   They made a new Isuzu commercial that includes the president's
remarks and some film of Ortega delivering a speech in a foreign
language as captions purport to translate what he is saying into a
plea for a deal on a sporty car.
   The approach is similar to that the importer has taken for the
past two years, in which it has corrected with captions the
outrageous claims that its smarmy spokesman, the fictional Joe
Isuzu, makes about Isuzu cars and trucks.
   But all three major television networks have rejected the latest
ad, Isuzu's admakers said. One network executive said the ad was a
publicity stunt.
   ``I think they were well aware that it would be rejected and saw
an opportunity for free publicity,'' said Harvey Dzodin, vice
president of commercial clearance at the ABC television network.
   The ad begins with a tape from a Feb. 2 speech by President
Reagan in which he encourages congressional support for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   The president said that when he hears the Nicaraguan leaders
making promises, he is reminded of the Isuzu commercials and thinks
``there should be subtitles under them telling the real story.''
   The commercial says Ortega made a speech about Isuzu the next
day.
   It shows Ortega delivering an address while subtitles provide a
fictitious translation: ``Hey, Joe Isuzu. Could you cut me a deal
on an Impulse Turbo? I hear the Impulse is faster than a speeding
bullet. I could use that in a car.''
   The ad ends with the now-familiar voice of Joe Isuzu, saying
``You have my word on it.''
   Jerry Della Femina, head of Isuzu's ad agency, Della Femina
Travisano & Partners, said as soon as he heard of Reagan's remarks,
he knew ``we had a terrific commercial.''
   But the TV networks didn't see it that way. Della Femina said
while they usually take a week or so to review an ad, ABC and NBC
rejected the new Isuzu spot in ``seven or eight minutes'' while CBS
took a full day.
   Dom Giofre, a spokesman for the NBC television network, said NBC
found the ad ``in poor taste.'' CBS and ABC policies prohibit
airing ads featuring unauthorized use of the president, network
officials said.
   Della Femina conceded no effort was made to get permission from
either Reagan or Ortega for use in the ad. He said his client still
wants to get the ad on the air on either independent stations or
cable networks.
   He said the ad displays ``no lack of respect for the office of
the president'' and argued that Ortega ``has been treated a lot
worse'' by others.
   No offense intended, Della Femina said. You have his word on it.

   Oil prices are being pressured lower, as traders
test the market to see where the next ranges will be.
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, contracts for
March delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude
oil, closed at $16.45 per 41-gallon barrel, down 16 cents from
Wednesday.
   Among refined products, wholesale contracts for unleaded
gasoline closed at 45.97 cents a gallon, down 0.69 cent, while
wholesale heating oil was down half a penny at 45.08 cents a gallon.
   Stephen J. McKiernan, president of the McKiernan & Co. commodity
brokerage firm, said sellers grew active after the crude contract
broke below $16.60, its most recent support level.
   Many traders were selling the market short, expecting prices to
head lower, he said, adding that some technicians were expecting
the contract to trade in a range between $16.20 and $16.50 a barrel.
   In a short sale, a trader sells borrowed contracts in hopes of
replacing them later with others bought at a cheaper price.
   At the same time, he said, ``there's the same underlying
bearishness we've had for months,'' mainly because of abundant
supplies.

<HEAD>American Standard Board Proposes Recapitalization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL MENEZES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. is attempting to woo
shareholders away from a hostile $2.03 billion bid by Black &
Decker Corp. with a rival recapitalization plan offering a $1.9
billion payout plus a stake in the recapitalized company.
   American Standard's board of directors approved the proposal on
Thursday, just over a week after it rejected Black & Decker's
$65-a-share hostile tender offer.
   American Standard said its plan it would pay $59 in cash plus
high-yielding debt securities it valued at $5 for each of the
company's 31.1 million outstanding shares.
   Shareholders also would receive one common share of the
recapitalized company for each of the common shares they held
currently, although the total number of shares in the recapitalized
company would be greater.
   American Standard stock rose 50 cents to close at $67.50 a share
and Black & Decker dipped 12{ cents to $18.87{ on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Recapitalizations, in which a company realigns its levels of
debt and equity, have become a frequently used takeover defense
because the company often takes on a big debt load that makes it a
less attractive target.
   American Standard, for example, would see its long-term debt
jump to about $2.3 billion from roughly $412 million. The company
planned to pay off the debt with its cash flow rather than by
selling assets, according to sources familiar with the plan.
   American Standard did not estimate the impact of the plan on the
company's earnings. Last year, it earned $127.1 million on sales of
$3.4 billion. William Boyd, American Standard's chairman and chief
executive, said earlier this month estimated profits would rise by
about 20 percent this year, excluding the impact of a takeover.
   A Black & Decker spokeswoman at the company's Towson, Md.,
headquarters did not return a telephone call seeking comment
Thursday.
   ``The recapitalization not only gives the stockholders
significantly higher value than the $65 being offered in Black &
Decker's tender, but also enables them to retain a substantial
ongoing equity interest in a viable American Standard,'' Boyd said
in a statement.
   In addition to giving public shareholders new stock in the
recapitalized company, American Standard also would convert the
1.23 million of its shares held by an employee savings and stock
ownership plan into shares of the recapitalized company at a ratio
to be determined later.
   American Standard said that using the ratio of 10.15-to-one as
an example, the number of its outstanding common shares plus
equivalents such as stock options would more than double, to 65.4
million from 32.2 million.
   The plan must be approved by shareholders and is subject to
sufficient financing being arranged. A special shareholders meeting
is planned for April to consider the proposal, the company said.
   American Standard said it planned to finance the
recapitalization with $1.59 billion in bank borrowing and the sale
of $225 million in senior subordinated debentures.
   Separately, a federal judge in Delaware deferred a decision on
Black & Decker's constitutionality challenge to Delaware's new
takeover law.
   Attorneys said U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Longobardi
planned to rule in about a week on the Black & Decker lawsuit
against the state and American Standard, which is incorporated in
Delaware.
   The law severely limits a hostile buyer's ability to sell a
target company's assets to finance a takeover. Black & Decker has
indicated it planned several major divestitures of American
Standard property to help finance its buyout if successful.
   After American Standard last week rejected its $65-a-share
offer, Black & Decker said it would seek shareholder approval to
win control of the company's board of directors.
   Black & Decker, a maker of appliances and power tools, has said
it had commitments for $750 million in financing for its offer and
its banker was confident it could raise another $1.25 billion in
bank loans.
   American Standard manufactures plumbing and air conditioning
equipment, automotive brakes and mass-transit control devices.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor To Pay $6 Million in Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eaton Corp. has paid $6 million to settle
government claims that one of the company's divisions overcharged
and issued premature bills on defense contracts, the company
announced.
   The government had alleged that Eaton issued $2.7 million in
premature bills and about $1 million in improper charges. The
government had been seeking triple damages and penalties totaling
more than $26 million.
   The settlement, which includes a $500,000 penalty for
entertainment furnished by Eaton's Airborne Instruments
Laboratories division and $700,000 in penalties for its billing
practices, was announced jointly in statements Wednesday by Eaton
Chairman James Stover and Andrew Maloney, the U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of New York.
   AIL, in Deer Park, N.Y., was accused of making false statements
in its monthly billings to the Air Force during work on the
defensive avionics system for the B-1B bomber.
   Eaton said the AIL division had government contracts of $3
billion during the period covered by the settlement.
   ``A settlement of these claims is a prerequisite to our moving
ahead with plans to exit the defense electronics industry,'' Stover
said. ``On that basis, we think the settlement is in the best
interest of Eaton shareholders.''
   Cleveland-based Eaton announced last October its intention to
sell its defense electronics business.
   As part of the settlement, Eaton agreed to absorb its own legal
fees and expenses, Maloney said.
   ``The defense contractors must realize that they have to abide
by the rules, and failure to do so will result in substantial
penalties and losses to the companies involved,'' the prosecutor
said.

<HEAD>Shareholders Meet Where Walt Disney Started</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM CURRAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mickey Mouse turns 60 this year, and
Donald, Goofy and the rest of the Disney gang aren't far behind.
   The faces of the popular cartoon characters created by Walt
Disney are among the best known in the world, and one questioner at
Thursday's shareholders meeting wondered if Walt Disney Co.
executives ever worry about over-saturating the market with those
familiar images.
   ``Yes, we worry about it all the time,'' said Michael D. Eisner,
chairman and chief executive officer of the broad-based
entertainment company that evolved from Disney's cartoons. ``I
think what we've found is that as long as what you do is excellent,
as long as every single move you make in every part of the company
is based on a goal of complete excellence and quality, you only
enhance the image.
   ``If you do things just to do them and they're cheap or
inferior, you are going to hurt something else.''
   About 300 people attended the Disney shareholders meeting, the
first held away from the company's theme parks, Walt Disney World
in Florida and Disneyland in California. The company decided to
``come home'' to the place where Walt Disney started out.
   Born in Chicago, Disney grew up in Marceline, Mo., about 80
miles northeast of Kansas City. His family later moved to Kansas
City, where he attended art school and did his first commercial
cartooning. He headed for Hollywood 65 years ago with $40 in his
pocket.
   The shareholders heard glowing accounts of the company's
results, bolstered by a remarkable turnaround at movie box offices,
and prospects for future growth, headlined by plans for a European
Disneyland.
   During the 1987 fiscal year ending Sept. 30, revenues increased
33 percent to $2.8 billion and net income was up 80 percent to
$444.7 milllion, or $3.23 a share.
   And the quarter ending Jan. 31 was the best first quarter in the
company's history, with revenues of $734.6 million and net
operating income of $100.4 million.
   Eisner and Frank G. Wells, president and chief operating
officer, highlighted plans for upcoming film ventures. But their
most enthusiastic comments were about the prospects for Euro
Disneyland, scheduled to open in 1992 near Paris. They said they
have no doubt they will be as successful in Europe as they have
been with their Japanese Disneyland near Tokyo, five years old in
April, which will soon welcome its 50 millionth visitor.
   The European Disneyland site, about 18 miles east of Paris, is
near one of the major north-south highway routes, Wells said, and
the French government will extend rail transportation to the gate
of the newest Magic Kingdom.
   ``Everything seems to be set to make it one of the most
successful theme park ventures ever, even rivaling Walt Disney
World,'' said Eisner. ``We believe that Euro Disneyland will be the
single most important undertaking by the company in the decade of
the 1990s.''
   Shareholders applauded promotional film clips from ``Three Men
and A Baby,'' the comedy starring Tom Selleck which has brought in
$132 million at the box office since its release last year, and the
more recent Robin Williams hit, ``Good Morning Vietnam,'' which has
fetched $63 million.
   The animated classic ``Snow White'' brought in a record $46
million in its re-release last year, bringing its total over 50
years to more than $350 million. The company is starting to put
more emphasis on the animated films which first made its
reputation, including a modern version of the Dickens classic
``Oliver Twist,'' set in New York City instead of London.
   Eisner said the company will soon meet its goal of releasing one
animated film a year, ``a dream even Walt would have felt
ambitious.''
   The Disney executives cited strong expectations for the
just-released ``Shoot To Kill,'' bringing Sidney Poitier back to
the screen after a 10-year absence, which brought in $5.8 million
and ranked No. 2 in its first weekend.
   Among films coming out later this year will be ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit,'' an animated feature in which Steven Spielberg is
co-producer, ``D.O.A.'' a thriller starring Dennis Quaid, ``Great
Big Business,'' a comedy with Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin,
``Cocktail'' with Tom Cruise, ``Fugitive'' with Nick Nolte and
Martin Short, and ``The Good Mother'' with Diane Keaton.
   Eisner was re-elected to the board of directors, along with
Stanley P. Gold, president of Shamrock Holdings Inc., Irwin
Russell, an attorney, and Raymond L. Watson, former chairman of the
company and now chairman of the board's executive committee.
   Shareholders also approved a stock incentive plan for employees
and retained Price Waterhouse as the company's accounting firm for
the 50th year.

   Rich's downtown department store once was more
than the flagship of a chain, it was a symbol of Atlanta, where
Southeastern shoppers came to browse and buy _ and return _
anything they wanted from the legendary family-operated institution.
   Today's version of the store retains the offices and selling
space, but the glitz has moved to the malls and the 121-year-old
chain is independent no more, purchased 12 years ago by Federated
Department Stores Inc. of Cincinnati. Federated is itself the
object of an ongoing $5.5 billion-plus takeover attempt by Campeau
Corp. of Toronto.
   Rich's was founded in 1867 by Morris Rich, a Hungarian immigrant
who borrowed $500 from his brother to start a small dry goods store
and had $5,000 in first-year sales.
   His grandson _ born Richard Rosenheim, but who changed his name
at age 19 to Richard Rich _ took over in the late 1940s and guided
the store until his death in 1975.
   The next year, the chain was sold to Federated in a stock swap,
prompting moans from Atlanta residents and resulting in full-page
newpaper ads from the company promising that Rich's would never
change.
   That promise has been broken, says Michael Rich, great-grandson
of the founder and the last family member to work for the chain.
   ``I think Rich's was a community leader in every aspect and now
it's a place to buy things,'' Rich said in a telephone interview
from his home in Vail, Colorado. Rich was vice president for public
relations, personnel and non-sales services when he left in 1983.
   In the years since the deal with Federated, Rich's has expanded
its mall operations, and recently completed a renovation of the
downtown store.
   However, in that renovation, four floors in one part of the
two-building complex were given over to leased office space,
significantly reducing selling space.
   And what was once unthinkable has happened: arch-rival Macy's of
New York is challenging Rich's hold on the Atlanta market.
   When Federated acquired Rich's in 1976, the chain had 12
department stores and 10 Richway discount stores, all but four in
the Atlanta area.
   Now, there are 20 Rich's stores, 14 in the Atlanta area, three
in Alabama, two in South Carolina and one in Augusta, Ga. The
Richway stores have been combined with Federated's Gold Circle
discount stores into a separate division.
   The Rich's division had $690.6 million in sales in 1986, more
than 6.5 percent of total Federated sales. Federated reported net
income of $287.6 million on sales of $10.5 billion for the 12
months ended Jan. 31, 1987.
   ``They're one of Federated's better operations,'' said Monroe
Greenstein, a retail analyst for Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. in New
York. He estimated 1987 sales at more than $700 million.
   Although Rich's has a low ratio of sales per square foot at
$140, he said, its traditional dominance of the Atlanta market
makes it an attractive property.
   Federated has ``done a lot to improve and a lot to take away
from what it was,'' Michael Rich said. ``They've changed the
concept of merchandising. They do what they do well. ... They run
mediocre department stores everywhere they are.
   ``They appeal to the middle economic strata and we tried to be
something to everyone,'' he said.
   Rich said he never understood why Federated bought Rich's and
then, to his way of thinking, changed its character. If it was
worth buying, he reasoned, it must have been because it was
successful.
   Federated is resisting the Campeau offer, and the Ohio
legislature has passed a law giving the state authority to assess
the economic impact of the potential takeover.
   Legislators are worried that Campeau would break up the company
and cost Ohioans their jobs.
   But in fighting the takeover, Federated has said it might be
forced to sell one or more assets, including the discount
operation. The company's latest move involved a financial
restructuring that could include the sale of most assets other than
the department stores.
   Rich, although he admitted he ``probably'' would like to return
to the department store business, said he had had no serious
discussions about reacquiring the family's stores.
   In addition to Rich's, Federated's holdings include the New
York-based Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Straus, Filene's of
Boston, Burdines of Miami, Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire in Los
Angeles, I. Magnin in San Francisco and Lazarus in Ohio.

<TEXT>
   Workers voted by a more than a 2-1 margin to
accept a new contract and end a strike at Ford's 22 British plants,
but new strife in the auto industry loomed when wage negotiations
broke down at Land Rover today.
   Ford Motor Co.'s hourly workers, on strike since Feb. 8, decided
by 16,060 votes to 6,759 in a union ballot Thursday to accept a new
two-year contract. Ford said it expects them back at work on Monday.
   The vote in the 70 percent turnout ended Britain's first major
industrial strike in three years, but the settlement is a
significant union victory, the first in seven years.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government is worried that,
because Ford made concessions, there could be new industrial unrest
and an inflationary explosion in wage demands.
   ``The cost of excessive pay settlements can only be damaging to
future prospects and jobs,'' Employment Secretary Norman Fowler
warned Thursday night.
   He said excessive pay settlements translated into an average
increase in earnings among all British workers of 8.5 percent over
the last 12 months.
   Britain's annual rate of inflation of 3.3 percent, the lowest
since October 1986, is largely the result of the Conservative
government's tight money policies.
   The government has argued that, as a result of low inflation,
many British workers have no right to expect annual pay hikes.
   In its settlement, Ford backed down on a demand for a three-year
contract and also agreed to a larger wage increase _ at least 14
percent over the life of the contract. Previously, it had offered
an increase of 7 percent in the first year and 2.5 percent above
the rate of inflation over the next two years.
   An average Ford worker now earns $327 a week.
   Ford won some changes in work practices to boost productivity,
but they must be agreed to at plant level, not imposed by
management.
   More than 9,700 workers were laid off because of the strike,
which disrupted production at Ford's Belgian plant at Genk and
threatened output at Ford factories in Spain and West Germany, all
of which rely on parts made in Britain.
   Ford said the strike cost it $350 million, at showroom prices,
in lost production.
   The walkout _ Ford's first in Britain for nearly a decade _ a
recent strike by English Channel ferry crews, and unrest in the
state-run National Health Service and in coal mines has prompted
concern about a new wave of industrial problems.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said a strike
by 6,000 hourly workers at Land Rover seems certain next week
following the breakdown of pay negotiations early today.
   Land Rover managing director Tony Gilroy said no further talks
were planned.
   Land Rover said it had offered a two-year pay package which it
said was worth an extra 14 percent and would give the average
production worker $22 a week more than the Ford workers settled
for. Union officials said it was not worth that much and that they
want more.
   Meanwhile, more than 4,000 hourly workers at Vauxhall Motors,
British subsidiary of General Motors Corp., have voted to strike if
they don't get a better pension deal from the company. No date for
the walkout has been announced.
   Widespread industrial strife erupted in Britain in the so-called
winter of discontent of 1978-79 but receded after Mrs. Thatcher
rose to power in 1979, a steep rise in unemployment and laws by her
government to curb unions.
   Unemployment is now falling again and stands at 2.56 million, or
9.2 percent.

   Allegis Corp., parent company of United Airlines,
says it is negotiating to sell up to 35 percent of its Covia-Apollo
automated reservations system to four European airlines for about
$350 million.
   Allegis spokesman Matt Gonring said Thursday that talks were
underway but no final agreement has been reached with British
Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swiss Air and Alitalia.
   Gonring said Allegis also is negotiating with a third party,
whom he identified only as ``one or more of the four'' European
airlines, for acquisition of an additional 15 percent of Covia.
   Analysts said the 15 percent stake would be worth about $150
million.
   Chicago-area based Allegis would retain a controlling interest
of 50 percent of Covia, under the deal, Gonring said.
   Covia operates the Apollo computer reservation system for
airlines and other companies.
   Allegis recently sold its Westin and Hilton International hotel
chains and Hertz Corp. car rental subsidiary.
   Rather than pay dividends to shareholders from the sales,
Allegis on Wednesday began a $2.8 billion cash offer to buy about
two-thirds, or up to 33.5 million, of its shares at $80 each.
   Allegis plans to keep its airline operation and revert back to
its old corporate name, United Airlines.

<HEAD>Chrysler May Postpone Kenosha, Wisc., Plant Shutdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca says he's
considering a ``modest, short'' postponement of the Sept. 30
shutdown of the company's auto assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis.
   Iacocca told reporters after a two-hour meeting Thursday with
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.: ``We
don't hold hopes too high, but they specifically asked if we could
have a modest, short extension ... at the plant.
   ``We're going to look and see if we can seriously do that. It
would help, a lot.''
   Meanwhile, Iacocca said the company, working with Aspin, who is
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, would explore the
possibility of bringing some of Chrysler's growing defense business
to the Kenosha plant.
   Participants in the meeting described it as productive, but
testy and loud at times. They said they would meet again in about a
month.
   ``It started out testy. In the middle of the conversation it got
testy and about a half-an-hour before we finished it was very
testy,'' said Thompson, who is threatening to sue the company for
breach of contract. He declined, however, to say what issues
sparked the outbursts.
   Wisconsin officials are angry because they appropriated $5
million to retrain workers at the aging plant after Chrysler
acquired it in a merger with American Motors Corp. They say company
officials promised to keep it operating into 1992.
   Iacocca, however, says company officials are guilty of nothing
more than being ``cockeyed optimists'' in originally planning to
keep the plant open for three to five years. Car sales have not
been sufficient to allow that, he said.
   Thompson said he was holding back on filing a breach-of-contract
suit being prepared by Wisconsin's attorney general, but he warned:
``The filing of the lawsuit depends upon what happens in the
negotiations.''
   About 5,500 workers could lose their jobs at the 86-year-old
factory, which is the nation's oldest auto plant. About 1,800
workers are eligible for pensions, leaving 3,700 facing
unemployment in Kenosha, an industrial city of about 75,000 on Lake
Michigan.
   Iacocca said Chrysler may be able to keep the plant operating
``a couple months'' beyond the scheduled closing on Sept. 30. But
Thompson said he hoped the extension would be longer than that.
   Aspin said the group is looking into transferring some of the
company's existing defense business to Kenosha and at securing new
business for it. He declined to offer specific details.
   Chrysler had $268 million in Pentagon business last year _
including electronics, small aircraft and some automotive sales _
and is looking to expand, according to Warren Nelson, an Aspin aide.
   ``Chrysler ought to give some thought to the fact that if they
have an interest in expanding their defense business, closing a
plant in Wisconsin isn't the way to go about it,'' Nelson said.
   He cautioned, however, ``There is no way Chrysler is going to
come up with 3,700 jobs no matter how much defense work they get.''
   Thompson said he and Aspin also asked Iacocca to negotiate with
the United Auto Workers union concerning the disposition of money
that workers had paid into a fund for improving the plant, and to
participate in a program to improve economic development in
southeast Wisconsin.
   On Tuesday, Iacocca announced in Milwaukee that the company
would dedicate all profits from new Chrysler cars sold in Wisconsin
to a fund to help laid-off workers pay their mortgages and rent.
Based on 1987 sales, the fund should amount to about $20 million,
he said.

   The stock market was little changed today,
continuing its recent stalemate around the 2,000 level in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips edged up .49 to 1,986.90 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 465 up, 507 down and 506
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.50 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Several analysts at major investment firms have lately grown a
bit more optimistic about the outlook for the market, citing signs
of strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
   Buying interest has been evident in some manufacturing stocks
and many of the smaller ``secondary'' issues.
   But investors have remained leery of doing much broad-scale
buying, with memories still fresh of the crash in October and talk
persisting of a recession this year or in 1989.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose \ to 112}; Ford Motor gained { to 42}; Chrysler
dropped [ to 24}, and Exxon was unchanged at 42.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.08 to 145.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .23 at 277.69.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 14.58 to
1,986.41, after closing slightly above 2,000 in the week's first
two sessions.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 on the
NYSE, with 678 up, 812 down and 470 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 151.43 million shares, against 176.83 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Budget Sees Individual Taxes of $1,600 Per Citizen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If President Reagan's proposed budget actually
becomes America's budget for 1989, it will mean that the federal
government will collect $1,687 in individual income taxes for every
man, woman and child in the country.
   That's an increase of $65 from the budget he presented a year
ago, due almost entirely to economic growth.
   The mathematics are straightforward. Divide the $412.4 billion
expected through individual income taxes during the year by 244.4
million people, the U.S. population as of Jan. 1. Last year, when
the total population was 242.1 million, the assumption was that
individual income taxes would bring in $392.8 billion.
   According to the budget proposal Reagan sent to Capitol Hill on
Thursday, the federal government expects its total receipts in 1989
to be $964.7 billion. Besides the personal income tax, the sum
includes corporate income taxes of $117.7 billion and Social
Security taxes of $354.6 billion. The rest will come from estate
and gift taxes, customs duties, excise taxes and the like.
   Using the same population formula for this year, the total
receipts represent $3,947 for everyone from the tiniest to the
oldest centenarian.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The source of money flowing in to the government has changed
greatly in the Reagan years, the administration points out. The
individual and corporate income tax share of total receipts in 1989
is expected to be 4.7 percentage points less than 1980 when three
out of every five dollars came from income taxes.

<TEXT>
   The administration tagged two displaced worker programs for
extinction because they have not ``operated efficiently to help
workers adjust.''
   One provides unemployment benefit payments when unemployment
insurance runs out. The administration feels those additional weeks
of payments ``encourage workers to delay efforts to seek new
opportunities in the hope that somehow their old jobs will
reappear.'' In the current year, the program cost $48 million in
federal money.
   The second program, costing $287 million in 1988, pays states
for helping dislocated workers find new occupations that use their
skills, get training in new skills or meet the cost of looking for
jobs. That money, says the budget, should go into a new Worker
Readjustment Program.
   The administration also wants to drop a work incentive program
that provided job services, training and public service employment
to welfare recipients.
   ``Although its aim is to help curb welfare dependency, it has
not proved successful or cost-effective,'' the proposal said. The
government budgeted $93 million for the program this year.

<TEXT>
   Reagan's budget proposal for 1988 asked Congress to tack on $1
for every ticket for international travel to and from the United
States to be used for a government program that encourages foreign
travel to the United States.
   Congress did not pass the legislation last year and the
administration wants it brought up again.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Money for recreation is to be cut back under the proposal from
$1.7 billion this year to $1.4 billion.
   To make that cut, the administration wants to reduce the amount
spent for buying land from $232 million to $51 million. And it
proposes a halt in buying some land for park and refuge purposes
through 1993 _ except for wetlands acquired with revenue from sale
of duck hunting stamps and the like.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The budget also makes clear that pardons are on the increase.
Last year, there were only 23 pardons granted by the president.
That number is estimated to increase to 50 this fiscal year and 50
again in the next. There was no explanation. The number of
``denials and no actions,'' _ 290 in 1987 _ is expected to increase
slightly to 300 this year and next.

<HEAD>Coniston To Seek Four Seats On Gillette Board of Directors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners indicated today it would try
to place four representatives on the Gillette Co. board of
directors, escalating its strategy of pressuring the company into a
merger or restructuring.
   A group led by the investment partnership, which holds a 6
percent stake in Gillette, said it intended to solicit proxies from
Gillette shareholders to place candidates on the board of directors.
   In disclosing its Gillette stake last Thursday, Coniston
indicated it might seek representation on the board as part of a
strategy to force an increase in Gillette's share value.
   Coniston would be unable to take control of Gillette's board,
because only a third of the seats are up for election in any year.
But analysts say a Coniston victory in the proxy fight could
pressure the board to accede to the group's demands that it meet
with potential merger partners.
   Gillette stock rose 37{ cents to $39 a share in early trading
today on the New York Stock Exchange.
   A spokesman at the Boston-based consumer products company said
Gillette had not yet seen the Securities and Exchange Commission
filing outlining Coniston's plan, and would not comment until it
had.
   Coniston also has said it was attempting to meet with potential
acquirers of Gillette, which long has been a takeover target.
Gillette has resisted takeover overtures, and reiterated a desire
to remain independent last week after Coniston made its disclosures.
   The moves by Coniston, which successfully waged a similar
strategy against Allegis Corp. last year, were seen widely as an
attempt to force Gillette's board to meet with potential merger
partners such as Revlon Group Inc., which has had several buyout
offers rebuffed by Gillette over the past 18 months.
   Keith Gollust, a principal in the partnership, said Gillette's
takeover defenses essentially gave its board of directors
unilateral power to accept or reject any merger offers.
   ``Our position is that shareholders, who really own the company,
ought to have the right to make that decision,'' he said.
   Gollust said the group had a telephone conversation with
Gillette chairman Colman M. Mockler Jr. last week, but Mockler did
not change the company's prior statements that it wished to remain
independent.

   The Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee today praised parts of the $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989
budget President Reagan submitted to Congress, but warned that the
proposal left tough deficit fighting for future administrations.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., said that domestic spending
increases proposed by the president in programs he has tried
cutting in the past showed a White House shift toward congressional
priorities.
   ``After eight years, it looks like you've finally seen the light
on education, drug enforcement, health and the environment,''
Chiles told White House Budget Director James C. Miller III, who
was appearing before the Senate budget panel.
   But Chiles also warned that the national debt, now about $2.5
trillion, was rapidly growing and would have to be dealt with soon.
He said efforts to control the deficit would have to go beyond the
so-called budget summit agreement reached last November between
Reagan and congressional leaders.
   ``The job facing the next president will make last year look
like a walk down Primrose Lane,'' Chiles said.
   The House Budget Committee chairman, Rep. William H. Gray III,
speaking on ``CBS This Morning,'' gave the spending plan ``a
passing grade in that sense that it's closer to congressional
priorities.''
   The Pennsylvania Democrat cited the budget's slowed increases in
defense spending and relaxed restraints on domestic spending as
factors in its favor.
   The spending plan contains a deficit of $129.5 billion, less
than the $136 billion target required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law. The government would spend $1.094 trillion, while
taking in $965 billion in receipts.
   If the budget were enacted intact, the government would have to
collect $1,687 in individual income taxes for every person in the
country _ $65 more would have been required under Reagan's 1988
budget. Such an increase, however, is attributable almost entirely
to economic growth.
   Appearing with Gray, Miller attributed the mild Capitol Hill
reaction to the budget summit agreement.
   ``We had 20 days and 20 nights of real hard negotiating,'' he
said. ``That's half the time Noah spent on the ark.''
   Under that agreement, drawn in the aftermath of the October
stock market crash, legislators and the administration set this
budget's overall spending ceilings for military, domestic and
foreign aid spending. In addition, Reagan already has signed $14
billion in new 1989 taxes called for in the pact.
   With 1988 an election year, lawmakers are unlikely to insist on
revisiting those painful subjects.
   ``It's like tying two cats by the tail and throwing them over
the clothesline,'' Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., a member of the
Senate Budget Committee, told reporters. ``There'll be a lot of
small intramurals, but nothing really's going to happen.''
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., added, ``Although I
have always felt that more could be cut from the budget through a
(spending) freeze, I think our first responsibility is to affirm
the summit agreement.''
   Others, however, predicted that although the budget's overall
shape appears settled, skirmishes will be fought over how that
money is divided up.
   ``It's a little like looking at a Trojan horse,'' said Chiles.
``It's an attractive horse, but you've got to look on the inside.''
   Reagan's budget contains proposals that pleased many lawmakers:
   _Spending to combat AIDS is increased by more than one-third to
$1.3 billion.
   _Education gets a $1.5 billion boost to $20.3 billion.
   _The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget
grows nearly 20 percent to $11 billion.
   _$2.5 billion is provided for a five-year fight against acid
rain.
   But there are spending slashes in other programs that Congress
has rejected before and is likely to ignore again.
   The president would:
   _End $600 million in federal subsidies for Amtrak, the passenger
railroad.
   _Reduce mass transit aid from $3.3 billion to $1.4 billion.
   _Eliminate the $200 million Urban Development Action Grants
program.
   _Sell government assets such as loan portfolios, the Alaska
power administration and the Naval Petroleum Reserve.
   ``The battle will be fought on domestic differences,'' said Gray.
   The budget is also the first submitted by Reagan that does not
allow Pentagon spending to keep abreast of inflation. Thus, it
allows a military spending increase from $285.4 billion to $294
billion in fiscal 1989, and contains a reduction in the size of
active-duty forces and drops the goal of a 600-ship Navy.
   It does, however, grant servicemen and women 4.3 percent pay
raise, well above the 2 percent granted other federal employees.
   The performance of the economy will be a weighty factor in
determining how docile the 1989 budget wars will be.
   The budget's expected $129.5 billion deficit is based on
projections by the White House Office of Management and Budget. It
projects healthy economic growth, along with continuing low
interest rates, inflation and unemployment, which taken together
mean lower government spending and higher government revenues.
   The Congressional Budget Office, which studies the budget for
Congress, expects a weaker economic performance this year and has
projected a $176 billion deficit.
   Chiles said he expected Congress to be able to adhere to the
budget summit agreement unless ``the economy totally goes South.''
   Others, however, were critical of OMB's projections, but
conceded that lawmakers had little taste this year for tackling the
massive deficit slashing that would be needed if CBO's forecast is
accurate.
   ``This is the year of the big wink, the high art of blue smoke
and mirrors,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
   If the lower deficit projection proves accurate, it could be the
third consecutive drop in federal red ink. Since reaching a record
$221 billion in 1986, the deficit fell to $150 billion last year
and is expected to fall to $146 billion this year.
   One possible bone of contention is the promise Reagan has made
to try to cancel spending for fiscal 1988 _ which began Oct. 1 _ on
several spending projects that lawmakers obtained for their home
districts. The president is expected to raise the issue next week.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Most of the markets were down only slightly, but wheat was off
as much as 5\ cents a bushel within a few minutes of the opening
bell.
   Demand for wheat typically weakens in late winter and early
spring, and the futures market is anticipating a corresponding drop
in prices, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``People are expecting the seasonal downturn in wheat,'' Spilka
said. ``They're looking for it and looking for it and when they see
signs of weakening, you get a kind of bandwagon effect.''
   Wheat futures prices have mostly advanced for the past eight
months. A down day today would mark the fourth straight day of
steady or lower wheat prices.
   In early trading, wheat was 3} cents to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.16{ a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.00{ a bushel; oats were 1

1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $6.27{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

<TEXT>
   Stock market investors face a quandary these
days when they look for ways to profit from the revival of American
manufacturing.
   Practically no one disputes that ``smokestack America'' _ makers
of steel, paper, chemicals, machinery and so forth _ has made an
impressive comeback from its woes of the early to mid-1980s.
   The dollar's decline in currency markets has improved the
competitive position of American manufacturers in world markets and
given a needed boost to U.S. exports.
   Furthermore, in the lean years many companies in this sector of
the economy cut costs, increased productivity and ``restructured''
themselves to concentrate on operations with the most promising
potential.
   While business was bad, there was little incentive to expand
capacity. So now that business is better, manufacturers often find
the facilities they have running at full tilt with order backlogs
growing.
   This, in turn, creates a climate in which a company can enjoy
what Wall Street analysts call ``pricing flexibility'' _ the
opportunity to increase prices and profits.
   All this adds up to what any experienced investor would regard
as a classic opportunity.
   While falling inflation and lower interest rates provided the
dominant themes of the 1982-87 bull market, many analysts say the
story today and for the future is manufacturing.
   There's one problem with that view, however. Manufacturing is by
long-standing tradition closely tied to the ups and downs of the
business cycle. And if there is going to be a recession, as so many
people are predicting right now, manufacturing would appear to be
standing directly in its path.
   In January, notes Rao Chalasani, an analyst at Prescott, Ball &
Turben Inc., a Cleveland-based investment firm, an index he
maintains of 31 manufacturing stocks fell 5.8 percent while the Dow
Jones industrial average gained about 1 percent.
   That action came amid other signs that recession fears were
increasing in the securities markets _ among them a drop in
interest rates and in the price of gold.
   Nevertheless, putting aside the question of where the economical
cycle stands, many analysts argue that there is a strong
``secular,'' or long-term, case for being bullish on American
manufacturing.
   ``Investment strategy decisions frequently key off of the
business cycle,'' said Robert Salomon at Salomon Brothers in a
commentary on the subject. ``Occasionally, however, a secular trend
takes hold.
   ``We believe that the revival of the U.S. manufacturing sector
represents the beginning of a secular trend of a proportion similar
to the disinflation trend experienced earlier in this decade.''
   Maintains Chalasani on a similar note: ``The fundamental secular
trend will remain for many years. Numerous factors can temporarily
check it, but it can be derailed only by cascading financial
accidents.''
   Salomon says that a recession is likely next year, but that the
forces in the economy emphasizing production and deemphasizing
consumption could shape it into something considerably different
from the typical down phase of the business cycle.
   ``If export growth partly offsets weakness in the domestic
economy, as we believe is likely, areas of the economy that are
typically weak during an economic contraction _ notably the
cyclical sectors _ may show surprising strength,'' he reasons.
   At the same time, he says, ``some consumption-oriented
industries _ traditionally perceived as defensive investments _ may
not be the safe havens that they have been in other times.
   ``On balance, the positive secular trend evident in the
manufacturing sector will, to some extent, offset (or at least
dampen) the near-term cyclical weakness.''

<HEAD>Ford Earns Record 1987 Profits; Workers to Share</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 12th graf to UPDATE with amount of profit-sharing
checks.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has out-earned industry leader
General Motors Corp. for the second straight year, a boon to Ford
workers who will receive record profit-sharing checks early next
month.
   The No. 2 automaker's fourth-quarter earnings rose 19 percent
from a year earlier and full-year earnings jumped 41 percent over
1986, but some Wall Street analysts said they had expected Ford to
earn even more.
   For the final three months of 1987, Ford said it earned $932
million, or $1.87 a share, on revenue of $18.8 billion, up from
$785 million, or $1.50 a share, on revenue of $16.26 billion in the
final quarter of 1986.
   For the year, Ford earned $4.6 billion, or $9.05 a share, on
revenue of $71.6 billion, up from 1986 earnings of $3.29 billion,
or $6.16 a share, on revenue of $62.7 billion.
   Earnings for the fourth quarter and the year were both records,
Ford said.
   Per-share earnings in 1986 were readjusted to reflect a
two-for-one stock split on Dec. 10, 1987.
   Market expectations that Ford's earnings would be somewhat
higher for the year and for the quarter depressed the price of Ford
stock after the announcement, said Douglas Laughlin, industry
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   After the announcement, Ford stock fell, finishing down $2.25 a
share at $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The stock's mostly down on a gut reaction to the number but
not on any real conclusive detail. It was a very respectable
quarter and the year has been excellent,'' Laughlin said.
   Thomas O'Grady, analyst with Integrated Automotive Resources
Inc. in Wayne, Pa., said the weaker-than-expected fourth quarter
may have been caused by incentive programs, which were unnecessary
a year earlier when buyers were flooding showrooms to beat 1988 tax
reforms.
   By the end of 1987, Ford's nest egg of cash and marketable
securities had grown to nearly $10.1 billion from $8.6 billion a
year earlier.
   Ford said today its workers will receive an average of more than
$3,700 each in profit-sharing checks. The checks, to be distributed
March 8, are up substantially from the average $2,100 payout that
workers received for 1986.
   GM workers received no share of 1986 or 1987 profits because the
company's U.S. auto earnings were too low.
   Ford's profit-sharing also is based on U.S. earnings, which
jumped nearly 40 percent to $3.44 billion in 1987 from $2.46
billion in 1986 due to higher car and truck sales and increased
production efficiency, Ford said.
   Ford was the only Big Three automaker to sell more cars and
trucks in 1987 than in 1986. Ford's F-series pickup truck was the
best-selling vehicle for the sixth consecutive year and its Escort
subcompact was the best-selling car, followed by the Ford Taurus.
   For 1987, earnings for industry leader GM rose to $3.6 billion,
or $10.06 a share. For Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 automaker, 1987
earnings fell slightly to $1.3 billion, or $5.90 a share.
   Ford attributed its record performance to improved sales
worldwide, strong earnings by subsidiaries and a comfortable
relationship with the United Auto Workers union.
   ``The joint effort by employees, suppliers and dealers in
bringing the consumer high-quality, value-for-the-money products
was the key to 1987 results,'' Ford Chairman Donald Petersen and
Vice Chairman Harold Poling said in a statement.
   Early in the fourth quarter, Ford signed a three-year,
job-protecting labor pact with the UAW that was negotiated without
a strike and helps the company improve production efficiency and
cut costs.
   Among Ford Financial Services Group subsidiaries, Ford Motor
Credit Co. earned a record $678.8 million for the year, up 11
percent, while First Nationwide Financial Corp.'s earnings fell 38
percent to $63 million.
   Together, the financial subsidiaries, including U.S. Leasing
International Inc. which Ford acquired in the fourth quarter,
contributed more than 18 percent of Ford's 1987 net earnings.

<HEAD>Dollar Recovering From Historic Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The worst appears over for the dollar but the U.S.
currency isn't likely to rise much further, a growing number of
European foreign exchange experts say.
   Almost two months after the dollar hit record lows against the
Japanese yen and the West German mark and a six-year low against
the British pound, the dollar has partly recovered and is holding
steady in a narrow range.
   ``We've certainly seen the bottom, without any doubt,'' John
Harris, an analyst with commodities broker Rudolf Wolff and Co.,
said Friday. ``We have turned around.''
   Other analysts made similar assessments, though many agreed that
the dollar will not move much higher in the forseeable future.
   ``This is the top for the dollar,'' said Paul Chertkow, director
of currency economics at the London investment firm Hoare Govett
Ltd.
   Part of the reason, is that the central banks of the major
industrial nations _ which spent billions in their own currencies
buying dollars to steady foreign exchange rates _ won't let the
dollar rise much further, Harris said.
   ``They wouldn't want to see the dollar suddenly take off. There
has been a definite attempt to bring some stabiltiy to the foreign
exchange markets,'' Harris said.
   Currency experts disagree, however, about whether the dollar
will continue to hold steady or will relinquish a portion of its
recent gains.
   Chris Johns, a currency economist with the investment firm
Phillips and Drew, said, ``My best guess is that we'll get a fairly
long period of stability now, until the middle of the year.''
   But Chertkow said: ``The next major move for the dollar will be
lower.''
   Particularly bearish, Chertkow said the markets could see the
dollar hit new record lows within months.
   The dollar began declining sharply in November over concerns
about the economic impact of the worldwide stock market crash and
the United States' staggering trade and budget deficits.
   On Dec. 31 in London, it hit a record low of 122 Japanese yen, a
record low of 1.5815 West German marks and a six-year low of
$1.8850 against the British pound.
   As of Friday morning in London, the dollar was worth 130.35 yen,
1.7080 West German marks and $1.7460 vs. the British pound.
   A major turning point came early in January, when central banks
set a trap for dollar-selling speculators and pushed up the dollar
with unexpectedly aggressive concerted intervention.
   The speculators who had bet that the dollar would decline
further suffered painful losses and many were frightened out of the
market. They have remained reuluctant to re-attempt more dollar
selling, analysts say.
   At the same time, the foreign exchange markets' attention mostly
has been focused on the U.S. government's merchandise trade reports.
   The latest figures, reported last Friday, showed the deficit
shrank for the second consecutive month to $12.2 billion in
December from $13.2 billion in November.
   Improvements in the trade figures ease fears that the U.S.
government would attempt to lower the deficit by pushing the dollar
down, which makes U.S. goods cheaper abroad and imports more
expensive in the United States.
   ``The trade deficit has turned and the general consensus is that
figures will stay the same or improve over the next few months,''
Harris said.
   He added, ``Although the U.S. budget deficit hasn't been
addressed, it hasn't been a major factor in the market (in recent
weeks). It has been discounted.''
   But Chertkow speculated that people will realize there has been
a lack of real progress in improving the trade and budget deficits,
and that little progress is likely during this U.S. election year.
   ``When the market recognizes that fact, it's going to panic a
little,'' Chertkow said. ``The market has been lulled into a false
sense of security.''

   Prices dipped in dull trading on the London Stock
Exchange Friday, hurt in part by weakness on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed down
6.3 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,729.8.
   Volume was a low 377.8 million shares, compared with 411.3
million Thursday.
   Prices were marked down at the opening in response to a fall
Thursday in New York, brokers said.
   Prices barely moved for the next several hours because of a lack
of trading and interest, they said.
   But prices slipped again in the afternoon when Wall Street
failed to revive at its opening.
   The market currently is lacking direction because it is
receiving contradictory signals about the direction of the economy,
and is waiting for British companies to complete reporting their
1987 results, one broker said.
   Only a few companies have already reported their results, and
the market needs some indication of how Britain's major banks and
industrial concerns are doing, the broker said.

   The California-based Pacific Stock Exchange says
it will join a six-month feasibility study on opening an exchange

   The Pacific Exchange has trading floors in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, and a Honolulu facility would allow greater involvement in
Pacific Basin financial markets, an exchange spokesman said
Thursday.
   The most likely expansion would mean adding a third trading
floor here, although a new exchange operation controlled by the
Pacific Exchange is also a possibility, said the spokesman, Don
Alexander.
   What makes Hawaii an attractive site is its mid-Pacific time
zone, he said. A Hawaii exchange could trade during the gap between
the close of exchanges in the mainland United States and the
beginning of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The exchange could operate from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Hawaii
time, which is 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST, Alexander said.

<HEAD>Ford Could Pay $1.75 Million in Penalties in Air Pollution Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. would pay $1.75 million in
penalties and close two vinyl-coating production lines to settle an
air pollution case at a plant in Mount Clemens, Mich., the Justice
Department announced Friday.
   The government filed a proposed consent decree requiring Ford to
pay the penalties for discharging excessive amounts of volatile
organic compounds in violation of the Clean Air Act.
   The decree, filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit, would
settle a civil complaint filed in 1984 and would be the largest
penalty ever assessed against a company in a case brought by the
government involving volatile organic compounds.
   The complaint said the violations occurred at eight coating
lines where production printers applied coatings to vinyl products
used in construction of seats, door panels and vinyl roofs.
   Six of the lines were operated without any pollution control
equipment and the coatings contained solvents made of the volatile
compounds, which were released into the air and contributed to the
pollutant ozone, the government said. In significant
concentrations, ozone can reduce lung function and increase the
incidence of respiratory and heart diseases.
   The proposed decree will become final on entry by the court
following a 30-day public comment period.
   Ford closed six of the lines in 1984 and 1985, and the decree
requires the company to close the other two no later than 90 days
after the decree becomes final.

<HEAD>Report Finds U.S. Treasuries Did Poorly Against Most Foreign
Securities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For those well-heeled investors who dabble in
foreign debt securities, the grass was a lot greener on the other
side during 1987.
   Weighed down by the sinking dollar, the U.S. Treasury bond
market performed dismally in comparison with other world markets,
although it appeared to be off to a better start this year.
   Salomon Brothers' World Government Bond Index showed that
Treasuries had a total rate of return of only 1.93 percent,
compared with an average return of 35.15 percent in dollar value
for eight other major world markets. Total return includes price
change, interest income and currency fluctuations.
   ``That's such a big difference. It's the widest margin in our
history'' of indexing global bond markets, said Carol A. Russo, a
Salomon Brothers research analyst.
   The domestic government bond market performed about half as well
as the others in 1986 _ 15.73 percent vs. 31.35 percent. In 1985,
the U.S. bond market provided a rate of return of 20.94 percent vs.
35.01 percent for the foreign markets, according to Salomon.
   Even the second-worst performer in 1987, the Canadian bond
market, had a rate of return eight times better than that of
domestic government bonds _ 10.01 percent in dollar value and 3.62
percent in local currency, Miss Russo said.
   The top performer was the British gilt market, which had a total
rate of return of 46.58 percent in dollar value and 15.51 percent
in local currency. The results reflected a coordinated effort to
drive down interest rates, as well as the dollar's decline against
the British pound, Miss Russo said.
   Other annual rankings, according to Salomon, included: Japan,
38.11 percent in dollar value, 5.96 percent in local currency;
Switzerland, 32.59 percent, 4.56 percent; the Netherlands, 32.11
percent, 7.55 percent; Germany, 29.38 percent, 5.80 percent;
Australia, 29 percent, 18.84 percent; and France, 26.6 percent,
5.84 percent.
   All this translated into some healthy returns for investors who
either purchased these foreign securities individually or got into
an international bond mutual fund.
   International funds had an average rate of return of 25.07
percent in 1987, second only to gold funds, whose rate of return
averaged 35.43 percent, according to Mutual Fund Values, a
Chicago-based publication that tracks nearly 800 mutual funds.
   During the same time, Treasury bond mutual funds had an average
return of negative 0.12 percent, the publication said.
Government-backed mortgage-related funds had a 0.57 percent return,
and general government bond funds, which include both types of
securities, had a return of 1.55 percent, it said.
   Economists blame the sharp drop in U.S. government bond prices _
and the accompanyingrise in interest rates prevalent through most
of last year _ on fears of higher inflation stemming from rising
oil prices and the dollar's weakness in foreign exchange.
   The market took a turn for the better after the Oct. 19 stock
market crash, when the Federal Reserve decided to ease its credit
policies to prevent a possible recession.
   The market's performance in Salomon's January index also showed
significant improvement.
   Treasuries ranked second in total investment returns, gaining
nearly 3.5 percent in value last month. First was the Canadian
market, which rose 6.7 percent in dollar value.
   Australia came in third, followed by France, Japan, Britain, the
Netherlands, West Germany and Switzerland, Salomon said.

<HEAD>Study: Crash Shifted Balance of Power in Banking Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The balance of power in the banking industry has
shifted dramatically since the October stock market crash, leaving
many of the nation's largest institutions vulnerable to takeovers,
a study released Friday said.
   The report by MAC Group, a Cambridge-based financial research
firm, rated 19 of the 50 largest U.S. banking institutions as
susceptible to takeover as of the end of last year, compared with
just four by Sept. 30.
   ``In effect there's a new group of very strong institutions
beyond the traditionally large institutions,'' said William T.
Gregor, a MAC Group senior vice president.
   The study measured the ratio of a bank's stock market value to
its book value _ its worth based on audited financial statements.
   Gregor said the ``market-to-book ratio'' is a ood predictor of a
bank's long-term performance capabilities. He said the lower an
institution's ratio, the more difficulty it has issuing new stock
to raise capital.
   ``When you're selling below the book value, you're selling for
below what the auditors are saying you're worth,'' Gregor said.
   Bank stocks were hard-hit by the Oct. 19 market crash. The
survey found that from October 31 to December 31, the stock price
of the surveyed banks fell 29 percents.
   The report concluded that:
   _A bank's ability to grow and acquire other companies has become
a critical feature of financial strength.
   _Banks most severly discounted by the crash are under
``unprecedented pressure'' to strengthen performance to stay
independent.
   _Competitive advantage among banks now is more a function of
market value and stock market performance than asset size.
   The 19 banks labeled as vulnerable to takeover all had
market-to-book ratios under 1.0 as of December 30. They included:
BankAmerica Corp., of San Francisco; Bank of Boston Corp., Boston;
Bank of New York Co., New York; Chase Manhattan Corp., New York;
First Chicago Corp., Chicago; Manufacturers Hanover Corp., New
York; Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh; and Security Pacific Corp.,
Los Angeles.
   ``In effect their earning power wasn't severly disadvantaged but
their ability to issue equity and to make acquisitions certainly
was damaged,'' Gregor said.
   A core group of 17 banks that emerged from the crash in better
shape or with limited damage all had ratio's above 1.0, according
to the study. Most weren't large banks in terms of assets.
   They include ``new powerhouses,'' Gregor said, such as
Fleet@Norstar Financial, of Providence, R.I.; Sovran Financial,
Norfolk, Va.; NBD Bancorp Inc., of Detroit; Banc One Corp.,
Columbus, Ohio; and Corestates Financial of Philadelphia.
   ``Cleary we're not going to see tomorrow that Fleet has made an
offer for Manufacturers Hanover, but nevertheless its clinically
possible,'' Gregor said. ``I think what we will see is more
frequent acquisitions than in the past. In some cases those may be
for entire institutions or pieces of institutions.''
   New guidelines being considered by the Federal Reserve Board
also could compound problems for hard-hit banks, Gregor said. The
change would require banks to maintain 8 percent of total balance
sheets in capital, 4 percent of which would be in equity.
   ``A number of institutions are going to find it painful and
difficult to do that,'' Gregor said. ``There's going to be even
greater pressure on capital and therefore on earnings.''

   The stock market headed higher in late trading
today, continuing its recent flirtation with the 2,000 level in the
Dow Jones industrial average.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips rose 8.78 to 1,995.19 by 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 4 to 3 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 815 up, 599
down and 504 unchanged.
   Several analysts at major investment firms have lately grown a
bit more optimistic about the outlook for the market, citing signs
of strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
   Buying interest has been evident in some manufacturing stocks
and many of the smaller ``secondary'' issues.
   But investors have remained leery of doing much broad-scale
buying, with memories still fresh of the crash in October and talk
persisting of a recession this year or in 1989.
   In a market that has been closely tuned to news developments,
there were no major government reports or other economic data to
give prices a push in either direction today.
   Texaco climbed 2[ to 42~. Financier T. Boone Pickens sought
regulatory approval to buy a stake in the company, in which another
prominent investor, Carl Icahn, already holds a 14.8 percent
interest.
   Brockway jumped 11[ to 57|. Owens-Illinois said a federal court
denied the Federal Trade Commission's request to block its
$60-a-share bid to acquire Brockway.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.66 to 145.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .78 at 278.70.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.27 million shares with an

   William Paley, the 86-year-old founder and
chairman of CBS, suffered lung and kidney failure after undergoing
emergency surgery last week and remained in critical condition
Friday at a Manhattan hospital.
   ``He's in critical but stable condition with pulmonary and
kidney failure in the ICU (intensive care unit) following emergency
surgery,'' said Elizabeth Erlanger, a spokeswoman for New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``He is currently receiving kidney
dialysis.''
   Contrary to a report last Sunday by a hospital administrator
that Paley was in satisfactory condition, Ms. Erlanger said that he
had been in critical condition since undergoing gall bladder
surgery on Feb. 11.
   Paley built the Columbia Broadcasting System from a fledgling
radio network that he bought in 1928. He controlled it for more
than half a century before turning over the reins in 1983.
   When CBS's biggest stockholder, Loew's Corp., became unhappy
with his successor's policies, Paley teamed with Loew's chairman
Lawrence Tisch to retake control in 1986.

<HEAD>Minstar Revives Plans to Merge With Boating Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minstar Inc. has revived plans to merge with
its boating subsidiary, offering to acquire the Genmar Industries
Inc. shares it does not already own and some of the company's
outstanding debt for about $85 million.
   An earlier proposed $559 million acquisition of Minstar by
Genmar, both of which are controlled by Minneapolis financier Irwin
Jacobs, fell apart last year when the stocks of both companies
plummeted in the October market crash before shareholders were to
vote on the deal.
   Under terms of the latest transaction, Minstar would pay $11.50
each for the 4.8 million shares, or 16.5 percent, of Genmar that it
does not own. Minstar also would pay $29.4 million for Genmar
debentures with a principal amount of $35.4 million.
   Genmar traded at $10.75, up 12{ cents from Wednesday's close,
and Minstar traded at $22.75, unchanged from Wednesday, in national
over-the-counter trading Thursday.
   After the initial proposal was canceled, Jacobs had said Minstar
would sell its sporting equipment and energy services businesses,
leaving Minstar essentially a powerboat maker.
   Jacobs also had indicated that, after determining the prices
Minstar could get for those units, he would consider some other way
of combining Minstar and Genmar.
   Last month, Minstar said it had received bids for all the
sporting goods and energy businesses and estimated that they would
sell for $370 million to $400 million.
   Jacobs said Wednesday he expected to announce buyers for the
energy operations and the Ben Hogan golf equipment businesses next
week. He said negotiations for the other operations are continuing
with several possible buyers.
   With those divestitures complete, Minstar will be left with its
majority ownership of Genmar's boating operations. Jacobs said the
acquisition of Genmar would help boost Minstar's market value by
making it a ``pure play,'' a company that investors and analysts
can assess solely by its performance in the boat business.
   Jacobs heads an investment group that owns more than half of
Minstar's stock.

<HEAD>State Seeks TMIC Liquidation, But Weighs Alternatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California regulators sought Superior Court
approval Friday to liquidate troubled TMIC Insurance Co., which has
been operating under state conservatorship for two years.
   The problems of TMIC, formerly known as Ticor Mortgage Insurance
Co., stem from the $1.4 billion default of Equity Programs
Investment Corp., or EPIC, a Virginia-based land syndicator that
had acquired 20,000 properties for tax-shelters partnerships.
   TMIC, one of the nation's five largest mortgage insurers, had
insured about 45 percent of the EPIC properties.
   TMIC's problems have steadily deepened over the past two years,
and state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said a new
actuarial study completed Thursday afternoon indicated TMIC's
liabilities exceeded assets by $169 million as of Dec. 31.
   Making matters worse, the study estimated that TMIC faces a
future gap of $254 million between liabilities and assets.
   However, Ms. Gillespie's spokeswoman, Carey Fletcher, said the
insurance commissioner remains hopeful an alternative to
liquidation can be worked out before an April 6 court hearing set
for the state's request.
   ``This gives them time to seek if something else can be put
together,'' Ms. Fletcher said. ``One is always hopeful.''
   Further talks are planned between state regulators, other
mortgage insurers, the Federal National Mortgage Association, known
as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie
Mac.
   State regulators met last Monday in Chicago with representatives
of 13 major mortgage insurers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an
effort to find a way to keep TMIC's mortgage insurance in force or
establish a new company to assume the insurance.
   The biggest effect of a TMIC liquidation would be felt by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac. The two agencies bought TMIC-insured
mortgages, then sold them as elements of securities on which the
agencies guaranteed interest and principal payments.
   Earlier this week, Fannie Mae said about 1.5 percent, or $3
billion, of the conventional mortgage loans in its portfolio and
its outstanding mortgage-backed securities are insured by TMIC. The
amount includes those related to EPIC, Fannie Mae said.
   Late last month, state regulators halted payments on 6,600 TMIC
properties on which $485 million in principal remained due. Deeds
to those properties have been offered to lenders in lieu of
foreclosure.
   In all, TMIC has issued mortgage insurance on $1.6 billion in
loans. Because it typically insures about 25 percent of the value
of a mortgage, TMIC has a risk of about $400 million.

<HEAD>Publisher Says His Fortune Will be Left to Charity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Robert Maxwell announced Friday that his
family fortune will be given away to worthy causes and he will
leave nothing for his children.
   The report in the Maxwell-owned Daily Mirror was the British
publisher's response to critics who have accused him of funneling
profits to Liechtenstein, a central European duchy and tax haven.
   The report, under Maxwell's byline, said the fortune held by the
family-owned Pergamon foundation in Liechtenstein ``is all to be
given away _ and nothing will go to his children.''
   ``Massive sums from the foundation, which is worth more than 1
billion bounds ($1.75 billion) and whose present income is
estimated at 25 million pounds, will go to medical research and to
help Israel's Jews and Arabs find peace,'' the report said.
   Funds would also go toward helping young entrepreneurs break
into the communications field, improving education and eliminating
conflicts and racial hostilities.
   The allegation that Maxwell's financial holdings are shrouded in
secrecy has sometimes been used against him by companies fighting
off takeover bids by the publisher.
   The Mirror said the planned fate of the fortune is revealed in a
forthcoming authorized biography of Maxwell by Joe Haines,
political editor of the Mirror newspapers group.
   It said Haines told Maxwell he wanted to include information
about ``the mystery of Liechtenstein,'' to which Maxwell is quoted
as replying: ``There is no mystery,'' and then detailing his plans
to give the money away.
   The report quoted Maxwell's son Ian as saying: ``I and all of my
sisters and brothers have always known that the wealth my father
helped to create would be returned for the benefit of science and
medicine. We are all delighted and welcome it.''

<HEAD>Loses Round in American Standard Takeover Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. has won a legal round in
its battle to escape a hostile $2.03 billion takeover attempt from
power-tool maker Black & Decker Corp.
   A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday rejected Black & Decker's
effort to stop American Standard from seeking court validation of
its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan in Delaware, where the
manufacturer is incorporated.
   Judge Robert Ward's action affirmed American Standard's position
that any litigation concerning the plan, designed to make an
unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive, should be heard in a
Delaware court.
   The legal wrangling was part of an increasingly complicated
battle between American Standard and Black & Decker, which
undertook the hostile takeover attempt in January.
   Last week, American Standard rejected a sweetened $65-a-share
offer from Black & Decker and said it was pursuing alternatives.
   On Thursday, American Standard Inc.'s board of directors
approved a multibillion-dollar recapitalization plan, which would
pay stockholders $64 a share in cash and junk bonds, along with
stock in the recapitalized company.
   That plan also would saddle the company with new debt to finance
the recapitalization, in which a company realigns its levels of
debt and equity. Such a strategy has become a common takeover
defense because the company often acquires a big debt load that
discourages potential acquirers.

<HEAD>Underlying Problems Remain, But All's Quiet On Economic Front</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All's quiet on the economic front, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan declared this past week, and most
economists were inclined to agree.
   True, the economy remains at risk of slipping into a mild,
election-year recession _ some economists say one has already begun.
   True, too, the huge trade and budget deficits will eventually
have to come down, and the transition could be painful.
   But in spite of all the problems, Greenspan was onto something
in remarks this past Tuesday after a speech to the Bretton Woods
Committee.
   ``The relationships at the moment among all the major financial
variables seem to be in relative balance,'' Greenspan told the
private group of economists, executives and former government
officials.
   ``For the moment, we are in equilibrium,'' he added.
   Such words could not have been spoken four months ago, when the
chief of the nation's central bank was pledging to inject money
into the banking system to protect the economy from the worst crash
in Wall Street history.
   Aftershocks of the crash that wiped out half a trillion dollars
in stock value in a single day seem to have been slight.
   In recent days the outward measures of the economy have been
almost monotonous. Not great, but not terrible, either.
   The dollar has hung around 130 Japanese yen, the Dow Jones
industrial average has stuck close to 2,000 points and the yield on
the Treasury's 30-year bond has evened out at a little under 8.5
percent.
   Of course, the markets have shown themselves to be capable of
sliding into chaos with less than a moment's notice. But so far, so
good.
   ``One of the advantages a Fed chairman has in testifying before
Congress is it only has to be true until he leaves the table,''
observed Robert C. Holland, a former Fed official and president of
the Washington-based Committee for Economic Development.
   ``There's no driving force (in the markets). Fearful
expectations seem to be tranquilized at the moment,'' Holland said.
   Analysts took Greenspan's remarks to mean that the Fed had no
intention of pushing interest rates lower to stave off a possible
recession, the formula pushed by an odd mixture of liberals and
election-minded Republicans.
   President Reagan is nervous that the central bank could spoil
his final year in office by inadvertently triggering a recession.
   ``There appears to be no need, at present, for restrictive
monetary measures,'' the administration said Thursday in the
economic outlook section of its 1989 budget proposal.
   The Reagan administration is doing its own part to keep the
economy growing through that old GOP nemesis, deficit spending.
Reagan's final budget request provides for a 1989 deficit of $130
billion, and it could turn out far larger in case of a slowdown.
   Greenspan's steady-as-she-goes strategy is earning respect even
from the kind of economists who ordinarily lobby for stronger
economic growth, such as Princeton University's Alan Blinder.
   ``There is a serious question now as to how much lower we can
push the unemployment rate,'' now at 5.8 percent, Blinder said this
past week.
   ``We ought to be judiciously nudging the rate down, watching the
inflationary signals at each step of the way. But you've got to be
wary,'' he said.
   Greenspan, Blinder said, is exhibiting ``quite a prudent
attitude.''

   Oil prices rose moderately late Friday, but

42-gallon barrel, up 25 cents from the Thursday close.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline rose 0.46 cent a gallon to 46.43 cents, and
wholesale home heating oil rose 0.72 cent a gallon to 45.80 cents.
   Much of the action was attributed to short-covering, a
price-raising influence caused by traders who buy oil to replace
borrowed oil they had sold earlier. Short-covering can raise prices
sharply but it is generally a temporary trend.

   New York Post owner Rupert Murdoch today
re-entered negotiations seeking union concessions and stopped the
clock on his deadline for closing the nation's oldest continuously
published daily newspaper.
   Just after his 2 p.m. deadline, Murdoch slipped out of
negotiations and told reporters in a hallway that the clock had
been stopped for 15 minutes.
   The extension continued for two hours with no word from either
camp, as Murdoch and his management team went to a separate room
for discussion.
   At 4 p.m., union leaders and Murdoch spokesman Howard Rubenstein
said both sides were breaking for food.
   But union leader George McDonald said Murdoch was using the time
to meet with Peter Kalikow, the prospective buyer of the Post.
   ``They're on their way over to see him to talk about something
we discussed,'' McDonald said, without elaborating.
   At the same time, at the Post's offices, reporters and editors
were working on a Saturday edition.
   As recently as this morning, Murdoch had vowed he would not stop
the clock.
   Murdoch has demanded the unions make $24 million worth of
concessions over three years so that he can close a $37 million
deal to sell the paper to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow.
   Murdoch has said that without the savings, he was folding the
paper, whose ownership has put him in conflict with federal
regulations barring anyone from running a newspaper and television
station in the same city.
   The Post's unions have put forward a savings package they say
amounts to $33 million, a figure management has called overstated
by $12 million.
   Two major sticking points have been union insistence on a raise
for workers and the gap between the total savings management
demanded and what it agreed to recognize of the unions' proposed
concessions, according to Theodore Kheel, a consultant to the
unions.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group for Post
unions, and the delivery truck drivers' union met separately to
consider how to come up with the difference.
   ``I am very optimistic'' about reaching agreement by 2 p.m.,
said Council President George McDonald. ``If we fall short, either
side, it would be really a disgrace and a disservice for the
employees and also the people of New York for losing another
paper.''
   The council offered a package Wednesday that union leaders said
would save $33 million over three years _ $9 million more than
Murdoch demanded. The unions proposed using the difference to fund
a wage increase.
   But management rejected a $12 million plank of the plan _
abolishing pre-shift overtime _ as non-negotiable under the terms
of Murdoch's contract with Kalikow, leaving the two sides in
agreement on just $21 million in savings.
   ``I would not call this negotiation,'' Kheel said. ``This is
more of an exercise in trying to fit results to preordained
criteria, an ultimatum.''
   The Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union proposed saving $3
million by cutting 30 jobs, part of 116 job buyouts at the paper,
and extending the work week by a half-hour, said Jerry Cronin, the
union's president.
   The unions, meanwhile, lost a bid to have the National Labor
Relations Board issue a complaint or block the threatened closing.
   In his contract with Kalikow, Murdoch has until Feb. 22 to
negotiate the union concessions, three days past his stated
deadline.
   Murdoch chose to sell the Post following congressional action
that blocked the Federal Communications Commission from granting
him a continuation of a waiver of its rule against owning a
newspaper and a television station in the same city. Murdoch also
owns WNYW-TV in New York.
   He faces a similar situation in Boston, where he owns the Boston
Herald and WFXT-TV. He has said he would sell the TV station if
forced to choose.
   Murdoch says he has lost nearly $150 million since purchasing
the Post 11 years ago. The paper was founded by Alexander Hamilton
in 1801.

   The National Broadcasting Co. said Friday it had
tentatively agreed to sell five radio stations to Emmis
Broadcasting Corp., a privately-held concern based in Indianapolis,
for $121.5 million.
   NBC had previously disclosed it was looking for buyers for its
seven radio stations, and reaffirmed that it hoped to sell the
remaining stations.
   The stations which would be sold to Emmis Broadcasting under a
letter of intent are WNBC-AM and WYNY-FM in New York, WJIB-FM in
Boston, WKQX-FM in Chicago and KYUU-FM in San Francisco.
   The sale is subject to a definitive agreement by the companies
and approval by their respective boards of directors, the
announcement from NBC said.
   The sale would leave NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric Co.,
with radio stations WKYS in Washington, D.C., and KNBR in San
Francisco. The company has said it hopes to sell the Washington
station to a minority group.
   Emmis Broadcasting, which was founded in 1980 and claims to be
the largest privately-held radio broadcasting company in the United
States, already owns seven radio stations, including two in New
York City, WFAN-AM and WQHT-FM.
   The announcement said Emmis would have to ``resolve ownership
conflict in New York'' if the sale were completed. Federal
regulations prohibit companies from owning more than one AM and one
FM radio station in a single media market, according to a spokesman
for NBC, Dom Giofre.
   Emmis president Jeffrey Smulyan said that no decision has been
made on which of the four New York stations would be sold.
   In addition to the two New York stations, Emmis owns KPWR-FM in
Los Angeles; WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C.; KSHE-FM in St. Louis;
WLOL-FM in Minneapolis; and WENS-FM in Indianapolis.
   NBC is rooted in radio broadcasting. Radio Corp. of America
formed NBC in 1926 when it purchased what is now WNBC-AM in New
York.
   RCA and NBC were acquired by GE in 1986 and NBC began reviewing
its radio operations in mid-1987.
   Last summer, it sold its radio network business, which supplies
programming to independent stations, for $50 million to Westwood
One Inc., a radio production and distribution company based in Los
Angeles.
   NBC sold its WMAQ-AM radio station in Chicago earlier this year
for $13 million, Giofre said.

   Wall Street sent Texaco Inc's stock higher
Friday following word that T. Boone Pickens was seeking permission
to buy at least 15 percent of the beleaguered oil giant, a stake
similar to that already held by fellow corporate raider Carl C.
Icahn.
   Texaco, which has been reorganizing itself as it prepares to
emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has been fighting
efforts by Icahn _ its largest shareholder _ to strip the company
of its anti-takeover defenses.
   Company officials have feared that Icahn or another raider would
try to take the company over and sell its assets to boost the value
of their stock.
   The arrival of Pickens on the scene only heightened speculation
that such a attempt may well be in the works.
   In nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues,
Texaco's stock closed Friday at $42.62{ per share, up $1.87{.
   Texaco spokesman K. Peter Maneri said the company learned of
Pickens' action in a Tuesday letter saying Mesa Limited
Partnership, an oil and gas concern controlled by Pickens, had told
the Federal Trade Commission that it wanted to buy more than $15
million worth of Texaco's stock.
   If neither the FTC nor the Justice Department objects, Pickens
would be free to acquire up to 15 percent of Texaco's outstanding
shares. Mesa also asked the government for an speedy review of its
request, which would cut 15 days off the required 30-day waiting
time.
   Speaking to reporters Friday, Texaco president James W. Kinnear
said he had ``no idea'' what Pickens' intentions were, and that the
company was capable of warding off any threatening moves by Pickens
or Icahn.
   ``I think we have appropriate bylaws and charter provisions to
make sure our shareholders' wealth is protected,'' he said.
   Icahn, who controls at least 14.8 percent of Texaco's 243
million shares, has said he would seek to install himself and four
associates on the company's board of directors, and has been
pressing the nation's third-largest oil company to remove
anti-takeover provisions contained in its charter.
   Pickens told the New York Times Thursday that he would support
Icahn in that effort. Andrew Craig, a spokesman for Pickens, said
Friday there would be no comment on Mesa's Texaco filing.
   Pickens and Icahn are well known in the oil patch.
   In 1984, Mesa picked up $213 million after a run Pickens made on
Gulf Oil Co. led to its sale to Chevron Corp. Mesa then offered
$9.3 billion for Phillips Petroleum Co., only to accept a $80
million profit when Phillips bought the shares back in 1985.
   Soon afterward, Icahn led a group of investors with an $8.1
billion bid for Phillips that led to another stock buyback and a
$50 million profit for Icahn.
   Several analysts suggested Friday that Icahn and Pickens could
profit by making simultaneous attacks on Texaco, even if they do
not cooperate directly.
   Gary E. Hindes, chairman of Delaware Bay Co., an investment
firm, said he believed the two are working together _ if only by
``a wink and a nod'' _ and that they would attempt to take control
of Texaco's board of directors.
   ``This is a major play under way,'' said George J. Gaspar, an
analyst with the Milwaukee investment firm of Robert W. Baird & Co.
Inc.
   ``I don't know what Mr. Pickens is trying to prove. I think
Texaco is bigger than Icahn and Pickens together,'' he said. ``This
may be a prelude to a larger plan.''
   ``You've got serious problems with exploration and production
(of oil) in the U.S. So obviously Icahn is going to try to exploit
that. And Pickens is just going to ride along.''
   ``Other oil companies would be happy to carve into some of
Texaco's assets,'' he observed.
   In fact, Texaco has already announced its intention to sell off
some assets while selling partial shares of others to third parties
in an effort to raise at least $3 billion after it emerges from
bankruptcy.
   Targeted assets reportedly include several refineries and some
oil reserves that are no longer profitable.
   Not included are Texaco Canada Inc. and Texaco's half-share in
P.T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia _ big money-makers that would be
juicy targets to a raider.
   On Thursday, it was reported that Texaco and Saudi Arabia were
negotiating a $1 billion deal whereby Texaco would sell a half
interest in two gulf coast refineries to the Saudis.
   On Friday, Kinnear declined to discuss that report, saying he
did not want to ``negotiate in a fishbowl.''
   Texaco sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last April to
avoid having to post a potentially ruinous bond while appealing a
$10.3 billion judgment held against the company by Pennzoil Co.
   A Houston jury awarded the judgment to Pennzoil after ruling
that Texaco had improperly interfered with a Pennzoil plan to
acquire part of Getty Oil Co. _ and acquired Getty itself.
   As part of its proposed reorganization plan, Texaco agreed to
settle the case by paying Pennzoil $3 billion in cash. It hopes to
emerge from bankruptcy protection in April.

<HEAD>Boeing Begins Test of 737-400</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto SE3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest model of the best-selling Boeing 737
jetliner made its maiden flight Friday, the first step on the way
to Federal Aviation Administration certification later this year.
   About 450 hours of test flights will be done before
certification. The first three 737-400s are to be delivered to
Piedmont Airlines.
   The first 737-400 was rolled out at Boeing's Renton assembly
plant Jan. 26. Boeing made it a gala day, rolling out the first
747-400 the same day in Everett. That jetliner begins test flights
next month.
   The 737-400 is a stretch version of Boeing's workhorse jet. It
is slightly more than 119 feet long and can carry 146 to 168
passengers as far as 3,200 miles without refueling.
   With 1,925 orders as of Dec. 31, the 737 series is the world's
most popular jet.
   As with the smaller 737-300, which entered service in 1984, the
new plane features fuel-efficient engines, advanced avionics and
instruments and improvements in aerodynamics.
   Nine customers have ordered 88 of the 737-400s and hold options
for another 35.

   The stock market jumped ahead Friday on a late
outburst of buying that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average
past the 2,000 level to a six week-high.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 28.18 points to
2,014.59, its highest close since it stood at 2,051.89 on Jan. 7.
For the past week the average showed a net gain of 31.33.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 988 up, 491 down and 483 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 180.30 million shares, against 151.43
million in the previous session.
   Several analysts at major investment firms have lately grown a
bit more optimistic about the outlook for the market, citing signs
of strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
   Buying interest has been evident in some manufacturing stocks
and many of the smaller ``secondary'' issues.
   After a rally last week that carried over to Tuesday, the market
flattened out for a couple of days. But no concerted selling
pressure developed.
   Newton Zinder, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said that
encouraged traders to step in and buy before the weekend.
   Brokers also said the market might have benefited from
computer-program activity by professional traders involving an
expiring stock-index futures contract.
   Texaco climbed 1~ to 42|. Financier T. Boone Pickens sought
regulatory approval to buy a stake in the company, in which another
prominent investor, Carl Icahn, already holds a 14.8 percent
interest.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, up 2{ at
44}; DuPont, up 1} at 85; Merck, up 2{ at 161\; Philip Morris, up
1{ at 90|, and American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 29{.
   Airline stocks were strong, helping to lift the Dow Jones
average of 20 transportation stocks 19.28 points to 815.54.
   Brockway jumped 11 to 57{. Owens-Illinois said a federal court
denied the Federal Trade Commission's request to block its
$60-a-share bid to acquire Brockway.
   Phillips Petroleum rose 1 to 15\. The company said it would have
a $25 million gain in the current quarter from the settlement of a
gas contract dispute.
   On the downside, Pannill Knitting fell { to 5{. The company
reported fourth quarter earnings of 53 cents a share, against
operating profits of 50 cents in the last three months of 1986.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $25.82 billion, or
1.01 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.82 to 146.96.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 202.85 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 4.50 to 301.48,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.70 at 261.61.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.49 to 357.12. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 280.16, up 2.24.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance against
major foreign currencies Friday, failing to hold gains made late in
the previous trading session.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York reported a
late bid of $445 for a troy ounce of gold, up from $442.80 late
Thursday.
   In the absence of significant news, the dollar finished the day
higher than it had been Thursday in Europe, but lower than the
levels attained in Thursday's late rally in New York.
   Thursday's rally was attributed to technical factors and
President Reagan's statement that he wanted to rescue a kidnap
victim in Lebanon. International tension tends to increase interest
in dollars as a safe haven.
   The dollar dropped Friday in Europe against the Swiss franc
after Swiss National Bank President Pierre Languetin said he hoped
central banks would sell dollars if the American currency rose too
sharply, dealers said.
   Otherwise, ``U.S. dollar trading was actually non-existent
today,'' said Rod Fowler, foreign-exchange manager for Wood Gundy
Inc. in Toronto.
   ``At the moment we're in a stalemate situation'' between bulls
and bears on the dollar, said David Godwin, chief currency dealer
for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
   The British pound fell to $1.7505 from $1.7508 in London. Later
in New York the pound finished at $1.7495, down from earlier in the
day but up from its price of $1.7418 late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 130.53 Japanese yen from
130.00 yen on Thursday. In later London trading, the dollar slipped
to 130.02 yen. By the end of the trading day in New York, the
dollar stood at 130.05 yen, down from 130.38 yen late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Thursday, included: 1.7080 West German marks, down from 1.7123;
1.3980 Swiss francs, down from 1.4098; 5.7755 French francs, down
from 5.7870; 1,256.75 Italian lire, down from 1,261.00; and 1.2737
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2706.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.7075 West German marks, up from 1.7040; 1.3985
Swiss francs, down from 1.4010; 5.7675 French francs, up from
5.7555; 1.9150 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9130; 1,257.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,254.63; and 1.2702 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2690.
   Gold bullion dropped to $441 in early trading in Europe, then
rallied somewhat when traders bought dollars either to limit losses
or trade in on the metal's earlier decline.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $442.90 a troy
ounce, down from $444 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, it fell to $443 bid from $447.50 bid late Thursday.
   Hong Kong markets were closed for the Chinese New Year.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold was bid late at
$445.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $442.80.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $6.37 a troy
ounce, down from $6.43 bid late Thursday. On New York's Comex,
silver for current delivery was bid at $6.385 a troy ounce, down
from $6.43 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Hit 14-Month High On Tight Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures for near-term delivery surged above $1.40 a pound
Friday for the first time since December 1986 on persistent
concerns about the scarcity of high-quality beans.
   On other markets, cattle futures advanced sharply while pork
futures were mixed; grains and soybeans, precious metals, energy
futures and stock-index futures all moved higher.
   Coffee futures prices on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange have risen steadily since last September, when the
International Coffee Organization began considering a return to
export quotas for producer countries.
   The export limits were reimposed last October and they, along
with late harvests in many Central and South American countries,
have resulted in tight supplies of high-grade coffee beans,
especially the preferred ``mild'' arabica beans, analysts said.
   Fears that the supply problem could continue were exacerbated
Thursday when the Agriculture Department estimated the 1988
Brazilian coffee crop would total 25 million bags, down sharply
from the record 35.2 million bags harvested last year by the
world's major coffee producer.
   ``Basically the feeling is bullish with the shortage of milds,''
said Kim Badenhop, an analyst in New York for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   Coffee settled 1.82 cents to 3.49 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $1.4074 a pound.
   Cattle for April and June delivery advanced the 1.5-cent limit
for daily trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other
cattle contracts also were up sharply in a stunning reversal from
Thursday's steep losses.
   The market was looking ahead to a mid-year decline in cattle
supplies foreshadowed by last month's USDA cattle inventory report,
said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc.
   ``You had a very highly charged emotional situation out there
today and I think you're probably going to see these kinds of days
happen more frequently in coming weeks as we come to grips with the
potential bull market of 1988,'' Stanley said.
   Hog prices gained support from the rally in the neighboring
cattle pits, but frozen pork belly futures retreated in
anticipation of increased pork production, Stanley said.
   Live cattle were .95 cent to 1.50 cents higher with February at
72.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to 1.20 cents
higher with March at 83.55 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower
to .62 cent higher with February at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .03 cent to .48 cent lower with February at 53.67
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade after a wild session in the soybean pit.
   Soybeans for March delivery soared to $6.45 a bushel, a new high
for the contract, on heavy speculative buying and
``short-covering'' by traders seeking to protect themselves from
losses.
   The rally spread to the neighboring grain pits, but soybean
prices collapsed minutes before the close in massive profit-taking,
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The
March contract finally settled at $6.31 a bushel, up 2{ cents from
Thursday.
   ``It was the biggest day we've seen in I can't remember how
long,'' Lespinasse said.
   Mickey Luth, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
the soybean rally was based largely on perceptions that the acreage
available for soybean planting this spring is too small to satisfy
the demand for soybeans.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 6 cents higher with March at $3.22
a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 2} cents higher with March at
$2.00{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with March
at $1.91} a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 6} cents higher with
March at $6.31 a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures posted modest gains on New York's
Commodity Exchange in reaction to a slight weakening of the dollar
and higher crude oil prices, said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $2.20 higher with the active April
contract at $448 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 5 cents
higher with March at $6.40 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
technically inspired trading, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 30 cents
higher with March at $16.70 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent to
.89 cent higher with March at 45.80 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .35 cent to .47 cent higher with March at 46.43 cents
a gallon.
   Stock-index futures gained on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 4.65 points higher at 262.95 points. The underlying
spot index was up 3.7 points at 261.61.

<HEAD>Polaroid Seeks $5.7 Billion in Damages From Eastman Kodak In
Patent Case</HEAD>

   Polaroid Corp. said Friday it has asked a federal
court for $5.7 billion in damages from the Eastman Kodak Co., which
was found in 1985 to have infringed on Polaroid patents in the
instant photography market.
   The request marks the latest development in a 12-year-old case
that forced Kodak out of its $200 million-a-year instant
photography business.
   In a statement, Kodak called the $5.7 billion damages claim
``ludicrous and ridiculously inflated.''
   ``The claim (is) an exercise in fantastic and fanciful
speculation wholly divorced from any facts that Polaroid could
conceivably prove,'' the Kodak statement said.
   ``To construct its claim, Polaroid has endowed itself with
perfect foresight, perfect management and labor, perfect production
equipment and supplies and a perfect non-competitive environment,''
it added.
   Both sides have been filing documents in the damages case for
the last eight months. A hearing is set for March 18 but a trial
date has not yet been set.
   U.S. District Court Judge Rya Zobel ruled in September 1985 that
Kodak, when it tried to enter the instant photography market, had
infringed on a handful of about 150 Polaroid patents on instant
cameras and instant film.
   Early in the suit, which was filed in April 1976, Zobel divided
the case into separate trials on the infringement claims and
potential damage awards.
   At Kodak's request, Zobel ordered Polaroid to release its damage
request on Friday.
   ``The judge simply required at Kodak's request that both sides
make public information we have filed over the last several months
with regard to the damages suit,'' Polaroid spokesman Harry Johnson
said.
   ``The two sides obviously have totally divergent perspectives on
this,'' he added.
   Johnson declined to comment on the $5.7 billion damage request.
   Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., charged Polaroid with seeking
to recover 10 times as much in damages as its after-tax net
earnings from 1976-84, and almost twice its revenues from selling
instant cameras and film.
   After a five-month trial in 1985, Zobel ruled that Kodak had
infringed on Polaroid's patents and ordered Kodak to stop making
and selling instant cameras and instant film as of Jan. 9, 1986.
   Kodak lost its final appeal in the case in the U.S. Supreme
Court, which in October 1986 refused to hear arguments in the case.
   In the original trial and appeals, Polaroid argued that Kodak
has copied its SX-70 instant photo camera, which was introduced in
1972 and produced a color print without requiring the user to
``strip garbage'' or apply chemicals.
   Polaroid, based in Cambridge, Mass., reported 1987 earnings of
$116 million on net sales of $1.76 billion, compared to 1986
earnings of $103.5 million on net sales of $1.63 billion.
   Consumer sales account for about 60 percent of the company's
sales, Johnson said, with the rest in technical and industrial
products.
   Kodak reported 1987 profits of $1.8 billion, or $3.52 a share,
on total sales of $13.3 billion worldwide, compared with profits of
$374 million, or $1.10 cents a share, on total sales of $11.55
billion for 1986.

   Bond prices barely budged Friday in light
trading that brokers attributed to lack of significant news and
reluctance to buy or sell until more economic statistics are
revealed later this month.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue rose about $1.25 per $1,000 in
face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, eased to
8.43 percent from 8.44 percent late Thursday.
   ``It seemed pretty quiet around here today,'' said Carol Stone,
senior economist at Nomura Securities Inc. in New York. ``I think
people are waiting for some news they might learn next week.''
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to report January factory
orders Tuesday, revised fourth-quarter gross national product
Thursday, and January consumer price index Friday.
   Those statistics could provide further insight into whether the
economy is heading into a recession, as some analysts fear, or is
growing vigorously and possibly inciting inflation.
   An economic slowdown would imply lower interest rates and likely
help bond prices. Conversely, signs of inflation would imply higher
interest rates and tend to depress bond prices.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged, while intermediate and long-term
maturities rose [ point, the financial information service Telerate
Inc. reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.04 to 113.31. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 0.42
to 1,184.74.
   Among corporate bonds, industrials and utilities were unchanged
to slightly higher in light trading.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.59 to 282.87.
   Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, general obligations and dollar
bonds both rose about \ point in extremely light trading.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 1 point to 5.67
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 4 basis points to 5.95 percent and year bills
fell 1 basis point to 6.24 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 611-16 percent, up from 6| percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Wall Street Trader Charged In Alleged Plot Against Boesky</HEAD>

   An ``extremely upset'' Wall Street trader
was charged with weapons possession and witness intimidation Friday
after authorities alleged he plotted an attack on convicted
financier Ivan F. Boesky with a loaded semi-automatic rifle.
   The arrest of John A. Mulheren marked the first public
indication of potential violence in a financial scandal surrounding
Boesky and suggested that government investigators are closer to
making new arrests.
   Mulheren, a general partner in the firm Jamie Securities Co.,
was seized near his Rumson, N.J. home Thursday in possession of an
Israeli-made semi-automatic rifle, said Monmouth County Assistant
Prosecutor Alton Kenney.
   Mulheren was ordered held in lieu of $17,500 bail after a
hearing Friday.
   A complaint filed against Mulheren in Freehold alleged the
weapon was to be used ``unlawfully against the person or property''
of Boesky, a former financier whose downfall more than a year ago
shook the financial world.
   The complaint also mentioned a possible attack against Michael
Davidoff, a former head trader for Boesky who is cooperating in a
government investigation of the financial scandal.
   Authorities declined to say why they believed Mulheren was
plotting against Boesky and Davidoff, but Mulheren once was a close
associate of Boesky and reportedly has been implicated in the
government's investigation.
   Meanwhile in Manhattan, federal prosecutors charged Mulheren in
a two-count criminal complaint with attempting to intimidate a
cooperating witness, who was identified only as Witness X, formerly
employed by Boesky. They refused to confirm or deny that Witness X
is Davidoff.
   The federal complaint quoted Mulheren's wife as telling police
he had been ``extremely upset by the Boesky situation'' and ``was
armed and was going to get'' Witness X.
   The complaint said when police seized Mulheren, they found the
loaded rifle as well as Army fatigue-type clothing in a bag in his
car.
   Boesky's whereabouts weren't immediately clear and he could not
be reached for comment. His attorney Harvey L. Pitt did not return
two telephone calls seeking comment. A secretary said he was out of
the office.
   In November 1986 Boesky paid a record $100 million to settle a
Securities and Exchange Commission complaint of insider trading,
the misuse of private information to profit in securities
transactions. He was banished from the securities business for life.
   Last April, Boesky pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of
conspiracy to lie to the SEC, for which he was sentenced to a
three-year prison term in December. He's scheduled to start serving
the sentence next month.
   Boesky has been the government's chief source of information in
a probe of other Wall Street professionals.
   Last September, the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified
people it said were familiar with the investigation as saying
Mulheren was cooperating with the government as a result of
Boesky's disclosures.
   The newspaper also said without attribution that the
investigation could lead to civil and criminal charges against
Mulheren.
   Fred M. Stone, a lawyer for Jamie, said the company's partners
are discussing a course of action in the wake of Mulheren's arrest.
Stone declined to say how many partners were involved in Jamie.
   Stone also released a statement from Mulheren's New York
attorney Otto Obermaier.
   ``It is known that John Mulheren has been upset by the
investigation by regulatory authorities of securities activities
and by the rumors and publicity which developed which he felt
unfairly impugned his honesty and integrity,'' Obermaier said.
   ``The important thing now is for him to get help and support to
permit him to resume a normal and constructive life. He is in the
process of seeking required medical assistance,'' said Obermaier's
statement.
   The New Jersey complaint named Mulheren on charges of unlawful
possession of weapon and intent to use the weapon unlawfully, said
Kenney.
   The possession charge carries a maximum sentence of five years
in prison and $7,500 in fines, while the other charge carries a
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $100,000 in fines upon
conviction, the prosecutor said.
   Kenny said federal authorities in Manhattan had filed papers to
arrest Mulheren if he posted the local bail.
   Kenney said Rumson police went to Mulheren's home Thursday and
received permission from his wife to search the family car, where
police seized a 9mm pistol, a .357-caliber Magnum revolver and a
shotgun. But Mulheren was not arrested then because he was licensed
for the weapons.
   Police began watching Mulheren afterward and later Thursday
stopped him in his car after he left home.
   Kenney said police found a satchel in the car containing the
semi-automatic rifle.
   The prosecutor said Mulheren was then arrested because the rifle
was ``clearly not a sportsmen's weapon'' and, although such
firearms can be owned in New Jersey, a permit is needed to carry
them off private property.

   Eastman Kodak Co. said Friday its
innovative 9-volt lithium batteries, which were supposed to have a
shelf life of 10 years, don't last that long.
   ``Until the problem is corrected, they won't have a storage life
of 10 years,'' said Kodak spokesman Henry Kaska. ``But I don't
think the average consumer is going to run into any difficulty.''
   The company said the problem does not affect the use life of the
batteries, only the amount of time they can sit on store shelves.
   The news prompted Black & Decker Corp. to announce immediate
plans Friday to stop selling mini-flashlights that were designed to
exclusively use Kodak's 9-volt lithium batteries.
   ``We're very concerned with selling the best possible product
and we relied on Kodak's word,'' said Barbara Lucas, a spokeswoman
for the Baltimore-based company. ``We can't very well continue to
be associated with something like this.''
   She said the company planned to notify dealers and ask them to
pull the Lite Years flashlights, introduced last year, and the
recently-announced Just-For-Me line off the shelves immediately.
   She didn't know how many products would have to be pulled off
the shelves, but said the Lite Years line had been selling well.
   When the unique batteries were introduced last year, Kodak
touted them as lasting twice as long as 9-volt alkaline batterie
and having a 10-year shelf life.
   However, routine testing last week by Kodak determined the
batteries don't last that long on store shelves or in car glove
compartments, especially when they're used in ``high-drain''
products such as flashlights, Kaska said.
   Kodak officials, who told Black & Decker about the problem, said
the shortened shelf life is caused by a buildup of resistance
inside the battery that prevents full current from being
transmitted.
   The problem is much more noticeable in products where a great
deal of current is needed, rather than ``medium drain'' products,
like smoke detectors or calculators.
   Kaska said the problem would be corrected, however, within a few
weeks, and the claim of 10 years of shelf life would be accurate
once again.
   ``We understand the problem. We know how to fix it and will do
so quickly,'' said James Moxley, president of Ultra Technologies,
the Kodak subsidiary that makes and sells batteries.
   He said the problem, which was discovered last week in ongoing
storage-life tests, does not affect how long the batteries can be
used, only the amount of time they can be stored.
   The less-than-predicted storage life will be corrected by
changing the electrolytic chemical used in the batteries, Moxley
said.
   ``As a matter of good business ethics, we reported the results
of our tests to Black & Decker,'' he said. ``Obviously, we are
disappointed by the company's action.''
