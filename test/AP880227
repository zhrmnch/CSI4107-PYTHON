   After receiving a flood of angry phone calls, the
Israeli Embassy said Friday that four Israeli soldiers shown on
television broadcasts beating two bound Palestinan youths will face
court-martial.
   A CBS-TV segment broadcast earlier Friday on British television
showed the soldiers in the occupied West Bank kicking the youths in
the head and chest before picking up rocks and smashing them down
on arms and legs in an effort to break limbs.
   The embassy said the soldiers involved were detained by military
police, who were investigating the Thursday incident in Nablus.
   The soldiers would be subject to court-martial and if found
guilty would be sent to a military jail, said the embassy.
   ``It is being treated very seriously. But we are satisfied that
this sort of thing is not going on all over the place every day,''
said an embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``There has been much reaction from the British public. We have
had many calls. But people can be assured that at least the wheels
of justice will run their course.''
   Earlier, the Israeli ambassador in London, Yehuda Avner,
promised a full investigation.
   Interviewed on ITN-TV news, he said: ``My reaction is one of
shock.''
   The beating also was shown on television in Denmark and the
Israeli Embassy there was deluged with telephone calls from
outraged viewers.
   The film was shot by Bob Simon of the American CBS-TV network.
At the invitation of the Israelis, Simon later flew by helicopter
to a military camp where he was able to identify the soldiers
involved, according to Press Association, the British domestic news
agency..
   According to TV news reports, the beating kept up for a full 40
minutes and was in direct contravention of orders issued this week
by the army high command that prisoners are not to be beaten if
detained after rioting or violence is over.
   In Israel, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the army's West Bank
commander, said, ``We were shocked and couldn't say a word after we
saw this film.''
   Mitzna said he suspended the unit's deputy commander, a captain,
and ordered the two Arabs released.
   Rioting broke out in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 11
weeks ago, and scores of Arabs have been killed.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity
under British procedure, said, ``We have watched the scenes on TV
with shock and horror. ...
   ``The action of the ... soldiers is incompatible with the
professional standards of the Israeli defense forces and shows how
far the Israeli soldiers have been brutalized by their experience.''
   Israel's ambassador to the Netherlands, Zev Sufott, made an
unusual appearance on nationwide television there Friday shortly
after the beating scene was shown on Dutch television.
   ``These are aberrations which, as soon as we hear of them, we go
out and pick them (the perpetrators) up,'' Sufott said in an
interview with the NOS-Journaal news broadcast.
   Anchorwoman Noraly Beyer said that by that time, 150 protest
calls already had been made to the studio.

<HEAD>Cruise Ship Vacation Becomes Mutinous Mess, Passengers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passengers on a cruise to Central America
abandoned ship in Panama after the crew mutinied, the air
conditioning failed and a travel agency's promise of a dream
vacation turned into a floating nightmare.
   The last 90 passengers aboard the cruise ship Galaxy disembarked
in Panama City, Panama, on Friday without completing the last leg
of the trip between Acapulco and Cancun, Mexico, said Ron Dusek,
spokesman for the state attorney general's office.
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox filed suit Wednesday against
Golden Cruisetours Inc. of San Antonio, which booked the cruise,
two of its subsidiaries and the companies' owners. Mattox alleged
that customers were bilked of hundreds of thousands of dollars when
their trips were canceled and their money was not refunded.
   The cruise was advertised in 52 newspapers across the country,
officials said. A brochure promised passengers a ``friendly,
attentive crew'' and the chance to meet new friends.
   The cruise that began Feb. 11 in Acapulco fell short of the
promises, passengers said.
   Eighty-seven of the 250 passengers refused to go aboard because
food was cold and the air conditioning was broken, officials said.
   The next day, the crew mutinied, according to the State
Department. More passengers left the ship Feb. 18 before the Galaxy
departed Punta Renas, Costa Rica.
   About 50 mutineers were removed from the ship in Costa Rica,
leading to a dock rally sponsored by a local union which refused to
supply replacement labor.
   Passenger Sarita Anderson described a fight in the ship's lounge
during a stop in Guatelmala.
   ``As we started into the lounge, there was a fight going on,''
Mrs. Anderson said. ``It was something to do with work schedules.''
   The English-speaking Honduran crew supervisor was arguing with
the ship's staff chief, yelling that the Mexican crew members,
kitchen help and cabin boys, who had been hired only days earlier
in Acapulco, were being worked too hard, Mrs. Anderson said.
   The two men then began a bloody fight, she said.
   Telephone calls Friday to Golden Cruisetours' office in San
Antonio went unanswered.

   The Air Force dispatched investigators
to begin processing damage claims after a fighter jet buzzed a
residential area, causing broken windows, fallen roof tiles and
minor injuries.
   A pilot from Edwards Air Force Base was participating in a
week-long military exercise at George Air Force Base, and was
simulating an attack in an F-4 Phantom fighter when the damage
occurred Thursday afternoon, George spokesmen said.
   ``He probably didn't know the area and didn't know how close we
are to Adelanto,'' Tech. Sgt. Jorge Caballero. The two bases are
more than 50 miles apart in the desert north of Los Angeles.
   ``There were no major injuries, but there were some complaints
of roof tiles falling on people and some minor cuts and scrapes,''
Caballero said.
   The pilot's name was not released.

   A hospital and a nursing firm will
split the cost of a $925,000 settlement to a woman who sued,
charging malpractice after her stomach blew up like a balloon and
her intestine ruptured, her lawyers said.
   Juanita Johns, 53, reached the settlement this week with
University Medical Center and Medical Personnel Pool of Northeast
Florida Inc., which supplied a private duty nurse for her last
year, attorney Wayne Alford said Friday.
   The suit charged that the nurse, ordered by a doctor to place a
tube down Mrs. Johns' throat to remove intestinal gas, incorrectly
hooked up a pump, causing air pressure that blew a hole in the
patient's intestine.
   Mrs. Johns, who continues to suffer infections and has a
disfiguring scar on her abdomen, will receive $150,000 from the
hospital and $775,000 from the nursing pool, said Alford and fellow
attorney John Kalil.

<HEAD>Leap Day: Getting the Calendar Back On Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like Olympiads and presidential elections,
Leap Day comes but once in four years. Monday's calendar
adjustment, like setting a watch back in the fall to get an extra
hour, adds a day in the year to keep things in tune with nature.
   Except for owners of some day-date watches, of course, most
people don't have to make any actual calendar adjustments. The
printers have done that for them by adding a 29th day to February.
   For folks born on prior February 29ths, it's an eagerly awaited
chance to to celebrate that doesn't occur every year. For some aged
80, perhaps having to list only 20 birthdays is a joy.
   Others anxious for adulthood struggle to prove that five
birthdays makes them old enough to vote and drive a car. Indeed,
the problem was crucial for Frederick, the hero of Gilbert and
Sullivan's ``Pirates of Penzance,'' a young man born Feb. 29 and
indentured until his 21st birthday.
   For both the fun and frustration of this added day, render unto
Julius Caesar the blame that is his.
   Caesar wanted to make the calendar accurate, and it almost
worked.
   The day is designed to compensate for the fact that calendars
count in whole days, 365 or 366 depending on the year, while it
takes the earth 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to get
around the sun.
   Adding an extra day every fourth year helped compensate for that
difference of about a quarter day, but problems became obvious as
the Romans' inaccurate calendar got three months out of line with
the seasons.
   So, in 46 B.C., known ever since as the ``Year of Confusion,''
Caesar added 67 days to the calendar to set it right again. And to
keep the calendar accurate, he instituted the system of slipping in
one more day on Feb. 29.
   That reform, suggested by the Roman astronomer Sosigenes, became
part of what is known as the Julian Calendar and remained in use
for centuries.
   ``There was one small problem: Sosigenes had done a little too
much rounding off,'' explained Gail S. Cleere of the U.S. Naval
Observatory.
   Sosigenes had estimated the year at 365.25 days, while it really
was 365.2422 days. That means Sosigenes was about 11 minutes off
over the course of a year.
   ``Although Caesar and his astronomer were long gone before
anyone noticed it, some 1,500 years later, 11 minutes per year had
added up to a whopping 10 days,'' Cleere said. ``And so, the
seasons were slipping backwards again _ spring into winter, winter
into fall, and so on.''
   That prompted the current calendar, instituted by Pope Gregory
in 1582, who dropped the offending 10 days _ a change that took a
while to be accepted in non-Catholic countries. Indeed, England and
her colonies didn't join in until 1752, by which time the error had
grown to 11 days. Japan came over in 1873, China in 1911 and Russia
held out until its Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.
   That's why many history books refer to dates during the
transition period as either ``old style'' or ``new style''
depending on whether a country was following the Julian or
Gregorian calendar at the time.
   In addition to dropping the added days, Pope Gregory ruled that
not every fourth year would be a leap year.
   In the Gregorian Calendar, centennial years are leap years only
if they can be divided evenly by 400.
   Thus, the year 2000 will be somewhat unusual in being a leap
year. The last centennial leap year was 1600, the next will be 2400.
   The calendar's still not perfect, Cleere admits, with the
Gregorian year still 26 seconds too long. But that only amounts to
a bit over a half-hour per century, so it will be a long time
before any further adjustments need to be made.

<HEAD>US Backs Delvalle in Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, in a new rebuff to
Panamanian military strong man Manuel Antonio Noriega, is lending
diplomatic support to President Eric Arturo Delvalle in his bid to
resist a Noriega-led effort to oust him.
   Delvalle was the target of a series of maneuvers that had the
earmarks of a military coup after Noriega successfully fought off
the president's effort to depose him as defense chief.
   ``We still regard him as president,'' State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Friday, hours after Noriega's
allies in the National Assembly voted to remove Delvalle from
office and to appoint the education minister as president. Delvalle
called the move ``legally despicable'' and urged a national strike
to repudiate Noriega's leadership.
   Mrs. Oakley said the U.S. decision was based on its support for
``civilian constitutional rule.''
   High-level meetings were held throughout the day Friday as
officials assessed the startling array of developments in a country
regarded as one of Latin America's most strategically important.
   The administration has demonstrated increasing hostility toward
Noriega, particularly since two federal grand juries returned
indictments Feb. 5 depicting him as a key figure in an
international drug trafficking conspiracy.
   Delvalle had been viewed by the administration as little more
than a front man for Noriega, but that all changed Thursday evening
when he broke with the military chieftain.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We condemn all
efforts to perpetuate military rule in Panama, including efforts to
remove President Delvalle from office.''
   Panama's political turmoil, marked by shifting allegiances and
high-stakes intrigue, gave rise to questions about whether the
United States would intervene militarily. But President Reagan
said, ``I don't think that's an answer.''
   Vice President George Bush, speaking to the South Carolina Press
Association, was less categorical than Reagan.
   Bush said he would ``reserve the right to do whatever is
necessary, including military force, to protect America's sacred
interest in that region of the world.'' On the other hand, Bush
said he didn't ``want to rattle any sabers.''
   According to a Panamanian dissident, Delvalle knew in advance
that his effort to replace Noriega would fail, but the maneuver was
only the first step in an elaborate plan designed to force
Noriega's departure over the next three weeks.
   Jose I. Blandon, a former close associate of Noriega who has
joined forces with Delvalle, said in an interview here Friday that
he expects democratic countries in Latin America will rally behind
Delvalle, further weakening Noriega's position. The United States
has been consulting with Latin American countries on that subject.
   Blandon said that he, Delvalle and an array of Panamanian
opposition leaders have been working secretly for weeks on the plan
to remove Noriega.
   Noriega's downfall will be hastened, Blandon said, if there is
broad support for a general strike in Panama and if the United
States decides to impose a trade embargo against that country.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called Friday for a trade embargo,
but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated the
administration had no interest in such a proposal. Other
administration officials said they knew of no firm decision to rule
out that option.
   Blandon said a U.S. trade embargo would cripple Panama, pointing
out that the country is heavily dependent financially on a
trans-isthmus pipeline that transfers Alaskan oil to tankers
serving U.S. East Coast ports.
   Blandon said Noriega already has been approached about the
possibility of seeking exile in the Dominican Republic. He said
Dominican authorities have indicated they would be willing to
receive him.
   But because of the federal indictments against him, Noriega
could be subject to extradition procedures because of a U.S. treaty
with the Dominican Republic.

<HEAD>Cost Of Producing Sugarbeets Lower In Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department study of 1984 yields
and expenses shows that sugarbeets can be produced at lower costs
in the Midwest than in some areas of the West, as a rule.
   The study involved seven regions that produce nearly all the
U.S. sugarbeets on about 8,700 farms. Overall, the department's
Economic Research Service reported Friday that it cost an average
of $30.30 per net ton to produce beets. The range, however, was
between $24 and $35 per ton.
   ``About 60 percent of the 1984 U.S. sugarbeet crop was produced
at a cost below the U.S. average price support of $31.63 per ton,''
the report said. ``The producers received a weighted average price
of $33.90 a net ton, ranging from $23.30 in Region 3 (Colorado,
Nebraska and southeastern Wyoming) to $37.10 in Region 6 (eastern
Idaho).''
   Most beet producers in Region 3 operated at a loss because of
the closing of several processing plants by the Great Western Sugar
Co., the report said.
   ``Sugarbeets are a high-value crop, but incomes vary widely
among producers because of differences in input costs, yields,
risks and non-farm income,'' the report said. ``Climatic extremes
in the widely disparate sugarbeet production regions may create
highly variable incomes from region to region or from year to
year.''
   The study of 1984 costs, by region, showed:
   _Region 1, Michigan and Ohio, 10.8 percent of the U.S. sugarbeet
acreage; government support of $27.79 per net ton; actual price
received by growers, $32.95 per ton; average cost of production,
$24.02 per ton.
   _Region 2, Minnesota and eastern North Dakota, 35.2 percent of
the U.S. acreage; support of $32.24 per ton; actual price received
by growers, $36 per ton; average cost of production, $25.66 per ton.
   _Region 3, Colorado, Nebraska and southeastern Wyoming, 12.8
percent of the acreage; support of $31.23 per ton; actual price
received by growers, $23.30 per ton; average cost of production,
$28.06 per ton.
   _Region 4, New Mexico and Texas, was not included in the study.
   _Region 5, Montana, northwestern Wyoming and northwestern North
Dakota, 5 percent of the acreage; support of $31.37 per ton; actual
price received by growers, $35.40 per ton; average cost of
production, $34.26 per ton.
   _Region 6, eastern Idaho, 7.4 percent of the acreage; support of
$31.05 per ton; actual price received by growers, $37.10 per ton;
average cost of production, $34.87 per ton.
   _Region 7, western Idaho and Oregon, 6.5 percent of the acreage;
support of $31.05 per ton; actual price received by growers, $36.90
per ton; average cost of production, $34.68 per ton.
   _Region 8, California, 18.8 percent of the acreage; support of
$32.98 per ton; actual price received by growers, $35.10 per ton;
average cost of production, $34.57 per ton.

   The use of cotton by domestic textile
manufacturers is at the highest level since the early 1970s, but an
Agriculture Department analysis says the price outlook for
producers is uncertain.
   In the 1987 marketing year that ended last July 31, nearly 7.5
million bales of cotton were used by mills, up from 6.4 million in
1986. As it looks now, 1988 mill use is headed for another gain to
around 7.8 million bales.
   But imports of cotton textiles also are up, totaling an
equivalent of 4.9 million bales in 1987, a 22 percent increase from
1986, the department's Economic Research Service said Friday.
   Meanwhile, U.S. exports of raw cotton are expected to be around
7 million bales in the 1988 marketing year, an increase of 300,000
bales from 1987, the agency said in its new outlook report.
   Based on Jan. 1 indications, the 1987 cotton harvest _ which
goes into the overall supply for the 1988 marketing year _ is
expected to yield 14.7 million bales, up from 9.7 million bales in
1986.
   Cotton prices moved up last year because of the tighter supply
and rising demand. The U.S. spot price, for example, rose above 77
cents per pound, the report said. But since last August, prices
have dropped 17 to 20 cents.
   ``The larger-than-expected 1987 U.S. crop, the potential for
increased acreage and production in 1988, and concern about the
economy's performance have pressured prices lower this season,''
the report said.

   Milk production last year declined 1 percent
to less than 142.5 billion pounds from a revised 1986 record of
143.8 billion pounds, the Agriculture Department says.
   Previously, USDA had estimated 1987 milk output at about 142.9
billion pounds and the 1986 record at 144.1 billion.
   The new estimates were in a monthly report Friday on milk
production, which showed January output running about 3 percent
above a year ago in the major dairy states.
   Department economists say 1988 milk production is expected to
rise by 1 percent to 3 percent, which could push output for the
year to another record level.

<HEAD>Romania Tells US To Cancel Special Trade Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Romanian government has decided to
renounce special trade benefits from the United States rather than
comply with American human rights demands, the State Department
says.
   As a result of abandoning the 13-year policy, Romania could lose
up to $250 million in commerce with the United States this year.
   At the same time, the United States will lose an economic weapon
the Reagan administration has claimed to be effective in pressuring
Romania to improve the plight of its people.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley announced Friday
that Romania informed the United States through diplomatic channels
that it had decided to renounce its receipt of most-favored-nation
trading status. That status has kept tariffs on Romanian goods at
levels lower than those for products from most other Soviet-allied
countries.
   The benefits will end July 2 and Romania also will lose
eligibility for U.S. government-supported export credits through
the Commodity Credit Corp. or the Export-Import Bank, Mrs. Oakley
said.
   She said Romania estimates the action will cause a $250 million
annual reduction in Romanian sales to the United States, which
totaled $775 million in 1987.
   U.S. exports to Romania are worth $200 million annually, of
which half are agriculture products, and Mrs. Oakley said the
competitiveness of these exports also will suffer.
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a House Foreign Affairs
Committee member who visited Bucharest last year, said in an
interview that the decision by Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu
to renounce the benefit was ``to pre-empt the annual scrutiny of
Romania's human rights record, which is deplorable.''
   ``He's cutting off his nose to spite his face,'' Smith said of
Ceausescu. ```We don't want to end the relationship. We just want
them to stop the trashing of human rights.''
   In recent years, U.S. diplomats have conferred with the
Ceausescu government on steps Romania was expected to take to get
most-favored-nation status. The message was simple: improve rights
or lose income.
   Under the 1975 Jackson-Vanik amendment, communist countries
otherwise ineligible for most-favored-nation status can win the
benefit from Congress if the president certifies the country has
fair emigration policies.
   Since enactment of the amendment, which was designed to spur
emigration of Jews and other ethnic groups from the Soviet bloc,
only Hungary, Poland and Romania have received the benefits.
   While the statute links the benefits only to emigration
policies, a growing dissatisfaction on Capitol Hill with Romania's
overall human rights record in recent months has prompted bills
cutting off the privileges this year.
   Besides Romania's longstanding suppression of free speech,
assembly, political opposition and other rights, senators and
congressmen said, there had been little movement on U.S. demands
for a loosening of control over religious minorities.
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, who met Ceausescu
in Bucharest three weeks ago, informed the Romanian leader of U.S.
dissatisfaction with human rights policies.
   Ceausescu's reply appeared to presage the decision announced
Friday. Whitehead told reporters after the meeting that in response
to his comments about Romanian rights, Ceausescu said, in essence:
stop meddling in Romania's internal affairs.
   Mrs. Oakley said that despite the halting of the
most-favored-nation process, Romania ``has authoritatively stated
to us that it will continue to allow emigration for family
reunification purposes, without relation to economic ties with the
United States. We welcome this.''

   This staid old spa town was a bit
taken aback last week to discover that the Winter Olympics'
best-loved loser is a native son _ ski-jumper Eddie ``The Eagle''
Edwards.
   Most of Cheltenham, like the rest of the world, hadn't heard of
the 24-year-old Edwards until he leaped into the Olympic limelight
with flailing arms and an unflappable smile.
   Edwards finished last in two events but came first as a
crowd-pleaser, and on Friday, British television viewers saw him
rubbing shoulders with actor Burt Reynolds on the Johnny Carson
Show.
   Mayor Gil Wakeley said Cheltenhamites are preparing a homecoming
parade, cakes and receptions for the part-time plasterer, although
Wakeley confessed he wasn't sure where or in what order.
   ``There were quite a number of people that had never heard of
his name,'' said Wakeley, sitting at the desk in his office,
nicknamed ``the parlor,'' where silver tea sets bedecked a chest
and a little dog wandered in and out.
   ``But I think most of Cheltenham stayed up to watch his final
jumps,'' he said.
   There was no sign of excitement on the promenade of chic shops
and fine Regency buildings, no Eddie-the-Eagle T-shirts and no
banners in the city of 95,000 people 90 miles west of London.
   Cheltenham, a tourist town built around mineral waters tapped
200 years ago, isn't the type of place to blow its horn about The
Eagle, but it seems quietly proud.
   Without sponsors, coaches or a single jumping slope in his
native land, with no one but his parents and sister with him in
Calgary, Edwards had dared to ``have a go at it,'' as the
townspeople put it.
   The Eagle, whose thick glasses enhance his gangly, birdlike
look, came last in both his events, the 70- and 90-meter jumps. His
longest jump fell 46.5 meters short of the winner of both events,
Matti Nykanen of Finland.
   But when he added three meters to the British record of 68
meters, London newspapers ran headlines such as, ``Eddie Survives
... and Breaks British Record.''
   Edwards, who doesn't mind coming across as a bit of a klutz,
always had a smile and wave for the crowd after his jumps.
   The crowds roared, but so did the critics. Norway tried to have
Edwards barred, and an Olympic official said 11-year-olds could
jump farther, although Nykanen reportedly supported Edwards' right
to compete.
   Back home there were doubters too, like the Times of London,
whose sportswriter commented: ``The question remains whether the
likes of Eddie, the Wingless Eagle, ... deserved to compete in the
Games,'' since ``the emphasis should be on excellence.''
   Cecil Baylis, a retired Cheltenham businessman, agreed. ``It's a
bit of a joke isn't it? I think people are laughing at him and with
him too.''
   The mayor dismissed the critics.
   ``The idea of the Olympics is for people to try _ for each and
everyone to have an opportunity to try,'' said Wakeley. ``It's for
the amateur.''
   Edwards seems to have struck a peculiarly British chord _ a
weakness for the gallant loser.
   ``The British always tend to like the underdog,'' said David
Watson, Edwards's first coach on the artificial slopes of the
Gloucester Hotel and Ski Center near Cheltenham, where Edwards took
up skiing in his teens on turf that doubled for snow.
   ``And in ski jumping, he's certainly the underdog,'' added
Watson, who manages the resort.
   Watson recalls the novice Eagle as ``keen but not as good as a
lot of people who were skiing then .... He was very ambitious but
he didn't want to listen.''
   Edwards yearned to slalom, but became fond of jumping during a
visit to Italy. Also, said his aunt, Jean Byrne, jumping was ``a
wee bit cheaper.''
   ``We were really surprised'' by the publicity, she said. ``He
only went to jump. People really took to him.''

   Here are some comments Friday from candidates
for the presidency:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, on Panama's military strong man Manuel Antonio
Noriega: ``Noriega's gone bad, and he's proven he's trafficked in
narcotics. ... Noriega should go and in my view he will go.''
   
   JACK KEMP, saying he thinks Noriega should be ousted because a
friendly government in Panama is essential: ``Noriega ...
represents a threat to the Panama Canal.''
   
   RICHARD GEPHARDT, saying Eastern Airlines cares more about
profits than its employees: ``We will stop the attitude that the
way to make profits is to take them out of the hides of employees.''
   Eastern Airlines spokesman Robin Matell called Gephardt's
remarks ``a cheap attempt to get votes in the upcoming presidential
primaries.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, stressing education and urging good jobs and
opportunity for all: ``It's going to take hard workers, not high
rollers, to get America moving again.''
   
   PAT ROBERTSON, speaking to students at a Christian academy: ``(I
want) to see America once again return to the fundamental faith
that she had, the faith of our fathers, to go back to our faith in
God and go back to individual self-reliance, to go back to a
feeling of community, to go back to strong family values.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, reminding the Georgia Legislature of his Southern
roots: ``I am one of you. I worked hard to make the new South new _
now, let's make the new South better. I am my party's conscience.
By July, with your help, I want to be its candidate.''
   
   BOB DOLE, picking up an endorsement from former Texas Gov. John
Connally: ``I think today our campaign goes up another notch.''

<HEAD>Southern GOP Leaders Talk With Reagan About Super Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and Southern Republican state
chairmen did some talking about prospects of attracting
conservative Democrats to vote GOP in the Super Tuesday
presidential primary balloting.
   The participants in the discussions Friday also talked about how
Republican ranks will already be swollen with new members drawn to
the primary by the candidacy of former television evangelist Pat
Robertson.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president
invited the Southerners to talk about ``what they expect in terms
of voter turnout, the new strength of the Republican Party in the
South, and how they see the campaign going at this point.''
   According to Arkansas GOP Chairman Ed Bethune, voters in his
state will ``see very clearly there are two primaries, the liberal
primary and the conservative primary.''
   Jeannie Austin of Orlando, Fla., head of the Southern Republican
Chairmen's Association, said ``we talked about Super Tuesday and
how we could get conservative Democrats to vote with us.''
   Ms. Austin and Oklahoma State Chairman Tom Cole agreed that the
candidacy of Pat Robertson, by encouraging his fundamentalist
Christian admirers to participate, is swelling the ranks of
Republican primary voters.
   ``He gets part of the credit without a doubt,'' Cole said. He
added, however, that he believes Reagan has done more than anyone
else to increase Republican strength in the South.
   Ms. Austin said Robertson ``certainly has an organization and we
welcome these new people to our party because it certainly beefs up
our numbers.''
   Republican State Chairman Van Hipp of South Carolina, which will
hold its GOP primary March 5, predicted a ``very tight race'' in
his state, saying Robertson has a good organization, Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas has the support of the popular Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., and New York Rep. Jack Kemp ``is coming on strong in rural
areas.''
   Hipp said Reagan ``views this as a golden opportunity to attract
independent and conservative-leaning Democrats.''
   Others attending were George Strake of Texas, Jack Hawke of
North Carolina, Evelyn McPhail of Mississippi, John Stuckey of
Georgia, Jim Henry of Tennessee, Donald Hoffman of Virginia, and
Bob Gable of Kentucky. Chairmen from Louisiana and Alabama missed
the meeting.
   Reagan, who has remained publicly neutral in the GOP race, was
asked by a reporter during a photo-taking session before the
meeting whether he expects Vice President George Bush to win in the
South.
   Gesturing around the table with his hands, the president said:
``Ask them.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Clears Way for Glass Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has given two of the
nation's largest manufacturers of glass containers the green light
to operate as a single company.
   On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia rejected a request by the federal government to block the
proposed merger between Owens-Illinois Inc. and Brockway Inc.
   Owens-Illinois spokesman John Hoff said the court denied a
motion by the Federal Trade Commission for an injunction and
dissolved a temporary stay of the proposed merger.
   Hoff said the court ruled that the FTC had failed to demonstrate
the need for an injunction.
   He said the company has extended its $60-per-share tender offer
for Brockway until 5 p.m. Monday, after which time it will be free
to proceed with the merger.
   Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Hens Green refused
the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that the FTC
had not proven the deal would harm competition.
   The FTC then asked the appeals court to block the merger until
the agency could conduct an administrative review of potential
anti-competitive effects of the deal.
   Last September, the Toledo, Ohio-based Owens-Illinois proposed
to buy Brockway, of Jacksonville, Fla., for $750 million.
   The merger would make the combined company the largest
manufacturer of glass containers in the industry. The nation's top
manufacturer is Anchor Glass Container Corp., which controls 23.7
percent of the market.
   The FTC has said the merger might violate federal antitrust laws
by substantially reducing competition in the glass container
industry and creating conditions for price discrimination.
   But Judge Green accepted the argument by the two manufacturers
that competition from the plastics and metal-packaging industry
will keep down prices.
   Attorneys for Owens-Illinois say the purpose of the merger is to
achieve cost savings and efficiencies that will enable the combined
companies to vigorously compete against the producers of plastics,
metal and other types of packaging materials.

<HEAD>Nader Group Says U.S. Imports of Iranian Oil Continued After Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Customs Service was unable to produce
immediate documentation that 6.4 million barrels of oil imported
from Iran late last year had been shipped or under contract before
a trade ban was imposed.
   Buyers Up, a consumer oil-buying cooperative affiliated with
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said Friday the oil was imported in
November and December after President Reagan banned trade with that
country.
   The Customs Service said it believed the oil was legal, but
couldn't immediately lay its hands on the documents that would
prove itt.
   The oil accounted for 7.3 percent of U.S. crude imports for
those two months. The trade embargo took effect Nov. 29.
   Buyers Up director Jason Adkins said officials at the Foreign
Assets Control Division of the Treasury and the Strategic Branch of
the Customs Service ``were completely unaware of the November and
December shipments of Iranian oil to this country until we brought
it to their attention.''
   He agreed the oil could be legal, but said he had not been able
to find anyone in the government who could say it was.
   Customs Service spokesman David Hoover said, ``We're reasonably
sure _ we don't have the printout _ the oil was legal.'' He said it
might take two days to find the computer printout that would show
the certifications that the oil was exempt from the president's
action.
   Since the exemptions expired Dec. 31, Hoover said he would be
surprised if January statistics showed any shipments from Iran.
   Iran was a major supplier to the United States in the 1970s
before the revolution in that country, but shipments fell after the
1981 release of the American hostages seized in the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran.
   Iran generally accounted for from 1 percent to 3 percent of U.S.
crude imports in following years.
   Shipments rose sharply in the early months of 1987, however, and
in July Iran was the second largest supplier of crude to the United
States. Reagan said he imposed the ban to ensure that U.S.
purchases did not contribute to terrorism, which the U.S.
government says Iran supports.
   For all of 1987, Iran's crude shipments amounted to 5.1 percent
of U.S. crude imports, more than 88 million barrels worth $1.5
billion. That was more than triple the $468 million paid for 34
million barrels in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Part-time resident George Bush was way
out in front Friday night as Maine Republicans launched a weekend
of GOP presidential caucuses, his campaign said.
   Statewide, the vice president's campaign claimed to have won 166
of the 234 state delegates selected so far for the April convention
in Bangor, at which 22 national delegates will be chosen.
   The Bush campaign said Pat Robertson so far has received 28
state delegates, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas has collected 20 and Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York has garnered five while 15 delegates were
uncommitted.
   The results of the Republican caucuses do not bind state
convention delegates and party leaders were not bothering to
compile the tallies right away.
   The delegates totaled by the Bush campaign included the 137
selected in caucuses in 43 towns since late January.
   The Republicans will select the rest of the 1,506 state
delegates during caucuses Saturday and Sunday.
   Bush and Dole forces had forged an uneasy alliance before the
caucuses to frustrate Robertson forays in delegate-rich areas as
they faced an influx of first-time voters from fundamentalist
churches.
   Robertson supporters warred with Bush backers over voting rules
Friday night at the Republican caucus in Portland, Maine's largest
city, but tempers cooled when most of the 33 delegate slots at
stake were evenly divided between the two.
   Each camp came away with 15, while Dole received the rest after
three hours of heated procedural voting and brokering.
   The local Republican organization in Portland became the first
to drop its winner-take-all standard in favor of proportional
representation.
   Bush and Dole factions conferred continuously during the
Portland caucusing but, in the end, the Dole supporters sided with
Robertson's campaign in scrapping the all-or-nothing allocation of
delegates.
   State party chairwoman Karen Stram, watching the Portland
voting, acknowledged that feelings were running high in the various
camps. Stram said her job was ``to be sure that everyone comes out
of it feeling they got a fair shake.''
   She also said statewide turnout could reach 15,000 or more by
the end of the weekend.
   ``No question, we're up three times at least'' over previous
years, she said.
   Organizers say their primary goal is to win as many as possible
of 1,506 state convention delegate slots for their partisans. But
party regulars also say the Bush-Dole coalition reflects fears that
the state Republican organization could be taken over by
Robertson's supporters, a repeat of what happened in Michigan.
   John Solberg, Robertson's state coordinator, this week charged
that ``the Bush and Dole campaigns are attempting to keep the
majority silent in the democratic process.''
   Solberg made his comments after the GOP caucus in Waterville, at
which Robertson won a straw poll but came away with no delegates.
   Participants in the straw poll split four ways, with Robertson
leading with 57 votes, Bush 40, Dole 20, and Kemp eight, Solberg
said. But Bush and Dole backers joined together in the caucusing to
block Robertson from maintaining a winner-take-all plurality. The
caucus's 12 delegate slots for the state convention were awarded to
the stop-Robertson combine.
   Solberg said a similar deal was struck at the GOP caucus in
Kittery last week.
   Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., who has been campaigning for Bush,
who has a summer home in Kennebunkport, said Thursday the vice
president's campaign was acting in self-interest to ``maximize the
number of delegates'' it could lock up. He called Solberg's
complaint ``amusing,'' saying that Robertson organizers had
themselves sought to build anti-Bush coalitions around the state.
   ``This is not fun and games,'' said McKernan, Maine's first
Republican governor in two decades. ``We're talking about the next
president of the United States.''
   State Sen. Pamela Cahill, a Dole organizer, also dismissed the
Robertson campaign charge. ``We operated within the caucus
structure and got those Dole delegates,'' she said Friday.
   Acknowledging that a Bush-Dole alliance here represented a far
different attitude than seen nationally between the competing
campaigns, Cahill said she was motivated by concern for ``the
well-being of the Republican Party.''
   ``I guess I'm too damn parochial,'' Cahill said. ``I'm concerned
because I don't want to see Robertson people getting all the
positions ... blocking out the rank-and-file Republicans who
support our party in good times and bad ... and then leaving the
party in disarray,'' she said.
   At the few Republican caucuses held already, turnout appears to
be much higher than in the past, a factor attributed to Robertson's
grass-roots drive.
   But a hostile reception for the insurgents could undercut the
potential for long-range party growth, warned an organizer for the
flagging Maine campaign of Kemp.
   ``We're sending the people home and telling them `you're not
welcome,''' said George Smith, who predicted the establishment
alliance would make Bush ``the big winner.''
   In Michigan, Robertson supporters won control of the state GOP
committee, working in cooperation with Kemp backers. The coalition
fell apart, however, in January when Kemp's camp defected to join
forces with Bush and split the state's 77 GOP delegates.
   Democrats caucus statewide on Sunday, and first place is
conceded to Gov. Michael Dukakis of neighboring Massachusetts.

<TEXT>
   An off-duty policeman was slain Friday during a
robbery attempt outside the grocery where he moonlighted as a
security guard, police said.
   A witness said the officer, Gary D. McCarthy, 32, was shot after
refusing to hand over a money bag. McCarthy, who was in street
clothes, died at Parkland Memorial Hospital four hours later, said
Police Chief Billy Prince.
   The 14-month member of the force was escorting the store manager
from a bank visit when a man jumped out of a car and attempted to
rob the manager, said Sgt. S.G. Shaw.
   `The officer went for his weapon and they got into a shootout,''
Shaw said.
   McCarthy was shot three times, and one of the bullets lodged in
his heart, hospital spokeswoman Paula Sears said. After the officer
fell to the ground, he fired twice at the fleeing vehicle and
shattered its rear window, police said.
   Officers found a car believed to be used in the robbery attempt
a few blocks away in a housing project, where witnesses said they
saw three men flee, police said. Helicopters searched for the men.
   Derick Johnson, 21, who was standing outside the store when the
shooting occurred, said the officer was carrying a money bag when
approached by the gunman.
   ``The guy tried to snatch the money, but the police officer
wouldn't give it to him,'' Johnson said. ``The guy was waving a
gun, and when the officer wouldn't give him the money, he just shot
him.''
   Two officers were slain last month in cases that sparked both
support for police and criticism from minorities who said officers
had been too trigger-happy when arresting blacks and Hispanics.
   A white officer was slain Jan. 23 by a deranged black vagrant
who had wrested the policeman's gun away on a downtown street. A
black officer was killed a week earlier during a suspected burglary
at an apartment complex where he worked off-duty.
   Prince, who earlier had charged that City Council criticism of
the Police Department had created so much public hostility that
police deaths were inevitable, said of Friday's shooting, ``I don't
see how you can make anything racial out of this.''
   The gunman was black; the officer white.
   ``The problem is we have too many people on the streets who
should be in the penitentiary,'' the chief said. ``There are too
many people on the streets who are mean.''

   Maine uses a two-step caucus-convention system for picking its
delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Maine, which is
one of four states specifically allowed by Democratic Party rules
to begin the process of picking delegates before March 8, holds
local municipal caucuses on Feb. 28. The results of these caucuses
will govern the allocation of the state's 15 pledged national
convention delegates from congressional districts. Maine's
remaining eight pledged national convention delegates will be
chosen at the Democratic State Convention on May 13-15.

   Maine Republicans choose their national convention delegates
with town caucuses held between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28 to elect
delegates to the state convention and congressional district
conventions. Delegates are not required to pledge their support to
a presidential candidate. The state's two congressional district
conventions meet in conjunction with the state convention April

<HEAD>Eastern Accuses Gephardt of Playing `Cheap Political Games'</HEAD>

   An Eastern Airlines spokesman says Democratic
presidential candidate Richard Gephardt was playing ``cheap
political games'' when he criticized the attitude of company
management.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell described Gephardt's comments as
``a cheap attempt to get votes in the upcoming presidential
primaries.''
   Gephardt said controversy surrounding the Miami-based airline is
a national issue as well as a local one.
   ``What it signifies is an attitude in corporate America that the
way of the future is to cut jobs, is to engage in mergers, is to
engage in taking the important parts of the corporation out and
splitting them out into entities so that there can be quick paper
profits,'' Gephardt said.
   Reps. Larry Smith and Claude Pepper said they'll ask Congress to
hold hearings to investigate Eastern. The two Florida Democrats
support Gephardt's candidacy and appeared with him at a news
conference Friday.
   Gephardt, whose campaign has stressed a need to improve
corporate productivity, stopped short of calling for re-regulation
of the airline industry by the federal government. But the Missouri
congressman said if he's elected president, his administration will
enforce the industry's safety standards and change the way
management thinks.
   ``We will stop the attitude that the way to make profits is to
take them out of the hides of employees,'' said Gephardt, who met
with Eastern employees before the news conference.
   Eastern, which reported a net loss of $181.1 million in 1987, is
demanding contract concessions totaling $450 million from unions
representing its machinists, pilots and flight attendants.
   ``Eastern is trying to negotiate a sensible solution with the
(International Association of Machinists) to what has been a
long-term cost problem,'' Matell said. ``No company can pay baggage
handlers an average of $43,000 a year. We are doing everything
possible to negotiate a sensible solution with the IAM to solve the
cost problem.
   ``The irresponsible charges made today are not in the best
interest of any of the parties, least of all Eastern or its very
fine group of employees.
   ``It's extremely unfortunate that a collective bargaining
situation is being used for cheap political games.''
   Rep. Smith said many in Congress want to investigate Eastern
``to prevent further deterioration'' of the company. Pepper said
``there ought to be some way'' the breakup of Eastern can be
stopped.
   Gephardt supported the call for an investigation of Eastern.
   ``Congress should be concerned about the safety in this airline
and should be concerned about some of the actions that have been
taken,'' Gephardt said. He said recent management decisions at
Eastern reflect ``the dismantling of a great corporation.''

   Two soldiers charged with mishandling
classified documents were arrested after a teen-ager who claimed to
be running drugs for one of them brought a briefcase of papers to a
TV station, officials said.
   The FBI arrested the two soldiers based at the Army's Fort Irwin
on Wednesday.
   James Weller, agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas office,
declined to say what the secret papers contained. He said
investigators were trying to determine whether the documents were
to be sold, and if so, to whom.
   A tip to a Las Vegas TV station from a former mental patient
prompted the arrests, Weller said.
   ``A young man came to our studios ... with a briefcase full of
secret documents,'' said Lynn Mathis, a reporter for station KTNV.
``He told us that he was employed by an Army sergeant as a drug
runner.''
   Station news director Steve Minium said the claimed he was tired
of dealing drugs and ``flipped out'' when he found the documents.
Minium declined to identify the 19-year-old.
   Staff Sgt. Edmund Washington Tuck, 24, and Specialist 4th Class
Kelly Joe Schmidt, 23, were arrested and held in the stockade at
Fort Irwin on charges of improper handling of classified documents,
Weller said.
   The informant told Minium he met Tuck in the mental ward of a
Victorville hospital and later moved in with him in Barstow. There
he said his job was to run a methamphetamine and LSD trafficking
operation for Tuck, Minium said.
   Agents are investigating the drug-trafficking allegations.
   Fort Irwin is in the Mojave Desert, about 140 miles northeast of
downtown Los Angeles. The Army trains soldiers in desert warfare
tactics at the base.

<HEAD>US May Accept Delay on Iran Arms Embargo If Soviets Agree to Early
UN Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is willing to talk about
delaying the effective date of an arms embargo against Iran in
exchange for Soviet agreement to have the United Nations vote on
the issue as soon as possible, a State Department official says.
   The State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Friday the proposal is designed to get a speedy
vote on the resolution while meeting the Kremlin's stated desire
for another round of diplomacy aimed at winning a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The official said U.S. officials proposed Thursday to Soviet
representatives at the United Nations that the United States would
be willing to discuss delaying implementation of an embargo from 30
to 60 days.
   The United States has been pushing the Soviets to agree to the
embargo but the Soviets have been reluctant to implement one
without another diplomatic attempt by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to get Iran to agree to a cease-fire in its
seven-year war with Iraq.
   The Soviet position has been that any embargo should immediately
follow passage of an embargo resolution by the U.N. Security
Council, and therefore such a vote should be delayed to allow time
for more diplomatic efforts.
   Meanwhile, the Minneapolis Star & Tribune in today's editions
quoted administration officials who said the United States also is
willing to discuss with the Soviets the creation of a U.N. fleet to
stop and search ships suspected of carrying arms to Iran.
   The officials, who were not identified by the newspaper, said
the U.N. fleet would not be similar to a Soviet proposal that U.S.,
French, British and other Western naval forces in the Persian Gulf
be put under the U.N. flag and command.
   Rather, the arms-monitoring fleet under the U.S. proposal would
be made up of ships from neutral countries and would intercept
freighters at the mouth of the Gulf as they headed for the Iranian
port of Bandar Abbas, the newspaper said.
   The State Department official told The Associated Press that the
U.S. position all along has been to discuss proposals that might be
used to implement the embargo after passage of the U.N. resolution.
   The United States has not yet made a specific proposal to the
Soviets about how the embargo would be enforced, the official said.
   The Security Council adopted a resolution July 20 demanding an
immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, troop withdrawal,
prisoner exchange and enforcement steps if either party did not
comply.
   Only Iraq has agreed to the cease-fire. An attempt by the
secretary-general to bring both sides to agreement foundered in
September.
   Any of the five permanent members of the Security Council _ the
United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France and China _
could veto an embargo resolution.
   The Soviet Union and other nations seeking better relations with
Iran have been reluctant to push for punitive enforcement.
   Earlier this month, U.S. officials said that China, which they
said sold $1 billion worth of arms to Iran last year, is not
expected to block an embargo.

   Singer Michael Jackson ordered more
flowers than other celebrities who've stayed at the Pensacola
Hilton, including Elizabeth Taylor and Bob Hope, and some of the
blooms went for vegetarian meals, workers said.
   ``When Michael left, I went up to the Presidential Suite to
collect the vases and they were everywhere, everywhere,'' said
Gehrig Galloway, owner of Gehrig's flower shop at the Hilton.
   ``I walked into the kitchen once when Damien was cooking,'' said
Thaisa Betts-Hester, the hotel's room division manager, referring
to the chef Jackson brought from Los Angeles. ``Damien was cooking
with an odd-looking flower with brown petals that he kept in a
Zip-loc bag. I asked him what was in the bag and he said,
`flowers.'''
   Jackson also ordered 32 cases of Evian mineral water for
drinking and bathing, baby corn, fresh herbs and sun-dried tomatoes
from Orlando, hotel employees said.
   He had a portable dance floor installed in his suite's living
room and was a polite guest, although one night he sprayed a can of
purple, gooey substance down a hallway, said Kathy Dyson, the
hotel's executive housekeeper.
   Jackson stayed at the hotel for two weeks as he rehearsed for
his national concert tour, which began this week in Kansas City, Mo.

   David Merrick, the impresario behind some of
Broadway's biggest hits, is returning to theater production in
London in May with an Australian comedy, ``Emerald City.''
   The play by David Williamson, who also wrote ``Sons of Cain,''
opens May 9 at Lyric Theater, Merrick's publicists announced Friday.
   It will be Merrick's second production in London, where his
long-running musical ``42nd Street'' opened in 1984.
   Merrick plans to bring ``Emerald City,'' a comedy about domestic
rivalry that he first saw last November at the Sydney Opera House,
to London with its Australian cast intact.
   Merrick's last Broadway production, a 1986 revival of Joe
Orton's ``Loot,'' was a financial failure but a critical success.
Among the biggest hits of his New York career were the musicals
``Gypsy'' and ``Hello, Dolly'' and Woody Allen's comedy ``Play It
Again Sam.''

   Singer Johnny Cash has agreed to appear
in a public service announcement to raise money for members of the
disbanded Nashville Symphony, say members of a group called Save
Our Symphony.
   Mike Karr, a symphony musician and member of a task force
examining ways to revive the deficit-ridden symphony, said the
players are excited about the fund-raising effort.
   ``We're excited that it has happened. It seems especially
encouraging that someone like Johnny Cash has agreed to take
part,'' Karr said Friday.
   The country singer's script says ``symphony music in Music City
is in serious trouble,'' and asks for donations to a Save Our
Symphony account to help ``keep the music from fading.''
   The money will be used to help out-of-work orchestra players put
on concerts or, if the symphony's board of directors decides to
stage concerts, will be donated to the Nashville Symphony
Association, said Connie Lincoln, an SOS committee member.

   Husker Du, a critically acclaimed underground
band whose latest album, ``Warehouse: Songs and Stories,'' was
released by Warner Bros. last year, has split up.
   Guitarist-songwriter Bob Mould this week confirmed the breakup
and called it ``more amicable than acrimonious.''
   Drummer Grant Hart said the split was ``not amicable at all.''
He said he left the trio on Dec. 15, a few days after the group's
last performance.
   ``I found it (Husker Du) less fun than other musical projects. I
couldn't do both Husker Du and other things because of dictums from
the other two members,'' Hart said.
   Bassist Greg Norton was the third member of Husker Du
(pronounced HOO-sker DOO), which was formed in 1978 as a punk-rock
outlet. Among the group's albums were ``Zen Arcade'' and ``New Day
Rising.''

   With great fanfare, the Soviet Union has begun
pulling its nuclear missiles out of East Europe, but is still
moving with caution on formally approving a superpower treaty to
scrap them.
   The Kremlin's double-track approach seems aimed at wringing
maximum publicity benefits from the missile withdrawal, while
avoiding any commitment to the intermediate-range nuclear forces
(INF) treaty before the U.S. Senate votes on its ratification.
   The Soviets also have gone public in recent days with
accusations that the United States has designs to bust the treaty
and that U.S. officials are trying to renege on agreements made at
the Washington summit in December.
   Soviet President Andrei A. Gromyko took the rhetoric a step
further Thursday by claiming progress now depends exclusively on
Washington in superpower negotiations seeking a 50 percent cut in
strategic nuclear arms.
   Gromyko told the Hungarian Parliament in a speech that whether
those negotiations in Geneva succeed or fail ``will depend, of
course, on how seriously these talks are treated by the United
States.''
   The medium-range missile treaty signed Dec. 8 by President
Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev already has been approved by the
ruling Communist Party Politburo, but will not go into effect until
it is formally ratified by the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet
parliament.
   Soviet officials acknowledge their reluctance to commit
themselves to the treaty stems from Senate refusal to approve the
1979 SALT-II treaty that set limits for strategic nuclear weapons.
   Gromyko, who served as Soviet foreign minister for almost three
decades, indicated the Kremlin leadership feels speedy Senate
action now is necessary to keep up the momentum on arms control.
   The world ``is awaiting the ratification of the Soviet-American
INF treaty,'' Gromyko said. ``It is important to avoid a slowing
down of the pace of advance in the talks on questions of
disarmament.''
   During Secretary of State George Shultz's visit to Moscow this
week, the superpowers gave their negotiators one month to draft
anti-cheating and other key provisions of a strategic arms pact.
   Shultz told reporters it was ``extremely important'' to spur on
work in Geneva if Reagan and Gorbachev are to sign the treaty at
their fourth summit, planned for May or June in Moscow.
   The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, which rubber-stamps decisions
made by the party leadership, has consigned the INF treaty to a
special subcommittee. There has been no official mention of when it
may be ratified.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, has said the treaty, which bans missiles with
ranges from 300 to 3,400 miles, will not be ratified until his
panel finishes a line-by-line scrutiny of it.
   Although the ratification process is out of the spotlight in the
Soviet Union, the Kremlin has been loudly announcing its most
recent moves on disarmament and casting doubts on the intentions of
the U.S. government.
   On Thursday, a train loaded with dismantled Soviet SS-12
missiles left a town near Dresden, East Germany, for the Soviet
Union, and Soviet troops at Hranice, Czechoslovakia, began removing
shorter-range missiles stationed in there.
   Withdrawal of the SS-12s, mandated by the INF treaty, is being
carried out early as ``further evidence of the socialist countries'
serious and responsible approach to the task of fully abolishing
nuclear weapons,'' the official Soviet Tass news agency said.
   Radio Moscow said in an international news broadcast that the
missile pullback is ``widely viewed as a gesture of good will
undertaken even before the Soviet-American treaty comes into
force.''
   However, Czechoslovakia's state-run CTK news agency quoted the
Soviet commander in charge of the missiles as saying they would not
be destroyed until the treaty is approved. Soviet media did not say
when the SS-12s would be eliminated.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and other American officials
have said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization needs to modernize
its battlefield nuclear weapons to make up for the U.S.-built
weapons banned under the INF treaty.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
Sunday, however, that those plans clash with the treaty and called
them ``incompatible with the strengthening of European security.''

   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, open their
10-day California visit with a Hollywood-style welcome from Los
Lobos, the hometown group featured in the hit film ``La Bamba.''
   After a welcoming ceremony at City Hall today, the Duke and
Duchess of York were to be entertained by Los Lobos.
   The group was to perform ``La Bamba,'' the rollicking Spanish
song immortalized by Ritchie Valens, the subject of last summer's
movie. Valens died in a 1959 plane crash with rockers Buddy Holly
and the Big Bopper.
   The royal couple arrived amid tight security in spring-like
weather Friday, five years to the day after the start of a similar
tour by Andrew's parents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.
   ``He's a friendly, outgoing young man and we're happy to have
him in our city,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said after welcoming the
couple at Los Angeles International Airport.
   Their tour is crammed with receptions, banquets, tours,
exhibitions and other official functions.
   Today, the royal pair were to tour Chinatown, visit an
elementary school, have lunch with Bradley, and host a press
reception aboard the royal yacht Britannia, docked at Long Beach.
   Security personnel experienced some tense moments Friday when
they found an abandoned briefcase about a block from where the
Brittania was docked. A State Department bomb unit exploded the
attache case.
   ``It was no bomb,'' said a British consulate spokeswoman who did
not want her name used.
   The duke and duchess deplaned at a remote section of the airport
after an 11-hour flight from London. A red carpet flanked by
American and British flags was rolled out to the stairway to the
plane.
   The couple were greeted by Bradley, Los Angeles County
Supervisor Deane Dana, British Consul General Donald Ballentyne and
their wives.
   Sarah, wearing a black suit, a blue-and-green blouse and a black
bow, was handed a bouquet by the mayor's wife, Ethel. The prince,
wearing a gray suit, waved at reporters and photographers.
   The couple boarded a black-and-white Rolls Royce limousine,
which quickly departed in a motorcade to Long Beach.
   Andrew, 28, and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, also 28,
will spend much of their time taking part in the UK-LA Festival, a
celebration of British cultural and commercial achievement.
   Gynecologist Anthony Kenney is traveling with the couple to
monitor Sarah's first pregnancy. The baby is due in August.
   The prince, the third child of Queen Elizabeth II, was a
rollicking bachelor dubbed ``Randy Andy'' when he visited Los
Angeles four years ago. The trip's most memorable moment came when
he turned a paint sprayer on the press corps while visiting a
housing project.

   Remember EDB? Four years after the grain fumigant
was banned as a possible cancer risk amid panic over contaminated
popcorn, breakfast cereal and muffin mix, the public has nearly
forgotten it.
   Judy Heckman, chief of pesticide disposal for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, hasn't. Heckman plans to fly to
Texas to preside at the burning of the last 330,000 gallons of the
pesticide early next week.
   The EDB, or ethylene dibromide, to be incinerated was taken from
a warehouse and put on a train in Liberty, Mo., that left last week
for an industrial park in Deer Park outside Houston. More trains
will leave with the remaining gallons every Monday until June,
officials said.
   The federal government paid $2.5 million for what was left of
the chemical and may spend up to $8 million to get rid of it, EPA
officials estimate.
   It is the costly end of a story of national panic that erupted
after EDB was discovered in groundwater in Florida, Georgia,
California and Hawaii in 1983. Worried about its potential to cause
cancer, the EPA in September 1983 banned the use of EDB as a
pesticide for spraying on the ground.
   It was not until Feb. 3, 1984, however, that EDB was banned as a
fumigant for stored grain and limits were set on amounts in foods.
   Although the extent of the cancer risk remains uncertain, EDB
was banned amid a public outcry that the government was dragging
its feet.
   Calls poured in to poison control centers across the country
with worried questions about EDB.
   Massachusetts authorities ordered tainted baby foods tossed out,
and Florida's agriculture department had scores of products swept
from grocery store shelves.
   Pillsbury Co. alone claimed it lost $70 million as a result of
what U.S. Agriculture Secretary John Block referred to at the time
as ``some hysteria out there that really isn't warranted.''
   ``At the time it was a major environmental catastrophe and now
nobody's heard of it,'' said Rick Johnson, the EPA official who
headed the federal effort to investigate and eventually ban EDB.
``So we must have done something right.''
   EDB had been widely used on farms and in storage silos since
1948. It was used mainly to kill fungus on stored grains, but also
was sprayed on citrus fruits to kill fruit flies and on soil before
crops were planted.
   Scientists continued to give it their blessings through the
1950s when they were unable to detect any residue after the
chemical evaporated. But when more sensitive detection techniques
were developed, they revealed that minute traces of EDB were
clinging to the wheat and other grains all the way to the
supermarket.
   In 1975, the National Cancer Institute said the pesticide was
suspected of causing cancer in laboratory animals.
   By 1980 the EPA proposed to ban it after studies found the
health risks of cancer, genetic damage and reproductive disorders
outweighed its economic benefits.
   Johnson said such a risk assessment makes sense for the
government, but can be hard to put into perspective for the public.
   ``The difficult thing is to explain a very complicated science
and policy issue to a naive public,'' he said. ```Can I eat this
muffin mix?' Of course you can eat it.''
   Others see EDB as a case study in government overreaction.
   Stephen Klaidman of the Institute for Health Policy Analysis at
Georgetown University in Washington is including a chapter on EDB
in a book he is writing about the influence of the media on public
policy.
   ``The central question is whether the stuff was taken off the
market too quickly before they knew what (pesticides) they were
replacing it with (and) whether there was a panic reaction to a
chemical that was in the food chain for 30 years,'' Klaidman said.
``As far as I know, nobody has been able to connect a single death
to EDB from ingesting it.''

   A man was sentenced to two days in jail
and fined $45 for riding a motorized skateboard without a driver's
license.
   Damian Vincent Ghiardi, 21, of Richland was convicted Tuesday of
driving with a revoked license and negligent driving. He ran a stop
sign in November on a skateboard powered by a chainsaw motor and
was knocked unconscious by a car.
   Defense attorney Nathan Kirk had argued that the skateboard was
not a motor vehicle because Ghiardi had to push it a block with his
foot to get up speed, but Benton County District Judge Eugene Pratt
disagreed.
   Prosecutor Bob Swisher said the case was treated seriously
because of the potential for more serious injury.
   Ghiardi's driver's license had been revoked last year when he
was convicted of attempting to elude a police officer, court
records show.

   The streets of this city
shut down by Arab strikes teemed with Israeli soldiers as the
muezzin called the faithful to pray on the Moslem Sabbath. The
soldiers waited for the inevitable violence.
   Noon prayers every Friday have surpassed religious significance
since Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip began
their protests 11 weeks ago. Mosques have become the rallying point
for dissent and the release of pent-up frustrations.
   The latest violence came at the Al-Omari Mosque in Gaza on
Friday, as it did elsewhere in the territories. And, as expected,
the soldiers wasted little time breaking up the demonstration,
responding to the stone-throwing with tear gas and rubber bullets.
   This time, there were no injuries a Al-Omari, the main mosque in
Gaza City, capital of the territory snatched from Egypt during the
1967 Middle East War. The building was erected by the Romans and
later transformed into a mosque.
   Friday's sermon by Khamis Murtaja, a lecturer at the Islamic
University in Gaza, was moderate. A worshipper whispered to a
visitor seated discreetly in the rear of the mosque that Murtaja,
like other speakers, has been warned by Israeli authorities to
avoid inflammatory rhetoric.
   Murtaja's sermon to several hundred listeners called for
patience and prayer in the face of the current difficulties.
   ``God will help those who remain patient,'' he said. ``It is a
test of their faith. If we cannot remove injustice by force, we
must be patient. Don't despair. Don't complain. The solution comes
only from God. If you complain to other than God, it is
submission.''
   But as Murtaja called for moderation, leaflets signed by the
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad organization were being circulated in
the mosque. Their message was vastly different.
   ``The land of Palestine is the center of the struggle and the
essence of the universal conflict,'' said the leaflet from Islamic
Jihad, whose influence has been growing, particularly in the Gaza
Strip.
   ``The salvation of the Arab people, in particular the
Palestinian people, and the salvation of all human beings is
related to the destruction of this hateful, racist entity,'' the
leaflet said, refering to Israel.
   It called on the people to escalate the fight against Israel,
saying ``the mosques must be transformed into centers of
confrontation.''
   The moment the prayers were over, dozens of youths rose to their
feet shouting ``Allahu Akhbar,'' Arabic for ``God is great,'' and
dash for the exit.
   Outside they picked up stones and pelted the nearest group of
soldiers, shouting taunts and curses.
   The soldiers charged, firing tear gas canisters and rubber
bullets. The youths scattered, darting into the myriad of
sidestreets and alleys. The army declared the area a closed
military zone until calm is restored.
   Army vehicles raced up and down the streets, three abreast,
chasing demonstrators. A woman ran down a main avenue waving her
arms and screaming: ``They have seized two mosques.''
   It is not true. At least not here. But numerous witnesses said
soldiers raided a mosque in the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp, where
one Palestinian youth died and about 20 injured in the clashes.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, insisting he
doesn't want to play the role of presidential candidate or
kingmaker if there's a brokered national convention, headed for
North Carolina today to help a fellow Democrat.
   Against the backdrop of brokered convention talk, Cuomo was to
appear twice over the next several days in an area of the nation
that could be very important to Democrats come November.
   Tonight, Cuomo was to be in Raleigh, N.C., as the featured
speaker at a fund-raising event for Sen. Terry Sanford. On Tuesday,
Cuomo is to be in San Antonio, Texas, for an address at Trinity
University.
   Was it coincidence that Cuomo was heading south just before the
crucial March 8 Super Tuesday primaries?
   ``Oh no, that's a plan,'' joked Cuomo on Friday. ``You see, I'm
going to be March 1 in Texas and if it really goes well, then March
2 I'm going to announce I'm running.''
   The New York governor, the most prominent of the Democratic
non-candidates, said Friday that he still didn't believe there
would be a deadlocked convention.
   ``I would have no role,'' Cuomo said of a possible brokered
convention. ``They (the announced candidates) would confine
themselves to people who were candidates and talk to one another.''

<HEAD>Cheers End Crisis Night At Covent Garden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a typical operatic tale _ a crisis night
with a storybook ending at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden.
   The lead singer felt terrible but sang on bravely.
   The second lead singer had a triumph, although he had never sung
his role before when he was summoned to London at short notice.
   When the first-night revival of Giuseppe Verdi's ``A Masked
Ball'' ended Friday night, it was cheers from a grateful audience
and nine curtain calls for cast and conductor.
   The story went like this:
   Italian baritone Giorgio Zancanaro, who was booked for the
second lead, fell ill with an ear infection which upset his sense
of balance and prevented him from traveling.
   So Romanian Alexandru Agache, who had never even sung in a major
opera house in the West took over, learning the role in just over
two weeks.
   ``I think this is the start of a big international career for
him,'' said conductor Richard Armstrong.
   Spanish tenor Giacomo Aragall had a valiant night.
   He also had an ear infection _ and bronchitis. But he got on
with the job and sang well, wavering at times, but hanging in there
even with his voice breaking in the last act.
   ``What a night,'' said Sir John Tooley, just retired director at
Covent Garden, when he called at Agache's dressing-room to
congratulate him.
   ``The human voice tends to be a recurring crisis. It causes
opera house managements the most awful headaches,'' Tooley said.
   ``Opera is full of problems, some of which you can deal with
away from the public gaze. But opera is the voice and a voice
crisis means you have got the public out front and the whole
performance to worry about _ your crisis is very visible,'' Tooley
said.
   ``You were stunning,'' Tooley told Agache. ``You coped
brilliantly with the acting and the singing.''
   ``You are very kind,'' murmured the Romanian, a big man with a
black beard, dripping sweat after the biggest test of his life.
   ``Aragall had a big problem, but he said he felt all right and
went on with it, but he sang under extreme difficulties all
evening,'' Tooley said.
   Agache, 33, lives in Cluj, in the heart of Romania's
Transylvanian country. He has sung in Budapest, Dresden, East
Berlin, Japan, Yugoslavia and France, and was expecting to make his
debut later this year in a major Western opera house, La Scala in
Milan. But Covent Garden got in first.
   Agache auditioned at Covent Garden on Jan. 19 and sang some
Verdi arias.
   ``He was recognized as having outstanding potential as a Verdian
baritone. He absolutely thrilled me as a singer,'' Armstrong
recalled.
   Two days later, Agache was in Leghorn, Italy, when his agent in
Frankfurt telephoned to say London wanted him as the ``perfect
replacement'' for Zancanaro.
   ``I sang a minor role in `A Masked Ball' in my debut with Cluj
Opera, but I had to start learning the major role of Anckarstrom
for Covent Garden,'' Agache said.
   He joined the rehearsals in London Feb. 9.
   In the opera, Anckarstrom is the secretary and friend of King
Gustavus III of Sweden, sung by Aragall.
   The secretary, burning with jealousy after discovering his wife
and the king are in love, joins a group of conspirators and stabs
the king to death at a masked ball.
   In history, the king _ one of the great rulers of the 18th
century _ was assassinated in 1792 at a masquerade in the Stockholm
opera house. He was shot in the back by a former royal bodyguard
named Anckarstrom.
   The assassin had his pistol hand cut off before he was beheaded
and his body quartered. But Verdi spared opera lovers and ended
with the king dying, ordering his assassin's release and pardoning
the conspirators.
   ``It's a difficult role because you have to marry very dramatic
acting and a big vocal part,'' Agache said.
   ``But it's a wonderful role, one of the great baritone parts,
and a pleasure to sing,'' he added.
   Verdi and ``A Masked Ball'' are much loved in London, which has
a vibrant and wealthy Italian community. The house was crowded.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Foreign Piracy Of Patents Draining U.S. Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. trade official says the failure of
foreign governments to crack down on foreign piracy of U.S.
patents, trademarks and copyrights is a growing problem that
distorts interrnational trade.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Friday that the
annual drain on U.S. companies because of ``inadequate protection
of intellectual property'' may run as high as $43 billion to $61
billion.
   ``The failure of our trading partners to provide effective
protection for intellectual property is a severe and growing
problem that distorts trade,'' Yeutter said at a news conference.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission released a report at the
news conference that said U.S. companies surveyed by the government
reported losses of $23.8 billion in foreign piracy. The ITC said
actual losses are much greater because not all companies filled out
questionaires on the subject.

   Fiers, who plans to go into private business, was one of several

his role and his failure to inform Congress about the activity.
   Despite that disciplinary action, Fiers had continued to handle

   Most Latin American governments expressed
support for Eric Arturo Delvalle's failed attempt to fire military
strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, which cost Delvalle the
presidency of Panama.
   Nicaragua and Cuba appeared alone among Latin American nations
in announcing their support for Noriega, whose backers in Panama's
National Assembly ousted Delvalle early Friday after he tried to
dismiss the general.
   Ending a three-day meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, the foreign
ministers of seven Latin American countries said they had suspended
Panama from their Group of Eight, a regional organization for
political and economic cooperation.
   The foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela said in a communique that the
suspension was ordered because participation in the group requires
``the clear operation of democratic institutions among members.''
   The communique said the suspension would last ``until a new
evaluation of the circumstances'' in Panama, where Noriega controls
the 15,000-man military and police as Defense Forces chief.
   In Managua, President Daniel Ortega on Friday pledged
``unconditional solidarity'' with Noriega, who was indicted on drug
trafficking charges in Florida earlier this month.
   Ortega said the general's problems began when ``the United
States government arrived and told Gen. Noriega: `Gen. Noriega, we
need you to support us in an invasion against the Nicaraguan
people' and Gen. Noriega and the Defense Forces of Panama said no.''
   Panama helped the leftist Sandinistas in their guerrilla war
against the Nicaraguan government of President Anastasio Somoza,
who was ousted in July 1979. Noriega, considered the real power
behind Panama's civilian government, was instrumental in the effort.
   In Havana, the Cuban foreign ministry issued a statement blaming
the situation on an alleged U.S. campaign aimed at extending U.S.
control of the Panama Canal, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina
said in a dispatch monitored Friday in Mexico City.
   Under a 1977 treaty with the United States, Panama is to take
over the canal and its defense in 1999.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Friday that the United States was not considering military
intervention in Panama, where the U.S. Southern Command and its
10,000 troops are based.
   In a statement, the Venezuelan government expressed support for
Delvalle's dismissal order of Noriega and called on Panama's armed
forces to respect it.
   ``The Venezuelan government reaffirms its unequivocal position
on the respect that the military forces in Panama owe to the
civilian power, as dictated by Panama's Constitution,'' said the
brief communique issued in Caracas.
   In a brief statement, the Argentine government said Friday it
``would like to make publicly known its solidarity with President
Eric Delvalle.''
   El Salvador's vice president, Rodolfo Castillo Claramount,
called Delvalle's ouster ``nothing more than a simple and vulgar
coup d'etat carried out by a group of military gorillas headed by
Noriega.''
   Castillo Calamount told a news conference Friday that the
Salvadoran government ``is seriously considering the possibility of
suspending diplomatic relations with the new Panamanian
government.''

   A last-minute plea by Gov. Evan Mecham's
new defense team failed to win a delay in his impeachment trial as
the Arizona Supreme Court refused to intercede.
   The four justices who heard his appeal for an emergency stay
Friday cited constitutional separation of powers in refusing to
intervene in the trial scheduled to begin in the state Senate
Monday.
   However, they said they would consider a more detailed request
during the court's regular conference Tuesday.
   Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat, predicted the
justices would not interfere with the nation's first impeachment
trial of a governor in half a century.
   The court's rebuff to Mecham capped a turbulent day for the
first-term Republican governor, who also faces criminal charges of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   First, Mecham's chief lawyer, Murray Miller of Phoenix,
disclosed he had resigned. He said Jerris Leonard, a Washington
lawyer and former assistant attorney general under President Nixon,
was taking charge.
   ``We brought in a number of new people and Murray chose to
leave,'' Mecham told The Associated Press Friday night. ``We parted
as friends. I've got the best of representation.''
   Leonard and another addition to the defense team, Thomas Crowe,
promptly launched a last-ditch effort to win a delay that the
Senate had refused to grant Wednesday night.
   By late Friday afternoon, they had filed a stack of legal
documents with the Supreme Court, and the emergency hearing was
granted.
   Crowe argued that the governor's constitutional right to due
process would be violated if the Senate judged him before a jury
trial scheduled to begin March 22 on the criminal charges. The
Arizona Civil Liberties Union filed a friend-of-the-court brief
making the same argument.
   The justices immediately expressed concern about breaching the
separation of judicial and legislative powers.
   ``Even if I agreed with everything you said in your papers,''
said Vice Chief Justice Stanley Feldman, ``what jurisdiction does
this court have to tell the Senate what to do in a job that the
constitution says should be done by the Senate and not the
judiciary?''
   Feldman presided in place of Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon, who
recused himself because the state constitution requires him to
preside over the impeachment trial.
   Attorney John Lundin, representing the Senate, told the
justices: ``You are being asked to enter an arena that has never
been entered into by any court in this nation.'' He said they
should decline to take that step.
   Mecham was impeached Feb. 5 on a 46-14 House vote, forcing him
to turn over power temporarily to Secretary of State Rose Mofford.
   Several days later, the House approved 23 impeachment articles,
charging Mecham with concealing the $350,000 loan to his 1986
campaign, misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by
lending it to his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official.
   Miller, who had represented Mecham since October, bowed out
abruptly. At first he would not say why, but later expressed
bitterness at the way Leonard had walked into his office early in
the week and announced that Mecham had hired him to take over the
case.
   He said Leonard, who entered the case Tuesday, told him he could
not begin such a complex case by Monday because ``that would be
malpractice.'' But he said Leonard later changed his mind.
   On Friday night, Leonard and Crowe filed a certification with
the Senate that they are ready to proceed.
   Among those opposing Leonard's participation in the case were
partners of his own law firm. He was forced to resign from the
prestigious Washington firm of Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg, Tunney
and Evans because of his decision to represent Mecham.
   Charles T. Manatt, senior partner in the firm and a former
Democratic National Committee chairman, said the firm wasn't
interested in representing Mecham for ``lots of reasons,'' but
would not elaborate.

   Sikh extremists were suspected fo killing
a Hindu police investigator early today and seven members of a Sikh
family, police in Punjab state said.
   The Sikh family was murdered Friday night at their farmhouse in
the village of Talwandi Chamchuk, about 25 miles west of Amritsar,
by six Sikh men armed with automatic rifles, said Amritsar District
Chief of Police Izhar Alam.
   The United News of India news agency quoted unidentified police
sources as saying the family apparently refused to pay extortion
money to members of the Khalistan Liberation Force, one the of Sikh
underground separatist groups.
   Khalistan is what the extremists call the independent Sikh
homeland they have been fighting to establish in the northern
Indian state since 1982.
   The victims were identified as Pirana Singh, 55, his wife,
Surinder, 50, two sons and two daughters and a visiting relative.
   The Hindu police investigator, Jeewan Lal, was killed near the
town of Ludhiana, southeast of Amritsar, police said.
   The latest slayings raised to at least 304 the number of people
killed this year in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists. Nearly
two-thirds of the victims have been Sikhs.
   Last year, more than 1,000 people were killed in Punjab by the
militants.
   Sikhs, whose religion is an offshoot of Hinduism, claim they are
discriminated against by India's Hindu majority. Sikhs comprise
about 2 percent of India's 800 million population but are a
majority in Punjab.

   A popular television actor says he can
take his toupe off now that Chun Doo-hwan is no longer president.
   Park Yong-shik, 44, said Friday he was forced to wear a
hairpiece during Chun's seven-year term because he looks strikingly
like the balding former president, who was succeeded Thursday by
Roh Tae-woo.
   Park said he was banned from appearing on state-run television
in 1981 without explanation. Park said he found out later it was
because he resembled the 57-year-old Chun.
   In 1982, Park said, his proposal to wear a toupe and grow a
beard to change his appearance was accepted. However, he lost
important roles in soap operas and other programs and only received
minor parts in historical dramas.
   ``I hope such a comic thing will never happen again,'' Park said.

   Federal indictments alleging a Cuban role in
cocaine shipments from Colombia marked the third time in recent
months that the Caribbean island nation has been linked to the
narcotics network.
   The two indictments unsealed Friday charged 17 people with
smuggling cocaine into Florida through a Cuban military base, and a
federal drug official said the operation apparently had official
cooperation.
   Nine defendants had been arrested by Friday night, said Jack
Hook, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro's name surfaced in the indictment
earlier this month of Panamanian strongman Gen. Maneul Antonio
Noriega. Last October, members of a similar drug ring allegedly
operating in part through Cuba were indicted here.
   In an interview broadcast on NBC-TV Thursday, Castro denied
there is drug trafficking of any type in his nation, calling Cuba
``the cleanest country in the world.''
   The evidence in the latest indictment ``does not make a
statement that the Cuban government has an official policy of
assisting drug traffickers,'' said Jack. ``What it does say is that
when a drug-trafficking, private, light aircraft lands on a
military base in Cuba and the cocaine is offloaded and placed onto
boats destined for the U.S., it is quite clear that somebody on
that base in an official capacity is involved.''
   The indictments, returned earlier this week by a grand jury
here, make no mention of involvement by Cuban government officials,
said Ana Barnett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
   One indictment charges five people, the other 12.
   The indictments described four cocaine loads totaling 3,800
pounds. Two came through Cuba in April and May, one through Haiti
in October and one through the Bahamas. The date of the Bahamas
shipment was not available.
   ``This does not indict or name or allegedly name any Cuban
officials,'' said Hook. ``But it is significant in proving that
Cuba is most definitely being used as a transshipment point for
Colombian cocaine destined for the United States.''
   Hook said he had no information on how far that involvement goes
in Cuban government.
   One defendant told an informant that he could arrange Cuban
coast guard escorts for drug boats leaving Cuban waters for
Florida, he said.
   Hook said the indictment shows that Cuba, even with its strict
security, is as susceptible to drug trafficking as are other
Caribbean nations, such as the Bahamas and Haiti.
   In October, police broke up a ring that allegedly smuggled drugs
into the United States through Cuba and other Caribbean islands.
Federal officials said there was no evidence of Cuban government
involvement.
   The indictment of Noriega charged that Castro was aware of the
Panamanian's drug activities and mediated a dispute over bribe
money between Noriega and Colombia's Medellin drug cartel. Castro
denied those allegations in the NBC interview.
   NBC also reported Thursday that U.S. officials say they have
solid evidence that Cuban MiG fighters and Cuban coast guard boats
have escorted and protected cocaine shipments on their way from
Colombia to the Florida Keys through Cuba.

   Authorities charged a fourth
American soldier with smuggling cocaine to the United States aboard
a U.S. military plane from Panama.
   Richard Mark Williams was charged Friday before U.S. Magistrate
Roberto Schmidt Monge in San Juan with smuggling, possession and
possession with intent to distribute 17 pounds of cocaine.
   He was brought from Panama to Puerto Rico on Friday, authorities
said. His age, rank and hometown were not given.
   Authorities said the cocaine was among 77 pounds confiscated
Jan. 30 during a U.S. Customs Service inspection of a U.S. Military
Air Command plane traveling from Howard Air Force Base in Panama to
the United States.
   The plane had stopped for refueling at the U.S. Roosevelt Roads
Naval Station in northwestern Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth.
   Williams became the fifth person, four of whom are American
soldiers, to be arrested and charged after the cocaine was found on
the plane.
   If convicted, Williams could be sentenced to up to 40 years in
prison.
   Federal officials said they were seeking one other American,
stationed in Panama, in the same investigation.
   Information about the case was limited because indictments
against the suspects were sealed in U.S. District Court in San Juan.
   Williams was detained in Panama, escorted by military personnel
on a commercial flight and arrested by FBI and Drug Enforcement
Administration agents on arrival at Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport in San Juan, according to court sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Two other U.S. soldiers facing federal charges of possessing and
importing 17 pounds of cocaine on the Jan. 30 flight pleaded
innocent Thursday at their arraignment in the district court.
   The two, Darrin Taylor, 19, of Chicago, and Franklyn Milton
Browne, 19, of Far Rockaway, N.Y., were arrested Jan. 30 along with
another soldier, Bruce Morris Mack, 20, of Gary, Ind., and Rafael
A. Valladares, 29, a Panamanian, who officials said was carrying
false documents identifying him as a U.S. soldier.
   Valladares, a civilian, was dressed in a U.S. Army uniform and
had dogtags and Army travel orders when arrested.
   Valladares and Mack were working independently of the other two
suspects and of each other, according to Arthur Barnes, assistant
special agent in charge of the DEA office in San Juan.
   The San Juan Star, citing unidentified official sources,
reported Friday that one American had established drug contacts in
Panama shortly before or after being discharged from the Army and
the other had supplied members of a drug ring with bogus travel
orders and military identification papers.
   It quoted the sources as saying one of the men had established
contacts with Panama's military chief, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who is under indictment in the United States on drug trafficking
charges.
   ``The authorities now think that the ring had been using
military aircraft for at least a year, making weekly trips to the
U.S. with the drugs,'' the Star reported.
   It said the ring used fake travel orders, and the men who would
transport the drugs would leave on Fridays from Howard Air Force
Base and travel to South Carolina and Texas, where the narcotics
were unloaded. The carriers would be back on the Howard base by
Monday, before they could be declared absent without leave, the
newspaper said.

   A 36-year-old East German man fled
uninjured over the heavily fortified border to West Germany by
climbing fences under cover of darkness, border police said.
   The man crossed the frontier late Thursday near the West German
community of Philippsthal, 90 miles northeast of Frankfurt, said
border police in Kassel. The escapee was not identified.
   At least 17 people have fled over East Germany's border with

<HEAD>China Publishes Photo Biography of Deng</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who has criticized
the personality cult that surrounded Mao Tse-tung, is the subject
of a government-published biography that includes 500 photographs
dating back to 1921.
   Among the pictures, half of which are being published for the
first time, are shots taken by Deng's daughter when Mao exiled Deng
to the countryside during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the
official China Daily said today.
   Deng, 83, was branded a capitalist during the upheaval but came
back after Mao's death in 1976 to steer China on a course of
market-oriented reform and opening to the outside world that has
significantly improved living standards.
   The 304-page book, compiled by the official Xinhua News Agency
and the Communist Party's Department on Party Literature, was
described as the most complete and accurate introduction of Deng
printed in China.
   The book also contains wartime photos of Deng with his wife Zhou
Lin and pictures of him playing billiards and cards, swimming and
mountain climbing.
   More than 250 people, including Politburo Standing Committee
member Hu Qili, gathered at the Great Hall of the People Friday
evening to celebrate publication of the book, China Daily said.
   Deng, who has cut down his public appearances since retiring
from most of his top posts last fall, did not attend the party.
Although in semi-retirement, he is still regarded as China's most
powerful politician.
   The book has been published in Chinese and English, with French,
Japanese and German editions to come out later.

<TEXT>
   The celebrated case of a wealthy Chinese
peasant who bought a cropduster for his village has become a tale
of woe with the revelation today that the plane never has been used
by the farmers.
   Guo Yuanying of central Henan province bought the ``Bee-3''
model ultralight aircraft for $7,258 in April 1984 to help
neighbors in spraying pesticides and fertilizer, China's domestic
China News Service reported.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said at the time that Guo,
then 37, was the country's first peasant to buy an airplane,
drawing from his textile accessory factory's hefty profits.
   That report said the local government planned to send three
peasants to the Beijing Aeronautical Engineering institute to learn
to fly and would build a small airfield.
   But today's report said the local government did not have the
money and that the airplane remained at the Zhengzhou airport for
two years before being donated to a tourist resort near the Yellow
River, where it has languished in a warehouse.
   The domestic news service noted that Guo's village is in a
region plagued by locusts and asked, ``Why is it so difficult to
utilize modern technology?''

<TEXT>
   Problems forced an Army helicopter to land twice
before it crashed in a North Texas cow pasture, killing 10 soldiers
and seriously burning eight, witnesses said.
   The Chinook CH-47D helicopter had been on a routine transport
flight from Fort Hood in central Texas to Fort Sill, Okla., when it
crashed Thursday near Chico.
   The helicopter landed immediately after takeoff from Fort Hood
when pilot Ronald W. Bender reported that a ``fault light'' on his
instrument panel had come on, base spokesman Mike Miller said.
   After checking the helicopter, Bender again received clearance
to take off, and left the base, Miller said. The spokesman said it
was not unusual for pilots to land to check out warning lights.
   About 20 minutes later, the helicopter landed near Cranfills Gap
about 45 miles north of Fort Hood on land owned by rancher John
David Abdnor.
   Abdnor said the aircraft's engines stopped. He said the
helicopter was on the ground about 20 minutes before lifting off
and heading north.
   ``They opened up the engine on the right side of the back end,''
said Capt. Calvin Turner of Killeen, who survived the crash. ``We
got back in, strapped up, started flying and all of a sudden we
heard a lot of noise.
   ``Smoke started coming out. We all ran up to the cab (in the
front). There was a lot of black smoke, and that's all I remember.''
   The seven remaining Chinooks at Fort Sill were grounded and
inspections ordered before they can be returned to service, base
spokesman Richard Brown said.
   Investigators were tight-lipped Friday on the cause of the crash.
   ``We don't have any information about what happened on board.
What we're telling ... is that the Army is investigating the crash,
but anything else I tell you would be either rumor or
speculation,'' said Fort Hood spokesman Capt. Michael Monett.
   ``The Army just does not discuss an ongoing investigation,'' he
said.
   A Pentagon source who asked that his name not be used said Army
officials had been told ``there was some maintenance work done on
the ground after the Chinook landed at Fort Hood.''
   ``But whether that's germane to anything remains to be seen,''
the official added. ``The investigators will have to check into
that. There's no indication yet that mechanics worked on something
at Hood that later could have caused a fire.''
   Monett said the probe could take a year.
   Seven men, including Bender, died at the scene, including one of
two soliders who leaped from the flaming aircraft before it crashed.
   Two of the injured were in critical condition today at Brooke
Army Medical Center in San Antonio, three at Parkland Hospital in
Dallas were in stable condition, and two at Harris Methodist
Hospital were in serious but stable condition, officials said. The
eighth was picked up by an Army ambulance from Bridgeport Hospital
in Wise County.
   No orders have been issued to ground the entire fleet of CH-47s,
said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon.
   The Army grounded its entire fleet of 63 Chinooks for 1{ months
in 1985 after an accident in Honduras injured eight soldiers. The
CH-47D, which has a troop capacity of 44, is a modernized version
of the craft used heavily in Vietnam.

   The decision by leaders of Jimmy
Swaggart's denomination to have Louisiana officials rethink their
proposed three-month suspension of the TV evangelist has increased
pressure on the church, a spokeswoman says.
   ``The longer it goes without reaching a conclusion, the more
questions we have from our own members and our pastors,''
Assemblies of God spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said Friday. `It
creates a hardship on that pastor of the local church, whose
congregation is saying `Hey, what's going on and why is this taking
so long?'''
   Swaggart tearfully confessed to unspecified sins from his pulpit
Sunday in Baton Rouge, La., and an admitted prostitute said in
interviews this week that she had performed lewd acts for Swaggart
for about a year.
   G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendent of the
Springfield-based Assemblies of God, the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination with 2 million U.S. members, refused
Friday to say what penalty the church recommended for Swaggart.
   CBS News reported that the church's Executive Presbyery told
leaders of the Louisiana district to order Swaggart to step down
for a year. The network cited no sources for the report.
   Church executives met here for 11 hours over two days to
consider a tougher penalty after many members called Assemblies of
God headquarters to complain that a three-month suspension from
preaching was too lenient. The Louisiana council also recommended
Swaggart receive counseling during a two-year rehabilitation.
   Mrs. Turnage said the headquarters was still receiving hundreds
of phone calls from people ``asking questions, voicing opinions.
People that are hurting, needing prayer, counseling and comfort.
We're anxious for that to get behind us too.''
   Once the Louisiana district has reviewed the Swaggart case, the
Executive Presbytery will take it up again, Carlson said, adding a
final decision could be several days or weeks away.
   Church officials say no other minister accused of moral
misconduct has been allowed to return to preaching in so short a
time as three months.
   Critics have noted that three members of the board of Jimmy
Swaggart World Ministries and Swaggart's co-pastor are on the
Assemblies state governing council, which receives financial
support from the evangelist's organization.
   Council member F.C. Chamberlain of Shreveport said Friday that
the state leaders felt Swaggart's case should be handled
differently ``when he made a complete confession.''
   Chamberlain acknowledged that he was a close friend of
Swaggart's for many years, but denied any favoritism. ``I would
like to think this district would want to do what is right for
everyone,'' he said.
   Swaggart, who has not appeared in public or commented since his
confession, reaches around the world with broadcast sermons and
contributes $12 million a year to the foreign missions programs of
the Assemblies of God.
   It is the second time in a year that the Assemblies of God
considered disciplinary measures against a prominent minister
caught in a scandal. Last year, PTL founder Jim Bakker lost his
Assemblies credentials after it was disclosed he had had sex with a
woman other than his wife and then tried to pay her to keep silent.
Bakker rejected a rehabilitation proposal.
   Mrs. Turnage said the Swaggart case is the most complex ever for
the Executive Presbytery because of the many facets of Swaggart's
ministry, including gospel albums, Bible study tapes and television
tapes.
   `In the past, preaching meant going into the pulpit,'' she said.
But with Swaggart, ``Is his singing going to be considered
preaching? I don't know.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham's new impeachment defense
lawyer, Jerris Leonard, says he's used to representing
controversial clients _ and this time around he has had only a week
to prepare.
   Leonard, a Washington attorney and former head of the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration, joined Mecham's defense team
Monday, a week before the embattled Republican governor's scheduled
Senate trial.
   Leonard suddenly became the lead attorney in the case Thursday
when Mecham's original lawyer, Murray Miller, turned in his
resignation.
   Leonard took the Mecham job at a price _ his job in the law firm
of Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg, Tunney & Evan. Charles Manatt, a
senior partner in the firm and former chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said Leonard was told the firm did not want to
represent Mecham, and Leonard resigned.
   ``I just don't think lawyers should be inhibited from taking
cases because of the politics of them,'' Leonard said Friday. ``The
history of my practice has been to represent controversial
matters.''
   ``If he (Mecham) feels he wants me, he should be entitled to
have the lawyer of his choice,'' he said.
   ``At the moment we're under tremendous pressure'' to prepare the
case by Monday, Leonard said.
   The attorney has been relatively close-mouthed since arriving in
Phoenix early in the week. When he confirmed Tuesday that he had
been hired, he said he was enthusiastic in taking on the governor's
case and promised to present a strong defense.
   Leonard, a former Wisconsin Senate majority leader, headed the
U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division and the LEAA under
President Nixon.
   One of his first clients was Howard ``Bo'' Calloway, chairman of
President Ford's 1976 presidential campaign, who was accused of
pressuring the U.S. Forest Service to speed up an environmental
impact statement on a ski area in which he held an interest.
Calloway was acquitted.
   During those hearings, Leonard became friends with Fred Craft,
then an Interior Department staff lawyer and now a close friend of
Mecham's. Craft was Mecham's Washington lobbyist, hired over the
state Legislature's objections, and he brought Leonard into the
governor's case.
   Leonard also represented retired boxer Muhammad Ali in a $50
million lawsuit against the government over Ali's 1967
draft-evasion prosecution.
   Another Leonard client was underworld figure Allen Dorfman, who
was executed gangland-style in 1983 just before he was to start
serving a prison term for receiving kickbacks.
   Leonard himself was accused by the federal government of
engaging in an illegal pyramid-type scheme to sell vitamins through
a company he headed, United Sciences of America. The company agreed
in an October settlement to pay $105,000 in civil penalties and
$35,000 in attorneys' fees.
   Some Arizona lawmakers said they were impressed with Leonard's
first argument before the Senate on Wednesday, when he requested a
delay in the impeachment trial.
   Leonard referred to his years as a Wisconsin legislator and
warned senators they must think about protecting their own dignity.
``Don't make a mockery out of this trial,'' he said in arguing that
he and Mecham's other lawyers needed more time to prepare.
   Assistant Senate Minority Leader Lela Alston, a Democrat, said
she thought Leonard was effective.
   ``I'm sure he'll get up to speed quickly,'' predicted Minority
Leader Alan Stephens.
   Leonard has not said why few people _ and not even Miller _ were
informed that another lawyer might be brought in until after he was
hired. But he insisted Tuesday, ``We're not trying to hide
anything.''
   Leonard said he believes Mecham has a strong case.
   ``If I thought that he had no opportunity to prevail and be
vindicated I'd say, `Governor, why go through it? Resign,''' he
said.

   A prostitute says drug use caused her to fail
a lie detector test when questioned about her relationship with
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, a television station reported.
   Debra Murphree, who claims Swaggart paid her to pose nude, took
the polygraph test voluntarily Monday after offering to sell the
National Enquirer her story for $100,000, Paul Levy, a senior
editor of the supermarket tabloid, said Friday.
   Levy said the examiner, an expert with 15 years' experience with
the New York City Police Department, concluded the 28-year-old
woman was not truthful on six questions, including one in which she
denied making up the story.
   He said the story included claims that Swaggart paid her to
perform oral sex as well as pose naked and talk dirty.
   Levy said the Enquirer decided not to print her story based on
the lie detector results, her drug history and her record of having
been arrested in three states.
   WVUE-TV of New Orleans, which had interviewed Murphree and aired
her claims this week, reported Friday that she blamed the lie
detector failure on drugs.
   ``I was very nervous. I had been doing crack and cocaine just
the day before. I had trouble remembering some of the questions,''
the station quoted Murphree as saying.
   Murphree, who was said to be Bahamas-bound on Thursday, has
three children living with her parents in Indiana and has a record
of prostitution arrests in Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana,
authorities said.
   John Martinez, a companion of Murphree, told The Palm Beach Post
that Murphree visited Swaggart weekly for a year in New
Orleans-area motel rooms at $50 per meeting.
   Martinez acknowledged he has been trying to sell Murphree's
story since Swaggart's tearful public confession of sin Sunday,
which led the Assemblies of God denomination to recommend the
evangelist be suspended from preaching.
   Swaggart said he was guilty of sins against his wife and God,
but has not commented further. Associates of Swaggart have
described his misconduct as involving pornographic acts.

   Clark Kent, the mild-mannered reporter who heads
for phone booths when he smells trouble, has become more of a
yuppie lately, says a comic book artist who drew Superman for more
than 25 years.
   The appraisal came from Curt Swan, 68, at Friday's 50th
anniversary party for the comic book character.
   Kent, Superman's alter ego, was initially portrayed as a
``milquetoast, sweet, timid'' man, Swan said. But he is now often
portrayed by other illustrators as more of a yuppie, with tailored
suits and a muscular physique.
   ``He wears high-fashion clothes,'' Swan said, adding that he
prefers the old Kent.
   The character of Superman, though, has remained relatively
unchanged over the years, he said.
   Some of the hundreds of people who attended the party, including
10-year-old Danny Williams of Greenwich, Conn., said they like it
that way.
   ``He's a hero. He's so strong. He flies and he's a legend,''
Williams said as he watched TV clips of Superman.
   The party, staged by DC Comics, the comic-book publisher that
introduced the cartoon character in June 1938, drew children and
adults fascinated with the Man of Steel, impervious to all but the
disabling substance kryptonite.
   ``I came from a world that no longer exists. Men would call me
Superman,'' came a voice through loudspeakers as the crowd was
treated to a slide show, replays of original radio programs and a
sound and light show.
   The party included a smoke-filled, tunnel-like hallway
supposedly made of the fictitious kryptonite. Some children
hesitated, scared to walk through.
   Superman was actually created in 1933, when two high school boys
from Cleveland _ Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster _ depicted a man who
could bend steel with his bare hands.
   It took until 1937 for Siegel, the writer, and Shuster, the
illustrator, to sell their idea to a man who needed a fresh new
lead character in a new comic book. The first issue sold hundreds
of thousands of copies.
   Through the years, Superman's daring rescues and battles against
evil have been chronicled in hundreds of newspaper funny pages, a
radio serial, a TV series and movies.
   The cast of characters includes reporter Lois Lane, his
perennial heartthrob, eager-beaver cub reporter Jimmy Olsen and
Perry White, blustering editor of the Daily Planet.
   A yearlong celebration of Superman, which will continue through
June, features an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History, the release of the movie
``Superman IV,'' a prime-time CBS special and the unveiling of a
statue celebrating Superman and his creators.
   Superman over the years has ``become part of the culture all
over the world,'' said Paul Levitz, executive vice president of DC
Comics.
   ``There was a period a few years ago where we were selling more
comic books in Germany than in the United States,'' he said. ``The
basic myth of the character touches everyone. We'd all like to
think that within the Clark Kent we all are there is the Superman
inside.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he wished there ``were a Superman I
could have in the city to protect us from crime.''
   ``I like Superman comics. I used to read them when I was a kid.
My father said it was junk,'' said Dorothy A. Puzo, a movie
director and writer whose father, the novelist Mario Puzo, wrote
screenplays for two Superman movies.

   A motorist on his way to work stopped to help
at an accident scene, only to discover the mortally injured victim
was his own 6-year-old son.
   ``I thought I was helping somebody else's kid,'' said Herbert L.
Robinson, a state employment specialist. ``I just saw him laying
there on the street and people standing around trying to take care
of him.''
   Mark and his 10-year-old sister, Joanna, were on their way to
school when the accident happened Friday, said their mother, Janet
Robinson.
   Police said the boy stopped to tie his shoe while walking with
two other children. When he hurried to catch up, he ran into an
intersection and was struck by a car.
   He died after being taken to Milwaukee County Medical Complex.

   The government said it freed more than
2,000 prisoners today as part of a ``grand amnesty.'' Opposition
leaders called the clemency deceitful, claiming 1,200 political
prisoners were still in jail.
   ``Release all prisoners of conscience,'' the National Coalition
for Democracy, the main coalition of dissident groups, said in a
statement.
   The new government of President Roh Tae-woo said it released
2,134 people from jails today and 5,100 others had their sentences
reduced or their civic rights restored.
   About 125 dissidents were among those freed and 1,606 others had
sentences reduced or regained their rights. The rest of the people
included in the amnesty were common criminals.
   Dissidents and other prisoners were released early today from
prisons in Seoul and other cities.
   Roh, who took office Thursday with a promise to introduce
sweeping democratic reforms, said the amnesty was to build public
confidence and underline the government's determination to end
decades of authoritarian rule.
   But the amnesty did not include dissidents who had refused to
repent or ``fundamentally reject free democracy,'' the government
said. Dissidents who had committed serious crimes such as murder or
arson were also excluded.
   Among the excluded were prominent dissident leaders Chang Ki-pyo
and Kim Kun-tae, both serving seven-year terms for inciting riots.
Amnesty International and other human rights groups have demanded
Kim's release.
   About 100 radicals and relatives of jailed dissidents staged a
protest today in Seoul outside the National Council of Churches
building. They shouted ``Release all the prisoners,'' but passersby
showed little interest.
   Scuffles, kicking and punching broke out as riot police barred
the way when the protesters tried to march. Furious protesters hit
police with placards and fists and seized several riot shields and
smashed them, but they were prevented from marching.
   Dissident leader Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, who had his civic rights
restored under the amnesty, told the protesters the amnesty was a
fraud. ``As long as there is a single dissident in jail, democracy
cannot be achieved,'' he declared.
   In announcing the ``grand amnesty'' Friday, Culture and
Information Minister Chung Han-mo said it was intended to promote
``national harmony and restore public confidence'' in the
government.
   At a news conference today, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung
called for ``total'' amnesty, complaining that the number of
political prisoners released constituted only a small portion of
political detainees. He called on the government to free all but
those who admitted to being communists.
   Communism is outlawed in South Korea.
   Kim Dae-jung later denounced Roh's government at a rally in
Seoul attended by about 4,000 people. He reiterated his claim that
presidential elections in December had been rigged, and urged
people to vote for the opposition in upcoming legislative elections.
   But the veteran opposition leader also said he was willing to
give Roh a chance to meet his promise to usher in full democracy.
   ``I can cooperate with Roh as the incumbent ruler in power if he
carries out sweeping reforms, including complete freedom, release
of all politicl prisoners and full guarantee of other civil
rights,'' he said.
   Kim Dae-jung and rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam were both
defeated by Roh in the presidential balloting, though the winner
did not receive a majority of the ballots cast.
   Government officials say 276 political detainees are still
behind bars _ 216 still awaiting trial and 60 others serving
sentences for serious crimes.
   The authorities hinted that some of those awaiting trial may be
freed when judicial processes are completed.

   Government agents raided a
prostitution den in a nearby resort at dawn today, arresting seven
Americans and 15 other foreigners who were customers or managers of
teen-age male prostitutes, officials said.
   The arrests were made at a hotel and eight cottages in
Pagsanjan, a riverside resort town 40 miles southeast of Manila
that has long been notorious for child prostitutes who cater to
foreign tourists.
   Miriam Defensor-Santiago, chief of the Commission on Immigration
and Deportation, said she planned to begin deportation proceedings
Monday against the arrested foreigners, whose identities were not
immediately available.
   Evidence seized during the raid included hundreds of color
photographs of naked male and female teen-agers that officials said
prostitution den operators used as catalogues for customers.
   In addition to the Americans, those arrested included five West
Germans, three Australians, two Belgians, a Briton, a Spaniard, a
Dutchman, a Canadian and a Japanese, said Mrs. Defensor-Santiago.
   She said they ranged in age from 55 to 60.
   The immigration chief told reporters she could also file
criminal charges against the foreigners but thought deportation was
the better option.
   ``I believe that their continued presence in Philippine society
would be inimical to the national interest,'' Mrs.
Defensor-Santiago added. ``Therefore, I prefer to act more
quickly.''
   She said she had evidence that some of those arrested were not
customers but rather operators of establishments ``engaged in
wide-scale child prostitution.''
   The agents also rounded up 18 male prostitutes aged 14 and 15
and a 16-year-old girl and three Filipino recruiters, Mrs.
Defensor-Santiago said. The teen-agers over to the Department of
Social Welfare.
   She said government officials were studying whether to prosecute
the children, who could be liable to jail terms of six years, or to
treate them as ``victims,'' which would qualify them for aid under
a government rehabilitation program.
   Estimates on the number of male and female prostitutes in this
country range from 100,000 to one million.

<TEXT>
   The country's mainstream Shiite Moslem
militia fired its security chief, who claimed the kidnapped U.S.
Marine colonel the militia has been trying to find and free is a
NATO spy.
   The fired security chief, Mustafa Dirani, also criticized the
Amal militia for arresting Shiite radicals in its search for Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins.
   Also Friday, there was a claim of responsibility for the
kidnapping of two Scandinavian U.N. relief workers in a note
delivered to a Western news agency in west Beirut.
   The handwritten Arabic note bore the victims' signatures,
fingerprints and handwritten lines in English purportedly from the
captives that said they were in good health.
   It said the two would be freed when their ``interrogation'' is
complete.
   Amal, which has been searching for Higgins since his abduction
in southern Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists Feb.
17, said in a statement Friday that Dirani was ``relieved of his
responsibility as head of the central security system.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Higgins, 43, commanded a 76-member truce observer group from 16
nations attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, known as
UNIFIL.
   Dirani said in a statement of his own that NATO paid Higgins and
some officials of the 5,800-man UNIFIL force to gather information
about terrorists.
   ``Regarding the American officer, I would like to stress that we
have confirmed information that NATO is seeking to confront what it
calls terrorism ... by forming security systems specializing in
Lebanon to gather information in preparation for acts of piracy in
the future,'' Dirani said in the statement, which did not mention
his dismissal.
   His accusations echoed claims by the kidnappers, a group calling
itself the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, that Higgins is
a CIA spy.
   Dirani, a former master sergeant in the Lebanese army,
criticized Amal for detaining members of Hezbollah, which is allied
with Iran and is challenging Amal for supremacy in predominantly
Shiite south Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella for
groups holding most of the 25 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   U.S. officials denied Higgins was a spy and U.N. spokesman Timur
Goksel said Friday that Dirani's allegations were baseless.
   ``All UNIFIL personnel report directly to UNIFIL headquarters
and to nowhere else,'' he said.
   Higgins, from Danville, Ky., once was an aide to former U.S.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. He was seized near the
ancient port of Tyre, an Amal stronghold 50 miles south of Beirut.
   He is the ninth American among the missing foreigners. The
hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, abducted March 16, 1985.
   A group identifying itself as Revolutionary Cells claimed
responsibility for kidnapping two Scandinavian officials of the
U.N. Relief and Works Agency on Feb. 5. The group's motives and
affiliations were not known.
   In the note it released Friday, the group said it would free Jan
Stening, 44, of Sweden, and William Jorgenson, 58, of Norway, once
their ``interrogation'' is completed.
   ``I am in good health and I hope that I will be released soon,''
Stening purportedly wrote on the note.
   ``I am in good health and am eating good. Also I hope to be
released very soon,'' Jorgensen wrote.
   Stening and Jorgensen were seized near the Ein el-Hileweh
refugee camp on the outskirts of the southern port of Sidon.
   Marrack Goulding, the U.N. undersecretary-general for political
affairs, said secret contacts were under way with ``people who
might have influence'' on the abductors to win the release of the
captives.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency supplies medical help,
schooling and food to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and the
Israeli-occupied territories.

   The murder of a young policeman shot three times
in the head at point-blank range was intended to intimidate those
who help authorities in the war against drug dealers, the police
commissioner said.
   Officer Edward Byrne, 22, killed as he sat in his patrol car
early Friday, was guarding the home of a Queens man who complained
to authorities about neighborhood crack dealers, authorities said.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward called it ``a deliberate
assassination'' and an ``attempt to intimidate not just that
witness but all'' who cooperate with police against drug dealers.
   ``An attack on a cop is an attack on society,'' said Mayor
Edward I. Koch, adding that the city was offering a $10,000 reward
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer
or killers.
   A private group calling itself Citizens Outraged at Police Being
Shot and the Daily News offered an additional $10,000 each.
   A confidential, 24-hour hotline was established for tips. Police
said that one or more people had seen part of the attack, which
took place in a residential area beset with cocaine trafficking and
violence related to turf wars between drug dealers.
   Witnesses told police that two men pulled up to Byrne's cruiser
in a car. One got out, approached the patrol car, then quickly
fired five shots into the vehicle before fleeing with the other man.
   The man being protected had a firebomb thrown through his window
after he provided information that led to the arrest in November of
a young man suspected of dealing crack, authorities said. Two
others were arrested in connection with the firebombing, and two
more were arrested on charges stemming from threats made against
the homeowner.
   The 40-year-old man, a Guyanese immigrant who goes by the single
name Arjune, said Friday that he has moved his family from the
house, which he has been unsuccessfully trying to sell.
   ``I heard the shots. ... I can't say anything. ... I'm scared to
death, in fear for my life,'' he said Friday.
   Ward dismissed speculation that Friday's killing was related to
the sentencing Thursday of Lorenzo ``Fat Cat'' Nichols, the reputed
head of a drug empire in southeast Queens.
   Nichols, 29, was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life for 11
narcotics and gun convictions.
   Police in recent years have tried to respond to the growing drug
trade in southeast Queens, launching a major drug sweep known as
``Operation Cleanup'' in September 1985. In its first two years, it
resulted in 400 felony drug arrests and 225 misdemeanor arrests,
along with seizure of 85 firearms and 30 pounds of cocaine.
   The slaying cast a pall over a promotion ceremony Friday for 91
people at Police Headquarters.
   ``Each of us enters this job with full knowledge of the inherent
danger, but we do not expect to be gunned down in this manner,''
Ward told the crowd.
   Byrne, whose father is a retired police lieutenant and whose
older brother is a federal prosecutor, was single and lived with
his parents in the Long Island city of Massapequa. He had been a
police officer less than two years.

   A ship carrying Philadelphia incinerator ash
is headed back to the Delaware Bay after being turned away by six
countries over 18 months as it tried to find a place to dump its
cargo.
   The Coast Guard said Friday that it has lifted a restriction and
will permit the Khian Sea into harbor. The Coast Guard had barred
the ship because its Liberian registery expired, but spokeswoman
Elizabeth Brannan said of the problem, ``it's all worked out.''
   She said the ship, carrying 15,000 tons of incinerator ash, was
expected to arrive at the mouth of the Delaware Bay early Monday.
   The state Department of Environmental Resources said it would
not allow the Khian Sea to unload until the ash had been tested for
hazardous chemicals.
   ``If the ash tests are hazardous, it must be disposed of as
hazardous material. If it isn't, it can be landfilled,'' said
department spokesman Paul Ciotta.
   Philadelphia incinerator ash has not been found to be hazardous
in the past by government standards, but the environmental group
Greenpeace has contended the ash is toxic.
   Greenpeace has been tracking the ship's unsuccessful efforts to
dispose of its refuse in the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Dominican
Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti and Honduras, and making it the
center of a campaign against exporting waste from the United States.
   ``The City of Brotherly Love must take responsibility for its
ash crisis, and not dump it on developing countries,'' said Jim
Vallette of Greenpeace USA.
   Faced with a shortage of affordable landfill space, the city
hired a contractor, Joseph Paolino & Sons, Inc. of Philadelphia, to
dispose of the ash.
   The Khian Sea set sail Sept. 5, 1986.
   A second ship, the Bark, loaded with about 14,000 tons of city
ash, left Philadelphia Feb. 5, bound for Haiti, according to the
Philadelphia Maritime Exchange. Greenpeace said Friday it learned
from shipping industry sources that the Bark arrived in Haiti on
Feb. 23.

   Police at Jan Smuts Airport
today blew up a plastic bag that they mistakenly believed contained
two limpet mines, authorities said.
   There were no injuries or damage in the controlled explosion,
police spokesman Col. Steve van Rooyen said.
   Van Rooyen said a woman reported seeing a plastic bag in an
unattented cart in the underground parking garage this morning.
Police, believing the bag contained a limpet mine and a mini-limpet
mine, took the bag onto a lawn outside the garage and destroyed it
using their own explosives, the spokesman added.
   Van Rooyen said the items destroyed were not limpet mines, but
were either limpet mine casings or imitation casings. He said that
the person who planted the bag had intended for it to be mistaken
as an explosive device.

<HEAD>Activists Bring Pots, Pans and Cameras In Effort To Thwart Hunters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Hunters became the hunted
when three protesters armed with pots, pans and cameras parachuted
into northeastern British Columbia in an effort to block a
government wolf kill.
   As the Friends of the Wolf members began their effort in the
Muskwa Valley on Friday, the Western Canadian Wilderness Committee
was in British Columbia's Supreme Court in Vancouver seeking an
injunction to halt the wolf hunt.
   Justice Alan Macdonell declined to order an immediate injunction
but ordered that the application be heard Monday.
   Meanwhile, another environmental group, Earth First, planned its
own protest and said it would have people hike into the area to
interfere with the government-paid hunters.
   The provincial government's Enviornmental Ministry announced
Monday that about 55 wolves will be shot in a 3,700-square-mile
area of the valley.
   Biologists blame wolves for reducing populations of moose, stone
sheep, elk and caribou to low levels in the area.
   Since 1977, more than 1,000 wolves have been killed in British
Columbia, and experts estimate there are 7,000 wolves in the
province. Controls in other provinces vary _ Ontario permits the
hunting of coyotes but not timber wolves, while Alberta has
considered a wolf kill for northern areas.
   The three Friends of the Wolf protesters _ Myra Finkelstein,
Renee Grandi, and Randy Reibin _ were equipped for 10 days in the
region, where temperatures can drop far below zero at night, the
organization said.
   They were carrying video and camera equipment in the belief that
if the hunt was recorded, it would prevent hunters from carrying
out the kill.
   ``With witnesses there, we're pretty confident the hunters won't
even show up,'' said Sue Rodriguez-Pastor in a telephone interview
from Fort St. John, about 500 miles northeast of Vancouver.
   If the government-paid hunters are not deterred, she said the
protesters will try to scare the wolves away with the noise of pots
and pans.
   Ralph Archibald, coordinator of the fish and wildlife branch's
carnivore control program, said Friday he doubted the protesters
could disrupt the hunt.
   ``The Muskwa is a very large area,'' said Archibald in a
telephone interview from Victoria. ``The probability of these
groups bumping into each other is pretty low.''

   North Korea today said South Korean troops fired
several rounds of automatic weapon fire at a North Korean guard
post in the demilitarized zone separating the two countries.
   North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang said the South stationed
about 30 soldiers armed with large-caliber machine guns and
automatic weapons within the DMZ at its central part and fired
several rounds Friday night in a ``grave military provocation.''
   The broadcast, monitored in Tokyo, did not report any casualties
and did not say whether the North returned the fire.
   On Feb. 17, the U.N. Command in South Korea said the North fired
four rounds of machine-gun fire across the DMZ. The command, led by
the United States, said South Korean soldiers did not return
gunfire.
   The Korean peninsula was divided after World War II, and the two
sides, separated by the demilitarized zone, remain bitter enemies
after fighting a war in 1950-53.

   More than 120,000 people, from toddlers
to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, ran in a patriotic show of strength
today to mark the 40th year of India's independence.
   Gandhi, dressed in a gray track suit and sneakers, flagged off
the ``Freedom Run'' near Parliament House, and thousands of people,
mainly schoolchildren, flooded the roads.
   Most of the runners wore T-shirts of saffron, green and white,
the colors of the Indian flag.
   Gandhi and about 70 other VIPs, including Cabinet ministers and
movie stars, joined the run for awhile. The prime minister was
surrounded by a human wall of security guards.
   He ran for about a half a mile before being whisked away in his
bulletproof car. Gandhi faces death threats from Sikh extremists
who have waged a campaign for an independent nation in India's
northern Punjab state.
   Thousands of policemen dotted the entire route of the 24-mile
run through the city, which ended at the National Stadium.
   The event was organized to mark 40 years since India gained its
independence from British colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947.

   Italian journalists today began a nationwide strike
intended to prevent publication of daily newspapers on Sunday and
Monday.
   The walkout, called to protest a breakdown in negotiations for a
new contract, will extend to radio and television journalists
Sunday and Monday.
   Transmitters of the nation's main news agencies, ANSA and AGI,
went silent at 7 a.m.
   The strike will rob readers of news of Italy's Olympic skiing
hero Alberto Tomba, who was going for a second gold medal. However,
the race was being broadcast live on three channels.
   The strike is the latest in a series of job actions by
journalists. The journalists, whose contracts expired in Decmeber,
are seeking pay increases and control over new technology.
   In a related development, the price for daily newspapers is
being raised 8 cents to 72 cents beginning next Tuesday.
   Italians also faced other strikes this weekend.
   Airport ground personnel scheduled a 24-hour walkout Sunday in a
continuing contract dispute, causing the state-run Alitalia
Airlines to cancel many flights to and from Rome's Leonardo da
Vinci airport. The airline said intercontinental flights would
operate on schedule.
   Many schools across Italy, which are normally open Saturday
morning, were shut down as a result of a strike by teachers
demanding higher pay and better working conditions.

<TEXT>
   A Turkish Boeing 727 crashed into
mountains today near the coastal resort city of Kyrenia in northern
Cyprus, killing all 15 people aboard, rescue officials said.
   The charter plane crashed 10 minutes before landing at Ercan
airport in the Turkish Cypriot sector of the war-divided east
Mediterranean island, airport officials said.
   There was no immediate word on what caused the crash at 10:20
a.m. about eight miles east of Kyrenia.
   Ayhan Bolay, director of civil aviation in Turkey's
Communications Ministry, said in Ankara that the weather was clear
and communications were normal with the control tower as the plane
approached Ercan. The mountains were shrouded in mist.
   In his last message to the tower, the pilot said: ``I want to
see the runway as I land,'' Bolay told reporters.
   ``Please confirm you sighted the runway,'' the tower responded
before losing radio contact with the plane, Bolay said.
   Officials said the plane was on a flight from Istanbul to pick
up a group of Finnish tourists for a Sunday flight to Helsinki via
Istanbul.
   Airport officials in Istanbul said the seven crew members were
from Yugoslavia. They said two of the six flight attendants were
British and the others were Turkish.
   The officials said two passengers _ a partner in Talia Airlines,
the Turkish charter company that owned the plane, and his wife _
were also aboard.
   Witnesses said the plane crashed near the Bufavento Castle in
the Kyrenia range, which rises steeply from the coast to a height
of 1,000 feet, and broke in two.
   A pillar of smoke billowed from the blazing wreckage as rescue
teams raced to the crash site, they reported.
   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish sectors since the
Turkish army invaded in 1974 after a short-lived coup by Greek
Cypriot militants seeking union with Greece.
   The Turks seized the northern one-third of the island, including
the coastal resort city of Kyrenia. The 120,000 Turkish Cypriots,
outnumbered 5-1 by Greek Cypriots, declared the north an
independent republic in 1983.
   U.N. spokesman Charles Gaulkin said the U.N. peacekeeping force
on the island contacted Turkish Cypriot authorities and offered to
provide helicopters to help evacuate casualties, ``but they said it
was not necessary.''
   The Boeing was the second plane to crash in the Kyrenia range,
almost in the same spot, in 15 years.
   An Egyptian airliner of the United Arab Airlines crashed about
two miles west of today crash scene on Jan. 29, 1973, on a flight
from Cairo to Nicosia. All 62 people aboard were killed.

   Twenty-three people were convicted in
connection with a drug trafficking ring that used housewives to
smuggle heroin into New York in exchange for cash and a stay at
posh Manhattan hotels.
   In the verdict rendered by a Palermo court Friday evening, all
defendants were convicted of drug trafficking and the alleged
masterminds were also found guilty of Mafia association.
   One of the alleged ringleaders, Francesco Rosciglione, received
the heaviest punishment, an 18-year prison sentence. Another,
Ignazio Mattiolo, was sentenced to 14 years and Salvatore Allegra,
a defendant who became a witness for the state, received a term of
12 years.
   The other defendants, mostly women, were sentenced to terms
ranging from two years to eight years in prison.
   The ring was broken in 1986 when a middle-aged woman carrying
6.6 pounds of heroin was arrested at Palermo's Punta Raisi airport
as she was about to board a flight for New York. The probe was led
by one of Italy's top anti-Mafia investigators, Judge Giovanni
Falcone.
   Prosecutors said the housewives would hide the heroin under
their clothes, dousing themselves heavily with perfume to conceal
the scent from drug-sniffing dogs.
   The women were paid $16,130 for each trip, plus the cost of the
round-trip ticket and all their expenses, including a stay at
exclusive hotels in New York, the prosecutors said.

   Italian porn star and parliamentarian
Ilona Staller was arrested for indecent exposure today after
performing a striptease at a bar and mingling too liberally with
the customers, police said.
   Staller, better known as Cicciolina, was being questioned by
police.
   Staller arrived in the Belgian capital Friday to launch her bid
for a seat in the European Parliament in the 1989 elections and to
speak out in favor of sexual liberty.
   She had scheduled several shows here and in nearby Charleroi.
   Between 200 and 300 people attended her show at the Canal Street
nightclub, including some Brussels police officers.
   Before Staller arrived, police had warned she would be arrested
if her behavior was unacceptable by Belgian standards.
   A police spokesman said while striptease is not illegal in
Belgium, Staller overstepped the bounds of decency when she left
the night club stage and began mingling with the audience.
   Staller was elected to the Italian Parliament last year as a
candidate for the small, outspoken Radical Party.

injuring six others, authorities said.
   Rescue workers dug through the ruins of the settlement in search
of other victims who might be trapped in the debris.
   Those left homeless by the disaster and numerous families whose
homes were threatened were evacuated and given temporary refuge at
a center in the suburbs of Fez, which is 125 miles east of the

   The rescue operation was headed by State Minister Moulay Ahmed
Alaoui, who is also president of the provincial assembly.
   Heavy rains fell in the region for several days.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has indicted two music
promoters, a former radio executive and the wife of one promoter on
charges of tax evasion and paying more than $270,000 in cash plus
cocaine to get records played on the air.
   Employees of nine radio stations in eight cities were named as
receiving the payola between 1980 and 1986, but weren't indicted.
Some were cooperating with authorities, the government said.
   Two of the stations are in Fresno, Calif.; and one each in El
Paso, Texas; Kansas City, Mo.; Atlanta; Cincinnati; Jacksonville,
Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; and Charlotte, N.C.
   The investigation is continuing, but U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner
declined to say if more indictments were expected.
   The three indictments announced Friday stem from an
investigation that began two years ago.
   ``The independent promoters were acting on behalf of virtually
all record companies in this country,'' Bonner said. But he said
there was no evidence that the record companies were aware of the
payola.
   Among those indicted Friday was independent promoter Ralph
Tashjian, an associate of Joseph Isgro, a Los Angeles-based
promoter who also has been under investigation but wasn't named in
the indictments.
   Tashjian, 39, of San Mateo, Calif., was accused of giving cash,
cocaine and ``other valuable considerations'' to radio station
employees. Among the records he pushed were Duran Duran's ``Wild
Boys'' and former Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant's
``Principle Of.''
   Tashjian also was accused of obstructing justice by falsifying
records of his company, Ralph Tashjian Enterprises Inc., after
learning he was under investigation.
   Tashjian and his wife, Valerie, were accused of under-reporting
income by $303,988 for 1983, 1984 and 1985, to evade $101,579 in
federal taxes.
   David Kenner, attorney for the Tashjians, who were arrested at
their home Thursday, said the couple ``categorically denies any
wrongdoing.''
   In a second indictment, independent promoter William Craig, 42,
of Scottsdale, Ariz., also known as William Craighead, was accused
of making illegal payments to get records on the air, willfully
aiding in the preparation of fraudulent federal tax returns and
attempting to evade individual income tax.
   Craig promoted records by Janet Jackson, Culture Club, New
Edition and the Eurythmics, among others.
   A woman who answered one of Craig's telephone numbers took a
message but said it was doubtful the call would be returned.
   A third indictment accused George Wilson Crowell, also known as
George Wilson, 59, former vice president and general manager of
radio station KIQQ in Los Angeles, with willful failure to file
federal income tax returns for 1984, 1985 and 1986.
   Crowell's attorney, Sidney Sodas of Milwaukee, Wis., had no
comment on the indictment.
   Crowell of Denver and Craig are expected to surrender within the
next few days, Bonner said.
   Maximum penalties for those indicted are: Craig, 18 years in
prison, fines of $1.64 million; Tashjian, 23 years, $1.53 million;
Mrs. Tashjian, 15 years, $1.5 million; and Crowell, three years,
$75,000, Bonner said.

   Two Palestinians were reported shot and killed
today and scores wounded in violent clashes with Israeli soldiers,
and hundreds of Israeli Arabs demonstrated in solidarity with their
brethren in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Secretary of State George Shultz took his Middle East peace plan
to the Arab world, while U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem tried again to
arrange a meeting between Shultz and Palestinians.
   Fifteen Palestinians invited to meet with Shultz on Friday
boycotted the meeting.
   Scattered protests were reported in the occupied territories
today, a day after four Arabs died in violent clashes on the Moslem
holy day.
   The U.N. says at least 69 Palestinians have been killed in
violence since Dec. 8, although that figure did not include one of
today's deaths. The Israeli army put the number of dead at 59 and
said 580 Arabs had been wounded by army gunfire.
   In the Arrub refugee camp south of Bethlehem, soldiers fired
tear gas and live ammunition to disperse stone-throwing protesters,
camp residents said.
   A 20-year-old Arrub man, identified as Nihad Abdul Ghafour, died
of gunshot wounds, said Dr. Hani Abdeen of Jerusalem's Mukassad
Hospital, where the victim was taken.
   Abdeen said he treated 12 residents of Arrub and the nearby
villages Halhoul and Dhahiriya for gunshot wounds. Five Arrub
residents suffered broken limbs after being beaten by soldiers, he
said.
   A Halhoul resident died after being shot in the chest during
clashes in that West Bank village, said a doctor at Hebron's Alia
Hospital. The Arab-run Palestine Press Service identified the
victim as Baker Abdullah Al Bao, 17.
   Alia Hospital officials also said they treated 15 Arabs for
gunshot wounds following protests in Halhoul, Arrub and Dhahiriya.
   In the Gaza Strip's Nuseirat refugee camp, a 23-year-old man was
wounded by a gunshot in the back during clashes with soldiers,
hospital officials said.
   The army said it was checking the casualty reports.
   In the Arab village of Shefaram in northern Israel, about 300
Arabs demonstrated peacefully against Israeli policies in the
occupied lands. Police did not interfere.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army imposed or extended curfews on four
refugee camps, confining to their homes 120,000 people, nearly
one-tenth of the 1.5 million Arabs in the occupied lands.
   In leaflets distributed by ``The United National Leadership for
the Uprising'' last week, Palestinian organizers called for stepped
up protests during the Shultz visit, including the defiance of
curfews.
   There were no immediate reports of curfew violations.
   Military police, meanwhile, detained four soldiers who were
filmed beating and kicking two bound Arabs in the West Bank city of
Nablus on Thursday. The army also suspended the unit's deputy
commander and ordered the two Arabs released.
   ``We were shocked and couldn't say a word after we saw this
film,'' the army's West Bank commander, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna,
said Friday after viewing footage of the beating.
   Excerpts of the CBS television footage were screened on Israel
television. They show four soldiers bent over two Arabs lying on
the ground, their hands tied behind their backs.
   The soldiers kicked the Arabs in the head and chest, then picked
up fist-sized rocks and smash them on the Arabs' arms and legs,
trying to break bones.
   Officials said military prosecutors would decide whether to
court-martial the soldiers.
   Shultz flew to Amman, Jordan today and met with high-ranking
officials, who told him the Palestine Liberation Organization must
be permitted to attend an international Middle East peace
conference. Jordan's King Hussein was in London.
   After the four-hour stopover, Shultz flew to Damascus to meet
with Syrian President Hafez Assad. Shultz is on a five-day
diplomatic mission that began Thursday.
   In meetings Friday, Shultz apparently failed to persuade Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to agree to negotations on a Middle
East settlement by the end of the year.
   The U.S. plan calls for immediate talks on Palestinian self-rule
and negotiations by December on the final status of the West Bank
and Gaza, which Israel seized from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Shultz suggested the 15 Palestinians who declined his invitation
to meet Friday night were fearful of working with the United States
because of orders from the PLO.
   In a statement read to reporters, he told Palestinians
``opportunity knocks loudly on your door. Now is the time to get to
work.''
   Those invited had vowed to boycott the meeting because Shultz
refused a PLO demand to consult Palestinians living abroad about
his new peace initiative. Shultz meets again Sunday with Shamir and
Peres before leaving for Cairo to see Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. He returns to Jerusalem again Sunday night for further
talks.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz took
his Middle East peace plan to Syria today after Jordan rebuffed his
attempt to exclude the Soviet Union and the PLO from Middle East
peace negotiations.
   ``Obviously that's their point of view,'' Shultz said in Amman
after hearing Jordanian demands sharply at odds with U.S. and
Israeli positions.
   Shultz has called for Palestinian participation in negotiations,
but not participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shultz also opposes an active role for the Soviets in shaping a
Middle East settlement to end the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   But Jordanian Foreign Minister Taher Masri, while calling
Shultz's meeting with Jordanian officials ``serious and useful,''
said the only way for a peace settlement was through an
international conference, including the Soviets and the PLO.
   In Israel, Shultz also encountered resistance from Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to his plea for an accelerated timetable
for negotiations leading to talks on a final settlement by December.
   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Shamir
urged Shultz to move slowly on the issue of Palestinian self-rule
despite the 11 weeks of anti-occupation unrest.
   The U.S. plan calls for immediate talks on Palestinian self-rule
and negotiations by December on the final status of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Egypt and Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Shultz had hoped with his mission to diffuse unrest on the
occupied territories, where Palestinians have clashed with Israeli
soldiers almost daily since since Dec. 8.
   A further setback was a boycott Friday in Jerusalem by 15
Palestinians invited by Shultz to discuss their aspirations for
national rights.
   After the boycott, Shultz read a statement carried on Israeli
television to Arabs in the region saying, ``opportunity knocks
loudly on your door. Now is the time to get to work.''
   In Amman, the PLO said today it is willing to meet U.S.
officials ``on any level,'' and said American rejection of a
meeting shows the United States is not serious about Arab-Israeli
peace.
   U.S. policy forbids American diplomats to meet ranking PLO
officials because the the administration regards the PLO as a
terrorist organization.
   Shultz pushed on and flew to Damascus to discuss the gloomy
outlook with Syrian President Hafez Assad, whom he has described as
a key player in any Middle East settlement.
   Shultz is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit Damascus
since 1983.
   In Amman, Masri said the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France _ and the PLO must be invited to peace talks.
   Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, which is waging a guerrilla
war against the Jewish state, and Israel has U.S. backing for this
position.
   Shultz also supports Shamir in trying to keep the Soviets from
trying to influence the outcome of any peace talks.
   In Jerusalem, U.S. diplomats tried again to arrange a meeting
between Shultz and Palestinian figures.
   In his television statement Friday, Shultz implied the
Palestinians were afraid to meet him because they would be defying
the PLO, which instructed Palestinians in the occupied territories
to boycott Shultz's invitation.
   ``Peace-making is difficult,'' Shultz said. ``Peace has its
enemies, but peace is a necessary ingredient to a decent life.''
   The stopover in Amman was not considered critical, since King
Hussein is in London, where he will meet with Shultz on Tuesday.
   On Sunday, Shultz meets again with Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres before leaving for Cairo to see Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
   Shultz returns to Jerusalem again Sunday night for further talks
with Shamir.

   A U.S. Navy ship docked in the
southern port city of Pusan on Saturday and discharged the first
U.S. soldiers and equipment to arrive for large military exercises,
news reports said.
   The Yonhap news agency said the 26,000-ton Regulus arrived from
Takoma, Wash., carrying 714 U.S. soldiers, 14 helicopters, three
tractors and 1,036 trucks.
   The United States and South Korea plan to deploy about 200,000
soldiers in the annual ``Team Spirit'' exercises, scheduled to run
from late February to early May.
   U.S. officials said the exercises this year will involve about
60,000 U.S. military personnel along with U.S. and South Korean
jets, a U.S. aircraft carrier and escorting warships.
   About 40,000 U.S. troops from bases in the Pacific and the
United States are to be brought in to join American troops based in
South Korea.
   North Korea has strongly opposed the exercises.

   Mozambican rebels sank six military
patrol boats on Lake Nyassa in northwestern Mozambique after
killing dozens of soldiers elsewhere in the country, the rebels
said Saturday.
   The Mozambican National Resistance said in a statement
distributed in Lisbon that it sank the boats Feb. 20 at the
Metangula base on the eastern shore of Lake Nyassa, which borders
Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania.
   The statement said the attack put a company of 100 Mozambican
marines out of action, but it did not mention casualties. Rebel
spokesmen could not be contacted for comment Saturday.
   Guerrillas also captured three towns in northeastern Niassa
province Feb. 22 and 23, the statement said. It gave no further
details.
   The right-wing rebels, also known as RENAMO, have been fighting
since 1977 to topple Mozambique's Marxist government. South Africa
denies Mozambican charges it supports the group.
   The rebels also said they killed several Cuban and Soviet
advisers and captured 43 Mozambican soldiers Feb. 17 in an attack
on the town of Bela Vista, 30 miles south of the capital, Maputo.
   On the day same, the rebels claimed they occupied the town of
Lugela in central Zambezia province, killing 18 Mozambican troops
and 17 Tanzanian soldiers fighting for the government.
   There was no independent confirmation of the claims nor any
indication of rebel casualties.

<TEXT>
   Since mid-1985, top leaders of
the United Democratic Front have been facing treason charges in a
trial viewed as a likely prelude to a ban on the nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition.
   Last week, the government decided not to wait for a verdict.
   It banned all the group's activities and imposed severe
restrictions on the few coalition leaders still free. Most of the
18 groups banned from political activity last week were affiliated
with the front.
   The apparent goal of the ban was to stamp out a grass-roots
movement that in less than five years had become the largest _ and
in many ways the most potent _ opposition group in South Africa's
history.
   The United Democratic Front has proved resilient before, and it
may survive this latest blow. Even if it does not, its legacy seems
assured.
   ``The (coalition) was the most effective political force that
has operated in black townships ever,'' said Tom Lodge, a political
scientist at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand.
   The activist spirit fostered by the group ``will continue under
different forms and will always present a challenge to the
government,'' Lodge said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a segregated society in
which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health services.
   Before Aug. 20, 1983, when the United Democratic Front was
launched at rally near Cape Town, South Africa had never
experienced anything like the coalition.
   It represented the first attempt to meld local and regional
anti-apartheid groups into a single network. It pledged itself both
to militance and to non-violence.
   And though it has always been predominantly black, it welcomed
white and Asian members who embraced its ideals.
   The coalition grew to encompass more than 600 organizations with
about 2 million members. The affiliates include church, civic,
educational and youth groups extending into virtually every black
township in the country.
   Its original goal was to oppose formation of the tricameral
Parliament, which has chambers for whites, Asians and people of
mixed-race but excludes the black majority. It backed a boycott of
the 1984 elections for the Asian and mixed-race chambers,
contributing to turnouts of less than 30 percent.
   Since then, coalition affiliates have waged a variety of
campaigns, ranging from prolonged rent boycotts to advocacy of
greater black control over education.
   Some analysts say the group's most impressive achievement has
been psychological _ convincing ordinary people that it was worth
organizing to build unified opposition to apartheid.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent activist who helped found the
coalition, said after learning of Wednesday's crackdown that the
group's day-to-day operations were less important that its
symbolism to blacks.
   ``It's a living sign that our of belief that the days of white
dominance are over,'' he said. ``That's something you cannot ban.''
   Twice, the government has charged groups of prominent United
Democratic Front officials with treason in an effort to prove that
the coalition conspired with the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement to provoke violence and make South Africa
``ungovernable.''
   One group, including co-presidents Archie Gumede and Albertina
Sisulu, went free after the case against them collapsed for lack of
evidence.
   But three other officials, including its national secretary and
its chief spokesman, have been held since 1985 during the country's
longest-running political trial. They and 16 co-defendants who are
free on bail dispute government charges that the organization
instigated the black unrest that broke out in September 1984 and
claimed some 2,500 lives over the next three years.
   Many activists had predicted that a guilty verdict at the
treason trial would be followed by a ban on the coalition.
   The trials have been only one of several tactics used by the
government to weaken the coalition, which in many instances has
been forced to operate clandestinely. Virtually all of its national
executive committee members have been detained or gone into hiding
during the 20-month-old state of emergency, and the few who
remained in the open were issued banning orders last week barring
them from United Democratic Front activity.
   According to monitoring groups, about 75 percent of the
estimated 30,000 people detained for varying periods during the
emergency belonged to the coalition's affiliates.
   The government has accused the group of contributing to a
``revolutionary climate'' in which its followers rejected
established institutions and harassed or killed blacks linked to
the white authorities.
   Gumede, in recent interviews, acknowledged that some coalition
followers had resorted to coercion and said the government's
restrictions on the group's leaders made it difficult to instill
discipline.
   ``We are on the run,'' he told Leadership magazine late last
year. ``Sooner or later, we are going to find ourselves in a real
jam, because people do not have sufficient time to think.''
   Gumede is now banned from giving interviews or speaking
publicly. His co-president, Mrs. Sisulu, is under police orders to
stay in her home between 6 p.m. and 5 p.m.
   As they learned of the restrictions, an unsigned coalition
statement was distributed to the news media.
   Its closing message: ``Nothing, we repeat nothing, will stand in
the way of the United Democratic Front as it carries out its
historical task and duty of uniting the oppressed and silenced
people of our country.''

   Communist rebels ambushed a military
jeep Saturday, killing two soldiers and bringing to 11 the number
of people killed in two days of scattered clashes, the military
said.
   Rebels also stormed a hospital in the northern Luzon province of
Cagayan and carted off medicine, food and other supplies, military
officials said. One civilian was wounded in the raid.
   The government-run Philippine News Agency said an undetermined
number of New People's Army guerillas opened fire on a military
jeep on the central island of Bohol. A constabularly captain was
wounded in addition to the two fatalities.
   In another report, the military said three communist rebels and
six Moslem guerrillas were killed in earlier clashes in Cagayan and
on the southern island of Mindanao.
   Maj. V.G. Jalligao said at least 50 New People's Army guerrillas
stormed the Matilde Olivas Hospital late Wednesday in Cagayan
province. Jalligao said one civilian was wounded in the raid, after
which the rebels fled toward a mountain village with medicine, food
and other supplies.
   In Mindanao's Lanao del Sur province, troops from the army's
35th Infantry Battalion came upon 20 Moslem rebels of the Moro
National Liberation Front during a patrol Friday and killed six of
them in the ensuing gun battle. The remaining rebels fled, the
military said.
   The clash occurred on the day President Corazon Aquino traveled
to Mindanao and the largely Moslem island province of Tawi-Tawi to
unveil economic development programs.
   During a speech in Zamboanga City, Mrs. Aquino warned Moslem
countries against encouraging violence by the Moslem rebel group,
which has been waging a 16-year insurgency for a separate state in
the south.
   Fighting in the Moslem insurgency peaked in the mid-1970s after
the war had claimed more than 50,000 lives.

   A woman who smiled while shooting
point-blank at a police officer who stopped to help her told
investigators she had been planning to shoot a police officer for
some time, authorities said.
   ``She decided this morning it was time to go ahead with it. She
figured she'd just drive around until she found one,'' police
spokesman Dee Anderson said.
   Pamela Diane Takhar, 33, was charged with attempted capital
murder and was being held in lieu of $250,000 bond, officer Lisa
Male said Saturday. Officer Gene Evans, 26, was wearing a
bulletproof vest and suffered no serious injuries in the Friday
morning shooting.
   ``The woman plainly told us she wanted to shoot a police
officer,'' said Anderson. ``She said that if she did kill a police
officer, she would go to jail. Then the whole world would know what
happens when you shoot someone.''
   Police said Evans stopped to investigate an apparently disabled
vehicle and found a woman sitting in the passenger side.
   ``He said she was very confused, and he had a conversation with
her that didn't make very much sense,'' Anderson said. ``She turned
around and smiled and then shot him.''

   Gary Hart today said he planned to stay in the
Democratic presidential race, despite his poor showings so far at
the polls, as he and his rivals for the nomination prepared to
debate one another again.
   Meanwhile, Republican George Bush turned up the heat on Pat
Robertson for making ``ridiculous'' allegations about him.
   Questions had arisen over wehther Hart was planning to call an
end to his campaign, but the former Colorado senator said he
planned to continue looking for votes in the South.
   Hart told a news conference that he would stay in the race
because ``the Democratic Party must have a voice for reform and
change.''
   The Democrats were meeting in a debate in Atlanta as they point
toward the Super Tuesday primaries across the South and elsewhere
that will decide more than one-third of the nominating delegates
and propel at least some of the candidates on to the next round in
big industrial states.
   Sen. Paul Simon, whose campaign is on the ropes and isn't active
in the 20 Southern and other states voting March 8, predicted:
``You're going to have as a result of Super Tuesday a very mixed
result with Jesse Jackson likely getting more delgates than anyone
else.''
   Simon told a news conference in Atlanta that he would continue
to campaign until the March 15 primary in Illinois, his home state,
where he said he expects to be the leading Democratic vote-getter,
followed by Jackson.
   Some of the Democratic candidates planned to participate in a
1{-mile march today through downtown Atlanta to call attention to
the problem of homelessness.
   Republicans in Maine, meanwhile, began a series of weekend
caucuses with supporters of Bush and chief rival Bob Dole engaged
in an alliance to stop Robertson. Maine Democrats hold their
caucuses Sunday, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis expected
to win the New England state.
   There was little mention of the internal bickering between
Dukakis, Richard Gephardt and Albert Gore Jr. as they and their
other rivals spoke Friday evening before a huge Georgia state
Democratic Party dinner. They attacked the Reagan administration as
one of greed and complacency while each repeated his own campaign
themes.
   Dukakis, who has tried to remain above the exchanges of the
other Democrats even as he suggests he may join it, made only a
veiled reference to attacks from Gephardt earlier this week.
   ``I hope we will be a party that has learned the lessons of
division,'' Dukakis said. ``Let's make 1988 a year for the promise
of opportunity, not the politics of resentment.''
   National Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk urged the candidates at
the start of the dinner not to engage in more bickering, cautioning
that the American people ``don't want name-calling.''
   While the Democrats talked, Vice President Bush was ensconsed in
a suite at a posh Atlanta hotel just across the street from the
Democrats' gala, taking a respite from two days of stumping in
South Carolina.
   He again blasted Robertson upon arriving in Atlanta, saying the
former television evangelist should offer proof to support his
various claims _ that Bush forces timed the embarrassing
sex-scandal disclosures of another TV evangelist, Jimmy Swaggart,
and that the Bush camp was engaged in ``sleazy'' politics and
``dirty tricks'' against him.
   ``The charge is ridiculous,'' Bush said. ``It's not the American
way to make unsubstantiated charges. It sounds like ... some kind
of elementary level politics.''
   Campaigning earlier in South Carolina, the state Robertson has
picked for his showdown with Bush, the vice president recounted
Robertson's charges and demanded of each, ``prove it.'' He also
said Robertson was ``scaring the American people'' by suggesting
nuclear missiles are in Cuba.
   Dole, meantime, was campaigning in Texas where he picked up the
endorsement of former Gov. John Connally, saying it would help him
in the largest Super Tuesday state.
   Robertson also campaigned in Texas, saying at a private church
academy that he wanted ``to see America ... go back to our faith in
God.''
   The Republican candidates were meeting in a debate in Atlanta
Sunday afternoon, also pointing toward the GOP Super Tuesday
primaries.
   In other campaign activity:
   _ Dukakis gently criticized Gephardt while campaigning in Texas
earlier Friday, saying President Reagan's 1981 tax cut that
Gephardt voted for was ``one of the biggest mistakes in recent
American history.'' He didn't name his rival.
   _ Gephardt kept up his theme that America is in an economic
decline and lashed out at Eastern Airlines in Miami as an example
of a company more interested in ``quick paper profits'' than its
employees. Eastern has sustained mammoth financial losses.
   _ Jackson accused the U.S. government and CIA of being ``an
accomplice'' to Panama military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
He said U.S. backing for Noriega, who has been indicted on U.S.
drug charges, is an example of the failure of U.S. foreign policy
to take the drug threat seriously.
   _ Bush said Noriega ``should go and in my view he will go.'' He
said he did not rule out use of military force to protect U.S.
interests in Panama.
   _ Republican Jack Kemp, who must do well on Super Tuesday to
keep his White House hopes alive, campaigned in South Carolina and
said Noriega ``should be ousted.''
   _ With all political eyes on Super Tuesday, Reagan got in the
act by meeting with Republican state chairmen from the South, who
told him they hope to attract conservative Democrats to their ranks
in the Southern presidential primaries.

   A man who was six months old when his

the Pinellas County Jail.
   ``There were little tears in his eyes,'' Sheriff Gerry Coleman
said of inmate James Stewart Gaston. ``He was very affectionate

   Gaston has been jailed for brief stays more than 1,400 times
because of alcohol-related misdemeanors. His son, James Stewart
Gallagher of Boston, learned his father was in the area from a
friend in Tampa who read about Gaston in the newspaper.
   Gaston, 65, was jailed Tuesday for 10 days for violating an open
alcohol container law.
   ``I've known him 30 years,'' the sheriff said. ``He probably was
my first arrest. When he's sober, he's the nicest man you've ever

   Gallagher, father of two young children, arrived Thursday and
Coleman arranged a 24-hour furlough for Gaston.

   The 18-story hotel offers rooms from $195 a night for a single

   Real estate dealers Philip Pilevsky and Arthur G. Cohen said
they were close to a $400 million to $500 million agreement to buy
the hotel, The New York Times reported.
   It said the two have formed a joint venture with the Mandarin

Worth, Texas.
   Pilevsky said the style and spirit of the hotel would remain,

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Injects New Element Into Usual Election-Year Pastime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fed-bashing has long been a favorite
election-year pastime for parties occupying the White House. But
this year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan injected a new
element: He bashed back.
   Greenspan has signaled to the Reagan administration in no
uncertain terms that it should quit leaning on the central bank to
ease interest rates.
   The Fed chief, in remarks that surprised some Fed watchers for
their directness, even went a step further, suggesting that such
White House pressure could backfire _ and result in a tighter
credit policy.
   Incumbents have always found the Fed an easy target in election
years.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, for instance, chafed at the
severely tight monetary policies pursued by his newly appointed Fed
chairman, Paul Volcker, policies that some loyalists claim helped
cost Carter the election in 1980.
   The party in power wants easier credit, lower interest rates, a
juiced-up economy that can translate into votes _ and the avoidance
at all costs of an election-year recession.
   But such desires often run at cross purposes to the role of the
Fed, which is to regulate the supply and availability of money in a
way that keeps the economy growing at a steady non-inflationary
pace.
   Lower interest rates can help delay a recession. But, if applied
at the wrong time, they can also trigger a major burst of inflation.
   Greenspan, whose service to Republican presidents dates back two
decades, may have felt more need than past Fed chiefs to publicly
demonstrate his independence from the White House just because of
these past associations, some analysts suggest.
   In addition, all members of the Fed are now Reagan appointees,
another factor that might have influenced Greenspan's decision to
fight back to assert the Fed's lack of subservience.
   Greenspan retaliated in back-to-back testimony before the House
and Senate Banking committees.
   The former chairman of President Gerald Ford's Council of
Economic Advisors told the House panel he totally disagreed with
the current council chairman, Beryl Sprinkel, who has suggested
that the Fed had been too tightfisted in supplying money to the
economy in 1987.
   Had the Fed followed the easier-money course favored by
Sprinkel, Greenspan fumed, it would have led to an ``unduly
inflationary environment.''
   Then, stepping up his attack in an appearance before the Senate
Banking Committee, Greenspan criticized a top Treasury official's
effort to influence Fed policy.
   ``I objected quite strongly,'' Greenspan said of the letter by
Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Darby urging the Fed to ease
monetary policy (that is, lower interest rates) shortly before a
recent Fed policy meeting.
   ``He was not aware of the implications of what he was doing,''
Greenspan said. He suggested Darby's effort could have been
counterproductive, triggering a Fed tightening of credit to
demonstrate the central bank wasn't bowing to political pressure.
   The White House moved quickly to downplay the rift. Sprinkel,
whose criticism of Fed policy through much of 1987 was well-known
in Washington, said he was pleased with the more accommodative
monetary policy the Fed has pursued so far in 1988.
   And President Reagan, in his televised news conference Wednesday
night, insisted he had no knowledge of the Darby letter and voiced
confidence in Greenspan _ his choice last summer to succeed Volcker.
   Republicans are nervous about the prospects of a recession and
want to make sure the Fed does what it can to keep the economy
rolling between now and Election Day.
   And one way to buoy up a sagging economy is with injections of
easy money and lower interest rates.
   Fed chairmen often don't do what presidents want them to do. And
these chief executives and their lieutenants have found different
ways to vent their frustrations.
   For instance, Democratic critics of Volcker contend that, even
though his tight-money policies in 1980 helped break the back of
double-digit inflation, he could have held off on his brand of
tough medicine at least until after the 1980 election.
   While Reagan has not personally criticized the Fed, Volcker was
frequently the target of not-too-subtle ``Fed bashing'' at the
hands of former White House staff chief Donald Regan.
   Former President Lyndon Johnson, unhappy with what he perceived
as the Fed's too-tight monetary policy, summoned then-Fed chief
William McChesney Martin Jr. to his Texas ranch for a well-reported
lecture as he paraded the reluctant Fed chairman around his grounds.
   Some Fed chairmen have seemed more eager to enter into alliances
with presidents _ for instance, the widely reported willingness of
the late Fed Chairman Arthur Burns to pump up the nation's money
supply at the behest of President Nixon to keep interest rates low
for the 1972 election.
   But few Fed chairmen have been as vocal in lashing back at their
administration critics as Greenspan was last week. Not that his
words were that harsh. The point is that he spoke on the subject at
all.
   ``He needed to respond strongly to dispel any notions that he
was a captive of the administration. He has been very tight with
Republican administrations in the past,'' said New York economist
Allen Sinai.
   Michael K. Evans, a Washington economist and longtime Fed
watcher, contended ``Greenspan was annoyed by stories circulating
about him claiming he's the tool of the Republican party. He
decided that was just too much to take, especially with Beryl
Sprinkel beating up on him.''

   Socialist Party leader Fred Sinowatz said
Saturday he will quit if it helps force out President Kurt
Waldheim, under pressure to resign over his conduct as an officer
in the Nazi army.
   In a radio interview, Sinowatz hinted that Socialists and the
conservative Austrian People's Party, which form a coalition
government, are weighing a deal. It would revolve around the
resignation of Sinowatz, who is supported by the left, and
Waldheim, backed by the right.
   But Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister Alois Mock, who also
chairs the conservative People's Party, immediately rejected such a
solution to Austria's most pressing problem.
   Sinowatz has had his share of controversy. His opponents contend
that he is to blame for leaking information to Austrian and U.S.
media about Waldheim's wartime past in 1986 during Waldheim's
campaign for the presidency.
   He has also been linked to illegal arms sales to Iran and
recently lost a court case involving a journalist who wrote that
Sinowatz had leaked information about Waldheim.
   The 1986 campaign ended with Waldheim winning the presidency, a
largely ceremonial post, and with the establishment of a coalition
government joining the Socialists, who opposed Waldheim, and the
conservatives, who backed him.
   Leaks about Waldheim's wartime past sparked a controversy about
the president's stint as a lieutenant in the German army during
World War II. Soon thereafter the United States placed Waldheim on
a ``watch list'' of undesirable aliens, barring him from the
country.
   The U.S. action prompted the Austrian government to appoint a
panel of historians to probe Waldheim's World War II experience.
The panel concluded that while there was no proof that Waldheim
committed war crimes, he was in ``close proximity'' to such crimes
and did nothing to stop them.
   Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing.
   In the Austrian state radio interview, Sinowatz said he would
step down as Socialist chairman ``if this were in the interest of
the state,'' but he made clear the proposal was linked to resolving
the domestic crisis over Waldheim.
   Sinowatz denied that his offer was related to mounting
criticicsm over his alleged approval of an illegal weapons shipment
to Iran in his capacity as chancellor in 1985.
   He also rejected any link to the acquittal by a Vienna court
last year of a journalist who wrote that Sinowatz, before the 1986
presidential election campaign, had told party friends he would
reveal Waldheim's wartime past.
   Sinowatz, who has appealed the court ruling, continues to
maintain he never made the statement or leaked such information.
   In the radio interview, Sinowatz said there had been talk about
``possible solutions'' in which ``a resignation of myself as party
chairman'' would be included.
   Sinowatz said the Socialists had made such a proposal to the
conservatives and were waiting for their reaction.
   Mock countered in another radio interview that his party cannot
decide on behalf of the president.
   ``The federal president was elected in a national election by 54
percent of Austrians,'' he said. ``No party can depose him.''
   But after Sinowatz's initiative, Mock is likely to come under
increasing pressure from conservative leaders, some of whom are
known to oppose Waldheim's staying on as president.
   Waldheim said last week he had canceled a scheduled speech
during a solemn meeting on March 11 to commemorate the annexation
of Austria by Nazi Germany 50 years ago. He will give a televised
broadcast instead on March 10.
   Two Socialist ministers had said they would boycott the session
if Waldheim addressed it.

   New President Roh Tae-woo freed 125
dissidents on Saturday and lifted political restrictions on
hundreds of others, but opposition leaders called the amnesty a
political trick disguised as reform.
   Also Saturday, Roh's governing Democratic Justice Party proposed
that crucial elections to the National Assembly be held in
mid-April. The announcement came as the two major opposition
parties prepared to merge.
   Roh's government said it released the dissidents from prisons
nationwide and restored the civic rights and reduced the prison
terms of 1,606 other political detainees. Loss of civic rights bars
an individual from participating in politics.
   The government said the amnesty was granted as part of its
promise to introduce full democracy. Roh approved the move after
meeting with his Cabinet for the first time since his inauguration
on Thursday.
   The political detainees were included in a larger amnesty
program for 7,234 people, most of them common criminals.
   The National Coalition for Democracy, a major dissident group,
ripped the amnesty as fraud and said it would fight to secure the
release of about 1,200 political detainees it says still are in
jail.
   ``We denounce the Roh government for fooling the people by
playing a game of numbers,'' the coalition said in a statement.
   The government said the amnesty program only left 276 political
prisoners, of whom 216 were awaiting trial and and 60 were guilty
of violent crimes.
   About 100 dissident leaders and relatives of dissidents still in
prison staged a demonstration Saturday in front of the National
Council of Churches building in Seoul. ``Release all prisoners,''
they shouted, but passersby showed little interest.
   Scuffles broke out as riot police barred the way when the
protesters tried to march. The outnumbered protesters punched and
kicked police but were prevented from marching.
   Dissident leader Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, who had his civic rights
restored under the amnesty, told protesters the program still was a
fraud.
   ``As long as there is a single dissident in jail, democracy
cannot be achieved,'' he said.
   Among those excluded from the amnesty were prominent dissidents
Chang Ki-pyo and Kim Kun-tae, both serving seven-year terms for
allegedly inciting riots. Amnesty International and other human
rights groups have demanded Kim's release.
   Another leading dissident, Lee Tae-bok, had his sentence reduced
from 20 years to 15 years.
   Roh, who took office with a promise to introduce sweeping
democratic reforms, said the amnesty was intended to build public
confidence and underline the government's determination to end
decades of authoritarian rule.
   Information Minister Chung Han-mo urged those included in the
amnesty to work with the new government to build democracy.
   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung denounced Roh's government at
a rally Saturday in Seoul attended by about 4,000 cheering people.
He urged people to vote for the opposition in upcoming legislative
elections.
   But he also said he was willing to give Roh a chance to meet his
promise to usher in full democracy. ``I can cooperate with Roh as
the incumbent ruler in power if he carries out sweeping reforms,
including complete freedom, release of all political prisoners and
full guarantee of other civil rights,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, officials from the Democratic Justice Party said they
would accept an opposition election formula to speed an agreement
on holding the legislative elections.
   After months of bitter wrangling, the main opposition
Reunification Democratic Party and the breakaway Party for Peace
and Democracy agreed on Friday to merge. The rift between the two
parties was credited with splitting the opposition vote during the
December election and vaulting Roh into power.

   An Aeroflot passenger plane crashed on landing
today at an airport in western Siberia, resulting in deaths and
injuries, the official Tass news agency said.
   Tass said the Tupolvev-134 airliner ``met with an accident while
landing'' at the city of Surgut, 1,400 miles east of Moscow. The
report did not say how many people were aboard, or how many had
been killed.
   ``Measures were being taken to rescue people. Necessary aid is
being given to the crash victims. There is loss of life,'' Tass
said in a three-paragraph report.
   ``The causes of the disaster are being investigated by a special
commission,'' it said.
   Domestic Aeroflot flights usually are filled to capacity.
Depending on the seating configuration, the Tu-134, which has twin
turbofan engines, can carry from 80 to 96 passengers, according to
Jane's All the World's Aircraft.
   Tass said the flight had originated in Minsk, with stops in
Kuibyshev and Tyumen, before a final scheduled landing in Surgut.

people and their governor at the crossroads of impeachment.

   For Evan Mecham, Arizona's
governor-in-exile, it has come to high noon.
   Here in the land of Geronimo and Wyatt Earp and the OK Corral, a
part of America never known for pussyfooting, the Arizona Senate on
Monday begins the final act in a course of redress not seen in this
nation in more than half a century. It will decide whether to
remove the impeached governor from office.
   Members of the Senate will not predict the outcome, only that it
likely will be close and that however it turns out there will be,
politically speaking, a lot of blood left on the ground.
   ``It's ripping up our party and state in a fashion that's going
to take years to recover,'' says U.S. Sen. John McCain.
   When McCain and three other Republican members of Arizona's
congressional delegation suggested that fellow Republican Mecham
resign, the senator began receiving hate mail by the sackful.
   ``The mob that crucified our Precious Lord is the same kind of
mob that is after our governor,'' wrote one constituent.
   The other day about 2,000 Mecham supporters took out their
anger, while raising money for his defense, by bashing an
automobile with a sledgehammer, three licks for a dollar. The car
was painted with slogans such as ``media bias,'' identifying what
they perceived as the causes of the governor's predicament.
   The Arizona House approved impeachment articles Feb. 5 accusing
Mecham of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, misusing $80,000
from funds raised by his inauguration committee, and trying to
thwart an investigation into a state official's alleged death
threat against a witness in a grand jury probe of Mecham.
   The 63-year-old, staunchly conservative governor also had
antagonized many Arizonans with controversial statements on ethnic
groups and social issues.
   After the vote, Mecham stepped down provisionally as governor
and moved into political exile, in an office in nearby Glendale.
Now the House charges are to be tried in the 30-member Senate,
where 20 votes would convict him and remove him permanently from
office.
   But not even the extreme measure of an impeachment trial is
likely to put to rest the turmoil in Arizona. If Mecham survives,
he still faces a criminal trial for not reporting the campaign loan
and a recall election resulting from a public petition.
   Recall election? All right then, said Mecham supporters, and
began circulating petitions to recall as well House members who
voted for the governor's impeachment.
   Yes, there is little stability these days in Arizona politics.
   Anywhere in Arizona, for that matter.
   The Phoenix area, Maricopa County, is the second-fastest-growing
urban area in America, just behind San Diego. It gains one new
citizen every 12 minutes. That's net gain. State figures also show
that for every four newcomers, three others move out.
   All that coming and going causes such instability that one
mental health organization recommended a state program to
discourage growth. Arizona, for instance, has one of the nation's
highest divorce rates, a suicide rate 50 percent higher than the
national average and, among adolescents, 70 percent higher. It also
ranks last in per-capita funding for mental health.
   ``We have an enormous amount of work to do in this state,'' says
state Sen. Greg Lunn, a Tucson Republican.
   ``That's another reason why the impeachment is such a
distracting turn of events. The Senate will be tied up with it for
weeks. Important matters that should be dealt with this session
will have to be deferred to the next.''
   Lunn has a special interest in environmental matters. Well he
might. The Phoenix area is promoted to tourists and potential
settlers as the Valley of the Sun. But dust and emissions and
temperature inversions conspire against the sun. Phoenix's smog
rivals the worst in the nation. So do its traffic jams.

   Maine Republicans, attracted by an
energetic Pat Robertson challenge to part-time resident George
Bush, continued to turn out in heavy numbers today during the
party's first consolidated caucus weekend.
   In Augusta, more than 300 people gathered this morning for
Kennebec County caucuses. ``The level of interest is strong,'' said
Robertson campaign organizer Mark Finks. ``The enthusiasm
originates from my candidate. We're turning out in massive
numbers.''
   On Friday, Robertson won a tie in Portland and a clear-cut
victory in Caribou, but Bush's campaign appeared to add to its
commanding lead in state convention delegates.
   Statewide, the Bush campaign claimed Friday to have won 166 of
the first 234 slots awarded. Bush's count gave Robertson 28, Bob
Dole 20, and Jack Kemp 5, with 15 uncommitted.
   The delegates totaled by the Bush campaign included 137
previously elected in caucuses in 43 towns since late January. The
Republicans will select the rest of the 1,506 state delegates
during caucuses today and Sunday.
   Those delegates will gather at the state convention in Bangor in
April to select 22 delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   The results of the Republican caucuses do not bind state
convention delegates and party leaders are not compiling the local
tallies immediately.
   In Portland on Friday night, supporters of Bush and Robertson
battled raucously over voting rules until Robertson backers, aided
by a small faction for Dole, voted to force the caucus to scrap its
winner-take-all standard for awarding delegate slots.
   In the presidential preference poll that followed, Robertson
drew 130 votes, Bush 127, and Dole 30. Bush and Robertson each were
awarded 15 delegates to the April convention in Bangor while Dole
got 3.
   In Caribou, Robertson defeated the combined forces of Bush and
Dole, 75-72, and collected all eight delegates, according to
unofficial reports.
   Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., who attended the Portland caucus to
bolster the Bush drive and conducted some of the private brokering
with the Dole campaign himself, said ``the wild card'' there and
around the state was ``how many new people who we've never seen
before the Robertson campaign is able to get out.''
   Later, he told caucus participants that they should be prepared
to unite behind the party's nominee after this summer's national
convention.
   In an overture to Robertson partisans, McKernan offered
greetings on behalf of GOP regulars, saying ``how pleased we are to
have you a part of the process.''
   Earlier, as Bush organizers sounded out the Dole camp in hopes
of blocking the proportional representation motion, Robertson
backers erupted with derisive chants of ``backroom deal'' and
``railroad.''
   State party chairwoman Karen Stram, watching the Portland
voting, acknowledged that feelings were running high in the various
camps. Stram said her job was ``to be sure that everyone comes out
of it feeling they got a fair shake.''
   She said statewide turnout in the caucuses could reach 15,000 or
more by the end of the weekend.
   ``No question, we're up three times at least'' over previous
years, she said.

   A union representing 6,700 flight attendants
at Northwest Airlines called a strike today after all-night
negotiations collapsed, a union official said.
   William Genoese, international director of the Teamsters union's
airline division, said workers were being told to walk out, but
refused to specify how broad the walkout would be.
   ``It might be one city, it might be two cities, it might be
three cities,'' said Genoese when asked whether the strike was
general or selective. Genoese, who had earlier said selective
strikes were possible to disrupt the airline's services, refused to
elaborate.
   A spokesman for Northwest said today the airline was preparing
to carry out its strike-management program, but added that there
was as yet no concrete sign that a strike had started.
   ``We did everything we possibly could to avoid a strike,''
Genoese said. ``Apparently the company feels it wants to take a
strike on. If we want to close down the airline, we can close it
down. They've got their hands full.''
   Teamsters spokeswoman Barbara Graham, at union temporary offices
at hotel near Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said shortly after
Genoese's announcement that she had received no notice of a strike,
but that the union was standing by.
   ``We're proceeding to implement our contingency plan,'' vice
president of law and labor relations Terry Erskine said at
Northwest headquarters. About 2,000 managers trained as flight
attendants have been posted throughout the Northwest system with
200 newly-hired replacement flight attendants also ready to move,
he said.
   Erskine said the airline was prepared to handle the strike.
``We've been through this fire drill before,'' he said.
   Representatives for Northwest Airlines and the union had
continued negotiations after a midnight EST deadline. In earlier
statements, Genoese said selective strikes would be used to keep
the airline off balance.
   ``When you have them off balance, they can't put out the fire
there and the fire over here,'' Genoese said early this morning.
``That works to our advantage in the situation.''
   Genoese said selective strikes would begin taking place at
various locations throughout the Northwest system to _ in his words
_ ``disrupt their service.''
   ``We have a right to do it,'' Genoese said.
   Some 6,700 Northwest flight attendants are represented by
Teamsters Local 2747.
   Jim Halverson, a spokesman for the Northwest unit of the Air
Line Pilots Association, said about 20 union officials meeting in
Bloomington Friday night would debate whether to honor picket lines.
   ``We feel we can pull a strike off without (the pilots')
support,'' Local 2747 spokesman Jeff Musto said. ``If we get it it
will be like an ace in the hand.''
   The machinists union representing Northwest mechanics gave its
support to an attendants' strike, but union representatives did not
say whether machinists would honor attendants' picket lines.
   Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said the machinists are under
a contract that forbids them to strike in sympathy with another
union.
   Wage scales, pensions and work rules are among the major issues
in the dispute. Former Republic Airlines flight attendants have
been working under their old contract since Northwest acquired
Republic in 1986, and many former Republic employees are paid less
than their Northwest counterparts.
   The company, the nation's fifth-largest airline, is trying to
bring the workers under one contract and offered to bring former
Republic employees up to the salary levels of Northwest employees.
But the union claimed the airline is compensating by reducing
vacation pay and retirement benefits.

   Once outside Phoenix, however, or Tucson, the state's only two
urban areas, you can drive for hours without seeing another car.
Geographically as well as politically and socially, Arizona is a
state of stunning contrasts and contradictions.
   The state is sixth in the nation in size but its 3.35 million
population ranks 25th. Three-fourths of its people live in the
Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. The rest live in villages
and towns scattered across mountains and deserts and forests
staggering in their solitude, and, in many areas, their poverty.
   In rural areas much of the frontier west prevails, and not just
in the rigorously independent attitude of the people. At Cordes
Junction, near Prescott, the cafe requires patrons to check their
weapons at the door. Many do just that, since in Arizona it's
perfectly legal to pack a gun openly.
   Rivalry in Arizona is fierce between city and country for the
state's attention to their needs. Mecham was supported by rural
voters who saw his two election opponents as representing the
Phoenix elite. His impeachment intensifies those jealousies.
   Feelings for and against Evan Mecham are held with such passion
that some longtime friends are reluctant to bring up the subject,
not knowing how the other stands.
   ``Some things are better left unspoken,'' said a Phoenix
businessman.
   Although Mecham's impeachment is Topic A in the hotel lobbies
and cocktail lounges of Phoenix and Tucson, many Arizonans treat
politics, including this turn of events, with a yawn.
   Only about 60 percent of eligible Arizonans have registered to
vote. Of those, little more than half turned out for the three-way
election that put Mecham in office; of those only 40 percent voted
for Mecham.
   Nonetheless, since becoming a state in 1912 _ the youngest of
the contiguous 48 _ Arizona has produced its share of national
political figures. Two Arizonans sit on the U.S. Supreme Court,
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
   Carl Hayden went to Congress from Arizona in 1912 and served
until he retired in 1964. He won his last Senate term in 1962 by
defeating Evan Mecham. Arizona's Sen. Barry Goldwater ran for
president in 1964.
   Conservative patriarch Goldwater supported Mecham for governor
but was one of the first to ask that he resign, even though it
meant a Democrat, Secretary of State Rose Mofford, would become
acting governor.
   ``Enough's enough,'' said Goldwater.
   Another Arizonan, John Rhodes, former minority leader in the
U.S. House, announced he would give up his retirement and, at 71,
run against Mecham in the recall election scheduled for May.
   ``I just don't want to see the state go down the drain,'' Rhodes
said.
   In the corridors of the state capitol the perception is that
among those who want him removed from office Mecham's alleged
criminal wrongdoing is less important than his style and values as
governor.
   ``He has polarized the state,'' said state Sen. Lunn.
   ``Instead of practicing the art of the possible, the art of
compromise, of bringing people together, he has brought a narrow,
ideological and personal agenda and is trying to shove it down
people's throats.''
   On his second day in office Mecham began alienating large
numbers of Arizonans by canceling a holiday honoring the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., claiming it was established illegally by
his predecessor. Later he made statements seen by some as slurs on
blacks and Orientals. He dismissed those petitioning for his recall
as ``dissident Democrats and homosexuals.''
   Now it comes down to the impeachment trial itself.
   Only 15 U.S. governors have faced impeachment proceedings. Only
seven were removed from office, the last Oklahoma's Henry Simpson
Johnston in 1928.
   Thomas Jefferson was once impeached, in 1781 as governor of
Virginia. His accuser was Patrick Henry, who thought Jefferson left
the capital with unseemly haste when British troops attacked.
Jefferson insisted on a trial and won vindication.
   So Evan Mecham, it appears, is in pretty good company. But,
then, so are his accusers.

<HEAD>Super Tuesday Fields Crowded and Still Unclear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   North Florida farmer Fred Williams has an analysis of the Super
Tuesday primaries across the South and elsewhere: ``There are too
many hogs in the creek and the water is muddy.''
   Little more than a week from the regionwide presidential
primaries in both parties, his farm analogy remains apt. The
picture in both parties hasn't entirely cleared, and the races
remain crowded.
   Super Tuesday, the closest the nation has ever come to a
national primary, could crystallize the nomination races,
particularly on the Republican side. But there's as much likelihood
it won't.
   Pat Robertson is a wild card that threatens to confuse the
Republican race. He has the opportunity to do well, maybe even win,
in some small-turnout primaries in areas where he built devoted
followings through years as a television evangelist.
   And if no Democrat strongly emerges, that race may not come
close to being decided on March 8 and the field will move on to the
next round of Northern industrial states, still crowded with three
or four candidates.
   ``Super Tuesday is not fulfilling the wishes of its founders,''
said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.
   Twenty states hold Democratic primaries or caucuses on Tuesday,
March 8, and they stretch from Massachusetts to Florida to Idaho;
there are 17 GOP contests. The day is mainly Southern, with 14
contests in Southern or border states. Democrats also hold a caucus
in American Samoa.
   At stake are 1,307 Democratic and 712 Republican delegates _
about one-third the total in both parties.
   Southern legislators set the whole thing up with the aim of
providing a conservative or moderating influence on the Democratic
nomination process, countering and perhaps stealing the thunder of
earlier contests. The GOP went along, often because Democrats
control the legislatures in those Southern states.
   The primary may yet move the Democratic nominee to the right.
But it didn't diminish the early contests. Wins in Iowa and New
Hampshire have helped propel Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis
in polls of the South.
   And so far no single Democrat has emerged with broad appeal
across the South _ the region Democrats agree they must carry to
regain the White House.
   Among the Republicans, the South looks like George Bush
territory. President Reagan has always been popular there and the
vice president has successfully _ so far at least _ managed to
appear the heir. Polls show him leading Dole two-to-one or better
in the region.
   He has the added benefit of a Southern organization regarded as
unsurpassed. But all those strengths looked as thin as the paper
they were written on when Bush appeared on the verge of losing New
Hampshire to Sen. Bob Dole.
   Bush won, of course, but Dole, Robertson and New York Rep. Jack
Kemp hope to attack Bush's base and prove it broad but thin.
   Kemp needs to do well somewhere in the South to be able to
sustain his campaign and the argument that he is the conservative
alternative.
   Robertson, who became known across the South and elsewhere as
host of the ``700 Club'' program on his own religious cable
network, has drawn a line in the dirt of South Carolina. He needs
to win somewhere, and he says that's where it will be.
   South Carolina isn't a Super Tuesday state; its GOP caucuses are
three days earlier. But it is being watched.
   Bush has organizational and institutional strength there. But
Robertson contends the state is fertile ground for him too. Its GOP
primary usually has a low voter turnout, and crossover Democratic
voting is allowed _ a made-to-order formula for Robertson's
strength based in fundamentalist churches.
   Dole is contesting the state, too, but could finish third. Dole
must pick his shots and concentrate in areas where he can profit
under the GOP's winner-take-all rules in many congressional
districts and states.
   Should Robertson produce victories in the South, the GOP race
could prove a prolonged and bitter fight with Bush, Dole and
Robertson. But Robertson must still demonstrate he has appeal
beyond his evangelical base and can be more than a disruptive force
for the GOP.
   Jesse Jackson leads in the polls in many Southern states and is
certain to do well in states with heavy black voting populations.
He wants to do well in the South but will go on to the convention
in Atlanta this summer regardless.
   ``He's going to have enough votes to play somebody's fiddle,''
said Williams, the Grand Ridge, Fla., farmer who backs Jackson.
``They'll trade for votes just like we trade pigs and cows.''
   Dukakis has run well in some Southern polls and has a good
organization in many states. As governor of Massachusetts, he
carries the image of a liberal state that triggers opposition in
many Southern quarters.
   ``There is just an innate fear of somebody from Massachusetts,''
said Louisiana Democratic chairman James Brady. ``They're
associated with Tip O'Neill and Teddy Kennedy.''
   But Dukakis hopes to win Florida, where he has strong support in
the southern end of the state, and perhaps Texas too. With
Massachusetts voting that day as well he could be the big delegate
winner.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee has tried to position himself
to the right of the Democratic field, depicting the rest as liberal
``peas in a pod.'' He must do well across the region, and polls
have shown him running as high as second and as low as fourth in
the region.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, winner in Iowa and South Dakota, is also
attracting conservative and moderate Democratic voters in some
states with his well-honed appeal to concerns about foreign
competition and a message that America is in economic decline.
   He has shown strength among blue-collar voters, and so far has
concentrated his effort in the economically hard-hit
energy-producing states of the South, where his call for an
oil-import fee is a further boost. A Texas poll had him leading
that huge delegate state but falling back after Dukakis won New
Hampshire.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois has no visible Southern strength.
Gary Hart appears to be fading.
   With so broad a field and so many contests, how will we know who
wins Super Tuesday?
   Florida and Texas are the big prizes, and if a candidate carries
both of those, it will be hard for anyone else to argue they won
Super Tuesday, although some no doubt will.
   As the nomination race moves on, delegates are what matters.
Massachusetts has the next biggest Democratic total, and Dukakis
figures to get most of them. Jackson, too, will get a big share of
Southern delegates.
   Still another measure will be the cross-over voting. It is
allowed in eight of Southern and border Super Tuesday states _
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas
and Virginia.
   A big Republican primary vote in those states, at the cost of
Democratic votes, could be a harbinger for the fall.

   Deposed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle was under virtual house arrest today after calling for a
nationwide strike against the nation's military strongman, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Reporters counted at least nine armed policemen manning
barricades blocking the short street in Panama City where
Delvalle's home is located.
   Other policemen were in the front yard of Delvalle's small
house. The policemen refused access to all people into the street
or the house. Residents in the area said police sealed off the
street late Friday.
   U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, who was in Panama, said he and U.S.
Ambassador Arthur H. Davis were prevented from visiting Delvalle on
Friday night.
   ``The Noriega troops that were guarding the residence were just
adamant _ they said they were ordered not to let anyone in or
out,'' Burton, R-Ind., told the Indianapolis Star newspaper.
   The two were stopped by a half a dozen guards at one of end of
the street, Burton said. He and Davis then tried to go around to
the other end of the street but were again stopped by armed guards.
   The congressman was in Panama for two days of meetings he'd
scheduled earlier to see if the countries could piece together an
effective drug interdiction effort.
   Burton said he did not believe Delvalle was in any danger, ``but
I sense uneasiness throughout the area.''
   Noriega, under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, has acccused the United States of engineering
Delvalle's failed attempt Thursday night to fire him as military
chief.
   The National Assembly voted to oust Delvalle hours after he
announced his plan to get rid of Noriega.
   ``I don't have a seat of government, nor military support, but I
do have two million Panamanians who are tired and bored of living
under a regime that one man has governed capriciously, and because
of that I call for national resistance to paralyze the entire
country starting Monday,'' Delvalle told reporters Friday night.
   Delvalle also urged a worldwide trade embargo against Panama.
   The opposition National Civic Crusade called an immediate
general strike. The coalition of 200 groups has been calling for
Noriega's ouster since last June.
   In Washington, President Reagan said the United States was not
behind Delvalle's attempt to get rid of Noriega, but was ``very
much aware of it.'' He said there were no plans for U.S. military
intervention in Panama.
   In a 10-minute emergency session early Friday, a pro-Noriega
quorum in the 67-seat National Assembly fired Delvalle as
president. Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma was then sworn in
as new chief executive.
   Noriega has run the country since 1983, controlling the
15,000-member police and Defense Forces.
   Panama City was quieter than usual Friday, with fewer vehicles
and people on the streets, but businesses were operating normally.
   Soldiers surrounded and closed the Chamber of Commerce building,
headquarters for the National Civic Crusade and the government shut
down opposition news media.
   Police closed the offices of the Christian Democratic Party,
whose president, Ricardo Arias Calderon, has been a leader of the
Crusade movement. Arias Calderon was detained when he arrived on a
commercial flight from Miami Thursday night and put on a flight to
Costa Rica.
   Also, Panamanian authorties refused entry to three U.S.
journalists when they arrived Friday in a charter plane from Costa
Rica.
   Asked in an interview with the government's Radio Nacional if
the United States was involved in Delvalle's attempt to remove him,
Noriega said: ``Totally, they have maintained a web.''
   ``They have been using a web that includes psychological warfare
... slander, lies, insults, conspiracy, and ... misinformation.''
   American military personnel in Panama were on alert and
civilians were told to keep a low profile. The 10,000-troop U.S.
Southern Command, which runs U.S. military operations in Latin
America, is based in the canal zone.
   The United States has called for Noriega's removal since he was
indicted in Florida on Feb. 5 on drug trafficking charges. The
indictment says Noriega allegedly let Colombian narcotics
traffickers use Panama as a base for smuggling cocaine and
marijuana into the United States, receiving kickbacks from drug
profits.
   Noriega has blamed protests that began last summer and the
indictment on efforts by U.S. rightists to prevent transfer of the
Panama Canal to this country by the end of 1999.

   A Navy Trident 1 missile was
launched successfully from a submerged submarine off Cape Canaveral
today, ending a streak of three Trident failures, officials said.
   ``It was excellent, there were no flaws whatsoever,'' said Air
Force spokesman Herb Illingworth. None of the Russian trawlers
frequently present for such launches were present, he added.
   The missile was fired down the Air Force Eastern Space and
Missile Test Range at 10:27 a.m. EST from the USS Stonewall Jackson
and landed in the Atlantic Ocean. The distance of the shot was not
released.
   It was the 55th Trident 1 launch since 1977 and the 30th from a
submerged submarine, Illingworth said.
   In the last six months, the Navy has had three consecutive
missile failures.
   A Trident 1 launched from a submarine in August 1987 failed. A
more powerful Trident 2 malfunctioned and was destroyed by remote
control after a Jan. 21 land launch. A second Trident 1 missile
blew up 18 seconds after lifting off from a submerged submarine on
Feb. 6, officials said.

   Gary Hart today dispelled rumors that he would
end his presidential campaign, saying he was remaining in the
Democratic race, although acknowledging he has little chance of
winning.
   ``I came back into this race and intend to stay in this race
because the Democratic Party must have a voice for reform and
change,'' Hart said at a news conference this morning.
   Hart, who dropped out of the race and re-entered it last year
saying he wanted to ``let the people decide,'' told reporters today
that ``I've heard from the voters. I want to hear from a few more,
but I understand the message.''
   Hart said his chances of winning the Democratic presidential
nomination were ``remote, to say the least.''
   Under these political circumstances, Hart said he normally would
have decided to quit the race, but he added that ``I don't think
these are normal times.''
   Hart issued a schedule of campaign stops and speeches around the
South between now and March 4.
   Questions had arisen over whether Hart was planning to announce
he was withdrawing from the race but aides to the former Colorado
senator said earlier that he was going to stay.
   ``He is having a news conference. He's not dropping out of the
race,'' Bobbie McCallum, Hart's liaison at his Denver campaign
headquarters, said Friday.
   The five other Democratic contenders were in Atlanta for a
Georgia state Democratic Party dinner on Friday. Hart did not
attend the dinner but arrived in Atlanta late Friday and was
scheduled to participate in a Democratic debate there later today.
   Hart's campaign has failed to catch fire since he re-entered the
race in December after dropping out the previous May amid questions
about his relationship with model Donna Rice. He had been the
undisputed front-runner before he quit the race.
   In rejoining the race, Hart said he came back because ``I have
the power of ideas and I can govern this country.''
   After finishing dead last among Democrats in the New Hampshire
primary earlier this month, Hart vowed to remain in the race
despite his poor showing.
   Hart made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1984.

<HEAD>Reagan Going To Brussels For NATO Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will join NATO leaders this
week at a summit designed to cement the solidarity of the 16-nation
alliance and strengthen his hand for arms-control bargaining with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Early Tuesday morning, Reagan will board Air Force One and fly
to Brussels, Belgium, for two days of talks beginning Wednesday
with the heads of state or government of the Western alliance. The
meetings at NATO headquarters will be the organization's first
full-scale summit in six years.
   With the exception of an opening statement the first day and
closing remarks on Thursday, all of the sessions will be in private.
   Thorny problems on basing rights for U.S. military forces as
well as West German reluctance about modernizing short-range
nuclear weapons are expected to remain on the shelf as NATO leaders
try to highlight areas of agreement.
   ``There is a good chance for a love-in. It looks as though they
have it pretty well wired,'' said Robert E. Hunter, director of
European studies for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
   ``Anything that comes out ought to show that the alliance is
strong and that everybody is working together and moving together
basically in the same direction,'' said a senior White House
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Nobody's going in there looking for confrontation,'' the
official added.
   The meeting offers a chance to review how to deal with the
challenge to NATO by Gorbachev's public relations offensive to give
him the image of a champion of peace and disarmament.
   It also could highlight that although a lame-duck Reagan is
losing his clout on domestic policy at home, he still commands
respect as a world leader.
   ``I think a lot of time is going to be spent among the leaders
talking about East-West relations, talking about change in the
Soviet Union, talking about what's real and what's just words and
how that guides us in dealing with our public,'' said one official,
speaking at a White House briefing on condition of being identified
only as a senior administration official.
   The official said the problem of the Warsaw Pact's overwhelming
superiority in conventional military forces will have ``a very
central place'' in the talks and be the subject of ``a lot of
time.''
   However, it was understood there was difficulty in producing a
hoped-for statement on conventional weapons because of disagreement
about what should go into it.
   Sensitive questions on the pace of modernizing battlefield
nuclear weapons in Europe will be looked at only broadly, the
official said, with nuts-and-bolts discussions left for meetings of
defense ministers and foreign ministers.
   Likewise, the official said ``it would be a perilous way to go''
to have the leaders tackle differences over U.S. bases in Spain,
Greece and Portugal. Instead, those problems will be left to
negotiators who have been working on the issue.
   Given budget pressures in the United States, one question will
be how NATO nations can absorb a greater share of the defense
burden, or as the administration official said, ``how do you stay
stronger with less money.''
   To counter Gorbachev's peace offensive, Reagan can be expected
to trumpet the signing in Washington of a U.S.-Soviet treaty to
eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles (INF).
   The summit falls within three months of an expected
Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Moscow in late May or early June. In
fact, a team of White House planners will break off from the
presidential party at the conclusion of the Brussels meeting next
Thursday and fly to Moscow to begin planning the superpower summit.
   If, as expected, Reagan gets strong backing in Brussels, he can
go to Moscow saying he has the alliance behind him.
   ``If you don't have an alliance that's split, you're dealing
from a position of strength,'' the White House official said.
   Hunter said the allies ``believe that Gorbachev got the better
part of the deal on the INF treaty, and they want to be reassured
that in Moscow the president will have deep concern for European
interests. And he (Reagan) will say all the right things next week
(to reassure them).''
   Reagan already has taken some of the steam out of the drive for
a treaty to cut U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons by 50
percent. He said in an interview there is too little time to
complete an agreement before he goes to Moscow.
   White House planners said the NATO summit also could produce one
or two more Senate votes for the INF treaty. However, the agreement
already seems assured of ratification by an overwhelming margin.

<TEXT>
   The Mexican government is creating
what it says will be the world's largest wildlife preserve to
safeguard the gray whale, which migrates to the Baja California
coast each year.
   It is the longest journey of any mammal, from the waters of
northern seas off Alaska to the lagoons of Mexico to give birth and
then mate each winter.
   Mexican officials say the land and sea ``reserve of the
biosphere'' is necessary to protect the whales and other species
from the effects of development and overzealous tourists, as well
as to provide facilities for scientists to carry out their studies.
   They take special glee in noting that the other stops along the
whales' route, Canada and the United States, have yet to take such
stringent measures to protect the once nearly extinct species.
   The whales leave the northern waters each October and travel
toward Baja California, swimming four to five miles each day and
staying five to 10 miles off the coast the entire way. They
generally reach Mexico in December and remain until March.
   Spouts of water vapor glistening in the sun announce the whales'
presence at Scammon's Lagoon, whose Spanish name is Ojo de Liebre
(Eye of the Hare), almost midway down the long peninsula.
   Then the noise of their movement, a powerful swoosh, breaks the
sea's stillness. Parts of the 35-ton whales themselves are visible
after the noise.
   The gray whale, unique in its coast-hugging habits, was hunted
virtually to extinction by 1930. Restrictions on commercial whaling
since have helped bring about a comeback, and scientists now
estimate that there are as many as 18,000 gray whales.
   The 7.2 million acre reserve takes in much of the peninsula's
Biscayne Desert and extends into the open sea.
   Three previous decrees had established refuges for the whales in
the waters of the four major lagoon areas used by the whales, but
ecologists say it was not enough to consider the marine zone as a
separate entity from the land.
   ``We have acted responsibly,'' Urban Development and Ecology
Secretary Manuel Camacho Solis said in announcing the plans. ``It
is an integral system ... to protect the habitat.''
   Scientists and ecological activists caution that the decree,
although important, must be followed by serious control and
supervision of the area if it is to prove effective.
   ``I think it is a very great effort of Mexico to decree such a
large area a biological reserve, in a country that is economically
in crisis,'' said the poet Homero Aridjis, leader of the ecological
activist Group of 100. ``I couldn't think of anything better. It's
magnificent.''
   Aridjis campaigned for the past year calling for greater
government protection for the whales.
   Although the mid-part of the Baja California peninsula is
sparsely populated, the major industrial Salt Exporting Co. complex
is located close by Scammon's Lagoon, a center of the whales'
activity.
   The complex, known as ESSA, has joint government and Japanese
private ownership. It is the largest open salt mine in the world,
exporting some 5 million tons annually.
   The maritime traffic has raised concern that diesel fuel spills
could affect the lagoons.
   The government plan requires ESSA to present an environmental
program.
   An Ecology Department study found that construction of piers and
canals and the increase of solid waste in the area as the human
population grew had affected the lagoons that are crucial to the
whales' reproduction.
   Mexican communal farms known as ``ejidos'' also are in the area,
with agricultural and part-time fishing operations that affect the
whales' habitat.
   Tourism, especially boats that travel down the coast from
California in the area, is noticeable and would be regulated more
strictly under the government's new program.
   T-shirts sold in Guerrero Negro, essentially a salt company town
with few tourist attractions, trumpet: ``Visit Baja California.
15,000 Whales Can't Be Wrong.''
   Tourism within reasonable limits is not regarded as
automatically harmful to the whales, although the noise of the
boats disturbs them.
   Biologist Luis Fleischer, director of the national research
program that has studied the marine mammals each winter for the
past decade, said, ``Well-run tourism can be beneficial, creating
sympathy and interest.''
   Anelio Aguayo, a leading researcher on whales at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, said some whales now have been
found that round the tip of Baja California to reproduce on the
Gulf of California coastline.
   He also said he hopes Canada and the United States will follow
Mexico's example and protect other areas along the whale's
migratory corridor, where industrial development often is greater.
   ``It's not only up to the government of Mexico to declare zones
of refuge and areas of protection for the gray whale,'' he said in
an interview in Mexico City.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning author Charles Fuller
Jr. had a few words of advice for the city's black youths, so he
rented 20 billboards for a month.
   ``Young people; Stay free take pride in Yourselves, GRADUATE!!''
read the billboards featuring a young black man and woman in
graduation gowns.
   Fuller, 47, author of ``A Soldier's Play,'' spent about $7,000
on the billboards while his younger brother Walter, 23, and his son
Charles 3rd, also 23, worked out the details for the project.
   ``It is not a whole lot, really,'' Fuller said. ``But we thought
maybe something on a billboard would be a way to get the attention
of young people.''
   ``You can't go out and preach on a corner. People won't listen
to you,'' Fuller said. ``More people will read that billboard than
would ever listen to me and Walt if we stood out on Girard Avenue
handing out leaflets.''
   ``A Soldier's Play,'' about bigotry on a Southern military

   Teen-age AIDS victim Ryan White is going to
Washington, D.C., this week in hopes that his experience with the
disease will help schools cope with others like him, his mother
says.
   ``He wants to try to make it better for everybody else,'' Jeanne
White said Friday.
   Ryan and Jill Stewart, student council president at Hamilton
Heights High School, are scheduled to speak to the presidential
commission on AIDS at a public hearing Thursday.
   After Ryan, 16, was diagnosed as having acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in December 1984, Kokomo school officials and
parents fought to keep him out of school. The Whites moved to
Cicero, where Ryan was accepted by the community and enrolled in
classes.
   Ryan plans to read to the commission excerpts from a paper he
wrote for his school English class. The paper, titled The Odyssey,
recounts the problems he encountered at Kokomo, White said.
   ``He wants to tell why education is important to him and why he
wanted to go back to school. It outlines the fight to go back to
school and some of the fear and panic that happened while he was
attending school there.''

   Television actor Alan Thicke says he
doesn't feel hypocritical about being co-host of the Miss USA
pageant, even though he belongs to eight animal-rights
organizations.
   Thicke has been criticized by animal-rights groups for his
association with the beauty contest, which will award the winner of
Tuesday's finals a full-length mink coat and a mink jacket.
   Thicke said Friday he believes he would be more valuable behind
the scenes than on the picket line with protesters who want to
educate people about the cruelties they say the fur industry
inflicts on animals.
   Last month, TV game-show host Bob Barker ended his 21-year reign
as the Miss USA master of ceremonies when he quit to protest the
mink giveaway.
   Thicke, star of ABC's ``Growing Pains'' and host of the Saturday
morning show ``Animal Crack-Ups,'' said picketing the pageant was
not the way to end animal cruelty.
   ``I invite those people to join any one of the eight groups that
I am involved with and do some of the things that we do, such as
meet with lobbyists and legislators,'' he said.

   Former Interior Secretary James Watt says he
thinks Cuba's purported use of isolation camps for AIDS victims is
a good idea, but he says the United States lacks the courage to do
the same.
   Watt, who served under President Reagan from 1980-83, said he
favors a quarantine and called AIDS ``the first politically
protected disease in America.''
   When a member of the audience asked whether such tactics would
violate human rights, Watt responded, `Do you want an AIDS victim
to sneeze on your salad when he's serving you at a local
restaurant?''
   Experts say that acquired immune deficiency syndrome cannot be
spread through casual contact. The disease, caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, is spread most often through
sexual contact and needles or syringes shared by drug abusers.
   Speaking Thursday at Weber State College, Watt said it was his
statement about the ethnic makeup of his staff that forced him to
quit. He described his staff as including ``a black, a white, two
Jews and a cripple.''
   Watt said he now agrees it was an ``insensitive statement,'' but
feels the only offensive part of the comment was the use of the

   Students walking by the little red
schoolhouse on the grounds of Governor Dummer Academy, the nation's
oldest boys boarding school, are likely to be thinking about
calculus or on their way to play soccer.
   But 225 years ago, when the school opened, the tiny schoolhouse
contained the only classroom on campus and the emphasis was on
Greek and Latin.
   On March 1, 1763, 27 boys with names like Theophilus Parsons,
Eliphalet Pearson and Samuel Sewall crowded into the two rooms. Of
the early graduates, one became a signer of the U.S. Constitution,
another the first U.S. postmaster general, two were appointed
president of Harvard and 16 served in Congress.
   The gulf that separates that fledling institution from today's
school, one of about 100 New England boarding schools, may seem
tremendous. But students and faculty at the picturesque school 33
miles north of Boston said the traditions that bound the first
graduates have not changed.
   David Williams, 60, has taught at Governor Dummer since 1951.
Like Samuel Moody, who greeted the first boys at the school in
1763, Williams is a ``senior master,'' a teacher considered a
``24-hour-a-day influence.'' He has also coached athletics and
served as a dorm master for years.
   Williams typifies the school's philosophy of combining a family
atmosphere with strict discipline and a heavy dose of sports.
   Williams said he remained at the school ``because I loved the
kids. I never encountered such a genuine relationship between old
and young.''
   Many of the 342 students at the school, where girls were
admitted in 1971, echo such sentiments.
   Stephen Kim, 18, of Concord, transferred here from the Middlesex
School and said ``I'm a lot happier. It's a much better
environment.''
   ``It's more of a family atmosphere,'' said Amy Russell, 16, from
Hampton Falls, N.H. ``There's a lot of bonding here because you
know everybody.''
   Both students and faculty here claim that their school is less
stereotypically elite than more prestigious schools like Phillips
Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, or Choate, in Connecticut.
   ``It's not as cliquey here,'' said Amy Shafmaster, 15, of
Durham, N.H. ``You can't really tell how rich someone is here the
way you can at other schools.''
   Faculty and students admit that the cloistered environment of
today's school is more removed from the real world than it was when
the school was first founded by the will of Lt. Gov. William Dummer
of the Massachusetts Bay province.
   ``We're babied a little because we're so sheltered here,'' said
Michelle Kahn, 16, from Atlanta. ``We should have to make more
decisions.''
   The curriculum is strict but well-rounded; art is a required
course. A senior's typical workload might include advanced biology,
calculus, religion, U.S. history, English and ``advanced
improvisational music.''
   The cost for boarding school students is $12,700; nonboarding
day students also attend. School officials said almost all
graduates enter college.
   Drugs and alcohol have been an issue on campus but discipline
problems at the school seem trite by comparison with public
schools. One student was expelled recently for stealing several
cases of soda from the headmaster's house.
   Peter Bragdon, 52, the school's 26th headmaster, dismisses any
notions that boarding schools like Governor Dummer are arcane ivory
towers.
   ``There are eternal laws and values that do not vary over
time,'' Bragdon said about the conventional values still taught at
the school. He said boarding schools offer students superior
academic standards as well as a more stable adolescence.
   ``Boarding schools often give fairer treatment to (teen-agers)
than parents do,'' Bragdon said.

   A bomb attached to a motorcycle
exploded Saturday in a town near the Afghan border, killing five
people and injuring 11, officials said.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the blast
occurred in the afternoon at the main bazaar in Tal, about 10 miles
east of the Afghan border.
   They said three of the dead and nine of the wounded were Afghan
refugees.
   About 3.5 million people from Afghanistan have sought shelter in
Pakistan since Afghanistan's civil war broke out in April 1978.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the
explosion. The Pakistan government has blamed a spate of terrorist
bombings in the past year on agents of Afghanistan's Soviet-backed
government.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan helping
the Marxist government fight a Moslem insurgency.

<HEAD>Democrats Considering Revival Of Campaign Finance Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are vowing to continue the fight for
campaign spending reform that led to a 53-hour filibuster last
week, possibly by introducing a constitutional amendment that would
allow Congress to set federal limits.
   ``We must not and we will not give up this fight,'' Sen. David
Boren, D-Okla., said Saturday in the weekly Democratic radio
address.
   ``This issue simply does not grab the headlines, like a foreign
policy emergency or a financial crisis. Yet it is just as
serious,'' said Boren, a principal author of the scuttled bill that
would have set voluntary limits.
   ``The way we're financing campaigns in this country is like a
silent deadly cancer eating away at the very heart of our
democratic system. Too much money pumped into campaigns, too many
special interests threaten the integrity of the election process
itself.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.V., already has said he
plans to continue the quest to combat the escalating cost of
winning Senate seats.
   ``This issue will come back again and again,'' Byrd said. ``It
will not be swept under the rug.''
   A senator in the middle of the partisan battle said Democratic
leaders are thinking about bringing a proposed constitutional
amendment to the floor to replace the legislation effectively
killed by stubborn opposition from minority Republicans.
   The proposed amendment that would give Congress the specific
authority, now lacking because of a 1976 Supreme Court decision, to
set mandatory limits on how much federal candidates can spend on
campaigns.
   ``It's a distinct and likely possibility the constitutional
amendment will surface in the next few weeks,'' said the senator,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The senator was a leader in
last week's failed effort by Democrats to get a vote on their bill
to set voluntary spending limits.
   Byrd would not say whether he planned to push the proposed
constitutional amendment. ``That is one of the options,'' he said,
and did not elaborate.
   The campaign spending bill, carrying 52 of the 100 senators as
co-sponsors, was scuttled for the 1988 session Friday when
Democrats fell seven votes short of the 60 they needed to curtail a
GOP talkathon and force a vote on the bill.
   The 53-41 roll call represented the eighth time since last June
that Republicans had defeated attempts by Byrd to limit debate on
the campaign spending bill.
   Boren, in the radio address, called it a ``tragedy'' that
members of both political parties could not agree on limiting
campaign costs. He said the average cost of running a successful
race for the U.S. Senate has gone up 500 percent in 10 years to
about $3 million and declared, ``It is time for us, all of us, to
wake up and speak out before it's too late.''
   ``We're not going to give up, either,'' said acting minority
leader Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. ``We have slayed the dragon eight
times. ... The deed is done, and we ought to move on to other
things.''
   Republicans refused to negotiate with Democrats over spending
limits, saying such restrictions would doom their party to minority
status in states where Democrats have a big edge in voter
registration.
   They offered to discuss restricting how much special-interest
political action committees can give to Senate candidates, but
Democrats said that without spending limits, PACs would find other
ways pump money into political campaigns.
   The proposed constitutional amendment has been laying fallow in
the Judiciary Committee. Its principal sponsor is Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., who was not a co-sponsor of the voluntary limits
bill.
   The Hollings legislation is a response to the Supreme Court's
Buckley vs. Valeo ruling in 1976 that held Congress, absent a
constitutional change, cannot restrict how much money a candidate
can on a campaign.
   Hollings' proposal, which has 19 sponsors, states simply that
``the Congress may enact laws regulating the amounts of
contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections to
federal offices.''
   A proposed amendment needs 67 votes to pass the Senate, a
similar two-thirds margin in the House and then ratification by at
least 38 states.
   Mathematics seem to be against Byrd if he brings the Hollings
legislation to the floor. He needed 60 votes to force a roll call
on the voluntary limit bill and never had more than 55, including
two missing from Friday's vote.
   However, the sponsor mix on the Hollings bill is different than
the one debated last week. Three of its cosponsors _ Richard
Shelby, D-Ala., Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. _
opposed cloture.
   If Byrd could hold his 55 votes and pick up these three
senators, he would need to find only two more to break any GOP
filibuster against the Hollings bill.
   Once this measure came to a vote, he would have to find the
other votes for passage from a handful of Republicans who are said
to support spending limits but who stayed loyal to their party's
position against the voluntary limit proposal.

   A woman celebrating her birthday was
burned and temporarily blinded by a snail that exploded on her
plate at a city restaurant, police said Saturday.
   Karen J. Prouty, 36, of North Syracuse, was about to take her
second bite of a bubbling order of escargot Friday night when one
of the snails exploded, burning her around her right eye, police
said. She couldn't see for about 90 minutes afterward.
   ``I just immediately broke down crying,'' Prouty said Saturday.
She was treated at University Hospital in Syracuse and released
Friday night.
   The dinner at Pascale's Wine Bar and Restaurant was a birthday
surprise arranged by her husband and sister, Prouty said.
   The restaurant's owner, Charles Pascale, assured her he would
pay for any medical expenses and for damage to her white linen
dress, Prouty said. He also offered her a free dinner.
   A restaurant worker referred a call Saturday to maitre d' Fred
Rosener, who was not immediately available for comment.
   But Pascale told police the snail probably was blown apart by
the pressure of steam building up in an air pocket.
   ``I enjoy escargot, but I probably will be very hesitant to
order it again,'' Prouty said.

   Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less took command
Saturday of the U.S. Navy's escort squadron in the Persian Gulf,
inheriting a force that U.S. officials say has lost no clout
despite a cutback in strength.
   Hours before the ceremony, two U.S. warships sailed through the
Strait of Hormuz into the gulf to complete the restructuring that
leaves 25 American warships in the region, including 16 in the
gulf-based Middle East Force.
   Less, a career aviator who once commanded the Navy's famed
``Blue Angels'' jet acrobatics team, became the 36th commander of
the Middle East Force in a shipboard ceremony that dates back to
the British navy at the time of the American Revolution in 1776.
   Government officials and gulf area diplomats attended the
wind-chilled, sunset event aboard the 17,000-ton amphibious assault
ship Coronado, newly designated flagship of the Middle East Force.
   The force has operated in the gulf since 1949, assigned to
represent and protect U.S. national interests in the vital oil
waterway.
   It attracted little recent attention until last year's
controversial decision by the Reagan administration to register 11
Kuwaiti tankers under the U.S. flag, qualifying them for American
protection from Iranian attack.
   Following that move, and the May 17 attack by an Iraqi jet on
the U.S. frigate Stark in which 37 Americans were killed, the
Navy's forces in the region grew to a peak strength of nearly 40
ships, including two battle groups in the Arabian Sea and Indian
Ocean.
   Inside the gulf, the force nearly tripled from about half a
dozen vessels to 17 at the start of 1988.
   In a speech on board the Coronado, Gen. George B. Crist, a
Marine who heads the U.S. Central Command, noted that a year ago
the United States had only about six ships in the gulf.
   ``This rapid buildup of deterrent power and the successes we
have achieved did not come easily,'' Crist said. ``Dramatic and
often traumatic decisions and efforts were required.''
   Crist's Tampa, Fla.-based headquarters is responsible for U.S.
military concerns in 19 countries from Africa to Pakistan,
encompassing the Middle East region.
   Crist also said he understood the new commander's motto was ``do
more with Less,'' an allusion to the Pentagon's move to trim the
cost and size of the escort operation by cutting the force from 17
to 16 ships.
   On Feb. 3, the 50-year-old Less also assumed command of the
Joint Task Force Middle East, the Arabian Sea support group that
also has been scaled down.
   In Saturday's ceremony, Less replaced Rear Adm. Harold J.
Bernsen, who has headed the Middle East Force since July 1986 and
before that was skipper of the flagship La Salle during the 1979
hostage crisis in Iran and the outbreak of the Iraq-Iran war in
1980.
   U.S. officials recently estimated the cost of the operations at
$15 million to $20 million a month, but said the cutback did not
result from a budget squeeze or a lessening of the Iranian threat.

   The United States will make no
reciprocal gesture to Moscow's decision to withdraw some nuclear
missiles and troops from Eastern Europe, the U.S. ambassador to
NATO said Saturday.
   Alton G. Keel Jr. said the Soviet move, rather than being a
meaningful expression of good will, was part of an orchestrated
campaign to convince West Europeans that the Soviet Union is
changing its ways.
   ``We, obviously from the U.S. standpoint, welcome the fact that
they're withdrawing the missiles, but there'll be no similar action
on the part of the U.S.,'' Keel said in an interview at his
official residence outside Brussels.
   Soviet soldiers on Thursday left two bases in East Germany and
one garrison in Czechoslovakia, taking with them the first nuclear
missiles dismantled under a U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating all
land-based nuclear rockets with ranges between 310 miles and 3,100
miles.
   The missiles moved out of East Germany and Czechoslovakia, known
in the West as SS-12s, have ranges of up to 550 miles.
   The treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev last Dec. 8 does not require either side to withdraw
or destroy any missiles until it has been ratified by both
governments. The U.S. Senate is expected to approve it by late
spring.
   Keel said Washington could not withdraw any of its more than 400
Tomahawk cruise and Pershing 2 ballistic nuclear missiles from
Western Europe until after the Senate decides whether to ratify the
treaty.
   He noted that the Soviets have said they will not actually
destroy any of the withdrawn SS-12 missiles until after the treaty
has been ratified by the Senate and by the Soviet parliament, the
Supreme Soviet.
   ``They obviously want to take as much advantage of their having
been willing to enter into this agreement as possible, use it to
advantage, try to convince European publics that there's been major
new thinking in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Keel said the United States already had shown its good will by
voluntarily halting deployment of cruise and Pershing 2 missiles as
soon as the treaty was signed.
   ``We actually did concede something unilaterally, we conceded
that we would no longer deploy systems,'' even though NATO had not
yet reached its original target of deploying 572 of the
medium-range missiles, he said.
   The Soviet move, he said, did little to increase the security of
NATO nations, which continues to be threatened by the existence of
more than 1,400 short-range Soviet nuclear missiles in Europe and a
Warsaw Pact numerical edge over the Western alliance in non-nuclear
arms.
   Keel said it ``would be meaningful'' if Moscow unilaterally
withdrew some of its shortest-range nuclear arms and conventionally
armed troops, but that NATO would make no reciprocal gesture
because its forces already are at a bare minimum to deter a
possible Soviet attack.

   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
response, delivered by Sen. David L. Boren of Oklahoma, to
President Reagan's radio address on Saturday:
   I welcome this chance to talk with you today, not as a
Democratic senator from Oklahoma, but as a fellow American, about a
problem that should concern all of us.
   Have you ever had the urge to start shouting, ``wake up, wake
up,'' to those around you to warn them about some danger that they
just don't seem to see?
   I had that feeling this past week as we debated about campaign
reform in the U.S. Senate.
   This issue simply does not grab the headlines like a foreign
policy emergency or a financial crisis, yet is just as serious. The
way we're financing campaigns in this country is like a silent
deadly cancer eating away at the very heart of our democratic
system.
   Too much money pumped into campaigns by too many special
interests threatens the integrity of the election process itself.
Did you know that in just 10 short years the average cost of
running a successful race for the U.S. Senate has gone up 500
percent, and that the average cost, in even small states, rose to
$3 million?
   That means that in order to finance a successful campaign for
re-election, a sitting senator must raise an average of $10,000 in
campaign contributions every single week of his or her six-year
term. That's $10,000 every week for 300 weeks in a row.
   This money chase for campaign contributions raises several
problems. First, it means that congressmen and senators are having
to spend their time and energy raising campaign money instead of
working to solve the serious problems facing our country.
   We need our Congress on the job, and not having to go out and
raise campaign funds. Second, campaigns now cost so much that
members can't raise enough to finance them from their home states
alone. They have to fly all around the country to cities in other
states where they can raise campaign funds instead of spending time
in their own states listening to the people back home to learn
about their problems.
   Finally, to raise the millions of dollars in needed campaign
funds, congressmen and senators have turned more and more to
special interest groups and political action committees known as
PACs. In the last election, almost 200 members elected to Congress
received over half of their campaign funds from PACs, often
controlled by lobbyists in Washington, instead of from the people
back home.
   What's going to happen to grassroots democracy if this trend
continues? Americans must ask themselves, is it good for our
country that the cost of campaigns has skyrocketed to $3 million?
Is it good for our country that the fastest growing source of these
funds is from narrow special interest groups based outside a
member's home state?
   The American people say no. In a recent Harris survey, 91
percent of those surveyed said this explosion of campaign costs is
a serious problem and it must be addressed. Ninety-one percent of
the American people, Democrats and Republicans alike, want their
respresentatives to act. This last week the Senate tried to act.
Fifty-two senators, over half of the members, joined in sponsoring
a bill to put limits on runaway campaign spending.
   Tragically a determined minority blocked the Senate from even
being able to consider this bill. Among Democrats the vote was 48
to 2 in favor of action. Among Republicans, it was 38 to 3 against
proceeding. I call this a tragedy because we should not break down
along party lines. We need to unite as Americans to solve this
serious problem which affects all of us.
   The supporters of the bill offered to change it to make sure it
would be fair to both political parties. But opponents said that
they would never even discuss putting limits on campaign spending.
We must not and we will not give up this fight.
   In a few weeks congressmen will spread out across this country
to speak at high school graduating ceremonies. When we urge those
students to some day think of running for office to serve their
country, will we also to have to tell them that at the current rate
of increasing campaign costs, 12 years from now when they're old
enough to run, the average U.S. Senate race will cost $15 million?
Will we have to challenge them not only to think about what they'd
like todo to help their country, but also to think about how they
will raise $15 million to run for the U.S. Senate?
   We must not let that happen to America. We must not cloud the
future of the next generation. It's time for us, all of us, to wake
up and speak out before it's too late.

   Iraq said waves of its fighter-bombers
attacked Iran's key oil refineries in Tehran and other cities
Saturday in strikes aimed at crippling Iran's economy.
   Iran responded quickly by shelling a border town. Later it also
shelled the southern Iraqi port, Basra, and vowed to strike Baghdad.
   An Iraqi military spokesman warned that if any Iraqi city was
hit ``all Iranian cities, including Tehran, will become targets for
our missiles, air force jets and other weapons.''
   Saturday's raids and threats rekindled fears of a flare-up in
the ``war of the cities,'' which has left thousands dead since 1984.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said at least one civilian
was killed and an undisclosed number were wounded in the raid on
the capital's southern suburbs. It did not mention the other raids.
   Baghdad's official news agency said Iranian artillery gunners
retaliated by shelling Basra and the border town of al-Qurna, just
north of the port city. It said five civilians were killed and 14
others wounded in Basra. Two civilians were killed and two others
wounded in shelling on al-Qurna, the agency said.
   Iraqi authorities also reported carrying out evacuation
exercises in Baghdad, Basra and other cities at risk of reprisals
from Iranian air, missile or artillery.
   The Iraqi News Agency said that apart from the raids on economic
targets, the Iraqi air force Saturday flew 101 combat missions
against Iranian troops concentrations, the highest one-day total in
months.
   Helicopter gunships flew another 72 missions, it added.
   Tehran Radio said two Iraqi helicopters were shot down. Iraq's
news agency denied the claim.
   The Iraqi raids marked a sharp escalation in the stalemated
7-year-old war and came as Iraq's army braced for new Iranian
ground offensives.
   Tehran Radio and INA, also monitored in Nicosia, said the air
raids took place just before noon.
   INA reported the Iranian refineries were ``destroyed ... and
shattered'' and left shrouded in flames and smoke. But it did not
identify them.
   Iran's main refineries are located near Tehran, the northwestern
city of Tabriz, the central city of Isfahan and the southern city
of Shiraz.
   A sustained air offensive against Iran's industrial centers in
1986 cut its refining capacity of 625,000 barrels a day by almost
half, forcing Tehran to import petroleum products and ration
gasoline for the first time since the war began.
   It was not clear whether Saturday's reported raids marked the
start of a new air offensive to throttle Iran's war-battered
economy. But the Iraqi air force has been concentrating in recent
months on hitting Iran's oil exports, the country's economic
jugular.
   INA quoted a military communique as saying ``large numbers'' of
Iraqi jets took part in the attacks ``deep inside Iranian
territory.''
   It said all the planes returned safely to their bases.
   The refineries were Iran's ``economic mainstays and linked with
the war effort'' of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fundamentalist
regime ``for prolonging aggression on Iraq,'' the communqiue added.
   Iran's War Information Headquarters in Tehran swiftly announced
that ``Iraq's military and economic centers'' in Baghdad and Basra
will be hit ``within the next few hours'' and urged civilians to
evacuate areas around likely targets.
   It did not specify how Iran would hit back. But the Iranians,
their badly depleted air force outnumbered 8-1 by Iraq, usually
retaliate against Baghdad with Soviet-made Scud-B missiles supplied
by Libya and Syria.
   Basra is within easy range of Iranian artillery and has been
repeatedly bombarded in the last 18 months, with more than 1,500
civilians killed by some 62,000 shells.
   At appalling cost, Iranian Revolutionary Guards battled to
within six miles of Basra a year ago and still hold a bridgehead in
marshland east of the city.
   The Iraqi air force last attacked major economic targets deep
inside Iran Feb. 11, when its Soviet-built MiG-21 and Sukhoi Su-20
fighter-bombers raided a power plant and fuel depots in southwest
Iran and an electronics factory in Shiraz.
   The Iranian air force, despite chronic shortages of spares that
have grounded most of its aging U.S.-made F-4 and F-5 planes, has
also seen action recently, mainly attacking Iraqi defenses and
supply dumps around Basra.
   These almost daily raids have heightened Iraqi fears that the
Iranians plan a new offensive against the strategic city that lies
on the Shatt Al-Arab waterway, the prewar southern boundary between
the two countries.
   The Iranians have been massing troops in the southern sector
since November, but have so far not launched any significant thrust
there.
   Western military analysts and diplomats in Baghdad said the
Iranians have concentrated up to 150,000 men in the south.
   But the analysts believe Iran cannot launch an all-out push
because it has not been able to mobilize enough men to wage a
sustained campaign.

<HEAD>Once Again, Reagan's Press Conference Remarks Spur Clarifications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House cleanup crew was at work once
again last week, attempting to clarify remarks President Reagan
made at his Wednesday evening news conference.
   The president's comments were only the latest in what is an
increasingly bulging file of eyebrow-raising statements he has made
at news conferences over the years. The gaffes have ranged from
erroneous economic statistics to misconstrued versions of events
around the world.
   At Wednesday's session, Reagan remarked that Palestinian unrest
in Israeli-occupied territory has been caused by ``outsiders coming
in.''
   It was followed quickly by a comment from Secretary of State
George Shultz, who told reporters the conflict's ``fundamental
origins are essentially indigenous.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the two answers were
``totally consistent as far as we're concerned.''
   The president also asserted that Shultz and former Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger had not objected to the secret arms
sale to Iran on the grounds that it was an arms-for-hostages deal.
   Shultz and Weinberger have insisted that they did raise such
objections, contentions supported by Congress' Iran-Contra report
and by a comment the president himself made a year ago.
   And Reagan also spoke of divisions among blacks in white-ruled
South Africa, stating, ``It is a tribal policy more than it is a
racial policy, and that is one of the most difficult parts here.''
   Fitzwater said he could not elaborate on the remark.
   The confusion that trailed Reagan's comments echoed the
discrepancies that have emerged from many of the previous 41 news
conferences the president has held during his seven years in the
White House.
   At a June 11, 1987, news conference at the economic summit in
Venice, Italy, the president sent his aides scrambling when he
stated that he believed the dollar's value could decline further
``within reason.''
   The administration was trying to halt the dollar's slide at the
time, and Fitzwater quickly issued a statement denying that the
president wanted the decline to resume.
   ``He wants stability in the dollar,'' the spokesman said.
   On Nov. 19, 1986, as the Iran-Contra affair was emerging, Reagan
told reporters that the United States ``had nothing to do with''
and ``did not condone'' arms shipments to Iran by third countries.
   Soon after the news conference ended, White House officials
issued a statement conceding that a third country was involved in
the secret shipments. The country turned out to be Israel.
   At that same news conference, Reagan said the TOW anti-tank
missiles included in the shipments to Iran are
``shoulder-carried,'' when in fact they are much too large for that
and are normally fired from a jeep.
   The president ignited a controversy June 11, 1986, when he said
that if any Americans were starving or undernourished, it was from
ignorance about where to get free food, not from lack of sustenance.
   ``I find it difficult also to find any cases of starvation and
undernourishment,'' he said.
   Democrats criticized the president for terminating a program
that publicized the food stamp program. Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., said there were hungry people ``a few blocks from the
White House.''
   On Feb. 18, 1982, Reagan offered an account of the early years
of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. He stated that President Kennedy
authorized the sending of the first combat troops into Vietnam,
which did not occur until President Johnson's administration.
   Reagan also said North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had
``refused to participate'' in national elections after the French
withdrawal from Indochina. In fact, the South Vietnamese government
refused to hold preparatory talks with North Vietnam, and documents
showed that American diplomats urged the South Vietnamese to insist
on conditions the Communists would not accept.
   The elections were never held.
   The Associated Press and other news organizations double-checked
comments the president made at a Jan. 19, 1982, news conference,
and challenged six statements.
   Reagan said 1 million more people were at work than in 1980. In
fact, there were 94,000 fewer people with jobs in December 1981
than in December 1980, according to official government figures,
and the White House later conceded that Reagan ``misspoke.''
   Among other statements at that news conference, Reagan said:
   _ The steel industry had commenced a multi-billion dollar
expansion program. Industry officials said there were plans to
modernize some factories, but that there were few proposals to
expand.
   _ A Pima County, Ariz., program for feeding the elderly saved
$50,000 by eliminating administrative help and doubled the people
they served. The program director denied that.
   _ Interest rates had dropped during his year in office. Although
some short-term rates had fallen, rates on long-term government
bonds _ the best indicator of long-term rates _ and home mortgage
rates had increased.

   Demonstrators stoned the Israeli Embassy
and broke several windows Saturday during a protest against the
crackdown on Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories.
   About 200 Greek Cyriots broke through a police cordon and barbed
wire barricades blocking access to the embassy building in a narrow
suburban street.
   They stood outside the tall wire fence of the embassy compound
and burned an Israeli flag, threw stones at the building and
chanted anti-Israeli slogans.
   Police reinforcements managed to drive the protesters away
within a few minutes.
   ``We have had many windows broken, but nobody has been hurt,''
said an Israeli diplomat at the embassy who answered a telephone
call from The Associated Press. He declined to give his name.
   The demonstrators marched to the embassy after staging a protest
rally in the capital's main square.
   One of the placards carried by the demonstrators said ``Dachau
lives again,'' a reference to one of the Nazi death camps where
millions of Jews were incinerated during World War II.
   Other placards said ``Palestinians have a right to
self-determination,'' and ``Israel, stop killing Palestinians.''
   The demonstration coincided with the opening session in Nicosia
of a hearing by the International Secretariat of the Inquiry
Commission Into Israeli Crimes Against the Lebanese and Palestinian
People.
   The inquiry, which held its session at a Nicosia hotel, includes
European judicial and legal personalities sympathetic to the
Palestinian cause. It is headed by British lawyer John Platts-Mills.
   Nasreen Bsisso, a Palestinian woman expelled from Israel two
years ago, told the inquiry that 138 Palestinians have been killed
and more than 2,000 have been seriously wounded since the unrest in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip started on Dec. 8.
   U.N. figures place the number of dead at 69.
   Jabril Mahmoud Rujub, 35, one of four Palestinians expelled from
Israel last month, said he had spent 17 years in Israeli prisons
and gave extensive testimony to the inquiry about prison conditions.
   ``Since there is no death penalty in Israel, they try to kill
the prisoners through torture and illtreatment,'' he said.
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said in a message to the inquiry that its work ``will
unmask and expose Israeli crimes and barbaric practices.''
   He said Israel ``would not be able to carry out these barbaric
crimes without the total support and unlimited aid it receives from
the American administration.''

<HEAD>Iran Executes Five For Planting Bombs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five people accused of planting bombs in
Iran were sentenced to death and executed Saturday, Tehran
television reported.
   The television did not identify the five nor say whether they
were among 30 people arrested earlier for allegedly planting bombs
in Tehran and western Iran in recent weeks.
   The television broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said: ``The
Islamic Revolutionary Court announced that five agents related to
the global arrogance who were accused of planting bombs that caused
some death and injuries, were sentenced to death and executed
Saturday evening.''
   It gave no other details. But Iranian leaders and the news media
usually refer to the superpowers as global arrogance.
   The arrest of the 30 people was disclosed earlier Saturday by an
Iranian security chief in a statement broadcast on Tehran Radio.
   Sarajeddin Mussavi, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary
Committees, had said the alleged bombers were ``paid Iraqi agents''
who will shortly be handed over to revolutionary courts for trial.
   Most saboteurs are branded Iraqi agents by Iranian authorities.
Death is the usual penalty for those convicted of bombings and
several have been executed by firing squad in recent months.
   Mussavi said in an interview on the state-run radio that the
alleged saboteurs had confessed to two bombings in Tehran earlier
this month.
   The last reported bombing in the Iranian capital was Feb. 18,
when a car bomb exploded on the Mohammed Ali Jenah expressway,
wounding two people. Another 10 people were reported wounded three
days earlier in a bomb blast in north Tehran's Martyr Bahonar
Street.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.

   Brothers David and Jon Fone made their
double wedding a family affair Saturday when they married Janette
Browne and her daughter, Rachael.
   David Fone, 23, married Janette, 37, making him Rachael's
stepfather as well as her brother-in-law.
   Jon Fone, 18, married Rachael, also 18. He now has Janette as
both a sister-in-law and a mother-in-law.
   David also becomes the stepfather to Janette's five children by
her first marriage, as well as grandfather and uncle to Jon and
Rachel's 1-year-old daughter, Nikita.
   David has two children by his first marriage.
   Confusing?
   Not at all, says Rachael.
   ``We're just one big happy family,'' she said.``At first it was
a bit difficult. It was a bit embarrassing talking about the things
you talk to mothers about, just in case she told David and it got
back to Jon. But after a few weeks it was great.''
   The two couples started double-dating every week in Torquay,
southwest England, ``and we became more like sisters than mother
and daughter,'' Rachael said.
   Janette, whose other children range in age from 4 to 13, said
that dating David brought her closer to Rachael.
   David said: ``You could see Janette getting happier and happier
every time we all went out together. One minute she was a mother of
six and never went out anywhere. The next she's going out drinking
and dancing with her teen-age daughter. It actually made her
younger.''

   Drugs and political murders have
perturbed the calm that had made this Central American country an
island of peace surrounded by guerrilla wars.
   Life in this bustling capital of narrow streets and low pastel
painted buildings remains tranquil compared to the daily
tribulations of neighboring El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.
Civil wars in those countries have killed more than 100,000 people
in the past decade.
   Because of Honduras' relative stability and its close alliance
with Washington, U.S. officials were particularly concerned about
the increased use in recent years of this country as a
transshipment point for American-bound Colombian cocaine.
   After several seizures of Honduran-routed drugs in the previous
two years, federal agents in Florida last November confiscated four
tons of cocaine hidden in a shipment of Honduran wooden doors.
Worth more than $1 billion, it was the biggest bust in U.S. history.
   Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said in an interview broadcast here last week that
``without doubt'' some Honduran military officers and government
officials are involved in the drug trade.
   Honduras returned to civilian rule in 1982 after a decade of
military regimes. But the civilian administration of President Jose
Azcona Hoyo remains weak and dependent on the support of the armed
forces.
   Abrams told the radio station HRN: ``As in any army, there are
individuals, people in the Honduran army who are not honest and
perhaps have been bought by Matta and the drug traffickers. But
that does not mean that the army as an institution is dishonest,
because that's not true.''
   He referred to Juan Ramon Matta, a Honduran who escaped from a
Colombian jail two years ago and returned here, where he lives in
an opulent home with a bodyguard of 10 former Honduran
paratroopers. Matta, allegedly a major figure of Colombia's
infamous Medellin Cartel, was jailed for a few months upon his
arrival back home. Local media said he bought his way out.
   Matta, 43, is wanted in the United States in connection with the
slaying in 1985 in Mexico of U.S drug agent Enrique Camarena
Salazar. The Honduran Constitution prohibits extradition of native
Hondurans.
   Abrams said the Honduran military asked a year ago for more U.S.
help in combating the proliferating traffickers. The U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, after an absence of seven years, has
re-established an office here.
   Political violence has increased along with the rise in drug
trafficking, though there is no apparent connection between the
two. Amnesty International, the London-based rights organization,
reported Wednesday that death squads linked to the Honduran
military are waging a new campaign of torture and terror against
government opponents.
   The independent Human Rights Committee, known as CODEH, blames
three slayings last month on officially sanctioned or tolerated
death squads.
   CODEH Vice President Anibal Puerto, in an interview with The
Associated Press, said there were 277 ``extra-judicial executions''
last year. He said that because of lack of investigative means, the
committee could not say how many it blames on death squads. But he
said most of the victims presented signs of torture, and that many
had been active in labor, rights, student or campesino (peasant)
organizations.
   Miguel Angel Pavon, head of the CODEH branch in the northwestern
city of San Pedro Sula, and professor Moises Landaverde were
talking in a car in front of the latter's home on Jan. 14 when a
motorcycle carrying two people pulled alongside. The motorcycle
passenger shot each man twice and the bike sped away.
   A few days earlier, gunmen killed former army sergeant Jose
Isias Vilorio, reportedly an ex-member of a death squad. Vilorio
had been scheduled to testify in Costa Rica before the
Inter-American Court on Human Rights hearing a case alleging that
death squads operated with official backing here in the early
1980s. A banner of a tiny leftist guerrilla faction was left by the
body, and the government says leftists killed him.
   Rights activists, citing the importance of Vilorio's imminent
testimony, contend he was killed by a death squad and that the flag
was a crude attempt to divert blame.
   Amnesty said other abuses, including arbitrary arrests and
torture of prisoners are widespread in Honduras.
   Consulted by the AP, Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro
termed the Amnesty report ``somewhat pulled out of thin air ...
when there is no proof.'' He said the murders of last month were
being investigated.
   But Puerto said the investigation is getting nowhere.
   Carlos Montoya, president of the National Congress, called
during a press conference Wednesday for the abolition of death
squads.
   ``We trust that the armed forces will make known the names of
those responsible for so many crimes,'' he said.
   Authorities here reacted with indignation to the reports of
officers' involvement in the drug trade. Armed forces spokesman
Col. Manual Suarez Benavides told the AP flatly, ``There are no
military officers involved in narcotics traffic.''
   The Foreign Ministry demanded that the U.S. Embassy provide the
names of Honduran officers allegedly involved in drug dealing.
   On Feb. 19, ambassador Everett Briggs wrote to Foreign Minister
Carlos Lopez Contreras saying the U.S. government has no list of
Honduran officers involved in drug trafficking. Briggs said that if
and when U.S. authorities obtain such information, it will be
passed on to Honduran oficials.

<HEAD>Resort Residents Want Rampant Growth Curbed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When explorer Bartholomew Gosnold
visited this small island off the Massachusetts coast in 1602, he
named it in honor of his daughter and the grapevines he found
growing abundantly on its open land.
   Today undeveloped land on Martha's Vineyard is increasingly
scarce, and an overwhelming majority of the resort island's
residents are demanding a halt to rapid growth they say is
stripping the island of its character and straining its police,
hospital and other services.
   ``At one time, it was natural graces that brought people to the
island. Now that is being supplemented by the fact that this is
also attractive as a straight out-and-out investment,'' said Walter
Renear, chairman of the Tisbury town planning board.
   A poll commissioned by the weekly Vineyard Gazette newspaper
found that 95 percent of adult residents in the island's six towns
believe development is creating serious problems. Seventy-five
percent of permanent residents and 82 percent of seasonal residents
called the problems very serious.
   The poll of 800 people by Louis Harris and Associates Inc. also
found a widespread distrust of developers and a belief among 82
percent of the respondents that the island will become unlivable if
growth is not curtailed.
   The year-round population on the island is now 12,690, more than
double what it was 15 years ago. The summer population swells to
over 90,000 with visitors in search of the island's breezes,
beaches, fishing and sailing.
   Most respondents favored a broad, one-year moratorium on
residential and commercial development and the adoption of
island-wide planning goals to restrict the number and location of
new developments.
   But Renear said speculation has helped force land values up and
a moratorium would likely draw lawsuits from developers and
property owners.
   ``It's the investment aspect of the land that is fueling this
development,'' Renear said.
   Many owners buy land and get permission to build. The permits
become part of the land value, and an investor need not build to
make money.
   For years there have been arguments about island development,
but Vineyard officials say the poll is the first indication that
there is near unanimity among residents about taking action to halt
growth.
   ``I think it's a mandate,'' said James L. Young, a member of the
Martha's Vineyard Commission, the island's regional planning
agency. ``I think it's time to take a good hard look at our
officeholders to see if they are indeed reflecting the views of
their constituents.''
   The number of building permits for new residential units on
Martha's Vineyard jumped 302 percent from 1976, when 158 permits
were issued, to 1986, when 636 new units were approved island-wide.
Another 517 units were approved in 1987, according to Vineyard
Commission records.
   Open land has become a commodity on the 100-square-mile island,
a summer haven seven miles off the Cape Cod shore. Land records
show that scores of undeveloped lots have changed hands several
times in recent years, each time at a higher price, without being
developed.
   Ironically, an agency created in May 1986 to help preserve some
of the island's scenic and historic land is benefiting from the
land deals.
   The Martha's Vineyard Land Bank receives proceeds of a 2 percent
tax on all Vineyard real estate transactions, and has collected
nearly $7.4 million, its share of the $370 million in real estate
deals on the island in the past 21 months.
   The land bank has used the money to buy outright or purchase
development rights to 290 acres and is in the process of obtaining
183 more acres.
   Efforts of the land bank and a handful of other island
preservation groups won't be enough to stop rapid development, said
Brendan O'Neill, executive director of the Martha's Vineyard
Conservation Society.
   A one-year building moratorium, he said, ``will buy us time to
forge an island-wide consensus about what we want to be as a
community.''
   But Renear, 62, a lifelong Vineyard resident, said a moratorium
is more likely to land island officials in court.
   ``This is a solvable problem and with time we can get a
solution,'' Renear said. ``There's room for growth. I'm not saying
that we have all the answers. But a moratorium is too simplistic.
Property owners will have you in court in two minutes.''
   John Magnuson, 32, who works for his father, a longtime builder
on the island, said better planning is the answer to the island's
growth problem.
   ``I don't think a moratorium is the answer,'' he said. ``I do
think it has to slow down somewhat, but there are some areas in the
back woods where growth is just fine.''

   Paul Swallow threw up his hands and whooped
when he crossed the finish line in his first ski race since he
broke his neck eight years ago.
   A paraplegic with only limited use of his arms, Swallow was back
on the snow again with more than 100 other disabled veterans.
   Sitting in a plastic ski sled made for disabled skiers and
grinning widely in the bright sunshine at Powderhorn Ski Area,
Swallow talked of ``paying for this in more ways than one'' but
said he thinks ``everybody should get in one of these things.''
   Swallow, 32, from Los Angeles, tore some skin from his left
elbow during his slalom run when his sled nearly overturned, but
all he cared about was getting out of his wheelchair and going
skiing.
   ``You get a lot of satisfaction out of this and it proves a lot
to people,'' said Swallow, a volunteer juvenile probation
counselor. ``Everybody can do something and there's no limit.''
   Encouraging disabled veterans to exchange their wheelchairs for
ski sleds and pushing them beyond their limits is the idea behind
the National Winter Sports Clinic for Veterans.
   Only in its second year, the clinic drew 105 disabled veterans
to Powderhorn for a week of skiing, snowmobiling, wheelchair
basketball and sightseeing.
   ``Can you imagine if you were confined to a wheelchair the
pleasure and thrill of being able to ski and going 40 mph?'' asked
Sandy Trombetta, the Veterans Administration's chief recreational
therapist in Grand Junction.
   Trombetta said most of the participants ``never even dreamed of
skiing before, and most have never pushed beyond their limitations
before.''
   The skiers ranged from near quadriplegics with only limited use
of their hands to amputees and blind skier Urban Miyares of San
Diego.
   Miyares skied with the help of Sue Haak of the Denver VA office,
who is a ski instructor for the handicapped at the Winter Park
area. She skiied next to Miyares, calling out to him when to turn,
slow down or speed up.
   Amputees ski on a single ski with tiny skis fitted to the
bottoms of their ski poles like outriggers.
   Paraplegics with good upper body coordination and balance use a
high-tech monoski, a plastic or metal shell perched on a single
ski. They also use outriggers, and accomplished monoskiers blast
through the same moguls and powder as expert able-bodied skiers.
   Most who have lost the use of their legs and have suffered some
injury higher toward the shoulders use the plastic sleds. They drag
metal spikes in the snow to turn and the less experienced are
tethered to a skier who follows to keep their speed under control.
   The plastic sleds officially are called ``sit-skis'' and cost
between $1,400 and $2,200 each.
   The veterans came from 20 states, either paying their own way to
Grand Junction or getting financial help from their local VFW or
American Legion groups. Trombetta said it costs the VA and several
corporate sponsors $50,000 to stage the week-long clinic.
   A second-year participant, Ray Hill of Detroit, says he can't
get enough of skiing.
   ``From the moment I took my first run last year I wanted to come
back,'' said Hill, 45, who was left in a wheelchair by a
hit-and-run driver.
   Hill said only the will and the mind stand in the way of the
disabled.
   ``You have to pick yourself up and do it again, and again, until
you master it,'' he said. ``And you can always look around here and
see somebody worse off than you are, doing the same thing.
   ``So if he's doing it, I can do it.''

<HEAD>Turkish Government Approves Defense Pact with U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday approved the
renewal of a defense cooperation pact with the United States that
was signed by the two countries almost a year ago, the Foreign
Ministry announced.
   The pact gives the United States access to a dozen military
installations in Turkey, including two electronic listening posts
that monitor Soviet military activities and nuclear tests.
   Premier Turgut Ozal's Cabinet, disappointed by the position of
the U.S. Congress on military aid to Turkey, had been withholding
approval of the agreement that will be in force until 1990.
   Turkey contends it needs $1.2 billion in U.S. assistance a year
to modernize its armed forces.
   Last year, the Reagan administration asked Congress to give
Turkey $914 million in aid. The Congress, citing budget
constraints, cut the request to $570 million and reduced the amount
to $490 million for the current fiscal year.
   The announcement said that in ratifying the agreement, the
Turkish government considered other aspects of the relationship
with the United States besides defense cooperation. It did not
elaborate.
   The announcement also noted that the United States, in the
agreement, had pledged to make it easier for Turkey to repay its
foreign military sales credits and also pledged to improve trade
relations between the two countries.
   It was not made public what kind of negotiations took place
before the Turkish government's decision to approve the agreement.
   The 1980 agreement expired in 1985, and it was extended until
1990 last March following intense negotiations.
   Legally, the agreement goes into force after confirmation by the
Cabinet and publication in the official gazette.
   The announcement said the gazette will publish the government's
decision on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   The United States lodged a protest with
the government for failing to protect a U.S. Navy supply ship
during an anti-American demonstration on the island of Crete, an
embassy spokesman said Saturday.
   Four islanders and two American sailors from the supply ship
Saturn were injured during Wednesday's dockside demostration at
Heraklion harbor. The ship, which sailed Thursday, called at the
port to pick up fresh fruit and vegetables for the 6th Fleet in the
Mediterranean.
   ``The U.S. Embassy has issued a protest over the lack of
security afforded during the incident,'' said the embassy
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman said the protest was delivered to the Greek
Foreign Ministry Friday by embassy Charge d'Affairs Ed Cohen.
   More than 1,000 demonstrators gathered at the port, sprayed
``Americans Go Home'' in red paint on the ship's side, cut and set
fire to a mooring cable, and hurled rocks, bottles and flares.
   Demonstrators claimed that sailors aboard the Saturn tossed the
bottles, rocks and other objects back into the crowd. The protest
was organized by a local peace group opposed to the American
military presence on Crete.
   ``The government is waiting ... for the Heraklion port
authority's report based on which a reply will be given,'' said
government spokesman Yiannis Roubatis.
   He said that if the findings cast blame ``on the behavior of the
American ship's crew during the demonstration, a protest will be
made to the American side.''
   There is an American Air Force base near Heraklion as well as
air and naval facilities for American warships at Souda Bay in
western Crete.

   An Aeroflot airliner carrying 51 people crashed on
a Siberian runway and burst into flames as it finished the final
leg of a cross-country trip, killing and injuring passengers, Tass
said.
   The Soviet news agency quoted a local aviation official as
saying the Tu-134 ``fell within the airfield boundaries, broke up
and caught fire'' at the city of Surgut, an oil and petrochemical
center on the Ob River about 1,400 miles east of Moscow.
   ``Unfortunately, there were victims,'' Tass said. An earlier
report said: ``There is loss of life.''
   Tass said the Tu-134 was carrying 45 passengers and six crew
members, but did not specify how many people were killed and
injured in the crash, which occurred shortly after 4 a.m. Moscow
time.
   It was the third reported fatal crash of a commercial jetliner
in the Soviet Union this year.
   Fire engines and rescue vehicles were at the crash site within
two minutes and were giving first aid to the injured, Tass quoted
the local deputy chief of civil aviation, Yuri Evreinov, as saying.
   Tass said 15 emergency vehicles were sent to the Surgut airport
to evacuate victims, who were taken to two hospitals.
   Eight doctors also were brought in from the regional center of
Tyumen, Tass said.
   Tass said the 1,600-mile flight originated in the Byelorussian
capital of Minsk, with stops in the Volga basin industrial city of
Kuibyshev and Tyumen, a Siberian oil city, before a final scheduled
landing in Surgut, a city of more than 150,000 people located in
western Siberia.
   The Tu-134 is a twin-turbofan plane designed for short- and
medium-range flights, and can carry from 80 to 96 passengers,
according to Jane's All the World's Aircraft.
   The causes of the crash are being investigated by a special
government commission, Tass said.
   ``The weather this morning was good, communications with the
plane solid,'' Evreinov was quoted as saying. ``But then the
unforeseen happened.''
   Tass said the Soviet government had conveyed its condolences to
people injured in the crash and to the families of the dead.
   In the past, the Soviet Union rarely reported its plane crashes,
but Deputy Civil Aviation Minister Ivan Vasin told The Associated
Press last fall that Aeroflot would begin publishing reports on its
accidents this year.
   The policy change was clearly linked to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness, on some social
issues.
   On Jan. 18, a Tu-154 passenger jet crashed on landing at the
Caspian Sea port of Krasnovodsk, and Soviet media said 11 people
were killed and 12 hurt.
   Those media reports, which were issued on the day of the crash,
marked the first time the state-run Soviet press and broadcast
media reported on a domestic air accident the same day it occurred.
   On Jan. 25, an Aeroflot Yakovlev-40 tri-turbofan passenger plane
crashed near the airport in the Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk.
Tass at the time said the crash caused ``loss of life,'' but did
not say how many people had died.
   Vladimir Y. Potemkin, deputy chief of flight services at the
Ministry of Civil Aviation, told a news conference earlier this
month that a total of 47 people were killed last year in accidents
involving Aeroflot planes.

   The State Department formally protested to the
Nicaraguan government Saturday after two U.S. diplomats were
threatened and one was roughed up by a crowd of policemen
participating in a parade in Managua, the department said.
   Nicaraguan ambassador Carlos Tunnermann was summoned to the
State Department to receive ``a stiff formal protest'' about the
incident, which occurred on Friday, according to a department
statement.
   The statement said two American diplomats were watching a rally
commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution,
when they were noticed by members of the Ministry of the Interior's
uniformed police force.
   After a high-ranking ministry official identified the two
diplomats as Americans, five uniformed policemen grabbed one of the
U.S. diplomats, pinned his arms and hoisted him in the air, the
department said.
   Other officers intervened to stop the five, but a crowd of more
than 100 other ministry officers surrounded the Americans and
screamed at them for five minutes, according to the department. It
said the diplomats then departed.

   Park Yong-shik can shed his toupee now
that Chun Doo-hwan is no longer president.
   The popular television actor says he had to wear a hairpiece
during Chun's seven-year term because he bears a striking
resemblance to the balding former president, who was succeeded
Thursday by Roh Tae-woo.
   Park, 44, said he was banned from appearing on state-run
television in 1981 without explanation. Park said he learned later
it was because he resembled the Chun.
   Authorities in 1982 accepted his proposal to wear a toupee and
grow a beard to change his appearance, he said. However, he lost
important roles in soap operas and other programs and only received
minor parts in historical dramas.
   ``I hope such a comic thing will never happen again,'' Park said
Friday.

<HEAD>Pandas' Bamboo Shortage Crisis Improving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's giant pandas, in danger of extinction
since 1983 when their dietary staple of bamboo began to wither, are
over the worst of the crisis, China's top forestry official was
quoted Saturday as saying.
   Forestry Minister Gao Dezhan said new bamboo has started to grow
in the pandas' three native provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and
Gansu, the official People's Daily reported.
   But he said the threat to the pandas is not over because the
animals don't generally like young bamboo.
   Gao called on the leaders of the three provinces to continue to
guard the pandas' safety. The officials met Friday in Beijing to
discuss the situation.
   At the meeting, Gao called for strict punishment, including the
death penalty, for hunters who capture or kill giant pandas.
   China's panda population, now just under 1,000, has been
declining for the past five years in part because a rare flowering
cycle of the arrow bamboo caused more than 275,000 tons of the
plant to wither and die.
   Eleven men were sentenced earlier this week to prison terms
ranging from three years to life for killing two giant pandas in
Sichuan province.

   The governing Liberal Democratic Party will not
accept a United States request that Japan lift restrictions on
imported beef and oranges within two years, a party official was
quoted as saying Saturday.
   Michio Watanabe, chairman of the party's Policy Affairs Research
Council, told a news conference that Japan instead would offer the
United States an increase in import quotas, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   ``There are people in the United States saying many things, but
we don't accept them,'' it quoted him as saying in reference to
U.S. demands that imports of oranges and beef be liberalized.
   Party officials were not immediately available Saturday to
confirm the report.
   On Thursday, a senior Economic Planning Agency official
predicted that Japanese import restrictions on beef would be lifted
within two years, with a lifting of restrictions on citrus fruit
coming even sooner.
   Japan has been under pressure from the United States and
Australia to open its beef and citrus markets, with an agreement
governing imports of the two products due to expire in March.
   But the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has
opposed liberalization, arguing that it is unfair to single out
Japan and pointing to restrictions that the United States maintains
on beef imports.
   Japanese officials have said the quotas are neccessary to
protect Japanese farmers.
   The current agreement between Japan and the United States called
for Japan to increase its beef import quotas from 141,000 tons a
year in 1984 to 177,000 tons by 1988, and its orange quotas by
1,100 tons each year until 1988. The level was 82,000 tons in 1984,
when the agreement was signed.

   Whether belching with smoke or strangely
silent, the mills of this once-mighty steel valley have been a
magnet for visiting notables over the decades.
   Britain's Prince Edward, later King Edward VII, toured the
area's mills and factories during his visit to the United States in
1860.
   Prince Don Gelasio Caetani, ambassador from Italy to the United
States, visited the mills of nearby Homestead in 1923. Sweden's
Prince Bertil followed in 1938.
   ``The bold energy and ceaseless inventive imagination displayed
by your industry seems to me to be the surest token of success for
the future,'' Prince Bertil said.
   Even Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, traveling through the
United States prior to a 1959 summit meeting with President
Eisenhower, toured a factory with his wife.
   Krushchev startled everyone when he gave his watch to a
steelworker who had offered him a cigar.
   Constantine, crown prince of Greece, saw a mill during a brief
visit to Pittsburgh in 1959. King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand
and his queen toured a plant the following year.
   The latest member of royalty to venture into the Monongahela
River Valley just south of Pittsburgh will be Britain's Prince
Charles. He doesn't plan to tour any steel mills, but will travel
past them on his way to a meeting with urban experts in Homestead
on Friday.
   Although the steel industry has declined precipitously,
Homestead Acting Mayor Joseph Little, like most everybody else
around this town of 5,000, is proud of the crowd his valley has
drawn.
   ``Homestead was a great town. It still is a great town,'' Little
said. ``We've just got to get something going for us. There won't
be any harm done as far as Prince Charles coming in.''

   Nebraska's first man, Bill Orr, serenaded his
wife, Gov. Kay Orr, and ConAgra Inc. chairman Mike Harper imitated
Gen. George Patton at the annual Omaha Press Club gridiron show.
   Harper stood before a huge American flag and poked fun at
taxpayers for helping foot the bill for an economic development
package that ConAgra said was needed to keep the giant food
processing company from leaving the state.
   Harper wore an Army helmet emblazoned with the ConAgra logo and
sang a takeoff on ``America the Beautiful.''
   ``Stand tall,'' Harper said. ``This country was built by people
who don't like to pay taxes.
   He said Nebraska's tax structure allows him to ``spend more on
the worthwhile things in life _ computers and company jets.''
   Orr, joined on-stage by his wife, sang in a love song that he
would stay with his wife if she decided to seek a second term.
   About 1,500 people attended the Friday's show, a musical review
poking fun at news events of the past year.
   The show, a benefit for journalism scholarships, was dedicated
to the late U.S. Sen. Edward Zorinsky, who collapsed and died after
performing at last year's show.

   The lion's owner, India Tucker, said her husband, Billie, shot

   Nicole was taken to Medical Center Hospital where she was
treated for multiple bites on her left arm and shoulder. The child

   Porn star Illona Staller, a member of
the Italian Parliament and candidate for the European Parliament,
was detained for 16 hours Saturday by police who accused her of
indecent exposure.
   Ms. Staller, known as Cicciolina, decided to cancel another
performance in Brussels and leave Belgium, said an organizer of her
tour. He quoted her as saying, ``I leave free but disapointed.''
   The nude performer was arrested early Saturday at the end of her
first night club appearance in Brussels after leaving the stage, a
police spokesman said. The spokesman, not identified in line with
police policy, said Cicciolina had overstepped the bounds of
decency, according to Belgian standards, and that she had been
warned in advance.
   She was taken to Brussels police headquarters and was released
at 6 p.m.
   Her spokesman said she had decided to interrupt her tour, which
included one more appearance in Brussels Saturday night and shows
in other cities, and to return to Italy.
   She also was making the tour to promote her candidacy for the
European Parliament in the 1989 election and to speak out in favor
of sexual freedom, said her spokesman, who talked with reporters on
the condition he not be identified.
   She was elected to the Italian Parliament last year as a
representative for the Radical Party. Marco Pannella, former
chairman of the party, said in a statement released here that the
police acted against her because she is a member of the Italian
Parliament.
   He said her arrest was ``obscene, not her show which I did not
see and in which I am not interested.'' He added he would protest
laws and regulations ``which hurt common sense and human rights.''
   The police spokesman declined to say if Cicciolina had been
asked to leave the country or if charges might be filed.
   A spokesman for the German airline Lufthansa said Ms. Staller
left Brussels on a flight to Frankfurt at 6:35 p.m.

   Reports from Armenia's capital indicated the city
was calm Saturday, but a U.S.-based group claimed some Armenians
remained camped in a tent city in the region where several days of
mass protests had been held.
   A hotel manager in Yerevan, reached by telephone from Moscow,
said, ``Everything is quiet'' in the capital city where at least
five days of street protests brought an appeal by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for restraint.
   A telephone operator in Yerevan also said the demonstrations had
ended. Efforts to contact Armenian nationalist leaders were
unsuccessful. Both the operator and the hotel manager spoke on
condition they not be identified.
   There was no direct word on the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh,
the autonomous region where members of the ethnic Armenian majority
began the demonstrations to protest the Soviet Communist Party's
rejection of a proposal to give the region back to Armenia. It has
been designated part of the neighboring republic of Azerbaidzhan
since 1923.
   Most telephone calls to Yerevan have been cut off since the
demonstrations began, and foreign reporters have been prevented
from traveling to the small republic on the Turkish border.
   Gorbachev's appeal, read on Armenian and Azerbaidzhanian radio
and television Friday by a Central Committee official, was
accompanied by a pledge from local party officials to ask the
Moscow-based Communist Party Central Committee to reconsider the
territorial issue.
   Reports from Armenia said that after the appeal, the
demonstrators in Yerevan, said by some to have numbered up to 1
million, began to disperse.
   A Washington-based group calling itself the Armenian National
Committee of America quoted telephone reports from the region as
saying Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert, had been turned
into a tent city by Armenian villagers from the countryside.
   The group claimed Azerbaidzhanis had killed 70 Armenians in the
region and that Soviet troops were stationed around Stepanakert to
prevent further ethnic violence. There have been other reports of
deaths in the region, but they have not been confirmed.
   Relations between Azerbaidzhan, a predominantly Moslem republic,
and mainly Christian Armenia have been tense for some time. Last
week, there were disturbances in the contested autonomous region,
where the population is three-quarters Armenian, and they spread to
Yerevan.
   The protests brought concessions from regional Communist Party
leaders. They named a 56-year-old Armenian, Genrikh Pogosyan, to
head the party in Nagorno-Karabakh, replacing Boris Kevorkov who
also is an ethnic Armenian but apparently less popular than
Pogosyan.

<HEAD>Snow In The East, Rain In South And West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Showers were scattered across parts of the Northeast on
Saturday, while rain fell in parts of the South and California.
   Snow showers extended from southern New York state and northern
New Jersey across Pennsylvania, northeastern West Virginia,
northeastern Ohio and eastern Lower Michigan.
   Two inches of snow had fallen since Friday at the
Allentown-Bethleham-Easton Airport in eastern Pennsylvania, and
there were reports of up to 4 inches of snow in the Poconos of
northeastern Pennsylvania, the National Weather Service said.
Syracuse, N.Y., got 2 inches in the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST.
   Snow mixed with rain fell across Delaware.
   Rain fell in west-central and northern California and
north-central Arizona.
   Rain amounts in northern California were light, but the weather
service said that had it not rained through Monday, the San
Francisco Bay area would have tied a no-rain February record that
was set in 1864.
   ``It's so dry now that even when we get rain it will take a few
days to get soaked in so we can get some runoff,'' said Gayle
Montgomery, spokesman for the East Bay Municipal Utility District.
He said water rationing was not out of the question if the dry
conditions continue.
   Rain also fell in central Mississippi and eastern Virginia.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 25
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 79 at both Kingsville and McAllen,
Texas. The early-morning low for the day was 14 degrees below zero
at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered snow was forecast across Upper Michigan.
Showers were forecast in northern and central California, into the
Tahoe Basin of western Nevada.
   High in the 20s were predicted in Upper Michigan and northern
through west-central New England; in the 30s and 40s from the
remainder of New England and the Great Lakes across the Ohio
Valley, the Atlantic states through Virginia, the upper Mississippi
Valley, much of the Dakotas, and northeastern Montana; in the 70s
to low 80s in southern Florida, much of Louisiana, from southern
Kansas across much of Texas, and in southern California and the
desert Southwest; and in the 50s and 60s in most of the rest of the
nation.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecutor Walsh Eager To Pursue Meese Pipeline Memo</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 1 graf with names of people expected to be indicted</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A memo central to independent counsel James C.
McKay's investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III has also
provided an intriguing new lead for Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence
E. Walsh.
   The Sept. 25, 1985 memo was written to Meese by his old friend,
E. Robert Wallach, about a proposed Middle East oil pipeline.
Wallach accurately describes Israel's help in arranging the U.S.
arms-for-hostages swap with Iran just 10 days earlier. And that
swap is central to Walsh's probe.
   The memo provides the first link between the pipeline affair and
the Iran-Contra episode, and may provide clues to the motivations
and knowledge of key players in each. And it is likely to provoke
yet another appearance by Meese before Walsh's grand jury.
   In an operation then known only to a handful of high U.S.
officials, Israel brokered the sale of 504 TOW missiles to Iran for
$6 million and provided a transfer point for arms shipments on Aug.
20 and Sept. 15 _ the day the Rev. Benjamin Weir was released by
his pro-Iranian captors in Lebanon.
   McKay, who is investigating Meese's involvement in Wallach's
efforts to win U.S. government financial support for the pipeline
project, recently turned the memo over to Walsh, the independent
counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, according to
government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In the ``For Your Eyes, Only'' memo, Wallach reported to Meese
that Bruce Rappaport, a Swiss businessman who was promoting the $1
billion pipeline project, ``indicates that (then-Israeli Premier
Shimon) Peres emphatically indicated that the release of Weir was a
result of the efforts of the state of Israel and no one else.''
   ``He indicated that they would also arrange for the release of
the remaining six (American hostages). There is a feeling that the
U.S. `owes' and that the accomplishment of this project, as
outlined in my memo, is appropriate,'' Wallach wrote.
   Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer, goes on to say the Israelis are
``a bit frustrated as to why the U.S.G. (U.S. government) has not
more directly facilitated the accomplishment'' of the pipeline
project. Rappaport was seeking U.S. support to ensure that Israel
would not attack the pipeline, which was to have run from Iraq
through Jordan near the Israeli border to the Gulf of Aqaba.
   McKay is trying to determine whether a reference in the memo to
the proposed payment of $650-$700 million in pipeline proceeds over
10 years to Israel and Peres' Labor Party should have alerted Meese
to a possible violation of a law that prohibits bribery of foreign
officials.
   Meese has said he does not remember reading in detail the
section dealing with the proposed payments, which immediately
precedes the reference to Israel's role in obtaining Weir's release.
   Walsh is likely to question Meese and Wallach about whether
there was any ``quid pro quo'' between Israel's role in the
arms-for-hostage deal and any U.S. government financial support for
the pipeline _ which was never built.
   The September, 1985 memo's description of a key Israeli role in
the arms-for-hostage deal appears to undercut Meese's congressional
testimony last year that he did not learn of Israel's involvement
until November, 1986.
   Walsh received a copy of Wallach's memo just as he was preparing
to put final touches on indictments likely to be returned in the
coming weeks against key participants in the arms sale to Iran and
diversion of proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. Though Walsh's
staff is eager to pursue the new lead, no delay is expected in
those indictments.
   Charges are expected to be brought against former National
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, his former aide, Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North, and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.

<HEAD>Three Italian Hostages Released By Kurdish Captors In Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-Iranian Kurdish group released three Italian
engineers Saturday who were taken hostage in Iraq last fall, to
protest Italian warships in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Ministry
reported.
   It said an Italian doctor determined the three were in fair
condition when they were turned over to Italian diplomatic
officials in Baiji, Iraq, about 125 miles north of Baghdad.
   The Foreign Ministry said the three were released because of its
``intense and discreet'' efforts, but did not elaborate.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980, and Italy
along with the United Staters and several other countries have sent
warships to the Persian Gulf to search for mines and defend their
flagged oil tankers and other cargo vessels from attack. Both Iran
and Iraq have attacked neutral shipping in the gulf.
   State-run RAI television said Saturday that the former hostages,
Sergio Cominetti, Giuseppe Carrara and Robert Diotallevi, were en
route to Baghdad.
   A group calling itself the Iraqi Kurdish National Union had
claimed responsibility last fall for the kidnappings.
   It said in a statement released in Lebanon that its members took
Cominetti hostage in mid-September and kidnapped the other two in
early October to protest ``Italian aid to the Iraqi regime and
Italian military presence'' in the gulf.
   The three worked for Italian electrical engineering companies on
projects in Iraq.

   Two days before the scheduled start of his
Senate impeachment trial, Gov. Evan Mecham said he was preparing to
ask a federal court to halt it, saying he feared his constitutional
rights would be trampled in ``a lynch-mob atmosphere.''
   ``As governor of this state I ask nothing more than is accorded
to any garden variety criminal,'' the Republican governor told
reporters at a news conference.
   ``Is this a Star Chamber or will we proceed under the
time-tested constitutional mandate'' that guarantees due process,
Mecham said.
   Mecham said he was preparing to ``seek federal redress on
whatever level is appropriate.''
   The Senate is scheduled to begin his impeachment trial Monday
morning, and Mecham said he and his two new attorneys were prepared
to be there if no court ordered the trial halted beforehand.
   His attorney, Thomas Crowe, said he had not decided which
federal court he would go to to seek a stay or a halt to the trial.
The decision might not come until after the trial begins but would
be made by Wednesday at the latest, Crowe said.
   The state Supreme Court refused Friday to grant a temporary stay
and said it would decide Tuesday whether the impeachment trial
should be delayed until after Mecham's March 22 criminal trial on
charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. Mecham also faces a
May 17 recall election.
   Mecham called the news conference Friday night, and some
legislators had speculated that he might resign Saturday to avoid
having to go through the publicity of a Senate trial, then run in
the recall election to regain his office.
   If convicted in the criminal trial, he would be unable to enter
the runoff, but he would be able to compete if the trial were
delayed or he won an acquittal.
   The governor told reporters that while a resignation might help
him personally, it would have ``terrible effects'' on other people.
   ``My resignation would write a bad chapter in the history of
Arizona that would be giving in to the powers who have schemed and
planned to put so much pressure on me that I would eventually
resign,'' he said.
   Mecham hired Crowe and Washington, D.C., attorney Jerris Leonard
last week, leading to the surprise resignation of Mecham attorney
Murray Miller.
   Miller said Friday that Leonard had admitted to him earlier in
the week that he was not prepared to defend the governor Monday and
that to do so would be ``malpractice.''
   However, Mecham said Saturday his attorneys would ``drink enough
coffee'' and prepare through the weekend to be ready Monday.
   Mecham complained that Senate attorney John Lundin argued before
the Supreme Court on Friday that the Senate did not have to grant
the governor many of the same constitutional rights he would
receive in criminal court.
   ``That there is a lynch-mob atmosphere in Arizona is apparent,''
he said.
   Some lawmakers questioned Saturday whether any federal judge
would be willing to grant a stay to block the Senate trial.
   ``It defies my belief that there could be one, given the
doctrine of separation of powers,'' said state Sen. Greg Lunn, a
Republican who has opposed Mecham. ``Were there to be one, I
presume we would have to make a decision whether we would comply or
not.''
   Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, said Saturday it
would be up to the 30 senators to decide if they would abide by any
federal court stay.
   ``We've got to get going,'' said Senate Minority Leader Alan
Stephens, a Democrat. ``The people of Arizona deserve a fair break
and the fair break is that the trial moves forward.''
   The House impeached Mecham on Feb. 5 on charges of concealing
the $350,000 loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol
fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat.
   Secretary of State Rose Mofford, a Democrat, became acting
governor when Mecham was impeached and would take over as governor
in the event of a resignation or conviction in either impeachment
or criminal court.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin has issued an opinion saying he
believes that even if Mecham resigned or were convicted, the recall
election would have to be held and Mrs. Mofford would be subject to
removal from office. Because of the way the Constitution is
written, a recall is aimed at the office, not the officeholder,
Corbin said.
   However, Stephens said that if Mrs. Mofford became governor
before the recall vote, he expected a court to be asked to decide
if a recall vote was necessary.

   A newly combative Michael Dukakis challenged
Richard Gephardt repeatedly in campaign debate Saturday to defend
his vote for the 1981 Reaganomics tax cut, and said Albert Gore
``has never run a government.''
   Gephardt said ``you bet'' he was proud to slash taxes on average
Americans and retorted that Dukakis had raised taxes repeatedly in
Massachusetts.
   Gore said Dukakis has no foreign policy experience. ``We've seen
the consequences in the last seven years of having the president
who needed on the job training in foreign policy,'' he said,
referring to the Iran-Contra affair.
   The sharp exchanges highlighted the political stakes involved in
the campaign debate 10 days before the critical round of Southern
and border state presidential primaries _ in the very hall where
Democrats will gather this summer to select their nominee for the
White House in 1988.
   Dukakis and former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado also criticized
Gephardt's trade legislation, the Massachusetts governor declaring
that it was dead in Congress.
   ``I don't know that. Where did you hear that?'' said Gephardt.
   ``It's burial has been postponed until after Super Tuesday in
deference to the next of kin,'' responded Dukakis.
   The Massachusetts governor, hoping to win enough Southern votes
to complement his primary victories in New England and the Midwest,
also sought to pre-empt Jesse Jackson's anti-drug crusade. ``As
president I hope I can organize a national alliance against drugs''
with the help of governors, he said.
   The debate blended good humor, earnest politicking and attacks
on the Reagan administration as well as the sharp exchanges.
   Jackson, bidding to expand his base beyond his natural black
constiuency, said, ``I'm a proud son of the South.'' And, as he has
before, he sought to play peacemaker. ``My fear is that in this ...
debate, we'll be kind of like a cross-eyed archer shooting arrows
past the people,'' he said after Dukakis and Gephardt clashed.
   Gore, a Tennessee senator hoping to jump-start his campaign in
his native region after poor performances in earlier contests, made
favorable references to former President Carter and Georgia Sen.
Sam Nunn as he stressed his Southern credentials. ``I served my
country in Vietnam. I've run a farm,'' he said.
   Hart, who announced earlier in the day he would stay in the race
at least through Super Tuesday even though his chances of winning
the nomination were remote, chided Gore for voting for the MX
missile and jabbed Gephardt for his vote on the tax bill.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who has virtually stopped
campaigning in the Southern states, assailed Gephardt as well for
voting in favor of the 1981 tax bill and the 1986 tax overhaul
bill, which he said was a ``monster.''
   Overall, the debate demonstrated a highly combative side to
Dukakis' campaign personality that he had previously kept under
wraps.
   The governor has been attacked in recent weeks by Gore and
Gephardt. Rather than responding sharply he has issued a series of
increasingly stern warnings that he would fight back if provoked
again.
   This time, he went after his rivals first.
   ``You proud of that? I want to know,'' Dukakis said as he
pressed Gephardt on his vote in favor of the 1981 tax cut bill.
   ``I'm proud to cut taxes for the average American,'' Gephardt
responded as Dukakis repeatedly pressed him.
   The subject turned to Dukakis' performance as governor of
Massachusetts.
   ``I've cut taxes five times in the last four years,'' he said.
   Said Gephardt, ``But you've raised taxes about 10 times.''
   Shot back Dukakis, ``No, I haven't.''
   The exchange seemed to be over, when Dukakis said, ``Let the
record show that Congressman Gephardt apologized all over Iowa for
that vote before he came down South.''
   Gephardt, determined to have the last word, said, ``You've got
the record wrong.''
   Dukakis took the fight to Gore, as well.
   ``Al Gore has never run a government, never balanced a budget,
never had to pick a Cabinet,'' he said, adding that the only time
the Tennessee senator negotiated anythng, it was a compromise on
arms control with the Reagan administration and he ``got taken to
the cleaners.''
   But Gore said Dukakis had raised questions about his own foreign
policy competence by suggesting that he might accept a Soviet
client state in Central America or withdraw U.S. troops from South
Korea in response to human rights abuses.
   The other disputes in the 90-minute confrontation paled by
comparison, although they lurked everywhere.
   Jackson jabbed at Dukakis' plan for increased tax collection by
saying, ``We cannot just be the IRS agents for Reaganomics and
collect uncollected taxes ... Reaganomics is fundamentally in
error.''
   Hart criticized Israel's crackdown on the West Bank and
challenged his other rivals to say the same.
   Said Jackson: ``I said it first.''
   After the debate ended, Dukakis responded to Gore's charges that
he lacked foreign policy experience. ``It's kind of silly for any
one of us to say we've got superior experience to be president,''
he said.
   But Gore said: ``I thought Mike Dukakis demonstrated the danger
of trying to learn foreign policy in a two-day cram course at the
Kennedy School of Government in Boston.''
   And Gephardt said that for those who opposed the 1981 tax cut
and the 1986 tax reform ``the only conclusion you can draw is
you're for taxes.''
   The Republican presidential contenders arranged a debate on the
same stage Sunday.
   Fourteen Southern and border states, including every state of
the South except South Carolina, hold primaries on March 8.
Together with the six non-Southern states, nearly one-third of the
nominating delegates in both parties are at stake.

   Thirty pilot whales perished after they
beached on the Gulf of California coast. A biologist said Saturday
the cause of death was unknown but the mass beaching of pilot
whales is a natural phenomenon.
   ``They are whales that normally beach in large groups,'' said
Luis Fleischer, a program director of the federal Fishing
Department, in a telephone interview from Baja California.
   He said the 26 male and four female whales beached about five
days ago along a three-mile stretch of Northern Baja California's
gulf coastline.
   ``They all are dead now and in an advanced state of
decomposition,'' Fleischer said.
   Adult pilot whales are about 9-15 feet long.
   Fleischer said the area is about 155 miles north of the zone
where the government intends to declare a land and sea wildlife
preserve. The preserve is intended to protect the gray whale, a
once nearly extinct species, which reproduces in the lagoons on
Baja California's Pacific coast.
   ``It has nothing to do with the reserve,'' Fleischer said of the
deaths of the pilot whales. The reserve is in Southern Baja
California state.
   The biologist said research would be done to determine if
weather conditions or what other reasons might be responsible for
the beaching.
   The newspaper Excelsior quoted Augusto Ferrer MacGregor, a
representative for the Fishing Department in Northern Baja
California, as saying that for the past two months about 1,000
pilot whales have been in the area where the beaching took place.

   The successful 1,000th test firing this
past week of a main space shuttle engine at NASA's National Space
Technology Laboratories shows the engine's reliability, officials
say.
   ``This 1,000th test is a milestone,'' NSTL Director Jerry Hlass
said.
   The test was conducted Thursday night for a duration of 9
minutes, 33 seconds.
   ``Engine 0211 is being checked out ... and early indications
show the test firing was a succcess,'' Boyce Mix, the engine test
manager at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said
Friday.
   Space shuttle main engine testing has been conducted at NSTL
since June 1975.
   ``Last year at NSTL, there was a record number of engine tests
in terms of test duration _ 33,738 seconds, the equivalent time the
engines would be required to perform for 22 shuttle launches,''
Hlass said. ``Our team is working very diligently to do its part in
returning the shuttle to safe flight.''
   Thursday night's test was the 11th conducted this year, said
Mack Herring, NSTL public affairs officer.
   Each shuttle orbiter is powered by three main engines, which
operate for the first 8.5 minutes of flight to propel the shuttle
to the point of near-earth orbit.
   All main engines used for shuttle missions are test-fired three
times before they are transported by truck to the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.
   The testing is conducted by the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell
International, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
prime contractor for the shuttle engines.

   A 90-year-old man has been accused of killing his
bride of less than a week during an argument over whether the
newlyweds should take a honeymoon cruise, police said Saturday.
   Vincenzo Quinto was booked on a charge of second-degree murder,
said Metro-Dade police spokesman Rey Valdes. Quinto was admitted to
a jail ward at Jackson Memorial Hospital because of his age, Valdes
added.
   Ana Quinto, 76, died Friday of ``blunt trauma to the head,''
Valdes said.
   Detective Pat Diaz said the couple met four months ago and
married one week ago Saturday. Quinto had moved to Miami a few
years ago after retiring from his job as a contractor in New York.
   Police on duty Saturday did not know if it was Quinto or his
wife who wanted to take a cruise.

   A black woman was attacked by two white men
who smeared her with excrement, painted markings on her face and
clipped her hair, police said Saturday.
   The injured woman was hospitalized for 12 days after the
incident earlier this month, police said. They said they were
unsure whether it was a ``copycat'' attack patterned after the
highly publicized case of a black girl in Wappingers Falls, N.Y.
   That girl, Tawana Brawley, 16, was found last November wrapped
in a plastic garbage bag and covered with excrement. The word
``nigger'' and ``KKK'' were scrawled on her body and she said she
had been sexually assaulted by six white men. Some of her hair also
had been chopped off.
   About 600 demonstrators marched peacefully through Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., Saturday to protest the treatment of Miss Brawley and the
stalled investigation of the assault.
   ``We come to you with hate in our eyes,'' said lawyer Alton
Maddox Jr., addressing Gov. Mario Cuomo rhetorically. ``We come to
you with hate in our hearts. You are not talking to
foot-shufflers.''
   The protest leaders have been calling on Cuomo to remove state
Attorney General Robert Abrams from the case. Cuomo had named
Abrams as a special prosecutor to investigate the case after two
local prosecutors claimed conflicts of interest.
   The leaders want a new, permanent prosecutor named for statewide
race-related crimes. They have said the victim and her family won't
cooperate with the investigation until then.
   The case has grown into a cause celebre among some civil rights
activists, and actor Bill Cosby posted a reward for information in
the investigation.
   In the Newton case, the victim was attacked Feb. 8 in a
stairwell outside her downtown apartment. She was not sexually
assaulted, police said.
   Police Detective John Tomasula said he believes the attack was
racially motivated because of statements the men made to the
victim. Tomasula declined to disclose what they said. The
assailants were believed to be in their 20s.
   Police believe the assault was not premeditated against the
woman, Hildegard Smith.
   ``I'm sure if anyone went down (the stairwell), something was
going to happen,'' Tomasula said. ``She was in the wrong place at
the wrong time and they just took advantage of her.''
   Ms. Smith, 50, was treated for trauma for 12 days at Newton
Memorial Hospital, said the Rev. William Sadler, one of the leaders
of a community coalition.
   The coalition, made up of mostly white clergy and civic leaders,
is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest
of the assailants.
   Ms. Smith's family last week gave permission for the coalition
to disclose her name and condition to help catch her attackers,
Sadler said.
   ``We wanted the people to know what had happened,'' he said.
``We wanted to support the woman and wanted to bring the whole
community together to say we don't want this kind of thing to
happen.''

<HEAD>Democratic Rivals Pound Gephardt For Trade Position</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Democrats Debate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt's Democratic presidential
rivals wrote an obituary for his trade policies Saturday, but
Michael Dukakis said ``burial has been postponed until after Super
Tuesday in deference to the next of kin.''
   Gephardt, whose legislation would penalize foreign countries
that have trade surpluses with the United States, told his
opponents during a campaign debate that his measure seeks to
discourage other countries from being protectionist.
   The House included Gephardt's provision in the sweeping trade
bill, but no such language appears in the Senate's version of the
legislation.
   House-Senate negotiators say they are unlikely to take action on
the proposal until after the Super Tuesday primaries March 8. Most
participants say they expect Gephardt's amendment to be changed.
   ``The Gephardt amendment is dead,'' Dukakis told the Missouri
congressman during one exchange. ``You know that.''
   ``I don't know that, Mike,'' Gephardt responded. ``Where did you
hear that?''
   ``It's burial has been postponed until after Super Tuesday in
deference to the next of kin, but it's dead,'' the Massachusetts
governor said to laughter from the audience.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said it would be ``false and
misleading'' to imply that unfair trading practices by other
countries account for more than 10 to 15 percent of the U.S. trade
deficit.
   ``The real answer is not just bashing other countries,'' said
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``The real answer is having an effective
president who understands the issue and then moves.''
   Moments later, former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado said, ``The
worst idea put forward in this campaign is protectionism.''
   He said Gephardt's amendment ``will lead us toward a trade war,
at least increase the likelihood of that trade war, which in turn
could trigger market crashes and depressions.''
   ``Gary, your thinking is stuck in the past,'' Gephardt said.
   ``Yours is,'' said Hart, as the two men, seated side by side,
pointed fingers at each other.
   ``Why do we continually apologize for unfair trade practices by
other countries ... ,'' Gephardt asked. ``All I'm saying is let's
stand up for the fairness for our people.''

   Leaders of Jordan and Syria told
Secretary of State George P. Shultz Saturday that his proposals for
a Middle East settlement were unacceptable.
   ``We did not reach any agreement,'' Shultz said after a
three-hour meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad, which
followed a similarly unsuccessful meeting in Jordan.
   ``We expressed our opinion in an open and frank way. No
agreement was reached,'' said Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa who also met with Shultz.
   After arriving back in Jerusalem late Saturday, Shultz said he
had not given up hope on his plan.
   ``The idea in negotiations of this kind is to get people to be
realistic,'' Shultz said. ``We are not there yet.''
   He resumes his attempts to gain acceptance of accelerated
negotiations on Palestinian self-rule on Sunday in talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres. Shultz then flies to Cairo to try to enlist the support of
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   Shultz's failure to reach an agreement Saturday centered around
the involvement of the Soviet Union and the Palestine Liberation
Organization in negotiations for peace.
   Jordan and Syria, which has close relations with Moscow, want
the PLO and the Soviets to participate in an international
conference on peace in the Middle East. The United States and
Israel want to exclude the PLO and to limit Soviet influence.
   U.S. policy forbids American diplomats to meet ranking PLO
officials because the U.S. adminstration regards the PLO as a
terrorist organization.
   Sharaa said the Syrians had listened carefully to Shultz's ideas.
   ``A solution to the problem of the Middle East cannot be reached
without the elimination of the Israeli occupation of all occupied
Arab territories and safeguarding of Palestinian national rights,''
Sharaa said.
   Syria's state-run television said Assad and the U.S. secretary
discussed ``the American ideas that Shultz carried with him''
concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The U.S. plan calls for immediate talks on Palestinian self-rule
and negotiations by December on the final status of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Egypt and Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war.
   ``The Syrian side found that these ideas do not lead to a
comprehensive peace formula,'' the television said.
   After the meeting, Shultz flew back to Israel from Damascus.
   Shultz was the first U.S. secretary of state to go to Damascus
since 1983.
   The Reagan administration, accusing Syria of supporting
terrorism, attempted to isolate the country diplomatically in
October 1986.
   But Syria's influence in the Arab world and its military
strength makes it impossible to ignore when it comes to peace in
the Middle East.
   Shultz took his peace plan to Syria after running into stiff
resistance from Jordan Saturday morning.
   Jordanian Foreign Minister Taher Masri, after meeting Shultz,
also insisted on Soviet and PLO participation in the negotiations
Shultz is trying to set up.
   When Shultz arrived earlier Saturday, the official Damascus
Radio broadcast a commentary noting signs of a positive shift in
the United States' Mideast policy.
   Referring to Reagan's statements at a news conference Wednesday
night, the state radio said Reagan was looking for a comprehensive
settlement because of Palestinian unrest in Israeli-held
territories, which has left scores of Arabs dead since December.
   But the shift was obviously not enough for the Syrians.
   Shultz last saw Assad in 1983. He accused the Syrian leader of
undercutting a U.S.-backed pact between Lebanon and Israel that
year.
   Three years later, the U.S. State Department accused Syria of
involvement in at least 40 incidents of terrorism and imposed
diplomatic and economic sanctions.
   But Shultz, on his way to Israel Wednesday night, said Syrian
involvement in terrorism ``seems to have declined'' and he intended
to find out how helpful Syria might be in a Middle East settlement.
   Before Shultz's arrival, Syrian state radio had been scornful of
the U.S. mission, calling it ``nothing but a political airlift to
rescue Israel'' under pressure of Palestinian uprisings.
   Shultz is trying set up negotiations by the end of the year on a
final Arab-Israel settlement that would resolve the Palestinian
problem.
   But Israeli Prime Minister Shamir urged Shultz on Friday to move
slowly and to aim for a test period of limited Palestinian
self-rule.
   The PLO, in a statement released in Jordan hours after Shultz's
departure, said it is willing to meet U.S. officials ``on any
level,'' and said American rejection of a meeting shows the United
States is not serious about Arab-Israeli peace.

   Israeli soldiers killed three Palestinians
during clashes in the occupied territories Saturday, hospital
officials said. Police detained two American teachers carrying
posters listing the names of slain Arabs.
   Arabs burned tires and threw rocks in Jerusalem and other
Israeli cities to protest the peace mission of U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, while a group of Israelis held a rally in
support of the initiative.
   On the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, protesters
clashed with soldiers in Hebron, the nearby village of Halhoul and
an Arrub refugee camp. The army said soldiers killed two
Palestinians and wounded 15.
   Hospital officials said three people were killed, including
17-year-old Maged Al Atrash of Halhoul who died of gunshot wounds
to the abdomen late Saturday at Jerusalem's Mukassad hospital. The
doctors said 27 people were wounded.
   Soldiers fatally shot Nihad Abdul Ghafour, 20, of Arrub and
Baker Abdullah Al Bao, 17, of Halhoul, according to the hospital
officials. The deaths brought to 71 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis since the recent wave of unrest began Dec. 8.
   The army reported Saturday that a 15-month-old Jewish child
suffered a broken skull when assailants hurled a stone at his
family's car in Jerusalem in an attack Friday.
   Israel radio quoted the army's West Bank commander, Maj. Gen.
Amram Mitzna, as saying Saturday that four soldiers would be tried
in a military court on charges they beat two Arabs who were lying
on the ground and had their hands tied behind their backs.
   The soldiers were detained Friday and their commanding officer,
a captain, was suspended after CBS television filmed the beatings
Thursday in the West Bank city of Nablus and showed the footage to
Mitzna. The general also ordered the release of the two Arabs.
   The film was shown on television stations in several European
countries, and Foreign Ministry officials said Saturday that
Israeli embassies in Europe received dozens of telegrams protesting
the beatings.
   The clashes in Halhoul and Arrub began when masked youths
blocked the main Jerusalem-Hebron highway, the army said. Soldiers
fired tear gas, rubber bullets and gunshots to drive the
stone-throwers away from the highway.
   For several hours, soldiers surrounded Hebron's Alia Hospital,
firing tear gas at stone-throwing demonstrators nearby, said a
nurse, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The army imposed curfews on the areas around Hebron, but allowed
Jewish settlers to move freely, military officials said. The army
also extended curfews on four Gaza Strip refugee camps, restricting
120,000 people, or nearly 10 percent of the 1.5 million Arabs in
the occupied territories, to their homes.
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, police detained American
teachers Alison Glick, 25, of Cincinnati, and John Benvenuto, in
his 40s, of Albany, N.Y., because they allegedly possessed inciting
material, said Joost Hiltermann, a friend of the two and researcher
for the Ramallah-based civil rights group Law in the Service of Man.
   Ramallah police refused to discuss the case.
   Hiltermann said Ms. Glick and Benvenuto were detained while
walking in Ramallah and carrying posters with names of Palestinians
killed by Israelis in the past 11 weeks.
   Benvenuto and Ms. Glick, teachers at a Quaker school in
Ramallah, were not allowed to see a lawyer, said Hiltermann.
   David Good, a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in east
Jerusalem, said he was informed of the detentions but could not
elaborate.
   In Jerusalem, about 3,000 Israelis attended a rally organized by
the ``Peace Now'' movement near the home of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. Demonstrators carried banners reading `Say yes to the peace
initiative.''
   Speakers urged the government to trade land for peace, a formula
advocated by Shultz, but opposed by Shamir.
   Also in Jerusalem, Palestinian protesters blocked roads near the
Shufat refugee camp, throwing stones and burning tires. Police
dispersed the crowd with rubber bullets and arrested six protesters.
   About 3,000 police officers, double the usual number, were
deployed in Jerusalem after Palestinian organizers last week called
for stepped-up protests during the five-day Shultz visit.
   Shultz, on a mission to seek agreement on guidelines for
starting Arab-Israeli talks, met with Syrian and Jordanian leaders
in Damascus and Amman Saturday and returned to Jerusalem later in
the day.
   In northern Israel, meanwhile, hundreds of left-wing Israeli
Arabs took to the streets to protest the Shultz visit and the
Israeli crackdown on the protests. There were no reports of
violence, and police did not interfere.
   Four hundred protesters demonstrated in Umm el Fahm, a town of
30,000, the site of frequent anti-Israeli violence. In the Arab
town of Shefaram, also in northern Israel, about 300 Israeli Arabs
demonstrated.
   Since the protests began in the occupied territories, many of
Israel's 700,000 Arab citizens have expressed support for their
brethren in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEAD>Irish Banker John Guinness Killed in Mountain Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGOR, Wales (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish banker John Guinness, whose wife was
kidnapped two years ago and held captive for eight days, was
fatally injured Saturday in a 500-foot fall on Snowdon Mountain in
north Wales, police reported.
   They said Guinness, a cousin of members of the Guinness brewing
family, was accompanied on the climb by his 49-year-old wife,
Jennifer, their son Ian and three friends. Guinness, 52, plunged
from the snow-covered path as the party descended from the summit
of the 3,560-foot mountain, according to police.
   Guinness suffered multiple injuries and was airlifted off the
mountain by a Royal Air Force helicopter but was dead on arrival at
a hospital in Bangor, 10 miles away.
   A police spokesman said, ``They were ill-equipped for such a
walk bearing in mind the conditions.
   ``The weather was not particularly bad but the conditions
underfoot were very hazardous where the accident occurred.''
   The couple had three children.
   Jennifer Guinness was kidnapped from the family home near Dublin
April 8, 1986, and held captive for a ransom of two million Irish
pounds _ then $2.6 million.
   Eight days later, police besieged the hideout where she was held
and freed her without payment of the ransom.
   Her three abductors surrendered and three other people were
arrested later.
   Mrs. Guinness was praised by police for keeping calm and playing
a key role in the negotiations during the siege.
   Guinness was chairman of the Dublin merchant bank Guinness and
Mahon.
   On the day of his wife's abduction, he returned home from work
to find her and their 23-year-old daughter, Gillian, tied up. The
abductors pistol-whipped him and tied him. Two and a half hours
after they fled he managed to free himself and telephoned police.
   The Guinnesses were married in 1959. Their third child, Tania,
is in her 20s.
   Guinness was regarded as one of Ireland's finest long-distance
sailors and once sailed the Atlantic with his wife.
   He was sixth cousin of the titular head of the centuries-old
family, the third Earl of Iveagh. The earl is chairman of the world
famous brewery that bears the family name.

<HEAD>Left Wing Wins Control of Britain's Biggest Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard-line leftists won control of Britain's
largest union Saturday at a time when the union-financed Labor
Party is seeking to moderate its stance after three successive
electoral defeats.
   The Transport and General Workers Union, with 1.4 million
members nationwide, elected 23 hard-left candidates to its
39-member National Executive Council. The moderate faction
supporting Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock previously had a 21-18
majority.
   The transport workers union has a 1,250,000 block vote for the
equivalent of 20 percent of the total voting power at the Labor
Party conference and could create obstacles for reforms Kinnock is
seeking.
   Welsh-born Kinnock, 45, who took over the leadership in 1983,
waged a polished campaign in the June 1987 general election but
still lost resoundingly to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservatives.
   At the Labor Party conference in September, Kinnock told the
delegates the 87-year-old party must ``face the realities of
changing society. ... What do you say to a docker who earns 400
pounds ($700) a week, owns his house, a new car, microwave and
video? You do not say `Let me take you out of your misery
brother.'''
   The party then voted overwhelmingly for a policy review.
   Ron Todd, union general secretary, said Saturday, ``The policy
of our union will be maintained. Our support for the (Labor) party
and its leader will be maintained.''
   ``We are involved in the Labor Party on an exercise on policy
review,'' he added. ``Our union will take its decision on the
review policy but it has always given consistent support to the
party. It's not a blank check and Mr. Kinnock knows that.''
   Dennis Skinner, left-wing Labor member of Parliament and a
member of the party's ruling national executive, said: ``This
result, together with the Ford strike and the (National Health
Service) campaign, indicates a new-found belief in strong trade
unionism, and every socialist should welcome these results.
   ``The left has had a few lean years. Now, the omens look rather
better.'' Auto workers struck all the British plants of Ford Motor
Co. Feb. 8-11th in Britain's first major industrial strike in three
years.
   The workers had rejected their leaders' recommendation that they
accept offered pay increases and a three-year contract. Instead
they won an increased pay settlement and a two-year pact. Labor
leaders called it the first significant union victory in seven
years.
   Nurses staged a one-day strike Feb. 3 to protest their hours and
wages and express concern for the condition of the publicly
financed National Health Service. They said it must have more
resources.

   Northwest Airlines planes continued flying
Saturday and a union spokesman said strike preparations by 6,700
flight attendants were ``put on hold'' even though all-night
contract talks hit a snag.
   Consensus was reached on all issues except wages during a
22-hour bargaining session, said William Wren, Northwest's vice
president for public relations. But union officials said there were
other issues still unsettled.
   Wren said he did not know when talks might resume.
   The union's rank-and-file negotiating committee met late
Saturday afternoon to receive direction from about 20 Teamsters
unit representatives from around the country, said William Genoese,
international director of the Teamsters airline division.
   Genoese said a strike was still possible, though he said talks
with Northwest might be resumed.
   Genoese also threatened what he termed ``guerrilla warfare'' _
which he defined as a decline in attentiveness by flight attendants
_ should there be no settlement or support for a strike.
   ``When you beat up on the workers who service the passengers,
they beat up on the passengers,'' he said. ``You can't beat up on
people in a service business.'' He had made the same threat a week
ago against another airline, Pan Am, after those talks broke off,
but no significant disruption in service has been reported, Pan Am
said.
   A request by the federal mediator involved in the Northwest
talks to delay a strike helped avert a walkout Saturday morning, he
said.
   ``The government wants to take another crack at this,'' he said.
``It was 8 in the morning and everybody had been working all night.
Maybe some of the numbers fell through the cracks.''
   The airline proposes to stretch from five to nine years the time
in which an employee advances from a ``B'' or lower pay scale to
the ``A'' schedule, a change the union is resisting, union
officials said.
   In another area of disagreement, the union wants a three-year
contract rather than the 4{-year pact offered by the airline. Also,
the sides are divided over the issue of retroactive pay,
negotiators said.
   Earlier, in the morning, Genoese said workers were being told to
walk out.
   Teamsters Local 2747 spokesman Jeff Musto said, however, that no
strike had been called, and spot checks by The Associated Press at
airports around the nation served by the nation's fifth largest
airline found no pickets or other strike activity. Airline
operations were reported normal from Honolulu to Boston.
   ``On any given day you're subject to some delayed flights, but
we're operating as scheduled normally,'' Wren said Saturday
afternoon.
   There was a 20-minute work stoppage early Saturday at Detroit's
Metropolitan Airport, union spokesman Richard Leebove said, adding
that about 200 Northwest machinists joined 70 flight attendants
Saturday afternoon in a rally at the airport.
   Many of the 75 flight attendants who assembled at strike
headquarters in Eagan for picketing duty left by noon.
   Representatives for the airlines and the union had continued
negotiations after a midnight EST deadline Friday, but the
negotiations recessed Saturday morning.
   ``We did everything we possibly could to avoid a strike,''
Genoese said during the morning. ``Apparently the company feels it
wants to take a strike on. If we want to close down the airline, we
can close it down.''
   A spokesman for Northwest said the airline was prepared to carry
out its strike-management program, but hoped that talks would
resume.
   About 2,000 managers trained as flight attendants were posted
throughout the Northwest system with 200 newly hired replacement
flight attendants also ready to move, said Terry Erskine, the
airline's vice president for law and labor relations.
   There was no immediate word on whether flight attendant picket
lines would be honored by pilots or machinists.
   Tyler said the machinists are under a contract that forbids them
to strike in sympathy with another union; the pilots' union said no
decision had been made on its role.
   Since Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in 1986, former
Republic flight attendants have been working under their old
contract, and many former Republic employees are paid less than
their Northwest counterparts.
   Northwest is trying to bring the workers under one contract and
offered to bring former Republic employees up to the salary levels
of Northwest employees. But the union claimed the airline is
compensating by reducing vacation pay and retirement benefits.
   Meanwhile, Pan Am Corp. is continuing negotiations with the
Teamsters, which represent 4,500 Pan Am reservations agents,
customer service employees and other ground workers. The union had
threatened to strike because management is seeking $35 million in
concessions.
   Formal talks broke off last weekend and a strike deadline
passed, but the employees kept working and informal talks have
continued by telephone, Pan Am spokesman James A. Arey said
Saturday.
   There was no evidence the Teamsters carried out a threat of
``guerrilla warfare'' at Pan Am, he said.

   About 5,000 members of a
right-wing paramilitary group rallied Saturday to demand a
whites-only state in South Africa and urge the government to
strengthen apartheid legislation.
   Members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement held a four-hour
ceremony in Pretoria, saying the government was attempting to
``sell out'' its whites. The group also burned the flag of the
African National Congress, an outlawed black guerrilla group that
supports majority black rule.
   The protesters, many wearing uniforms and carrying pistols, said
prayers, sang and waved flags.
   They commemorated an 1881 victory by the Afrikaners over the
British in the town of Majuba, which leader Eugene TerreBlanche
said was symbolic of the Afrikaners' present-day struggle to
establish a homeland.
   ``The day is coming when this government will capitulate (to
blacks),'' TerreBlanche said. ``The AWB must prepare ... because
that is when we will take over the country.''
   ``If you scrap the apartheid laws, you can expect South Africa
to follow the same route as the other (African) colonies, which
have decayed and rotted,'' he said. ``Without apartheid laws we
cannot have order. And without order this country will
disintegrate.''
   Apartheid, by law and custom, establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The demonstration followed Wednesday's government crackdown
which banned 18 of the country's leading black opposition groups
from engaging in politics.
   TerreBlance did not comment on the crackdown.
   After the meeting, group members traveled to the Union
Buildings, the government's executive headquarters, to present a
petition calling for a whites-only state in South Africa.
   Riot police blocked the entrance to the building, but accepted
the petition from TerreBlanche. There were no reports of violence
or arrests.
   The right-wing group is made up almost exclusively of
Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended settlers of South Africa. The group
rejects all concessions from South Africa's 5 million whites to the
nation's 26 million black majority.
   In other developments Saturday, security forces began erecting a
five-foot barbed-wire fence around most of the KTC squatter camp
outside Cape Town.
   The KTC camp has been the site of ongoing faction fighting among
rival black groups in recent weeks. Police said two people were
killed and 20 shacks were flattened in fighting last week.
   Witnesses said the fence, which stretched for more than a mile,
had three openings for residents to enter and exit. Several
thousand people live in the KTC camp.
   In June 1986, 70,000 people lost their homes and scores of
people were killed in KTC and three other sections of the
Crossroads squatter complex during an onslaught by black vigilantes.

   The pilot who abandoned a twin-engine Cessna along
a closed highway in September 1985 left behind nearly a ton of
cocaine and the clue eventually led to the indictment of Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Cessna's pilot, Anthony Azpruia, told prosecutors about the
Noriega link after his arrest, The Miami Herald reported. His
cooperation and implication of Miami-based aircraft parts business
DIASCA sparked an investigation.
   The investigation of alleged Panamanian drug trafficking was
completed by Miami-based federal officials whose information was
ignored by Drug Enforcement Administration officials in the U.S.
Embassy in Panama City and in Washington, according to a Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee counsel and the chief assistant U.S.
attorney in Miami.
   ``There's absolutely no question that, through all the
administrations since 1969, we had more than adequate information
that this guy (Noriega) was a dope dealer and chose to ignore it,''
said Richard Gregorie, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Miami.
   ``Even when we wanted to indict him, there were two factions
within the DEA,'' he said. ``People were satisfied with what they
were getting out of Panama, that he was doing enough. The other
faction wanted to work the case. We really didn't send a lot up to
Washington. We stayed clear of it.''
   DIASCA had already been penetrated by DEA agent Dan Moritz when
pilot Azpruia made his emergency landing on a closed section of
Interstate 75 in south Florida on Sept. 25, 1985.
   Running out of fuel and pursued by a DEA helicopter, Azpruia
landed and abandoned the $1 million plane and its cargo, about 900
kilograms or roughly 1,980 pounds of cocaine.
   Moritz said DIASCA president Alfredo Caballero provided aircraft
for ``cocaine-smuggling ventures'' by 38-year-old pilot Floyd
Carlton, who is now the government's key witness against Noriega.
   Moritz said the DIASCA office was used for ``planning smuggling
ventures, for assembling and distributing large cash proceeds of
narcotics transactions and for placing telephone calls.''
   Caballero denies any involvement in drug trafficking.
   Four months after the Cessna's highway landing, Caballero, his
son, Azpruia, Carlton and three others were indicted. All were
jailed but Carlton, who was in Panama.
   Azpruia told prosecutors that there was a Noriega connection,
but investigators needed Carlton to make a case.
   Carlton was pursued not only by authorities in Florida but by
drug lords in Colombia who believed he had stolen a cocaine
shipment of more than 1,100 pounds from them, the Herald reported.
   Carlton was so worried that he went to the U.S. Embassy in
Panama City and told DEA agents there about Noriega's alleged role
in the drug smuggling.
   ``When I mentioned the name of General Noriega, they immediately
became upset, and I noticed that. Of course, I became nervous at
that point,'' Carlton has said.
   The embassy confession was a bungled opportunity, said Jack
Blum, counsel to a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee.
   ``The minute the boys hear what he's got, they turn cold, like
he's a lunatic,'' Blum said. ``When he tells them about Noriega,
there's an understanding that this isn't a healthy place to talk
about it.''
   ``He was seeking help. But he wasn't seeking help as far as
being willing to come to the United States and testify,'' Gregorie
said.
   Carlton eventually went to Colombia, confronted the drug lords
and, with a kind word from the boss of Colombia's Medellin Cartel,
the pressure was reduced, the newspaper said.
   Miami investigators used Caballero to set up a trap in Costa
Rica to capture Carlton. Since then, Carlton has given detailed
depositions about drug flights he says he flew to the United States
under arrangement with Noriega and has testified before the Senate.

   Serial killer John Wayne Gacy believes he will be
paroled, cried while watching the Olympics and says ``It doesn't
always pay to be good to people,'' according to letters published
Sunday.
   The letters were written by Gacy and sent to Sue Terry, 43, of
Centralia. She says Gacy has proposed and she would marry him, the
Chicago Sun-Times said in Sunday's early editions.
   Gacy, 45, now on death row, was convicted of killing 33 young
men and boys, 29 of whom were found buried under or near his home
outside Chicago.
   ``I don't believe hardly any of it,'' Ms. Terry told the
Sun-Times. ``I really don't. ... He doesn't think he's guilty. To
me he don't seem like he could hurt anyone.
   ``We're real close,'' she said. ``I like John, and he trusts me.
I guess I love him. Yes.''
   Gacy wrote 41 letters to Ms. Terry, who is divorced, from Oct.
5, 1986, to Feb. 16, 1988. She shared some of them with the
newspaper and the Sun-Times said it would publish the letters for a
week.
   The portions published in Sunday's editions, which became
available Saturday, ranged from Gacy's thoughts on freedom to his
disdain for Queen Elizabeth II:
   _He said he was moved by the performance of Olympic speed skater
Dan Jansen, whose sister died while he was competing in Calgary.
   ``She wanted him to go on and skate for her. And in the first
turn he lost his balance and fell. The tears just rolled down my
face. And I don't even know him,'' Gacy wrote.
   _Ms. Terry asked Gacy about an eventual release from prison.
   ``You asked me what I'll do when I get my freedom. I don't deal
in fantasy that much. It will be hard. Don't forget it may be as
long as 10 years before I get this monkey off my back. And that's a
lot to make up for as I have eight years or more done already.''
   ``I have land in five states. Most of it is where I don't want
to live _ Florida, Arizona, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Hey,
you want to live on an island? I think that would be great.
   ``If you got mad at someone, they couldn't get away from you.''
   In another letter quoted in Sunday's editions, Gacy had more to
say about what he would do if free.
   ``I am being sued for $697 million right now. Start paying that
off,'' he wrote. ``The numbers don't mean a thing, as they can have
it all. Just give me my freedom. I'll make what I need so fast
anyway as I have a knack for making money.
   ``I already told you what kind of house I am going to build. ...
I am going to make it a halfway house for horny girls and party my
butt off in orgies. Can you dig it?'' Many of the boys and young
men Gacy is convicted of killing had been sexually molested before
they died, prosecutors said.
   _Gacy says he has no affection for Britain's Queen Elizabeth.
   ``I can't stand royalty. When people are starving, we have these
sissy types wasting money. ... Since when do you bow to another
human being? They are no better than you.''
   In another letter, Gacy writes, ``It doesn't always pay to be
good to people, even family.''
   Ms. Terry could not be reached for comment by telephone
Saturday; there is no telephone listing for her in Centralia.
   Marvin Ziporyn, a Chicago forensic psychiatrist who analyzed the
letters for the newspaper, said they give a clear understanding of
Gacy's personality.
   ``He doesn't discuss the (murder) case in the letters, but they
show the mechanics of his personality like what makes a watch
tick,'' Ziporyn said.
   ``I think what's important is that he's `John Wayne' Gacy. John
Wayne like the movie star, and his trying to live up to that image
is an important part of his personality,'' Ziporyn said.

<HEAD>Debate Rages Over Allowing Jesse Jackson To Give Michigan State
Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Michigan State University
trustees are questioning plans for the Rev. Jesse Jackson to
deliver the university's winter commencement address two weeks
before the state's Democratic caucuses.
   Opponents have said that allowing Jackson to speak would break a
71-year-old tradition. Since 1917, no candidate for public office
has addressed Michigan State graduates.
   Joel Ferguson, a trustee who also is Jackson's Michigan campaign
director, said Jackson was scheduled to deliver the March 12
address before declaring he would seek the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   Michigan Democrats will hold their caucuses March 26.
   Ferguson said the speech would be non-political, something other
trustees doubted.
   ``There's absolutely no way he can write a speech that doesn't
look and sound presidential,'' Trustee Thomas Reed said. ``Even
when he comes here and talks about his grandmother, it will have
some political overtones.''
   Trustee Kathy Wilbur called on the Michigan State to adopt a
rule to prevent presidential candidates from making commencement
addresses at the university.
   Michigan State President John DiBiaggio has supported Jackson's
selection as the winter commencement speaker.
   ``We wanted to have the Rev. Jackson because he is a
distinguished leader, a humanitarian ... a positive role model for
minorities and others,'' DiBiaggio said. ``There's a great deal of
enthusiasm among the student body.''
   But DiBiaggio added that banning candidates from speaking ``has
some legitimacy.''
   Several notable politicians have given commencement addresses at
Michigan State, including then-Vice President Richard Nixon in 1957
and former President Harry S. Truman in 1960, but none was running
for office at the time.

   A Ku Klux Klan group's protest of the Dallas
police department's new affirmative action hiring plan turned into
a melee Saturday when an anti-KKK group charged the hooded Klansmen
and other white supremacists.
   Police clubbed members of the crowd of about 200 and some
protesters sustained minor injuries, authorities said. Eight people
were arrested on minor charges, police said.
   Members of the anti-KKK group held a rally and burned
Confederate and Nazi flags in front of City Hall, where about a
dozen Klansmen had gathered to stage a news conference against the
affirmative action plan.
   Members of the placard-carrying anti-KKK crowd surrounded the
Klansmen and shouted ``Go away. ... Dallas doesn't want you. We
don't want you.''
   As the Klan marched around City Hall plaza, an elderly black
woman was punched in the face by a white man, who was arrested for
aggravated assault.
   ``That was the worst thing. We put him right in jail. I don't
know why he did it but it certainly instigated a few tempers to
pop,'' said Deputy Chief R.L. Schifelbein.
   The anti-Klan protesters threw bottles and horse manure at the
Klansmen as tactical squad police armed with clubs and mounted
officers tried to ring the hooded men and keep the crowd back.
Police dogs converged on the scene as officers tried to break up
the feuding factions.
   Skirmishes erupted several times during the one-hour
confrontation, with opponents in the crowd spitting on each other.
   Klansmen seeking to escape the hostile crowd squeezed into cars
and tried to leave the scene. As they were attempting to flee, an
officer hit one anti-Klan demonstrator in the stomach with a club.
   Some of the demonstrators apparently resented police protection
of the Klan and shouted ``Cops kill the people!'' One man yelled
``Shoot a cop!''
   The demonstration also drew a group of ``skinheads,'' or white
supremacists with shaven heads.The skinheads usually remained
outside the ring of police protection, and it was between this
group and the crowd that most of the fights and pushing occurred.
   The Rev. Leonard Charles Stovall led the anti-Klan crowd in
prayer after the melee. Speaking of police, he said, ``Lord help
them be responsible to everybody.''
   Schifelbein said the Klansmen came from Connecticut.
   ``We did not invite them. We don't want that kind of support. We
want the support of the people of Dallas and not some idiot from
Connecticut,'' he said.
   The news conference was scheduled by a man who identified
himself as David White, of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan based in Shelton, Conn.
   The City Council implemented the affirmative action hiring plan
earlier this year in response to critics' charges that the police
department did not reflect the city's racial makeup.
   Racial tension in Dallas increased in recent weeks after the
fatal shootings of three police officers and four other men who
were shot by police.
   The most controversial shooting was the death of white officer
John Glenn Chase, who was killed by a mentally ill, black transient
who grabbed his gun and then shot him while a street-corner crowd
watched and some witnesses allegedly shouted ``Shoot, shoot!'' The
transient was later killed by police.
   After that shooting, Police Chief Billy Prince said criticism of
the department by minority elected officials had fostered an
environment of ill-will between the minority community and police.
   Critics of the police have blasted the department, saying
officers are too trigger happy when confronting minorities.
Criticism of the department also led to a congressional hearing
last spring.
   The latest shooting occurred Friday, when off-duty officer Gary
D. McCarthy, 33, was gunned down during an attempted robbery at a
grocery store where he was moonlighting as a security guard.
   Saturday evening, police announced two arrests, and said one of
the two men had late been released on personal recognizance bond.
They gave few details, declining to name the suspects or give
charges against them.
   The gunman was black and the victim white, but Prince said he
didn't think the shooting was racially motivated.
   ``The problem is we have too many people on the streets who
should be in the penitentiary,'' the chief said. ``There are too
many people on the streets who are mean.''

   Presidential candidate Pat Robertson
said he made a stop at a Baton Rouge airport Saturday to support
fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart because ``in Christianity we don't
shoot our wounded.''
   Swaggart, who stepped down from his television pulpit Feb. 21
after tearfully admitting to an unspecified sin, reportedly paid a
prostitute to pose naked and tried to make a deal with a preacher
who confronted him about it.
   Robertson said Swaggart was in seclusion at his walled family
compound _ routinely guarded by security officers _ and the two
felt a personal visit to the home ``would expose him to further
unneeded scrutiny by the press.''
   Robertson's brief airport appearance came while he was en route
to Huntsville, Ala., from Houston.
   The Republican candidate said he had talked twice by phone to
Swaggart on Saturday. ``I told him I want to see him soon restored
to his pulpit and continue again his magnificent work.''
   ``I am not one who is going to get involved between the
Assemblies of God, which I admire and appreciate, or Jimmy
Swaggart. That is an inner-church matter,'' Robertson, a Southern
Baptist, said when asked if he was urging the Assemblies of God to
go light on any punishment.
   Louisiana officials of the Assemblies of God recommended barring
Swaggart from preaching for three months, but officials at the
group's national headquarters sent the recommendation back, asking
for reconsideration.
   ``A person is forgiven when he asks for it,'' said Robertson.
``In my estimation, God has forgiven him. I just wanted to
symbolically put my arm around him and say, `Brother, I love you
and I am here to tell the world.'''
   Robertson also made a peace offering to Vice President George
Bush, a fellow GOP presidential contender.
   ``While we're in an attitude of reconciliation, I think it might
be appropriate to ask for reconciliation between me and George
Bush,'' Robertson said when asked if he felt Bush had anything to
do with disclosures about Swaggart. ``I don't wish to have any
confusion or animosity between us.''
   Robertson charged earlier in the week that the disclosures about
Swaggart and the prostitute were timed to hurt his campaign. He
offered no proof, and declined to say who he thought was behind the
disclosures. However, in the same interview he accused Bush's
campaign of ``dirty politics'' and ``trickery'' directed at him.
   Meanwhile, there was no indication when Assemblies of God
officials in Louisiana might submit new punishment proposals for
Swaggart.
   ``I would not have any comment on that. I'm sorry, you know. I
just don't have any comment,'' the Rev. Cecil Janway, district
superintendent of the church's Louisiana District Council, said
Saturday.
   Neither the church nor Marvin Gorman, the defrocked Assemblies
of God minister who reportedly confronted Swaggart with photographs
documenting his indiscretions, has said exactly what they were.
   But admitted prostitute Debra Murphree claims Swaggart paid her
to pose naked and talk dirty to him, but did not have intercourse.
   She tried to sell her story to the National Enquirer for
$100,000, but the tabloid rejected her offer after she failed a lie
detector test, senior editor Paul Levy said Friday. Murphree told
WVUE-TV on Friday that nervousness, drug use and inability to
remember some of the questions caused that failure.
   Before the pictures were given to church officials, Swaggart
offered to help Gorman return to the Assemblies of God and to have
Gorman appear on his television show, according to unidentified
sources quoted in Saturday's editions of the Times-Picayune in New
Orleans.
   Gorman, who claimed in a $90 million lawsuit against Swaggart
and 13 others that Swaggart destroyed his ministry by spreading
false rumors of numerous adulterous affairs, refused to comment on
the report. So did officials at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries in Baton
Rouge.
   The sources, which the newspaper described as close to Gorman,
said Gorman told Swaggart he wasn't especially interested in either
offer and gave Swaggart four months to deal with his personal
problems.
   ``There were no strings,'' one source told the newspaper.
``Swaggart knew that Gorman had photographic proof of his
indiscretion but Gorman was leaving it up to Swaggart to figure out
how to deal with it. Gorman did not dictate how Swaggart should
deal with it.''
   The newspaper quoted its sources as saying that Swaggart
appeared truly repentant, and Gorman left the meeting satisfied
that Swaggart was ready to seek the counsel of church elders and
accept their advice.
   Gorman wrote Swaggart early this month to remind him of the
deadline, the newspaper said, but when there was no response people
close to Gorman gave the photographs to national Assemblies of God
leaders in Springfield, Mo.
   Those leaders forbade officials and ministers to talk about the
proposed punishment, when a decision might be reached, or anything
else about the matter.
   F.C. Chamberlain, a Louisiana presbyter who said Friday that it
was Swaggart's complete confession _ not favoritism _ that prompted
a recommendation for an unusually short three-month suspension, had
no comment Saturday.
   Calls to other members of the district council either were not
answered or were not returned.
   The council recommended Monday that Swaggart undergo two years
of rehabilitation and counseling, starting with a three-month
suspension from preaching in this country.
   CBS News, without citing any sources, reported that the church's
Executive Presbytery in Springfield told leaders of the Louisiana
district to order Swaggart to step down for a year. The church's
general superintendent, G. Raymond Carlson, refused to say what
penalty was recommended.
   Co-pastor Jim Rentz, who has taken the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart
Ministries during Swaggart's preaching tours abroad, was to give
Sunday's sermon. There was no advance word on its subject.

Gen. Try Sutrisno as the new commander of Indonesia's armed forces,
replacing Gen. Benny Murdani.
   Before his appointment as commander, Sutrisno was army chief.
   Presidential spokesman Sudharmono said Benny will continue to
serve as commander of the National Security Agency at least until
the end of the 11-day session of the People's Congress, which is
scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   The National Security Agency was formed in 1966 to restore order
after an unsuccessful communist-supported coup attempt the previous
year. Suharto was appointed its first commander by the late
President Sukarno.
   Benny became commander of the armed forces and of the security
agency in March 1983.

   Lula E. ``Tiny'' Oslund, a former silent screen
star known as Blanche Sweet when she played confident and
determined heroines for filmmaker D.W. Griffith, has died. She was
92.
   Mrs. Oslund's ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean off
Honolulu following private services Friday, the day after she died
at home.
   Born in Geneseo, Ill., in 1895, Mrs. Oslund began making films
while still in her teens. ``The Lonedale Operator'' (1911) and
``Judith of Bethulia'' (1913) were two of the films she made with
Griffith.
   Mrs. Oslund went on to work with several other directors,
starring in such movies as ``Anna Christie'' (1923) and ``Tess of
the D'Urbervilles'' (1924).
   She made only four movies after the silent era ended, including
a bit part in the 1959 Danny Kaye film ``The Five Pennies.''
   Mrs. Oslund and her son, Wilman F. Oslund, moved to Hawaii in
1983 from Abilene, Texas.
   She also is survived by a sister, Vila O. Miller, and two
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A judge ordered the winner of a $1.8 million
lottery jackpot to pay half the prize to his former live-in
girlfriend.
   Ingham County Circuit Judge Peter Houk upheld a claim Friday by
Carolyn Eeles of Westland that she and her ex-boyfriend, James W.
Renfro, had an oral agreement to share any winnings from the
Michigan Lotto tickets they bought Dec. 18, 1985.
   One of those tickets turned out to be the jackpot winner. But
Eeles' lawyer, Karl Nickolai, said Renfro returned to his estranged
wife less than two days after claiming all the prize money and then
moved to Tennessee.
   Houk said Renfro testified during the trial that he bought the
Lotto tickets himself. But the judge said 17 other witnesses
contradicted Renfro's testimony, including some who vouched for
Eeles' claim that she and Renfro each paid $5 for 10 tickets and
that Eeles herself picked the winning numbers.
   Renfro was ordered to pay Eeles half of the first two after-tax
installments, worth about $74,000 each, that he has collected. Houk
also ordered that Eeles receive half of the remaining 18 payments
and interest on the first two installments, and that Renfro pay her
lawyer's fees.
   ``I'm thrilled _ there is justice in this land,'' Eeles, 43,
said afterward. Renfro, 48, said the witnesses ``weren't telling
the truth.''

<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah,
began their official 10-day Southern California visit Saturday in a
typical freeway traffic jam that delayed their arrival at a City
Hall welcoming ceremony by 25 minutes.
   The car carrying the Duke and Duchess of York had to take a
detour around the jam on the trip from the royal yacht Britannia,
moored in Long Beach, 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. The
traffic snarl was caused by an accident on the Santa Monica Freeway.
   When the royal couple arrived at City Hall, they were cheered by
about 1,000 people, some of them waving British flags, and Mayor
Tom Bradley welcomed them in the City Council chambers. The day's
events Saturday also included visits to Chinatown and a school for
the performing arts.
   Andrew and Sarah were in town to launch UK-LA '88, a three-month
celebration of British culture and commercial achievement.
   ``The United Kingdom has sent the diversity of its cultural life
to share with us,'' Bradley told them. ``We count it a very special
honor that you have joined us on this occasion.''
   Andrew stressed the couple's participation in launching UK-LA
'88, which he described as an ``ambitious, cultural collaborative
venture'' between Los Angeles and British art groups.
   During their stay, Andrew and Sarah are expected to attend a
number of the festival's 60 cultural events featuring British and
American artists.
   Noting that he and his wife will visit the aircraft carrier USS
Nimitz at sea during their visit, the prince cited common military
obligations shared by the two nations around the world.
   ``For us, our visit to one of your ships will remind us of those
many parts of the world in Central Europe, in the Persian Gulf and
elsewhere in which your armed forces and ours stand side by side in
common defense or our shared democratic values,'' said the prince,
a Royal Navy helicopter pilot.
   The City Hall reception featured songs by Los Lobos, an East Los
Angeles group that gave its musical bounce to last year's hit film
about Ritchie Valens, who died in a 1959 plane crash with rock
legend Buddy Holly.
   Los Lobos performed two songs, including the rollicking Spanish
song that Valens immortalized, ``La Bamba,'' from which last year's
movie title was taken. Sarah, 28, who is expected the couple's
first child in August, kept time with her left heel.
   After the City Hall welcome, the royal pair toured nearby
Chinatown under light rain.
   Sandy Wong, a Chinatown resident originally from Hong Kong, said
people who hail from that British colony have a special affection
for the royal couple, and she confessed to being particularly
impressed by Andrew.
   ``He's really better looking than the pictures,'' said Mrs.
Wong, 49.
   The royal couple applauded politely during a performance by
elementary school students in a small square. The boys performed a
lion dance and the girls a parasol dance.
   The next stop was a quick visit to the 32nd Street School, a
``magnet'' school for performing arts, where the couple was treated
to dance performances, jazz music and skits.
   ``Well done,'' Sarah told the young dancers and musicians before
the couple sat in on a medieval history lesson to discuss life in a
castle.
   One student asked if there were still dungeons in Windsor
Castle, the official residence of the British ruling family.
   There used to be dungeons in one part of the castle, Andrew
responded, but ``there is no use for dungeons nowadays, so they've
been brought up to date _ they're now a disco.''
   Another student asked about the most important responsibility of
being a duchess.
   ``Hope you've got a pad and pencil,'' Sarah quipped, then added,
``Oh, my husband. He comes first and then my life.''
   As a parting gift, students gave the couple three school
T-shirts _ one baby-size. The couple's first child is due in August.
   For lunch, the duke and duchess dined on smoked quail and
grilled Pacific salmon in a restaurant atop a downtown high-rise.
The luncheon crowd was dotted with show business personalities,
including Ed Begley Jr. of television's ``St. Elsewhere'' and
singer Marilyn McCoo, host of the ``Solid Gold'' rock music TV
show. Later, there was an off-the-record reception for news media
representatives on the royal yacht.
   The royal couple flew in from London on Friday afternoon,
arriving to spring-like weather five years to the day after the
start of a similar tour by Andrew's parents, Queen Elizabeth II and
Prince Philip, that was marred by rough weather.
   Security personnel experienced some tense moments Friday when
they discovered a suspicious-looking briefcase about a block from
where the yacht Britannia was docked. A State Department bomb unit
blew it up.
   ``It was no bomb,'' said a British consulate spokeswoman who did
not want her name used.

   Four children and their baby
sitter were killed by carbon monoxide fumes from a faulty gas
heater, officials said Saturday.
   Ola Weerts and a friend had left the children with a baby sitter
Friday night and went to dinner.
   ``They came back and checked about 9:30 p.m., left again and
arrived shortly before midnight and found the majority of them
dead,'' said Clay County Sheriff's Lt. Tim Martin.
   Pronounced dead at Mrs. Weerts' home here were two of her three
children, 10-year-old James and 6-year-old Sherri. Her friend's
granddaughter, Julie Meador, 10, and baby sitter Jennifer Bias, 17,
were also dead, Martin said.
   The third Weerts child, 12-year-old Tanya, died Saturday evening
at Shands Hospital in nearby Gainesville.
   ``They were all in their beds, apparently sleeping, except for
one 10-year-old on the kitchen floor,'' Martin said. Ms. Bias was
found on a living room sofa.
   ``It's absolutely the worst multiple death case in one family
that we've had in Clay County,'' Martin said.
   An autopsy on Tanya was scheduled for Sunday. Autopsies on the
others showed they died of acute carbon monoxide poisoning,
authorities said.
   ``A normal carbon monoxide level was 1 to 2 percent, caused by
pollutants like ozone,'' Martin said. ``Smokers have higher level,
maybe 10 percent.''
   ``The four kids had an average of 65 percent,'' he said.
   ``Ultimately, what has happened was, we feel, a faulty exhaust
on a gas furnace became clogged and the carbon monoxide fumes were
allowed to back up and disperse through the house,'' Martin said.

   Composer, pianist and musical arranger Gene
Vincent de Paul, whose collaboration with lyricist Don Raye on
``Pigfoot Pete'' got them an Oscar nomination, died Saturday after
a lengthy illness, his daughter said.
   De Paul, who was 68 and had been suffering from a brain tumor,
died at his suburban Northridge home, daughter April Leach said.
   He often collaborated with Raye, and the two were nominated for
an Academy Award in 1942 for the song ``Pigfoot Pete'' from the
film ``Hellzapoppin.''
   De Paul worked with Johnny Mercer on music for the 1954 film
``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' and the Broadway play, ``L'il
Abner.'' De Paul also worked on the music for the Walt Disney film,
``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' Ms. Leach said.
   De Paul was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 1985,
Ms. Leach said. He was born in New York on June 17, 1919.
   ``He's had his music recorded from everybody from big bands to
Phoebe Snow and Stevie Wonder,'' Ms. Leach said. ``The Judds'
latest album has one of his songs on it.''
   Among his biggest hits were ``Cow Cow Boogie,'' ``Star Eyes,''
``Irresistible,'' ``When You're in Love'' and ``Mr. Five by Five.''
   He is survived by his daughter, three sons and two
grandchildren. A funeral was tentatively planned for Thursday, Ms.
Leach said.

   Senegal's violence-marred electioneering
ended Friday with President Abdou Diouf, the heavy favorite, making
a final campaign speech before an overflow crowd at the 30,000-seat
Demba Diop sports stadium.
   Diouf was expected to be re-elected and retain his Socialist
Party's majority in the National Assembly in elections Sunday.
   Four presidential candidates and six of Senegal's 17 registered
political parties were to contest the multiparty presidential and
National Assembly elections.
   A crowd estimated at more than 10,000 went to Senegal's
Independence Monument in this capital city Friday to attend a final
rally for the main opposition candidate, Abdoulaye Wade, and his
Senegalese Democratic Party.
   Security was increased following two days of violence in Thies,
42 miles northeast of Dakar. Truckloads of members of the Military
Intervention Group were stationed along Dakar's streets.
   The riot police were deployed against Democratic Party
supporters in two days of running battles in Thies, after the
government barred a rally by Wade's party in the town's main
square. Troops used tear gas, rubber bullets and truncheons to
scatter groups of stone-throwing youths.
   Some Democrats claimed more than 100 people, including eight
local party officials, were arrested. Government official did not
comment on the allegations.
   Diouf denounced his opponents, primarily Wade, at a rally Friday
morning in Thies at the Place de France, site of the earlier
clashes.
   ``In light of the events of yesterday, I am ashamed of
Senegal,'' said Diouf. ``I thought I was facing men who thought as
I did .... Unfortunately, these men are men of subversion.''
   A Socialist Party spokesman refused to comment when asked why
Diouf was allowed to speak in Thies while then opposition rally was
barred.
   Most of those who fought the riot forces were teen-agers.
   Brawling began Thursday.
   By Friday, the youths had armed themselves with sticks and wore
motorcycle helmets in preparation for street fighting. During
Diouf's 10-minute address in Thies, the concussion of exploding
tear gas canisters could be heard in the surrounding neighborhood.
The level of violence Friday appeared less intense than the day
before, though minor injuries were reported.
   The Socialists were expected to lose some of their 111 seats in
the 120-member assembly Sunday, although the 52-year-old Diouf was
expected to win easy re-election to a second five-year term.
   He has led Senegal since 1981, when the nation's first
president, Leopold Sedar Senghor, retired. Diouf won the 1983
elections with 83.5 percent of the vote to Wade's 14.79 percent.
Three other candidates shared the rest. Wade accused Diouf's party
of rigging the elections, a charge the president denied.
   Wade, 61, a lawyer and three-time presidential candidate,
accuses Diouf of selling out the country to Western creditors and
foreign businessmen.
   Wade threatened to turn his party into ``a liberation movement''
if he considered this election to have been rigged.
   Two million of Senegal's estimated 7 million people are
registered to vote.

<TEXT>
   Hungary and the Soviet Union pledged
friendship and support for each other Friday as a five-day visit by
Soviet President Andrei Gromyko drew to a close.
   And according to an unexpected announcement by both countries,
the Hungarian Writers' Union, which a year ago ran into political
trouble after it rejected conservatives in its leadership, signed a
working agreement with the Soviet Writers' Union.
   The friendship pledge came in a final communique signed by
Gromyko and President Karoly Nemeth of Hungary.
   Gromyko is to return to Moscow on Saturday, ending his first
foreign state visit since assuming the presidency in 1985.
   The agreement between the writers' unions means they will
cooperate in publishing books, exchange visits and sponsor
exchanges of students and critics.
   ``We are ahead of you'' in terms of glasnost, or openness,
Viktor Karpov, head of the Soviet Writer's Union, chided his
Hungarian audience at a news conference.
   Earlier, in an interview with a Hungarian newspaper, Karpov
noted that the Hungarian Writer's Union ``has successfully put
behind it the difficulties that had arisen within it.''
   Last year, more than 25 Communist Party loyalists left the
association of about 600 members. Culture Minister Bela Koepeczi
said the union no longer represented Hungary's literary sector
after writers chose to elect an independent board, rejecting board
members favored by the party.
   The state then authorized formation of a guild of writers, poets
and translators.
   The head of the Hungarian Union, Tibor Cseres, said Friday that
in the end a ``compromise was reached and neither side had to yield
its basic ground.''
   He said the compromise made possible the agreement with the
Soviet Writers' Union.

<TEXT>
   The Museum of Modern Art's director has
resigned because of protests about an exhibition in which a printed
face of Marilyn Monroe was imposed on an image of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, patron saint of Mexico.
   More than 100 artists and intellectuals issued a statement
Friday expressing ``profound indignation'' and demanded
reinstatement of Jorge Alberto Manrique.
   They blamed his resignation on ``the pressure exerted by
reactionary groups'' and said ``the director of a museum cannot ..
. be raised to be the censor of any work of art,'' the liberal
newspaper La Jornada reported.
   The government, which runs the museum, requested Manrique's
resignation Thursday and he complied.
   On Jan. 23, about 1,000 people chanting ``Long Live Christ the
King!'' stormed the museum in the Chapultepec Park and forced the
management to close an exhibit called ``Alternative Spaces'' by
Rolando de la Rosa, 36.
   He had superimposed the face of the late actress Marilyn Monroe
on an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, an object of reverence in
Mexico where 90 percent of the 80 million citizens are Roman
Catholic.
   In another work, styled after Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last
Supper,'' Jesus Christ had the face of the late Mexican actor and
singer Pedro Infante. In ``La Sagrada Familia'' the baby Jesus was
replaced by a soccer ball.
   Pro-Vida, the group that organized the museum assault, demanded
the resignations of Manrique and Martin Reyes Vayssade,
undersecretary of culture. It also demanded de la Rosa be
hospitalized for ``social re-education.''
   Manrique was the only official of the government's Fine Arts
Institute, which runs the museum, to condemn the closing of the
exhibition, La Jornada said.
   It quoted him as calling for legal action against the
protesters, whom he described as ``neo-fascists with clear
political objectives.''
   ``Inevitably this decision will be interpreted as a pat on the
back for the attackers of museums,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying about the forced resignation.
   Earlier, Manrique told the weekly magazine Proceso: ``To say the
Mexican people were offended (by the art) is a big lie and absurd.''

   Actress Tracy Scoggins was attacked in a
hotel elevator while in town to serve as a co-host of the Miss USA
Pageant, police said Friday.
   Miss Scoggins, who played Monica Colby in the ABC series ``The
Colbys,'' suffered bruises in the attack Thursday night, said
police Lt. J.R. Grijalva. She did not require medical attention.
   Antonio Garcia, 35, was charged with attempted sexual assault
and released on $100 bail set by Adolfo Romero, an associate
magistrate, Grijalva said.
   Miss Scoggins expressed outrage at what she considered low bail.
   ``What that says to me is that a man like this can save himself
a whole expensive night of dinner and dancing and just pay $100 to
assault the woman of his choice,'' she said. ``That's a pretty good
deal.''
   Romero was not in his office late Friday.
   Police said Garcia had followed Miss Scoggins to the Marriott
Hotel, where she was staying, and into the elevator.
   ``He pulled down the front of her evening gown and attempted to
sexually assault her,'' Grijalva said. ``She was able to fight him
off, and when the door opened, she was able to get out and call for
help.''
   Hotel guests pulled the man out of the elevator and subdued him
until hotel security and police arrived, Grijalva said.
   Miss Scoggins was attacked after returning from a taping of the
evening gown and swimsuit competitions.
   The 51 contestants have been staying in another hotel. Miss USA
will be crowned Tuesday night in a nationally broadcast pageant.

<TEXT>
   A special court convicted and sentenced five people
Friday for three armed robberies in 1983 designed to help finance
the left-wing terrorist group Direct Action.
   The sentences _ life imprisonment for one defendent and 13 years
for each of the four others _ ended a two-week series of trials of
suspected Direct Action members.
   A sixth defendant was given a suspended sentence.
   Regis Schleicher, 31, was given a life sentence and Prosecutor
Daniel Barreyre called him ``a commando chief who shoots like a
professional, the most dangerous of the group.''
   Police considered Schleicher a founding member of Direct Action.
The terrorist group has asserted responsibility for numerous
bombings, the 1986 fatal shooting of Renault president Georges
Besse and the 1985 killing of French Gen. Rene Audran.
   Barreyre had asked for 20-year prison terms for each of the
other four: Jean-Marc Rouillan, 35, on his 88th day of a hunger
strike; Vincenzo Spano, 31; Nicolas Halfen, 24, and his brother,
Claude, 32.
   The sixth defendant, Frederique Germain, 31, cooperated with
police and received a five-year suspended prison term.
   A seven-judge court deliberated just over two hours before
handing down the convictions and sentences.
   The six were convicted of robbing two banks and a jewelry shop
in 1983. The holdups netted about $100,000, police said.
   In one robbery, two policemen were wounded and a member of the
gang was killed in a gun fight.
   Rouillan began a hunger strike Dec. 1, along with three other
suspected Direct Action members, to protest being kept in isolation
in prison.
   On Thursday, France's human rights minister, Claude Malhuret,
said the hunger strike campaign ``plays on the humanitarian
sentiments of the French people and must be stopped.''
   He said that despite their confinement, the defendants had the
right to daily walks, to receive newspapers, listen to the radio
and receive visits from family members, lawyers and doctors.
   The defendents were arrested by police Feb. 21, 1987, at a Loire
Valley farm. Authorities said Direct Action terrorist activities
ended with the arrests.
   The three other people on hunger strike are suspected of being
Direct Action leaders. In previous trials, seven suspected Direct
Action members were convicted on various lesser charges and given
prison sentences.

   Seven Latin American countries asked
the United States Friday to halt all aid to the rebels fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   The foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela also signed a declaration calling for a
United Nations agreement to fight drug trafficking.
   Several foreign ministers indirectly criticized Panama's
military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, after Noriega's
allies deposed civilian President Eric Arturo Delvalle early Friday.
   The nations are members of the Group of Eight, formed last year
to assist Central American peace efforts. The group ended its
three-day meeting in Cartagena Friday.
   Panama, the eighth member, was not represented after Foreign
Minister Jorge Abadia left Cartagena Thursday night because of the
political crisis.
   The group's formal declaration made no mention of the Panamanian
turmoil, which began Thursday when Delvalle ordered Noriega to step
down from his post as military chief and Noriega refused.
   But Foreign Minister German Nava Carrillo of Venezuela made an
indirect reference to Noriega, saying that in a democracy ``the
military must be obedient to civilian power.''
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes of Colombia, who did not
mention Panama specifically, said democracy has suffered a blow in
Latin America.
   The ministers' statement recognized ``the value of the
contribution to the peace process'' that President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica made with a peace plan signed last Aug. 7 by the five
Central American presidents.
   But the statement said fighting continues, countries are
building up armaments and ``destabilizing actions and violations of
international rights'' occur.
   Sources close to the foreign ministers told The Associated Press
that the reference to destabilizing actions and violations of
international rights was a reference to U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels known as Contras.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
ministers expressed concern in their talks about alleged Cuban
support of Salvadoran rebels. But the final declaration made no
mention of Cuban involvement in Central America.
   According to U.S. officials, there are some 8,000 Soviet bloc
and Cuban personnel in Nicaragua, including about 3,500 military
and secret police. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the
6-year-old civil war.
   El Salvador claims that Cuba is supporting Salvadoran rebels
with aid coming through Nicaragua.
   Referring to negotiations between the Nicaraguan government and
Nicaraguan rebels, the formal statement said that for the talks to
succeed there must be no interference from outside Central America.
   The statement urged developed nations to contribute emergency
aid to Central American countries.

<TEXT>
   President Raul
Alfonsin said Friday that agricultural subsidies by the United
States and the European Economic Community have cost Argentina $12
billion since 1980.
   ``You have forgotten the developing world,'' Alfonsin told the
Cairns Group of 14 food-exporting nations on the last day of a
three-day meeting.
   The agricultural subsidies create economic and social unrest
that endangers the political stability of some countries, Alfonsin
said.
   Alfonsin criticized trade proposals by the United States and
European Common Market countries to begin reducing farm subsidies
as too little and too late.
   He said he didn't believe a U.S. proposal to eliminate farm
subsidies over 10 years ``can be considered definite,'' and the EEC
proposal to limit grain production to 160 million tons is about the
same grain production figure as last year.
   The Cairns Group ``has the central object of eliminating that
arsenal of protectionist measures that distorts foreign trade in
the field of agriculture,'' the president said.
   The group takes its name from the Australian coastal city where
the first ministerial-level meeting of the organization was held in
August 1986.
   It issued a closing declaration outlining its hopes for a
strategy to reduce trade protectionism. The declaration will be
introduced at the meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade group next month.
   The Cairns Group also agreed to meet again in December in
Toronto.
   Also calling for the reduction or elimination of agricultural
trade protectionism was Grains Minister Charlie Mayer of Canada.
Trade Ministers Mike Moore of New Zealand and Michael Duffy of
Australia made similar declarations earlier at the meetings.
   The nations in the Cairns Group are Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, Indonesia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and Uruguay.
   Only Fiji among the 14 did not send a representative to
Bariloche, a mountain resort 1,000 miles southwest of Buenos Aires.

   Minority students occupying a Hampshire College office vowed
Friday to continue the four-day sit-in through the weekend, while
University of Dayton students held the president's office in a
protest against CIA recruiting.
   The Hampshire College students were attempting to pressure the
private school in Amherst, Mass., to do more to promote racial
harmony.
   Anita Fearman, a spokeswoman for the 40 students who took over
an office in a dormitory Tuesday, said discussions with college
President Adele Simmons have been cordial, but she saw no quick end
to the standoff.
   The students' demands include funding and a full-time
coordinator for their activities on behalf of minority students,
hiring of an administrator for multicultural affairs, a policy
statement condemning racism and amnesty for the protest.
   ``The administration has offered us $25,000 to reorganize and
make fundamental structural changes in the social fabric of the

than that and we know they have the resources.''
   Simmons has said some of the demands, such as a policy on racial
harassment, have been in the works for several months. About 100 of
the college's 1,100 students are minorities.
   In Dayton, about 50 members of Plowshares for Peace and the
Democratic Socialists of America took over the outer office
Thursday of Brother Raymond L. Fitz, the Roman Catholic school's
president, and demanded a one-year moratorium on CIA recruitment.
   The number had dwindled to 27 by Friday, university spokeswoman
Teri Rizvi said.
   The students who remained were charged with disruption under the
student conduct code, Ms. Rizvi said. Penalties could range from a
fine to expulsion, and will be determined by a student-faculty
panel, she said.
   Fitz met with the protesters for 1{ hours Friday and said he
would discuss their demands with administrators and faculty.
   Schuerman told the protesters later: ``Whatever the resolution
is, it's not going to hinge on whether you stay here or leave.''
   Last week, students at the University of Massachusetts occupied
a building for six days to protest racial violence at the campus.
The siege ended with an agreement on such demands as increased
resources for Third World programs.

   A 79-year-old man was charged with
attempted murder Friday after he stormed into a retirement home
that had evicted him for being a troublemaker and opened fire,
wounding four people, police said.
   William H. ``Shorty'' Cox was ordered held on $250,000 bond in
the shootings. Police said Cox burst in during a board meeting
Thursday.
   ``He picked out the people he felt had done him wrong and began
firing,'' police spokesman Dee Anderson said.
   Four people suffered minor gunshot wounds and a fifth, Willie
Joe Wright, 67, suffered a heart attack and was listed in critical
condition Friday at Arlington Memorial Hospital.
   Cox had lived in the home for 22 months but was evicted in
September for `violent acts,'' including shoving others and using
profane language, said Sam Hilburn, president of the home's board
of directors.
   ``I heard the rounds going off _ ping, ping, ping _ and saw
people ducking,'' said Pat Wilkinson, an electrician who phoned
authorities. ``I was still on the phone when he wandered through
the office. He said, `Go ahead and call the police ... I don't want
to get everything blown out of proportion.'''
   The home, which houses 140 people, has no security guards. Cox
entered the board room, where about 15 people were gathered, with a
semiautomatic rifle in his hands and another rifle strung around
his neck, police said.
   ``He said, `I've got a statement to make,' but rambled
incoherently,'' said board member Charles Smith.
   Cox shot once into the ceiling then ``apparently he selected
people and shot at them,'' Anderson said. ``It was not random
shooting.''
   Cox surrendered to police in a kitchen at the home, Anderson
said.
   Cox had sued the home, alleging that he had been wrongfully
evicted, but the suit was dismissed, Hilburn said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Reagan will join NATO leaders this
week at a summit designed to cement the solidarity of the 16-nation
alliance and strengthen his hand for arms-control bargaining with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Early Tuesday morning, Reagan will board Air Force One and fly
to Brussels, Belgium, for two days of talks beginning Wednesday
with the heads of state or government of the Western alliance. The
meetings at NATO headquarters will be the organization's first

   A memo central to independent counsel James C.
McKay's investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III has also
provided an intriguing new lead for Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence
E. Walsh.
   The Sept. 25, 1985 memo was written to Meese by his old friend,
E. Robert Wallach, about a proposed Middle East oil pipeline.
Wallach accurately describes Israel's help in arranging the U.S.
arms-for-hostages swap with Iran just 10 days earlier. And that
swap is central to Walsh's probe.
   The memo provides the first link between the pipeline affair and
the Iran-Contra episode, and may provide clues to the motivations

<HEAD>Calling Long-Distance From a Hotel: Dial At Your Own Risk</HEAD>

   Patricia Rossi had thought that as
administrative assistant to the chairman of the Rhode Island Public
Utilities Commission she was familiar with telephone companies and
their rates.
   But she was surprised and outraged when she was billed $5.78 for
a two-minute phone call from St. Petersburg, Fla., to her home in
Providence, R.I., by a company she had never heard of.
   ``When I saw this, I said what's going on? Their rates are
triple AT&T rates,'' said Ms. Rossi. ``But it wasn't just the
money. I thought someone should explain'' why the call hadn't been
handled by American Telephone & Telegraph Co., whose credit card
number she gave the operator and whose price for the call would
have been less than $2, she said.
   The company that handled the call was Central Corp., based in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., one a few dozen ``alternative operator
services,'' or AOS, companies that are raising concerns among
federal and state regulators because of an increasing number of
consumer complaints of price-gouging.
   The companies are providing operator services to hotels,
hospitals, universities and private pay-phone vendors in a $7
billion a year market that until recently was handled almost
entirely by AT&T.
   AOS companies blame the complaints primarily on billing errors,
and they say theirs is a young and growing industry that customers
haven't gotten used to yet.
   ``We deserve some of the criticism,'' said Lester Freeman,
president of Central. ``We've had a shrt but precipitous learning
curve. We've made a lot of mistakes, but we've done a lot right,
too.''
   At an establishment served by an AOS company, callers who dial
``0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator gets
billing information and then sends the call over a line the AOS
leases from one of the long-distance carriers.
   Many of the callers who get connected to an AOS company are
those using a credit card issued by a local Bell operating company
or AT&T, since those cards require callers to start by dialing
``0.'' AOS companies say their operators identify their companies
and that callers can request that they be transfered to an AT&T
operator at no charge.
   Callers using other a card from another long-distance company
dial a local or 800 number to reach their network, bypassing AOS
operators.
   ``The problem is that people are just dialing as they
historically have done and their call is being intercepted and they
don't realize what's happening'' until they receive the bill, said
J. Alan Taylor of the Florida Public Service Commission.
   The Federal Communications Commission, with control over the
interstate long-distance telephone industry, has authority to
regulate resellers who buy and sell time from long-distance
carriers like AT&T, MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint
Communications Co. But the FCC has not set limits on AOS rates.
   ``We're looking into the service as a whole,'' said Kathie Kneff
of the FCC's telephone enforcement division, which received its
first complaint about an AOS company six months ago and now has
about 80.
   Jeffrey Sklaver, a consultant at McLean, Va.-based
TeleStrategies Inc., said AOS companies are posing ``an interesting
problem to the FCC because no one has ever charged more than AT&T.
All the resellers were in business to charge less than AT&T.''
   The FCC can fine AOS companies that don't answer consumer
complaints, but Ms. Kneff said the companies generally have been
responsive. Most consumers, like Ms. Rossi, who have complained to
the FCC about an AOS bill have received refunds, Ms. Kneff said.
   In Florida, the Public Utilities Commission is considering
requiring AOS companies to charge rates no higher than those
allowed for AT&T.
   Tennessee regulators are proposing to prohibit the local phone
companies from providing billing services for AOS companies that
charge rates higher than AT&T's.
   The Virginia utilities commission in January advised consumers
calling from hotels, hospitals and pay phones to ask operators what
company they work for and how much they charge.
   ``If it is not the long-distance phone company with whom you
normally do business, the commission warns that you are dialing at
your own risk,'' the commission told consumers.
   Gabe Battista of National Telephone Services, an AOS based in
Rockville, Md., rejects charges of price-gouging, saying his
company is trying to compete with AT&T in price and quality of
service. He declined to release the company's rates, but said its
charges for a call are usually within $1 of AT&T's price for the
same operator-assisted call.
   Central's Freeman said regulatory efforts to tie AOS
long-distance rates to those of AT&T are unjustified.
   ``The traveling public does not expect to pay the same for a
long-distance call from a hotel as they do at home,'' he said,
adding that AT&T's rates are not ``sacrosanct.''
   AOS companies, less than 2 years old, found their niche in the
market after AT&T stopped paying commissions to hotels on the
long-distance calls made by their guests.
   These companies now are offering 15 percent and 20 percent
commissions to attract that business, along with hospitals,
universities and pay phone vendors.
   Callers generally can make credit card, collect and third-party
billed calls through an AOS company. Bell phone company cards are
accepted since the AOS companies have billing agreements with the
Bell companies, and some companies accept Mastercard, Visa and
other credit cards.
   The AOS' charge for the call is then included in the caller's
local phone bill, though it appears on a separate page with the AOS
company's name.

<HEAD>And Vadim Created Woman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-one years ago, Brigitte Bardot wrapped her
voluptuous body in a sheet, tantalizing moviegoers around the world
who flocked to see France's new ``sex kitten'' in the film made by
her director-husband, Roger Vadim.
   The film, ``And God Created Woman,'' became a movie classic,
launched BB's career and defined the tone and content for the
director's subsequent films.
   Vadim has gone back to the same title for his latest film, which
has little in common with the 1956 version except a continuing
fascination with freedom, sensuality and bourgeois morality.
   If this sounds a bit pedantic, remember that Vadim is the
filmmaker who gave the world the avant-garde sci-fi romp
``Barbarella'' starring his young, blond wife, Jane Fonda.
   His films are never short on beauty, especially the blond,
blue-eyed kind. Vadim has cast his 26 movies with women ranging
from elegant Catherine Deneuve, his third wife, to earthy Angie
Dickinson, and from intellectual Jeanne Moreau to sexpot Susan
Sarandon.
   For the new ``And God Created Woman,'' which opens this month in
the United States, Vadim chose blond Rebecca DeMornay, whose
previous credits include playing the saucy strumpet opposite Tom
Cruise in ``Risky Business'' and the angelic girl next door in
``The Trip to Bountiful.''
   ``People tell Rebecca that she has never looked more beautiful
than in this film,'' said Vadim, the Gallic Svengali, as he relaxed
in a borrowed Paris apartment after a morning of television
interviews. ``But it wasn't intentional. I make people look
beautiful, I can't help it.
   ``You wouldn't ask Rodin to make an ugly sculpture, or me to
make a film with an ugly woman. That's my style, that's my nature.''
   Bardot played a woman who marries a man in order to escape an
orphanage, only to fall for the man's younger brother, played by
Jean-Louis Trintignent. Although in the end she remains with her
older husband, the film is an exploration of sexual freedom.
   ``I wanted to show a normal young girl whose only difference was
that she behaved in the way a boy might, without any sense of guilt
on a moral or sexual level,'' Vadim said. ``There was really
nothing shocking in what Brigitte did, what was provocative was her
natural sensuality.''
   Vadim said sexual liberty is taken for granted now and women in
the 1980s are fighting for freedom of a different sort. He said he
didn't want to remake his earlier film but wanted to illuminate the
problems faced by a modern, young woman.
   ``Women now seek the freedom to be themselves, to be successful
in work without renouncing old-fashioned romanticism. Women want to
keep what they have gained without giving up those romantic ideas
which are very nice in life,'' said the 60-year-old Vadim, who
looks more like a French lawyer in his gray slacks and navy
pullover than an international film director.
   The film, shot in Santa Fe, N.M., tells the story of a young,
female prisoner who meets a carpenter working at the jail and
marries him as a way to show she is a stable candidate for parole.
   Her husband is nice, but chauvinistic, and the film follows
their relationship to an ``optimistic end, where they can stay
together without her giving up herself.''
   Vadim moved to Malibu, Calif., after his divorce from Fonda and
rented a house across from her so the two could share in the
raising of their daughter. He also has children by Deneuve and his
second wife, Annette Stroyberg.
   During the interview, he talked about the movie industry and
said his counterparts in French film lack the professionalism that
characterizes Hollywood. He pointed out that 1987 was one of the
worst years in a decade for box-office receipts in France, while
the opposite was true in the United States.
   ``French filmmakers are beginning to realize they have to try
harder, put more thought and effort into their films and make them
more international,'' he said.
   Vadim has been asked by several Paris producers to shoot his
next film in France and is considering making a science-fiction
film or suspense thriller here in English.
   ``But you know I've never had great luck in France. When `And
God Created Woman' was released the critics were horrible,
especially to Brigitte who they said couldn't act,'' he said. ``Of
course she couldn't, but she had another quality, she was and is
inimitable, unique.''
   After the film was an international success, the French critics
changed their minds, he said.
   ``I am sure that these same critics will aggress my new movie,
saying, `how can you touch such a classic, French masterpiece?'''

<HEAD>Takeovers Give Some Sparkle to a Drab Stock Market</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the hopes of many Wall Street analysts are
borne out, corporate takeovers will provide an important source of
support for the stock market all through 1988.
   In just the first two months of the year, the pot has kept
bubbling with bids for the likes of Sterling Drug, Federated
Department Stores and Stop & Shop.
   Brokers like these stories because they have enlivened what has
otherwise been a very sluggish and scared stock market in the
aftermath of the crash last fall.
   When one company in a given industry _ for example,
Addison-Wesley in publishing _ receives a bid, other stocks with
similar businesses tend to attract speculative buying.
   But beyond the windfalls takeovers can produce for holders of an
individual stock, analysts see these deals as positive for the
overall market outlook.
   For one thing, they say, the activity suggests that a fair-sized
number of presumably sophisticated people view American stocks as
attractively priced.
   Furthermore, takeovers can have a sort of echo effect. When the
holders of a company that is acquired get paid off, they are likely
to reinvest the proceeds in other stocks.
   ``The takeover game is going like gangbusters,'' observed Jay
Donnaruma, an analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
``Apparently everyone wants to `make a deal' before the environment
in Washington changes and becomes less friendly.
   ``The takeovers do create more money to go into stocks, and
that's a positive for the near future.''
   Joseph Feshback, technical analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, cites takeovers as one reason why he thinks a dramatic
rise in the stock market ``could occur any week now.''
   ``This is the final year of an administration that has been very
accommodating to takeovers,'' he says. ``If takeovers proceed at a
very rapid pace, they will put a huge supply of liquidity into the
system.
   ``By my rough calculations, as much as $20 billion could be
injected back into the system this year. Most of this should
eventually find a home in the equity market.''
   Stocks struggled to make much headway in the past week. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 8.62 to 2,023.21.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained .74 to
147.70; the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 4.07 to
284.23; and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market increased 6.28 to 363.40.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 191.09 million shares a day,
against 160.98 million the week before.
   The merits and demerits of takeovers, of course, have been hotly
debated for years. One question many observers are asking these
days: How many American assets do we want to sell to foreign
investors to help finance our habit of consuming beyond our means?
   Nevertheless, it appears to be a fact of life at the moment that
the depressed dollar in foreign exchange is attracting foreign
buyers to U.S. businesses.
   Some see buying by corporations, either domestic or foreign, as
preferable to the formerly fashionable leveraged buyout, in which
big investors used huge amounts of debt to acquire businesses.
   However they are conducted, mergers and acquisitions tend to
reduce the supply of stock available in the marketplace.
   And if you take the simple Economics 1 view that prices of
stocks are determined by supply and demand, a shrinking supply
becomes a force working in favor of higher prices.

<HEAD>Newly Started Construction Falls in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of newly started construction fell 8
percent in January from the previous month, led by a steep drop in
non-residential buildings, a construction research concern said
Sunday.
   The F.W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co.
said the latest decline continued a downward drift from highs
reached last August.
   The report said the annualized value of new construction
contracts fell to $228 billion in January from $247.3 billion in
December 1987.
   On a seasonally adjusted basis, contracts for non-residential
building tumbled 16 percent to $75.6 billion, residential
construction fell 3 percent to $110.4 billion and public works
construction fell 4 percent to $42.0 billion.
   ``January's contracting data reinforced the downward trend of
new construction activity which has been developing since the
fall,'' said George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist
for F.W. Dodge.
   He said construction contracting has fallen on a month-to-month
basis in three of the past five months since reaching an August
peak of $273.1 billion.
   Contracting for new construction is viewed as a leading
indicator of spending and employment throughout the construction
industry.
   Christie said a decline in January's contracting for
non-residential buildings reflected a bigger than expected decline
in the commercial construction market.
   ``It's been a tough winter especially throughout the South where
starts were weak, so part of January's steep fall may have been
weather related,'' he said. He said he expected non-residential
contracting ``will be ratcheting its way down over the rest of
1988.''
   Non-residential construction also includes buildings for
industrial, manufacturing, educational, religious and recreational
puposes.
   The decline in residential contracting reflected stability in
one-family home building and continued declines for apartments and
hotels, the report said. Dodge expects total housing starts will
fall 5 percent in all of 1988 to 1.525 million units.
   The drop in contracting for public works projects and other
``non-building'' construction reflected a stabilization in highway
and bridge construction.
   That figure also includes contruction of dams, sewage and water
supply systems, airports and utility and communication systems.

<HEAD>Fed Slowly Lifting Cloak Of Secrecy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The poker-faced Federal Reserve let the public
peek at some of its cards this past week by providing specific
clues as to how monetary policy was being played out lately.
   Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Fed, confirmed that the
central bank was paying closer attention to fluctuations in the
dollar, commodity prices and the interest-rate yield curve, or the
difference in long- and short-term rates.
   Fed policy in recent years had involved watching a greater
variety of economic measures, such as the money supply, which
includes cash in circulation, checking and savings accounts and
money market accounts.
   While most Fed watchers had been aware of this change in
direction for some time _ seeing hints, for example, in minutes of
policy committee meetings or from central bank governors _ they
were heartened by the fact the Fed made this information available
to the public.
   ``God bless Johnson ... because we can all start thinking the
same way,'' said William V. Sullivan, director of money market
research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The Fed has operated in a
cloak of secrecy.''
   He said ``the new regime seems to be more open'' under Chairman
Alan Greenspan than it was under Paul A. Volcker, who left office
last summer.
   ``The Fed enjoys a certain amount of secrecy,'' said F. Ward
McCarthy, chief financial economist for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets. ``The less the public knows ... the easier it is for it to
do its job.
   ``But I don't think it's always intentional. I think for a
period of time they couldn't decide exactly what was driving
monetary policy.''
   At a conference sponsored by the Cato Institute in Washington,
Johnson noted that the relationship between the money supply and
the economy has become less predictable in recent years. He
admitted that as a result there was always a mystery about what
numbers the Fed was watching, and that was unhealthy for the credit
markets.
   The value of the dollar, commodity prices and the yield-curve
might not be perfect indicators, Johnson said, but together they
provide a clearer picture of whether the economy is heating up.
   Economists say the Fed is likely to keep lowering interest rates
to stimulate the economy until the indicators point toward
inflation.
   The credit markets have been closely tracking those same
indicators for some time, pushing interest rates higher at the sign
of rising inflation and lower with sluggish economic growth.
   ``This reaffirms the perception that the markets are the
ultimate critic of monetary policy,'' said McCarthy.
   Johnson's remarks this past week means the Fed and the credit
markets are on the same wavelength, said Maria F. Ramirez, a top
economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and they also provide a
clearer indication as to where rates might be heading.
   ``This could reduce volatility'' in bond prices, said Sullivan.
   But Carol A. Stone, senior economist for Nomura Securities Inc.,
said, ``It could mean somewhat more volatility because the markets
know the Fed is looking at particular things,'' and they might
overreact.

<HEAD>UAW Local Sues Chrysler Over Planned Kenosha Plant Closing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Autoworkers Union Local 72 filed a
lawsuit Friday against Chrysler Corp., alleging the company is
breaking federal laws by pulling auto production from Kenosha and
putting 5,500 people out of work.
   In reponse, Chrysler said a preliminary review of the suit
indicated it was ``without merit.''
   The suit, which also names as defendants the city of Detroit and
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said Chrysler
obtained about $50 million in federal grants to modernize its
Jefferson Avenue plant in Detroit, said James Eggleston, an
attorney for the union.
   He said that when Chrysler applied for the federal money, the
carmaker said it would make mid-sized trucks at the old Jefferson
Avenue plant to keep jobs there during the modernization of the
facility.
   But now the company plans to shift production of the L-body
Omni-Horizon cars to Detroit from Kenosha, he said. Chrysler
announced last month it planned to close the Kenosha plant by fall.
   ``The lawsuit is trying to prevent the use of federal funds to
destroy a community,'' Eggleston said.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee, and it
seeks an injunction to force Chrysler to keep its plant in Kenosha
open while continuing its upgrading of the Jefferson Avenue plant.
   In its response, Chrysler said, ``Our lawyers have not had time
to thoroughly examine the complaint but based on a preliminary
review the lawsuit is without merit.''
   ``The government money is for the new Jefferson facility. No
government money will be spent at the old Jefferson plant where the
L-body (Omni-Horizon) will be produced,'' Chrysler said in the
statement.
   Bob Berg, spokesman for Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, said the
city has not received formal notification of the lawsuit and would
not comment until it was able to examine the filing.
   Chrysler announced late last month the Kenosha plant would close.
   Eggleston said $15 million of the federal money came under the
Urban Development Action Grant program, which he said cannot be
used to transplant jobs from one community to another.
   The remaining $35 million came under a community development
block grant, which Eggleston said requires an impact study be done
by the federal government and Detroit. The suit said that the grant
was approved without assessing ``the significant adverse effects on
the human environment in Kenosha.''
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has offered to divert profits from
this year's car sales in Wisconsin to create a trust fund for the
laid off autoworkers. Iacocca also said while the automaker may
have raised expectations in Wisconsin, it made no promises to keep
the Kenosha plant open.

<HEAD>Texas Sees Decline in Oil Output in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Final figures likely will show that Texas crude
oil production fell about 8 percent during 1987, the Texas Railroad
Commission reported Friday.
   Commission Chairman Jim Nugent said the state's oil production
still is suffering from the effects of the 1986 plunge in world oil
prices.
   ``Texas' oil production decline steepened in 1987. Final
production numbers should show a drop of 60 million barrels, or
about 8 percent, from 1986,'' Nugent said.
   A barrel is equivalent to 42 gallons.
   Nugent said the state's daily production rate fell 80,000
barrels a day between January and December 1987.
   ``That's not surprising when you look at the number of wells
that have been dropped off production over the last two years,'' he
said.
   ``Between the end of 1985 and the fall of last year, we lost
production from some 30,000 stripper wells and more than 9,000 of
the better-producing wells,'' Nugent said.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up; Personal Income, Consumer Spending Also Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices, consumer spending and personal income all rose
by 0.3 percent in January, while home sales fell for a third
consecutive month.
   The reports Friday left the picture of a U.S. economy
experiencing continued moderate inflation and weaker growth in
spending by consumers.
   In the financial markets, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 5.64 points to 2,023.21, finishing the week with a
net gain of 8.62 points. Bond prices edged higher and the dollar
slipped slightly.
   The increase in consumer prices in January was about the same
rate of inflation as through 1987, but a large decline in energy
costs cloaked hefty increases in many other areas.
   The advance was equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 4.2
percent, according to Labor Department analysts. That compares to
the 4.4 percent actual rate of inflation posted for 1987 and is
also in line with the Reagan administration's projection of 4.3
percent inflation for 1988.
   Analysts said that many of the price increases may reflect
one-time-only increases timed to coincide with the beginning of the
year.
   ``There were a lot of price increases that come at the first of
the year, but I'm not overly alarmed,'' said Lawrence Chimerine,
chairman of the Wefa Group, a Philadelphia-area forecasting service.
   But Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist,
called the report ``a bit worrisome.''
   In another economic reports Friday:
   _The Commerce Department said Americans' personal incomes and
consumer spending both rose at moderate rates of 0.3 percent in
January, less than half the 0.7 gains both posted in December.
Economists expect weakening consumer spending this year as the
economy slows down.
   The gains were taken as positive signs that consumer spending,
while not growing as briskly as it did during the early years of
the economic recovery, will at least expand enough this year to
keep the economy out of a recession.
   _A real estate trade group said sales of existing homes fell 3.6
percent in January, the third consecutive monthly decline. The
National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing
single-family homes were at their slowest pace since June 1985.
   The association said that consumer fears raised by the collapse
of the stock market in October were partly to blame for the
slowdown.

<HEAD>Bearishness Dominates Oil Market, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices continue to be weighed down by an
overwhelming mood of bearishness in the market, analysts say.
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
closed at $15.78 per 42-gallon barrel, down 14 cents from Thursday.
   It was the second day in a row that the near-month crude
contract closed below $16 since Dec. 21, when it settled at $15.16.
   Among March contracts for refined products, wholesale heating
oil closed at 45.70 cents a gallon, up 0.48 cent from Thursday,
while wholesale unleaded gasoline settled at 45.26 cents a gallon,
0.11 cent lower.
   Heating oil was the only bright spot during the day, drawing
strong demand because of a perception that inventories are
``relatively low,'' said Andrew Lebow, an analyst at the Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. securities firm.
   But he said the prevailing sentiment ``is still bearish,''
adding that he joined other traders in expecting further declines
for crude prices next week.
   John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said his firm shared that view, citing
overproduction by OPEC as ``the overriding issue.''
   O'Dea said the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have been operating on an
``every-man-for-himself'' basis, producing as much oil as necessary
for their respective shares of the market, despite slack demand and
burgeoning inventories.
   As a result, he said, this has only increased downward pressure
on prices.
