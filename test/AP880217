   ``Empire of the Sun'' was named best movie and
its director, Steven Spielberg, and young star, Christian Bale,
also received honors as the National Board of Review of Motion
Pictures presented its 1987 awards Tuesday night.
   A lifetime achievement award was given to Lillian Gish, who also
was named best actress for her 105th film, ``The Whales of August''
_ an award shared with Holly Hunter for ``Broadcast News.'' Michael
Douglas was named best actor for his performance in ``Wall Street.''
   The National Board was founded in 1909 to oppose censorship and
reward excellence on the screen. Its D.W. Griffith Awards have been
given annually since 1917. Miss Gish's first film, ``An Unseen
Enemy,'' was directed by Griffith in 1912.
   Bale, 13, was given a special award, the first the National
Board has given to a child actor.
   Neither Miss Hunter nor Miss Gish, recuperating from a fall in
January, was present. Miss Gish's best friend, Helen Hayes, said,
``She was bullied into staying home. I'm sure that doctor has been
dismissed.''
   Michael Douglas, accepting the best actor award from Glenn
Close, his costar in ``Fatal Attraction,'' called his part in
``Wall Street'' ``the best I've ever had.'' He thanked Oliver Stone
and Stanley Wise, who wrote it.
   Spielberg said ``Empire of the Sun'' was ``the hardest movie any
of us involved have ever made.'' He called Christian Bale, who did
not attend, ``a regular kid _ I think a lot of that came out in the
movie.''
   ``If Christian Bale hadn't existed, we had no second choice. He
carried this movie really all by himself,'' Spielberg said.
   Host Jose Ferrer called ``Empire of the Sun'' ``a powerful and
richly human anti-war film.'' Spielberg said that if Griffith had
made the movie, it would have cost ``about $175,000, in the early
part of this century.''
   Olympia Dukakis, cousin of the Massachusetts governor, was named
best supporing actress for her role as Cher's mother in
``Moonstruck.'' Sean Connery, who wasn't present, was named best
supporting actor for``The Untouchables,'' in which he played a
tough Irish cop.
   The two-part ``Jean de Florette''-``Manon of the Spring'' from
France was named best foreign film.
   The award for best documentary went to ``Chuck Berry: Hail!
Hail! Rock 'n' Roll'' begins with John Lennon saying, ``If you
tried to give rock 'n' roll another name, you might call it Chuck
Berry.'' Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, presented the award to
performer-songwriter Berry.
   Lee Remick received a special television award. Frank Rowley,
who will choose vintage movies for the Biograph Theater, which will
open Friday near Carnegie Hall, also received a special award.
   Ceremonies were held at the Library for the Performing Arts in
Lincoln Center. Recipients of the awards are known ahead of time.
One of the presenters, actress Judith Ivey, drew applause when she
said, ``We're not sitting here waiting for an envelope to be
opened. Some people think that's entertaining. I think it's sick.''

<HEAD>Former Broker Pleads Guilty To Illegal Trading Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former broker pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges
that he defrauded his employer of more than $1 million in a scheme
involving illegal trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Jeffrey Donnelly, 28, of Chicago, a former trader in Standard &
Poor's 500 stock index-futures contracts, pleaded guilty to two
counts of commodities fraud, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard
Pearl.
   U.S. District Judge James Alesia set sentencing for April 7,
Pearl said. Donnelly, a former employee of CRT Services Inc., faces
a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
   Under a plea agreement, Pearl said, the government reserves the
right to grant Donnelly immunity from prosecution in return for his
testimony.
   Donnelly was expelled by the Merc last March and fined $100,000
on charges of fraudulent trading. The charges to which he pleaded
guilty were brought last week.
   The plea agreement states that he defrauded CRT Services by
diverting money from profitable S&P futures trades to four accounts
between January 1984 and July 1986.
   Authorities charged that Donnelly split the profits with four
other people after diverting the money into their accounts.
Donnelly's share, 35 percent of the profits, amounted to $350,000,
prosecutors said.
   Pearl said Donnelly already has paid back some of the money.
   ``He and the others have made substantial restitution,'' the
attorney said.
   Pearl would not say whether the other four would be charged. But
he said the investigation is continuing.
   Donnelly was among 10 men charged Feb. 9 with fraudulent trading
in commodity futures. The men were accused in four separate schemes
_ one of which, authorities said, involved the use of wigs, makeup
and phony credentials to gain access to trading pits. But Donnelly
was involved only in the scheme to which he pleaded guilty Tuesday.

   Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern didn't mind
playing two squares in the comedy hymn to marital fidelity, ``She's
Having a Baby.'' In fact, they liked the movie's emphasis on
old-style morals.
   ``Old-fashioned is new-fashioned, let's face it,'' Bacon said.
   Director-writer John Hughes ``is basically an old-values type of
guy in all his movies,'' McGovern said. And his story of a young
couple, Jake and Kristy Briggs, is ``a tribute to suburbia'' and to
the virtue of commitment.
   Though the actors are young _ Bacon is 29, McGovern is 26 _ both
are examples of another old-fashioned virtue: hard work. They
recently talked about just how hard it was to bring out ``Baby.''
   One scene _ the Briggs' wedding _ was shot over 26 consecutive
hours. It was filmed in the Winnetka Congregational Church in
Illinois, which was available for only a limited time.
   Two versions of the scene were filmed: a straight-forward
account of the wedding, and Jake's hallucination about what his
wedding vows really mean.
   ``Wilt thou listen to endless conversations about children's
clothes and decorator checkbooks?'' the minister asks in the
fantasy version.
   The marathon session demanded a lot of Bacon. ``I actually fell
asleep on my feet,'' he said.
   Bacon, who previously appeared in ``Diner'' and ``Footloose,''
is on the screen in almost every frame of the film. In one scene,
Jake sits outside the church with his best man, who tries to tempt
him not to get married.
   The struggle, Bacon says, was to win the audience's sympathy,
despite the fact that his character is on the brink of jilting the
beautiful Kristy.
   ``I really wanted him to seem like a little boy in a monkey
suit, and that was difficult,'' Bacon said.
   McGovern's travails were more subtle. Her character, Kristy,
appears bland. But she's not, said the actress.
   Kristy is ``very strong, although she doesn't necessarily appear
on the surface to be strong,'' said McGovern, who first drew
attention in the industry with her portrayal of Timothy Hutton's
girlfriend in 1980 in the Academy Award-winning ``Ordinary
People.'' The next year, she had a supporting actress Oscar
nomination for her role in ``Ragtime.''
   ``She's a person you wouldn't ever think twice about,'' McGovern
said. But before the end of the movie, ``The door opens on her soul
and you see how much there is she has to offer.''
   Both actors lauded Hughes' direction. ``As strong and
independent as I come off on the set, I need a director who will
say, `OK, that's good, you got it,''' Bacon said. Hughes did that
for him.
   McGovern agreed. ``I always felt supported and I always knew
that he would guide me.''
   By the end of the filming, Hughes trusted Bacon to improvise.
One touching and funny result has Jake trying natural childbirth
methods _ massaging his abdomen and panting _ while Kristy gives
birth in another room.
   ``By that point I'd been playing this character so many times
and in so many different situations that I really felt that I knew
him and John knew him. ... And he just kind of said, `We'll turn
the camera on and you just hang out in the room and do what you
would do.''
   The tension Bacon has felt in front of the camera in other
movies didn't apply in this one, he said. ``John sort of blows all
that tension right out of the water,'' by letting the camera roll
during retakes instead of shouting, ``Action!'' or ``Cut!'' a lot.
   The atmosphere during filming was relaxed enough for Bacon to
bring along his dog, Jane, whom he calls ``a Labrador deceiver'' _
a mutt that's part Lab.
   Bacon and McGovern are both accomplished on the New York stage,
and are used to feeding on the energy of an audience. But in a way,
McGovern said, the director filled that function.
   ``When he was looking at me he would see Kristy, he wouldn't see
Elizabeth,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The letters, phone calls and telegrams come
from across the nation, but the message to police and state Parole
Board members is almost always the same: Thomas Trantino must not
go free.
   Nearly 25 years after Trantino and an accomplice shot Sgt. Peter
Voto and officer Gary Tedesco to death at point-blank range in a
nightclub here, emotions still run high.
   From an accountant in nearby Teaneck: ``The courts and the
parole system should start to recognize the danger which these
criminals present to society. If he killed in cold blood two police
officers who were in uniform, how can those of us who are citizens
in plain clothes be safe?''
   From a Connecticut woman: ``I don't want to hear that he is a
model prisoner who is now a writer, a painter. ... They are
forgetting he has one other glaring accomplishment, and that is
that he committed a cold-blooded murder of two human beings.''
   The prospect of release has sparked a petition drive,
legislative proposals, a letter-writing campaign and a candlelight
rally by more than 1,500 people to convince the Parole Board that
Trantino must remain behind bars.
   The case has also revived debate over an old question: When has
a murderer finally paid his debt to society?
   Paramus Police Chief Joseph Delaney, a leader of the campaign
against parole, said many feel ``the people who commit the violent
acts aren't getting punishment that fits the crime.''
   ``They want to see pure, unadulterated punishment,'' he added.
``Don't say `life in prison' for someone and then let him out 15,
20 or 25 years later.''
   On Aug. 26, 1963, Trantino and Frank Falco were at the Angel
Lounge celebrating a robbery. When Voto and Tedesco arrived to
investigate a disturbance, Trantino and Falco surprised them,
partially stripped them and shot them.
   Falco was killed the next day by police trying to capture him.
Trantino was caught, convicted and sentenced to die in the electric
chair.
   The sentence was commuted to life when New Jersey's death
penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972. In 1980, the full
Parole Board voted to release Trantino, provided that he make
restitution to the families of his victims.
   The decision sparked an outcry, and in 1982 the board voted to
keep Trantino locked up for 10 more years, a term that was cut
almost in half through credits for good behavior and work.
   A two-member panel decided last month that he should be paroled
March 15, but the full board has decided to review the decision.
   A Parole Board official, citing policy, declined to explain the
decision. However, under state law Trantino can be paroled only if
he shows ``no substantial likelihood of future criminal activity''
and proves he has ``made progression in rehabilitating himself.''
   From 1978 to 1982 Trantino was granted regular furloughs from
prison, which ended after the controversy over his parole. In 1980,
he married the community college English professor who had edited
his prison writings into a book.
   Trantino, 50, is now at the medium-security Riverfront State
Prison in Camden, and declined an interview request. In a 1986
interview he said he had no recollection of the murders and
believed his freedom was long overdue.
   He works in the prison canteen storeroom and participates in a
program that tries to convince juvenile delinquents, in a ``low
key'' way, to change their ways, said Department of Corrections
spokesman James Stabile.
   Victims' rights organizations, Delaney and Voto's brother
Andrew, now police chief in this small blue-collar community, have
been at the forefront of efforts to block parole.
   Recently, Delaney and Voto appeared on Morton Downey Jr.'s
television talk show. The next day about 1,000 people called the
board from across the country to oppose Trantino's release.
   ``He's a classic con artist,'' Delaney said. ``I have dealt with
people in my many years as a cop and there's no question in my mind
that if they release him he will kill again.''
   The case has struck a chord among family members of crime
victims.
   ``Most of the letters that come in to me thank me for picking up
the fight against coddling prisoners. There's too much concern for
these people,'' Voto said.
   ``Why should a man walk out when he was sentenced to death?
There is rehabilitation, and I am for it, but not in these types of
cases ... not an outright killer, a cold-blooded killer.''

<HEAD>Finishing Last, Robertson Says He'll Shine in the South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson
took in stride his bottom-of-the-pile finish in the New Hampshire
primary Tuesday, saying he was ready to shine in the South, ``in my
backyard.''
   With returns nearly complete in the Republican primary,
Robertson was last among the five contenders.
   ``We played in Bob Dole's backyard (in Iowa) and I beat George
Bush there,'' Robertson said. ``We played in New Hampshire, which
according to George Bush is his backyard, and he won convincingly.
   ``Tomorrow morning, I go into the South, and they're going to be
playing in my backyard,'' Robertson said in a concession speech at
a hotel ballroom as several hundred supporters cheered, stomped and
chanted, ``We want Pat!''
   Robertson, 57, with his wife, Dede, at his side, said:
   ``I'm throwing the gauntlet down to Bob Dole and George Bush:
South Carolina is the first Super Tuesday state, and I'm going to
beat you there convincingly.''
   South Carolina Republicans actually vote the Saturday before
Super Tuesday, when 20 states hold caucuses or primaries.
   The crowd cheered again when one supporter yelled out, ``You've
got the biggest backyard, Pat!''
   Earlier, Robertson's national field director, Richard Pinsky,
acknowledged that after Robertson's surprise second-place showing
in the Feb. 8 Iowa caucuses, ``We were hoping to do better here.''
   Robertson said in an interview on NBC-TV: ``Our polling showed
we would have a strong third place. We came up very short on that.''
   Pinsky blamed Robertson's showing on two controversies in the
past week: Kemp's charges about allegations made by a group from
which Robertson distanced himself and Robertson's claim during a
GOP debate Sunday that the Soviet Union has ``nukes in Cuba.''
   Robertson was hounded Monday by questions on his statement
during the debate, and subsequently said his was not ``a
categorical statement per se.''
   But in his concession remarks, Robertson said he will meet with
Cuban leaders in Florida this week, and ``It may be that something
happened in the debate here which may be the key to victory in
Florida.''
   Later he said: ``We've got an issue that came out of here on the
Cuban missiles. I wasn't expecting it to play this way, but I'm
getting reports from Texas and Florida that the people down there
are with me on this issue. So New Hampshire may have given me the
key issue to win the two biggest states in the South.''

<DATELINE>SENDAI, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was once known as the Black Country
because of its long winters, harsh terrain and hard life. Even at
the dawn of this century, it still was a land of barbarian tribes
and powerful feudal warriors _ one of Japan's last frontiers.
   Warrior clans and impoverished peasants lived in isolation among
its vast mountain ranges.
   But it had a bucolic tranquility and Japanese poured in from all
over to enjoy what Japan once was _ volcanic hot springs and rugged
seascapes, folk crafts and villages, old temples and teahouses,
well-tended apple orchards and rice fields.
   This is Tohoku, the Black Country's formal name, and it takes up
the entire northern end of Honshu, Japan's main island.
   But Tohoku's leaders are planning to catapult Tohoku into the
21st century, turning the region into a hub of technological
progress, filled with high-tech factories, seaports and
telecommunications centers.
   If that happens, some fear, Tohoku's culture and way of life
will vanish.
   Some of it already has.
   New highways and high-speed train lines have brought modern
Japan closer to Tohoku. Thousands upon thousands come to its ski
resorts and lakes, snowscapes and primieval marshes in three
national parks, all offering a respite from the urban plain around
Tokyo, a little over 100 miles to the south.
   Sendai is now Tohoku's largest city, with 700,000 residents.
Devastated by World War II bombing, its broad tree-lined boulevards
are a rare product of postwar city planning.
   Between Tohoku's growing cities lie vast wooded mountains and
cultivated plains, where people carry on a simpler, more
traditional Japanese lifestyle.
   Most live in houses that are huge by comparison with those in
Tokyo, but they lack central heating and flush toilets. People's
lives are suited to the seasons: The cold winter months are spend
clustered around quilt-covered heaters called kotatsu, and
observing the traditional festivals and rituals tied to the
planting and harvesting of rice.
   But in Sendai, the Tohoku Federation of Economic Organizations,
a powerful business alliance, is planning a leap into the 21st
century.
   If the federation has its way, rustic northern Japan will become
a network of technolopolises, marinopolises, teletopias and a
``magmapolis'' _ modern cities based on high technology, seaports,
telecommunications and power generation and tourism tied to
volcanic activity.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's ``Furusato (Hometown)
Concept'' _ a plan to establish centers of industry and culture in
rural Japan _ is further encouragement for Tohoku's planners.
   More than 34 foreign firms and some of Japan's leading
electronics companies already have moved their factories from Tokyo
to industrial parks in Tohoku, attracted by tax incentives, lower
land costs and abundant water and energy.
   Real estate cost an average $9 a square foot in Tohoku in 1987,
compared with $110.50 in suburban Tokyo.
   Several company presidents said fresh, skilled labor drew their
firms to Tohoku, where the people are known for their ``serious
character and diligence.''
   Federation officials maintain that high-tech industrial
development poses little threat to the Tohoku's environment.
   But opponents claim the air already has become polluted around
heavily used roads and that even ``clean'' semiconductor factories
must use dangerous chemicals.
   About one-tenth of Japan's 121 million people _ the same number
that live in Tokyo _ live in all of Tohoku, which makes up 20
percent of Japan's land area.
   Toshio Tamakawa, chairman of the Tohoku federation and president
of the region's largest corporation, Tohoku Electric Power, says
Tohoku is an attractive alternative to Tokyo's congestion and high
prices.
   ``People used to say Tohoku was a barbarian hinterland,'' he
said. ``They certainly can't say that anymore.''
   Nearby Matsushima (Pine Island) is still considered one of the
most beautiful spots in Japan, but the Pacific coast to north and
south is a mass of grey factories and shipyards.
   Modernization has brought flashy department stores and hotels to
Sendai, along with subways, urban sprawl and traffic jams.
   But even in quieter, less developed areas, life is changing.
   A few hours north of Sendai in Hiraizumi, taxi driver Kirio
Aoyanagi, in blue uniform and white gloves, talks of how he
returned to his native town from ``miserably lonely'' Tokyo after
living there almost 10 years, to marry and raise his family.
   Aoyanagi now guides tourists through ancient temples and
describes the floods, wars and fires that destroyed most of
Hiraizumi, a city built around 1100 by the powerful Fujiwara clan
that was once a center of political power.
   Aoyanagi says he and others can't live by farming alone, and
need factory jobs. But he worries that old traditions are
disappearing as Tohoku grows more modern and less isolated.
   ``It's not like it used to be,'' he said. ``People are becoming
self-centered just like in Tokyo. The younger generation is
completely different.''
   A giant Buddha's face loomed out of a nearby cliff in a quiet
mountain valley. Below, a group of farmers, in traditional aprons
and kerchiefs, worked at rethatching a farmhouse roof _ a picture
of the past.
   ``I want to keep Tohoku a good place to live,'' Aoyanagi said,
``where people care about each other, and not just their money.''

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospitals in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip are overcrowded and increasingly
overwhelmed with victims of Israel's policy of using beatings and
blows to subdue Arab protesters.
   Last Wednesday at the Gaza Strip's largest Shifa Hospital,
Palestinian doctors set the broken limbs of 24 Arabs clubbed by
Israeli soldiers, then swiftly discharged them to make room for
more.
   In the West Bank's Nablus on Friday, troops fired rubber bullets
and smashed windows with their rifle butts to break into Al Ittihad
Hospital and detain four Arabs suspected of throwing stones.
   A wall was smeared with blood where docors said the Arabs were
beaten and six windows were broken, one punctured with a rubber
bullet.
   Besides treating scores of victims, Palestinian hospitals have
served as havens for Arab protesters trying to elude detention
after anti-Israeli demonstrations.
   Shifa Hospital has been a staging ground for riots by hundreds
of Palestinians who hurled firebombs and stones at soldiers. Troops
stormed the hospital twice within two days in December and shot
dead two Arabs.
   ``This is a situation worse than on the TV serial `M-A-S-H,'''
said Dr. H. Jack Geiger, a member of a fact-finding team from the
Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights that visited hospitals in
the territories.
   ``People are stitching wounds without gloves and without
anesthesia. These hospitals are completely inadequate for the
treatment of this kind of trauma and do not meet an acceptable
standard,'' Geiger said last Wednesday.
   As Geiger spoke at Shifa, a large ginger-colored cat wandered
through wards that reeked with the smell of urine and feces. Thick
fetid water filled clogged-up toilets and sinks in the bathroom and
a pool of open sewage ran on the floor.
   At Alia Hospital in Hebron last week, an Associated Press
reporter watched doctors stitch up the wounds of Palestinian
patients lying on blood-stained stretchers on the emergency room
floor because all the beds were filled.
   A doctor stitched shut a deep gash on the head of a 20-year-old
man shaking with pain, while in a stretcher beside him another
doctor set a man's broken forearm.
   ``We work with the minimal medical standards,'' said Dr. Ahmed
Yassih of Shifa, which like Hebron's Alia Hospital is Israeli-run.
``Every time we operate there is a shortage.''
   ``One day there was no clean linen. Another day, no water. Then
no towels, no sterile instruments. Sometimes we work without
electricity or have no silk thread for stitches,'' said Yassih, one
of four Palestinian surgeons who perform most operations at Shifa.
   Yassih said he discharged 45 Palestinians with beating injuries,
including 24 with broken limbs, after only a few hours of treatment
last Wednesday.
   ``There just aren't enough beds,'' Yassih said. ``We get more
and more cases every day. I have to keep at least 15 beds free for
emergencies.''
   Lying in rows of narrow metal frame beds were dozens of
Palestinians recovering from more serious beating injuries and
gunshot wounds.
   One 17-year-old Palestinian student, Jihad Al Achronz of Rafah,
was paralyzed from the waist down from a bullet wound that
punctured a spinal nerve.
   Another 14-year-old, Ahmed Al Khalud of Jabaliya refugee camp,
suffered epileptic seizures, incontinence and paralysis of his
lower spine and upper leg from a bullet wound to the back.
   Youssef Hamad, 40, screamed as doctors lifted him to examine a
swollen black bruise from his neck to lower back. Both Hamad's arms
and legs were in casts, his bandaged head had 12 deep gashes, and
several ribs were fractured.
   Hamad said he was beaten by 10 soldiers who accused him of
raising the outlawed Palestinian flag on a Gaza City street.
   Yasih said beating victims often were from the same family or
section of a refugee camp and frequently were clubbed at night. He
said he treated 12 members of the Al Masri family from Gaza, six of
whom had broken limbs.
   ``We find people injured in the same places over and over: the
upper chest, legs, back, knees, arms, hands and elbows,'' Yassih
said. He said about half the victims treated at Shifa had broken
legs and 60 percent had broken hands.
   Yassih also said many Palestinians were reluctant to go to Shifa
or other Israeli-run hospitals because hospital officials are
required to give patients' names to the army, which patrols outside
the hospital gate.
   Three days earlier, troops entered the hospital and took three
Arab patients from their beds, reinforcing Palestinians' fears, the
doctor said.

   ABC only got a silver in the ratings the first
week of Winter Olympics coverage, but ABC's ``World News Tonight''
was golden for the first time since August, snapping CBS' 20-week
win streak.
   The first two nights of the Olympics, Saturday and Sunday,
varied widely in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, but according to ABC
averaged higher than the first two nights of the 1984 games.
   An estimated 25 million viewers saw Sunday night's coverage,
featuring pairs figure skating, putting it in the top 10 with a
19.7 rating and a 30 share. But Saturday's coverage of hockey was
in the bottom 10 with a 9.9 rating and 17 share.
   The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with
televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are
tuned to that program.
   The first two nights of the 1984 games were a Tuesday and a
Wednesday, and had a combined rating of 13.8 compared to 15.5 for
this year, said ABC.
   ABC's highest rated show of the week wasn't the Olympics, but
the conclusion of the two-part miniseries ``Elvis and Me,'' the
highest-rated miniseries so far this season.
   But NBC handily won the week ending Feb. 14, with an average
prime-time rating of 16.2. ABC was second with 14.9. CBS was third
with 14.2. After winning 19 of the 21 weeks so far in the season,
NBC has an average rating of 16.4, and CBS and ABC are tied with
13.6.
   The 10 top-rated shows of the week were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC,
``A Different World'' NBC, ``Elvis and Me, Part 2'' ABC, ``Cheers''
NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``Growing Pains'' ABC, ``Night Court''
NBC, ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``L.A. Law'' NBC and the Winter
Olympics Sunday coverage on ABC.
   NBC's new ``Sonny Spoon,'' starring Mario Van Peebles as a
chameleon private eye, premiered last Friday with so-so numbers,
ranking 49th.
   The lowest rated shows of the week were: ``Our House,'' Winter
Olympics Saturday coverage, ``West 57th,'' ``The Law and Harry
McGraw,'' ``Decision '88 _ The Iowa Caucus,'' ``Star Trek II: The
Wrath of Khan,'' ``The Thorns,'' ``48 Hours in Israel,'' ``Sledge
Hammer!'' and ``The Charmings.''
   For the week ending Feb. 12, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had an
average rating of 11.8 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had
an 11.1 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.9 and 19.
   Network analysts had no immediate explanation for ABC's showing.
However, last week's ratings could have been affected by coverage
of the Iowa caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential
race.
   ``We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or
coverage of Chernobyl, and with live programming like the Iran
hearings and political coverage,'' said ABC News spokeswoman Elise
Adde.
   ABC's prime-time special on Iowa ranked a respectable 44 out of
68. It followed the conclusion of ``Elvis and Me.'' NBC's Iowa
coverage ranked 63rd. CBS delayed its coverage of Iowa until 11:30
p.m. EST, after prime time.
   The last time ABC was first in news ratings was the week of Aug.
10, 1987.

   A smelt fisherman who fell into the
Cowlitz River learned what it's like to be netted when his fellow
smelt dippers dipped him out.
   ``Before I realized it, I was in a very swift, icy stream, my
waist-high wading boots were full of water and they were dragging
me under,'' Elton ``Tommy'' Krueger, who cannot swim, said after
his rescue Sunday.
   Five other smelt dippers held out their long-handled nets to
Krueger, 72, of Wapato, after he slipped in from the muddy river
bank.
   ``I grabbed and they dipped me out,'' he said.
   Krueger said he brought home a near-limit of smelt, not counting
the four that he poured back into the river when he emptied his
boots.

   The 130 Palestinian deportees whose voyage
home was aborted by the bombing of their ship this week include
prominent Arab proponents of peace with Israel as well as others
who advocate violence.
   Most were expelled from their Israeli-occupied homeland without
trial, under a process considered illegal by virtually every nation
except Israel.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization gathered the deportees and
hundreds of observers in Athens for a trip back to Israel aboard a
``ship of return.''
   Their goal was to focus attention on Israel's policy of exiling
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Participants said the voyage would have been probably the
largest non-violent action attempted by the PLO.
   ``We have chosen to go back with no guns, no explosives, not
even any stones,'' said Mohammed Milhem, deported mayor of the West
Bank city of Halhoul.
   Israeli leaders had vowed to block the ship from reaching
Israel's shores.
   On Monday, before the deportees could fly from Athens to the
port of Limassol, Cyprus, to begin the protest voyage, an explosion
left a hole below the waterline of the ferry bought for the trip. A
day before, three PLO guerrillas were killed in a car bombing also
in Limassol.
   The PLO accused Israel of responsibility.
   The planned voyage carries echoes of the 1947 trip of the ship
Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned
back by British forces as they tried to reach Palestine.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had called the
PLO-sponsored trip a ``declaration of war'' on Israel and branded
participants as ``terrorists and those who want to kill us, every
one of us.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in 1985 that deportations
were effective ``for those who instigate and call for participation
in terror, even though they themselves are not active.''
   The same 1945 British Mandate laws used by Israel for many of
the deportations were applied against Shamir and other Israeli
leaders who led guerrilla bands that assassinated and bombed
British soldiers and Arabs in the 1940s.
   The U.N. Security Council denounced the deportations in 1980 and
again last month, saying they contravened the 1949 Geneva
Convention.
   ``Their goal is to leave our people leaderless,'' said
Abdul-Jawad Saleh, exiled in 1973, a year after his re-election as
mayor of Al-Bireh.
   Among those listed for the trip are the president of Bir Zeit
University, the president of the Jerusalem Higher Islamic Council,
the Jordanian mayor of Jerusalem, the deputy mayor of Jenin and the
assistant Anglican archbishop of Jerusalem.
   Milhem, expelled in 1980 and elected to the PLO Executive
Committee in 1984, often has been suggested as a moderate
Palestinian negotiator for Middle East peace talks.
   Saleh described himself as ``a non-violent activist,'' and said
he was never told specifically what triggered his deportation.
   He recalled that Israeli military officials had summoned him to
warn against founding agricultural cooperatives and ordered him to
stop protesting on behalf of villagers outside Al-Bireh.
   Like Milhem and many other exiles, Saleh said he favors
acceptance of Israel alongside a Palestinian state. ``Two states to
live in peace together in the same country,'' was the way Anglican
Bishop Eliya Khoury put it.
   Not all deportees agree with that view.
   Four Palestinians expelled last month issued a statement shortly
after arriving in Lebanon, saying Islamic radicals there should
``threaten to execute'' three Israeli hostages if Israel kept up
its crackdown on Palestinians in the occupied lands. More than 50
Palestinians have been killed in rioting in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since Dec. 8, most of them by Israeli gunfire.
   According to Palestinian and Jordanian officials, Israel has
deported up to 3,000 Palestinians.
   Many deportees say they want peace with Israelis, but within an
Arab-dominated Palestinian state.
   ``My brother and my grandfather and his father and my children
were born in Palestine,'' said Nashaat Labadeh, a Nablus school
principal. ``This is our land. Palestine belongs to us.''
   He said he was deported largely for his involvement in a 1968
teachers' strike against Israel's attempt to impose its school
books on West Bank pupils.
   Saleh said Israel should not close its doors to those who have
attacked it in the past.
   ``Even if we were terrorists, and we are demanding a peaceful
solution, I think we are the people to make peace with,'' he said.
   ``You don't make peace with your friends. You make peace with
your enemies.''

   A city official says transit agency employees are
suspected sabotaging safety devices on train doors.
   ``This appears to be an insider problem, someone who obviously
knows enough about cars to disable them,'' said Frank Wilson, the
Chicago Transit Authority's senior deputy executive director in
charge of maintenance.
   Inspectors at a rail yard discovered the vandalism, involving
the air-filled rubber edges that prevent doors from closing on
passengers, Wilson said.
   Over the weekend, 25 doors on 18 cars were vandalized, he said.
Air hoses either were disconnected or cut cleanly where they
connect to a compressor, Wilson said Monday.
   On Tuesday, crews found 11 new cases of apparent tampering,
including five instances of damage to cars that had been repaired
since the weekend, he said.
   There were no passenger injuries linked to the faulty doors.
   Wilson has been very outspoken about the agency's problems since
coming to Chicago a month ago from a similar post in Philadelphia.
   Last fall, the transit authority suspected employee sabotage
when fuses necessary for emergency brake systems were missing in
100 cars. An investigation failed to produce any suspects.

   George Bush got the win he so badly needed
in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary Tuesday and
proclaimed ``reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.'' Bob
Dole fumed over what he called campaign distortions and told Bush,
``Quit lying about my record.''
   ``Thank you, New Hampshire,'' Bush said, apt words of gratitude
to the state that revived his presidential hopes. ``On to the
South, where we're going to rise again.''
   Dole accused Bush's campaign of distorting his record in a
flurry of late television commercials aired in New Hampshire. The
Kansas senator said the ads unfairly accused him of backing an oil
import fee and trying to raise taxes. After complaining for much of
the evening, he was asked if he had anything to say to Bush during
a live interview with both men on NBC-TV.
   ``Yeah, quit lying about my record,'' Dole said. ``I'm not for
raising anybody's taxes and he knows that; I'm not advocating a $10
oil import fee, and he knows that _ but they were on the ads all
weekend.''
   Dole also said he regretted not answering Bush more forcefully
during the waning days of the New Hampshire campaign, saying he had
been ``too kind.''
   Bush led with 38 percent to Dole's 29 percent, with all
precincts reporting.
   The remaining three GOP candidates lagged far behind _ New York
Rep. Jack Kemp at 13 percent, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont at
10 percent and former television evangelist Pat Robertson at 10
percent
   A sixth candidate, Alexander Haig, dropped out of the race
Friday and registered less than 1 percent.
   Kemp claimed he was in third place and sought to make that sound
like a victory. ``We won the contest for the conservative wing, and
now we're going to contest fo the whole nomination of the
Republican Party,'' Kemp said.
   Robertson looked ahead to primaries in the South, saying he had
competed in Dole's backyard of Iowa and Bush's in New Hampshire.
``Tomorrow morning we go into the South and they're going to be
playing in my backyard,'' Robertson said.
   He pointed to South Carolina, which holds a GOP primary three
days before the rest of the South votes on Super Tuesday March 8.
``I'm going to beat you there convincingly,'' he said to his rivals.
   Du Pont also contended he was in the running with Kemp and
Robertson for third place. He called it ``a virtual tie'' among
those three and said, ``That's got to be good.''
   Dole said: ``It's better to win, and I congratulate the winner.
I can stand here with my head held high.''
   Dole said Bush had distorted his record by accusing him of
backing tax increases. Dole, who was battling a reputation as a
slashing campaigner earned in his 1976 vice presidential race,
suggested he may come back at Bush as the campaign turns to the
South in the coming three weeks.
   ``I think we should have answered the charges. I mean, I think
you can be too kind to your opponent and we were,'' Dole said.
``They kept saying Bob Dole wants to raise taxes. They know that
was not accurate. ... We wanted to keep it positive and see if it
worked.
   ``It's unfortunate that the vice president of the United States,
who knows better, would sink to that level,'' Dole said.
   Asked later about Dole's accusing remark, Bush said: ``I don't
know what he's talking about.'' But Bush's campaign in Washington
issued a statement quoting Bush four times over the last six months
saying he would support the oil tax.
   Dole has said he would consider the oil import fee but would
rebate the fee to homeowners who use oil for heat.
   Bush's victory came after his once-strong advantage in the polls
had evaporated following his dismal showing in Iowa a week ago.
Dole forces pointed to that comeback, even as it fell short.
   ``We were down more than 20 points eight days ago,'' said Dole
campaign manager William Brock. ``To have come this close is a
tremendous commentary on Bob Dole and also ... on the softness of
the vice president's supporters.
   ``If he is going to have this kind of a problem in the South ...
he's got a real problem,'' Brock said.
   Earlier in the day, Bush said ``things have dramatically turned
around'' for him in New Hampshire, just as they did for Ronald
Reagan in 1980.
   Bush pointed cheerfully to the traditional first returns that
were counted just after midnight in tiny Dixville Notch in the
state's northern mountains. There he was a winner, with 11 votes to
Dole's 6.
   Bush's once-substantial lead in polls in the state evaporated
following Dole's two-to-one victory over him in Iowa's caucuses a
week earlier. But daily polling by the television networks
indicated the trend to Dole tailed off by the weekend and the race
stabilized into a virtual dead heat.
   Bush also found comfort in New Hampshire's history of rejecting
Iowa winners _ including himself in 1980.
   ``He did what I did in 1980,'' Bush said of Dole. ``He won in
Iowa and came in and talked about momentum. I did what Presidnt
Reagan did. He came in and started talking the issues'' after
losing to Bush in Iowa.
   Bush searched urgently following his Iowa debacle for a way to
better deliver his message _ that he is the logical heir to
Reagan's conservative legacy.
   He was an insulated candidate who rarely made contact with
reporters in Iowa, a time when he was beset with questions over his
role in sales of U.S. missiles to Iran. But with his politial
future on the line after the Iowa defeat, Bush began asking for
votes with apparent emotion and uncharacteristically climbed into
the cab of a big truck and drove a forklift to try to display a
common man's touch.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis claimed
``a great victory'' in the New Hampshire presidential primary
Tuesday, moving to the front of the Democratic field with the
backing of his neighbors.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri _ the winner last week in the
Iowa caucuses _ held onto the No. 2 spot, besting Sen. Paul Simon
of Illinois for the second time in a row.
   ``It's really a great victory in many ways,'' Dukakis said,
``because these are the people who know me best and they had to
test me, not as neighbor, but as a presidential candidate.
   ``It's just a terrific boost. Obviously, it's going to be very
important as we go into the South and the Middle West,'' he said.
   But the Massachusetts governor would not claim the
front-runner's crown: ``I'm wary of that label.''
   With all precincts reporting, Dukakis had 36 percent, Gephardt
20 percent and Simon 17 percent.
   Further back were Jesse Jackson at 8 percent, Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee at 7 percent, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt at
5 percent and former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado at 4 percent.
   Gephardt said he did well across the state, exaggerating his
showing a bit by claiming, ``The only thing we didn't carry was the
Boston suburbs.''
   ``About a week ago, they said we couldn't compete in New
Hampshire,'' Gephardt said. Now, he declared, ``It appears that
we've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race in the rest of the country, but
that could change.''
   And the Missouri congressman said money is not a problem.
   ``We're raising money at a good clip,'' he said. ``We are going
to be fine for Super Tuesday.''
   That was not the case for Simon, whose campaign was alrady
$500,000 in debt before the primary.
   ``This is not helping,'' Simon said. ``From the financial point
of view, if I were 3 percentage points ahead instead of 3 points
behind, it would make a huge difference in collecting money.''
   Babbitt was next-to-last and Hart last, but both refused to end
their campaigns.
   ``This nomination is not won in one week or 30 days, it's going
to be a six-month campaign,'' said Hart, who won New Hampshire in
1984.
   Hart, who re-entered the race saying ``let the voters decide,''
admitted he would have to start doing better: ``It will take at
least 30 to 60 days to determine whether or not I can put together
a viable candidacy.''
   Asked if he was going to withdraw, Babbitt said, ``No way. I'm
going to move on to Washington in a couple of days and call and
talk to my supporters all over the country and ask them this
question: how ... can we keep this reform movement alive? Should I
wage a guerilla campaign or should I withdraw or do something else?
''
   Jackson said he was satisfied with his showing here. ``Our
message has won... They outspent me 10-to-1. And yet a poor
campaign, a rich message has been successful in New Hampshire,'' he
said.
   Gore said he did better than anticipated in New Hampshire and
had no regrets about doing little campaigning there.
   ``We made a decision not to spent a million dollars on two or
three delegates. We're saving that for the 1,400 delegates here in
the Super Tuesday states,'' Gore said in Houston. He was the only
candidate who wasn't in New Hampshire Tuesday night.
   Simon and Gephardt had been concentrating their fire on each
other until the final weekend, when both switched to ads attacking
Dukakis.
   ``I haven't been watching a lot of television lately, but I'm
told people have been saying some pretty nasty things about me,''
Dukakis said. ``I assume that's going to take its toll.''
   Dukakis was angered at Simon's ad, which suggested he is a
technocrat who doesn't care about people. Simon ``obviously does
not know what he's talking about,'' Dukakis said.

   Richard P. Feynman, a Nobel Prize winning
physicist who helped shatter NASA's claim that cold weather didn't
doom the shuttle Challenger, died Monday of cancer. He was 69.
   Feynman earned a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1939 and a doctorate at Princeton University in 1942.
He worked on the Manhattan Project where he helped develop the
atomic bomb during World War II. He moved to Cornell University in
1945, where he did his Nobel-winning studies, then moved to Caltech
in Pasadena in 1950.
   In 1965, Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Julian
S. Schwinger and Shinichero Tomonaga for developing an improved
theory of quantum electrodynamics. The theory allowed scientists to
predict the effects of electrically charged particles on each other
in a radiation field.
   His best-selling autobiography in 1985 was entitled ``Surely
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!''
   Feynman was a member of the presidential commission that
investigated the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger
in which all seven crew members died.

<HEAD>The Next Battleground: The South And Super Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Leaving the snows of New Hampshire behind, the
presidential candidates set their sights today on the next big test
_ the South, with its high-stakes Super Tuesday contests looming
three weeks away.
   ``On to the South, where we're going to rise again,'' said Vice
President George Bush, fresh from his revival in New Hampshire.
   Republican rival Bob Dole threatened to shatter what his
campaign called a ``myth of invincibility'' surrounding the vice
president's organization in the South.
   The change in scenery couldn't come too soon for Pat Robertson
after his last-place finish in New Hampshire. Robertson, a
Virginian, consoled his followers by saying, ``Tomorrow morning we
go into the South and they're going to be playing in my backyard.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, coming off a strong
first-place finish in his neighboring state, was conceding nothing
to Democratic rivals Albert Gore Jr., a Tennessean who is banking
on his native Dixie, and Jesse Jackson, who has a strong base in
the region's large black population.
   ``Some people have been asking how a New Englander can hope to
do well on Super Tuesday,'' Dukakis said. ``The fact of the matter
is, I don't have a Southern strategy. I don't have a Northern
strategy. I have an American strategy.''
   Gore, in Houston, was the only one of the candidates not in New
Hampshire Tuesday night. ``We made a decision not to spend a
million dollars on two or three delegates,'' he told supporters.
   After New Hampshire, several candidates were heading to South
Dakota, Minnesota and Wyoming, where lower-stakes contests are
scheduled between now and March 8. But the big attention-grabber is
Super Tuesday, March 8, when 20 states, most of them in the South,
stage primaries or caucuses.
   The delegate prize: 1,307 Democrats, or more than half of the
2,082 needed to win the nomination, and 700 Republicans, also more
than of the 1,139 needed to nominate.
   Gore has a favorite line about his decision to bypass Iowa and
run a limited campaign in New Hampshire: ``If you're going to go
duck hunting, you go where the ducks are. If you're hunting for
delegates, you go where the delegates are.''
   Super Tuesday, in a sense, is Gore's first stand _ and without a
strong showing, it could be his last.
   ``We must do well on Super Tuesday _ there's no ifs, ands or
buts about it,'' said his campaign manager, Fred Martin.
   Jackson, who has solid black backing, has taken the lead in some
recent Southern surveys. In Iowa and New Hampshire, both of which
have only tiny black populations, Jackson notched respectable
fourth-place showings, indicating he has broadened his base of
support.
   Gore has singled out Jackson as his main opponent in the South.
``I think it will essentially become a two-person race,'' he said.
   He raised the ``electability'' of Jackson on Tuesday, saying:
``Democrats in all parts of the country are really hungry for a
victory in 1988 and interested in finding a nominee who can offer
the best chance of beating the Republicans in the fall.''
   Gore and Jackson are displaying vastly differing campaign
styles. Gore is racking up endorsements from key political leaders,
and kicked off a massive media campaign last week.
   Jackson doesn't have the money for big media buys, but his
campaign manager, Gerald Austin, said that isn't important because
Jackson is already well-known.
   As for Gore's support from the Democratic political
establishment, Austin retorts: ``We're depending on the endorsement
of the people, not the House speakers and the like.''
   The well-funded Dukakis was spending heavily in delegate-rich
Florida and Texas, and his organization is seen as strong,
especially in Florida.
   To mount a serious Super Tuesday television offensive, a
candidate must buy air time in 20 or more separate television
markets. That means big expenses _ a major factor for candidates
like Democrats Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon, who are saddled
with debt.
   Among Republicans, Dole was kicking off his Southern campaign
with a news conference Thursday at the Georgia Capitol.
   Despite Bush's strong Southern organization _ the best among the
GOP candidates, in the view of some _ Dole was banking on winning
over a large undecided vote.
   ``It doesn't surprise me when the people with the vice president
say they've got an organization that can't be matched down here,''
said Clay Collins, Dole's campaign director for Georgia.
   Nonetheless, he said, ``We have the thrust to break through that
invincibility myth. I think we are going to make rapid gains.''
   Bush, however, also was confident.
   ``We're going South and fight. It looks good there,'' Bush said.
He was to campaign in Missouri on Thursday and in Texas through the
weekend.
   Robertson, the former television evangelist, has also shown a
strong Southern organization, and his church-backed following will
be a formidable force in the Bible belt.
   But Robertson also needs to regain momentum after his
disappointing showing in New Hampshire, so he's looking to South
Carolina's GOP primary on the Saturday before Super Tuesday. An
expected low turnout, combined with Robertson's constituency of
fundamentalist Christian voters, make that state a likely spot for
an improved Robertson performance heading into Super Tuesday.

<HEAD>Life-Threatening Illness First Thought To Be Just A Pain In The
Neck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Sen. Joseph Biden experienced a pain in
the neck, he was placed in a brace until it felt better. But last
week when the pain came back suddenly, doctors found an aneurysm on
the brain that required delicate surgery to save his life.
   The surgery, performed last Friday, was so successful that
doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Tuesday transferred
the 45-year-old Delaware Democrat out of intensive care and into a
regular hospital room.
   ``Physicians are pleased with his continued progress and his
condition is listed as satisfactory,'' said Peter Esker, a Walter
Reed spokesman.
   A neurosurgeon familiar with the Biden case said many patients
with cerebral aneurysms are not as lucky, particularly if there is
rapid and serious bleeding.
   ``It can kill you in 10 minutes,'' said the surgeon, who asked
not to be named. ``Most patients survive,'' he added, but for a
serious medical condition, aneurysms on the brain are ``big time.''
   The doctor said that Biden is in ``the lucky two-thirds'' who
live through cerebral aneurysm surgery, and the senator's
relatively quick release from intensive care probably means he
avoided a long list of problems that can ambush such patients.
   ``One third of these patients die,'' said the surgeon, while
others may experience some loss of function, such as paralysis or
decline of intellectual ability. ``But if everything is perfect and
the surgery is within 24 hours (of serious bleeding), they can be
out of the hospital within seven days. Recovery can be absolutely
normal.''
   Dr. Edward Laws, chairman of the neurosurgery department at
George Washington Hospital, said he had no details on the Biden
case but that patients with successful surgery usually are released
within a week or 10 days.
   ``It sounds like he (Biden) is doing better than that, though,''
said Laws. ``I think he's probably going to do great.''
   An aneurysm is caused by a weakness in the artery wall that
allows pressure to force the artery to swell outward, like a
blister. The danger is that the aneurysm will burst. But in the
brain, even a mild leakage can be dangerous and damaging.
   A leakage into the brain from a branch of the carotid artery can
cause a neck pain, but both Laws and the other neurosurgeon said it
is ``unusual'' for such a pain to be misdiagnosed.
   Laws suggested that Biden, in fact, may have had a neck problem
earlier and that development of the aneurysm, which manifests a
similar pain, was just coincidental.
   Biden first complained of the neck pain in late January.
   Jane Berman, an aide in Biden's Washington office, said when the
senator sought medical care, he was issued a brace.
   ``They thought he had a pinched nerve and a viral infection in
the neck at the same time,'' she said.
   Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wore a neck
brace in late January during hearings on the nomination of Anthony
Kennedy to the Supreme Court. A week later, the senator was too ill
to vote on the confirmation.
   But last week, Biden felt well enough to take off the brace and
accept several speaking engagements at East Coast colleges, Ms.
Berman said.
   In Rochester, N.Y., the pain returned suddenly and powerfully,
and Biden also experienced nausea.
   He went home to Wilmington, Del., and immediately was admitted
to St. Francis Hospital ``for tests.''
   One of these tests was a CAT scan, a sophisticated X-ray
technique. The aneurysm was spotted and Biden quickly was
transferred by ambulance early Friday morning to Walter Reed where
surgery began only hours later.
   Laws said that typically in such a procedure an incision is made
in the temple area of the head. Surgeons then cut a small window
through the wall of the skull and the brain is raised slightly to
gain access to the aneurysm site.
   To correct the flaw, surgeons use a clip, a small metal device
with two tiny jaws that lock together. The clip is placed at the
base of the aneurysm, parallel to the flow of blood. Left in place
permanently, the clip isolates the weak spot and allows the artery
to heal.
   The procedure, said Laws, is ``microsurgery'' because the
artery, which he described as like ``a piece of wet spaghetti'' is
so small.
   ``It is very difficult and delicate surgery,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is remaining mum
on the battle for the Republican presidential nomination as he
heads back to Washington and his regular weekly meeting with Vice
President George Bush.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan watched
returns from the New Hampshire primary on television on Tuesday as
he wound up a three-day vacation at his ranch in the Santa Ynez
mountains north of here.
   ``We won't have any comment,'' Fitzwater said when asked about
the New Hampshire voting. Reagan has maintained a public stance of
neutrality in the race for the nomination, although he has
repeatedly praised Bush's performance as vice president.
   In response to a question, Fitzwater said the Bush campaign,
facing stiff competition from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, had
made no requests that the president step up his commendation of the
vice president. He said Reagan had not talked with Bush in recent
days.
   The two are scheduled to have lunch at the White House on
Thursday, as they do each week.
   Also on Thursday, the president will meet with bipartisan
negotiators in Congress who worked out the $1.1 trillion budget
compromise to be formally unveiled that day. Fitzwater said Reagan
would tell them that ``it is a remarkable budget that ... includes
more money for AIDS research, more money for housing and education,
but makes cuts in other areas that will allow us to meet the budget
reduction and keep the deficit on a downward path.''
   Later Thursday, the president will attend the swearing in of
Judge Anthony Kennedy of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as a
member of the Supreme Court. He nominated Kennedy after the Senate
rejected his nomination of Robert Bork and his second nominee,
Judge Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew in the face of reports of his
marijuana use in earlier days.
   On Friday, the president will meet with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl before leaving for Camp David to spend the weekend.
   At his final meeting with reporters in Santa Barbara, Fitzwater
was asked about a speech in which Edward L. Rowny, the president's
disarmament adviser, told a group of scientists in Boston that the
Soviet Union is ``squandering time'' in arms talks and ``remains a
brutal adversary.''
   ``I think Ambassador Rowny was just giving them a little prod
that says, `Come on, fellows, let's get down to business here,'''
Fitzwater said. ``We might not use those words, but we share his
concerns.''
   The spokesman also announced that the president was signing a
bill by Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, rescinding an $8 million
appropriation for schools for North African Jews in France. Inouye
was criticized after including the funds in a catch-all
appropriations bill.

stalled and oil pressure dropped about 45 miles east of Pittsburgh,
said USAir spokesman David Shipley.
   None of the 80 passengers and crew members aboard were injured,

   The aircraft was taken out of service and was being checked by
USAir and Federal Aviation Administration officials, Shipley said.
   The passengers and their luggage went to Newark aboard another

   Vice President George Bush said reports of his death had been
greatly exaggerated. His comeback may get the same treatment.
   That's the way it is in the crucial, high-stakes, do-or-die,
make-or-break, pick-a-cliche contests that begin the season of
competition for presidential nominations. Every state leaves an
indelible imprint, until the next state votes.
   That sometimes means as long as a week.
   The early omens, circa 1988, point to a season of political
trench warfare, in which battle cries and claims to momentum yield
to a long, hard struggle to collect delegates, one state at a time,
then one vote at a time, until they add up to a nominating majority.
   One week after he became the Republicans' leading loser, Bush
gained a solid comeback victory in the New Hampshire presidential
primary Tuesday.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, third among Democrats in
Iowa, won easily in next-door New Hampshire, and said that put him
on a winning path that leads South.
   Sen. Bob Dole claimed satisfaction in second place, but it was
way before midnight when he stopped smiling and started snarling at
Bush.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Democratic victor in the Iowa
caucuses, said runner up and 20 percent of the vote was a solid
showing _ and it was, to the extent that he out paced fellow
Midwesterner Paul Simon for the second week running. ``This isn't
helping,'' the Illinois senator said in bow-tied understatement.
   Sen. Simon polled 17 percent, three points and a good many
dollars short. Simon said if he could have reversed that narrow
edge it would have made ``a tremendous difference in raising
money,'' which is in dangerously short supply in his campaign.
   For all of that, nobody was quitting outright, not even former
Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who got 5 percent and barely beat Gary
Hart. Babbitt said he'd talk with his supporters and figure out
what to do next.
   So, coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, both political parties
have confirmed what they knew going in _ Bush is the man to beat in
what looks like a two-way Republican contest, with Pat Robertson
looking from the outside in.
   The Democrats have yet to pick a face from the crowd. Dukakis
has what edge there is because he is the most recent winner, but he
is heading into difficult territory in the Southern primaries that
come up on March 8, Super Tuesday. A victory next Tuesday in
Minnesota would provide an undeniable boost.
   To this point, for all the effort and money they have spent, the
contestants have succeeded in eliminating Alexander Haig from the
Republican running, and pushing Democrat Babbitt toward the exit.
Neither of them had a chance in the first place.
   Robertson, who embarrassed Bush in Iowa, slumped to last place
in New Hampshire. The former television evangelist acknowledged
that he'd come up short of his hopes, but said he wasn't
discouraged. ``My natural base is down in the South and that's
where we go from here,'' Robertson said.
   Rep. Jack Kemp ran third, with 13 percent. He said that made him
the winner in the competition to become the candidate of the
conservative wing of the party. Or, as he later billed it, the
progressive conservative wing. He, too, said the South promised him
a better lot.
   Pete du Pont ran narrowly ahead of Robertson.
   Democrats Jesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said they, too,
were aiming southward. The black vote there is certain to boost
Jackson's showings. Gore decided to wait near his Tennessee base
for the rest of the field to come there. ``Super Tuesday is a
completely new ball game,'' he said.
   But it is a game in which there will be enough conflicting
messages to enable most of the contestants to claim headway. All 20
contests are not in the South. Dukakis' Massachusetts, and next
door Rhode Island will be holding primaries on March 8, among the
half-dozen outside the Southern and border states.

   Student protesters who have held a
University of Massachusetts building for five days began
deliberating a tentative understanding late Tuesday hammered out
earlier in the day by their negotiators and university officials.
   The students' meeting was closed, and there were conflicting
signals on whether an end to the five-day standoff, which began
when some 200 minority students took over the school's New Africa
House in a protest of campus racial tensions, was near an end.
   ``Not all (the students') demands have been met, but all have
been responded to in good faith,'' Chancellor Joseph Duffey said as
he forwarded a written statement to the students. ``There are
things I cannot do now, but we've agreed to plan to address general
concerns.''
   Earlier, university officials had said Duffey would be putting
into writting a tentative understanding reached between him and a
nine-member student negotiating committee during a meeting that
lasted nearly four hours.
   ``It looks like we have a resolution,'' said James Langley, a
spokesman for Duffey, after the meeting broke up.
   But a student spokesman said late in the evening that the
document sent by Duffey was received with ``mixed emotions'' by the
entire student group and that discussions of what they would do
next could last well into the night.
   ``The vote is going very slowly,'' spokesman Roscoe Robinson
said. `I'm getting nervous.''
   Earlier, when the meeting with Duffey was still in progress,
Robinson had also expressed optimism on the way it were going,
saying he was ``pleased with the results.''
   Jeanne Hopkins, university spokeswoman, described the tentative
understanding as ``an agenda for what we'll do, where we will go
from here.''
   Administrators did not release the document sent to the
students, but Dwayne Warren, another student spokesman, said it
contained a promise of further efforts to improve minority
students' condititions on the campus, including increased support
for minority organizations.
   The day also saw a rally by more than 500 white UMass students
who supported the minority students' protest.
   ``Hey, ho, Chancellor Joe, racism has got to go'' was chanted by
students, who were held back by black students linking arms to
clear a path for Duffey as he walked toward the building.
   Students and faculty also read letters of support, including a
message sent Tuesday by Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson. Some supporters had traveled from Albany and Philadelphia
and local businesses and residents had sent protesters blankets,
pillows and food.
   ``I came to see if they needed any help,'' said Michelle Norman,
21, a senior from Pleasanton, Calif., who added that she was
missing two classes to attend the vigil. ``I think it's a good
cause.''
   Jackson, a Democratic presidential contender who was in nearby
New Hampshire for Tuesday's primary balloting, called the
protesters at 9:15 a.m. to lend his support.
   ``The students occupying the New Africa House have taken a
principled position on legitimate concerns. The quality of
leadership in the state and country can be determined by how it
handles such crises as this one,'' Jackson said in a statement read
by a protester.
   The protesters had said they would meet with Duffey to negotiate
on a revised set of demands, which a spokesman for the group
declined to detail. They vowed to remain until Duffey agrees to
their conditions.
   The six original demands included a written policy against
discrimination by the university, prosecution of five white
students accused of attacking two black men and a white woman on
Feb. 7, and the suspension of campus police officers who allegedly
formed a line-up of black men when women complained of harassment.
   Sara Lennox, a German professor, said 50 faculty members have
signed a statement deploring the recent incidents and urging the
administration to resolve the dispute.
   ``A climate of hostility, danger and racial intolerance must not
be allowed to continue,'' said the statement, signed by members of
an ad hoc committee to promote racial tolerance. The group was
formed in response to a fight between black and white students
following the World Series in 1986.
   The university rescheduled classes that usually meet in New
Africa House to other buildings.
   ``We see this as a short-term, temporary thing. We don't want to
escalate tensions,'' spokesman Langley had said.
   Between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the
long holiday weekend, according to Robinson, 24, of Boston.
   Associate Dean of Students Rick Townes, who is serving as
mediator, said the protesters were civil but determined.
   ``There has been a resolve that this was going to be the last
time they were going to make a stand,'' Townes said. ``This is not
a movement led by radical students. These are good students tired
of dealing with this.''
   A session between the protesters and Duffy, planned for Monday,
was canceled because Duffey left campus to visit an ailing brother.
   The protesters sent Duffey a sympathy card signed by more than
200 students. Duffey responded by sending them a fruit basket and a
card that read: ``I send affection and respect.''
   About 9 percent of the 25,000 students at the state's largest

   The latest appearance of a great white shark
and Norman Mailer's film of his own book received the dubious honor
Wednesday of being at the top of the pack as the Golden Raspberry
Award Foundation announced its picks for worst pictures of 1987.
   The 8th Annual Golden Raspberry Award nominations also went to
Bill Cosby, Madonna, Sylvester Stallone and the $35 million
superflop ``Ishtar'' as the foundation took note of what it felt
was truly terrible in motion pictures last year.
   ``Jaws: The Revenge'' and ``Tough Guys Don't Dance'' received
seven Razzie nominations each, with the acting considered so bad in
the latest ``Jaws'' sequel that even Bruce the mechanical shark was
nominated for worst actor.
   The Razzies are a light-hearted parody of the Oscar ceremonies
and coincide with the annual Academy Award nominations, which will
be announced Wednesday.
   The Razzie ceremony will be held April 10 and will feature
dramatic readings of the most ridiculous lyrics from some awful
movie songs.
   The winners, if they dare to show up, will receive a trophy of a
golf-ball size raspberry glued atop a film reel and spray-painted
with gold.
   ``There are three basic theories of what qualifies as a
Razzie,'' explained John Wilson, Razzie foundation president.
   ``First, Hollywood's own measure, how much money did it lose?
Second, a movie that was not supposed to be a comedy that generated
enormous laughs from the audience. `Jaws' was one of those and so
was Norman Mailer's `Tough Guys Don't Dance,' which was laughed off
the screen in Cannes.
   ``The last is how excruciating it is to actually sit through a
film. Does someone have to pay you money or bribe you with popcorn?
`Who's That Girl?' fits into that category,'' he said.
   Cosby received three nominations for star, author and producer
of ``Leonard: Part 6,'' a movie that he disavowed and almost no one
saw. Madonna, last year's Worst Actress winner, is a contender this
year for ``Who's That Girl?,'' nominated for five Razzies.
   Stallone, the all-time Razzie champ with four wins, is
continuing the tradition with ``the maudlin arm-wrestling
melodrama'' ``Over the Top,'' which got three nominations.
   The Golden Raspberry Foundation, made up of film professionals
and critics as well as frequent film-goers in California and nine
other states, believe the worst pictures of 1987 were ``Ishtar,''
``Jaws: The Revenge,'' ``Leonard: Part 6,'' ``Tough Guys Don't
Dance'' and ``Who's That Girl?''
   Named for worst performances by an actor, besides Bruce the
Shark, were Cosby in ``Leonard: Part 6''; Judd Nelson in ``From the
Hip''; Ryan O'Neal in ``Tough Guys Don't Dance''; and Stallone in
``Over the Top.''
   Worst actress nominations, in addition to Madonna, went to
Sondra Locke in ``Ratboy''; Lorraine Gary in ``Jaws''; Debra
Sandlund in ``Tough Guys Don't Dance''; and Sharon Stone in ``Allan
Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold.''
   Worst supporting actor nominees are Billy Barty in ``Masters of
the Universe''; Tom Bosley, Mack Dryden and Jamie Alcroft, all of
``Million Dollar Mystery''; Michael Caine in ``Jaws: The Revenge'';
and David Mendenhall in ``Over the Top.''
   Nominated for worst supporting actress are Gloria Foster,
``Leonard: Part 6''; Daryl Hannah, ``Wall Street''; Mariel
Hemingway, ``Superman IV''; Grace Jones, ``Siesta''; and Isabella
Rossellini, for both ``Siesta'' and ``Tough Guys Don't Dance.''
   Worst director nominees were James Foley for ``Who's That
Girl?''; Norman Mailer for ``Tough Guys Don't Dance''; Elaine May
for ``Ishtar''; Joseph Sargent for ``Jaws: The Revenge''; and Paul
Weiland for ``Leonard: Part 6.''

<HEAD>Department Wants To Share Cost For Recreational Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is looking for
state and local business partners to help share the cost of
upgrading recreational facilities on national forest lands.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the department's Forest Service,
said Tuesday the move is in response to increasing demands for more
recreational areas and service, and to help relieve pressures on
federal spending.
   ``The squeezed budget is a factor,'' Robertson told a news
conference.
   A spokesman for an environmental group, the Wilderness Society,
supported the agency's program but with some reservation.
   ``There definitely needs to be greater emphasis on recreation,
and I would applaud efforts on the part of the Forest Service to
increase the emphasis on recreation,'' said Richard Rice, a society
economist. ``I would urge them to use caution in opening the door
to private development, however.''
   Robertson said the ``Challenge Cost-Share Program'' was
authorized by Congress on a pilot basis at a level of $500,000 for
the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1. Of that, $100,000 was
earmarked for the Tonto National Forest near Phoenix, Ariz., with
the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up
by local people, companies, state agencies, municipalities or other
groups.
   Some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be under
way this spring and summer he said. Restoration and improvement of
existing facilities, areas and trails are typical goals.
   The $500,000 of Forest Service seed money was met with $908,000
from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects.
   One of the objectives of the program will be to provide more
facilities on national forest land near cities.
   Private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds,
marinas, ski areas. No increase in user fees is being proposed at
this time, but that eventually will have to be faced, he said.
   Asked if the plan means opening the door for major private
development on national forest land, Robertson replied:
   ``Yes, we are opening that door, but we also need to work with
those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall
scheme'' for recreation development.
   The Forest Service administers 191 million acres, or about 8{
percent of the U.S. total land area.
   Robertson said the proposed budget that President Reagan is
scheduled to send Congress on Thursday for the 1989 fiscal year
that will begin on Oct. 1 will include $3 million for the
recreation cost-share program, up from the $500,000 in pilot funds
this year. One that began in 1986 for fish and wildlife will be
requested at $5 million, compared with $1.5 million in fiscal 1988.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Feb. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.86 million head,
up 8 percent from a year ago and 3 percent from two years ago,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.76 million
head, down 2 percent from a year ago but 1 percent above two years
ago, the report said Tuesday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.66 million head, up 4 percent from a year
ago and 5 percent more than in January 1986. The report said those
were the largest January feedlot placements since 1974.
   As of Feb. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year
earlier in six states and down in Iowa. The states account for
about three-fourths of the nation's beef production.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Feb. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   The Agriculture Department has approved
another field test of genetically altered tomato plants that can
survive spraying of a chemical herbicide to kill surrounding weeds.
   James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Tuesday a permit
for the field test was issued to E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.,
Wilmington, Del. The company expects to begin testing this spring
near Brandenton, Fla.
   The plants were designed to tolerate sulfonylurea, described as
a new class of low-risk chemical weed killers.
   The du Pont field trial is the third test approved by the USDA
agency. Previously, permits were issued to Calgene Inc., Davis,
Calif., for tobacco and tomato plants that tolerate the herbicides
bromoxynil and glyphosate.

   Lucille Ball passed a Harvard University
test with a little help from Lucy Ricardo.
   Miss Ball was named Woman of the Year by the Hasty Pudding
Theatricals, Harvard's all-male revue, on Tuesday.
   On stage before about 500 wildly appreciative fans, Miss Ball
passed a trivia test about her alter ego in the 1950s sitcom ``I
Love Lucy,'' which lives on in reruns.
   She couldn't remember the name of Little Ricky's baby-sitter
(Mrs. Trumbull) but recalled husband Ricky Ricardo's theme song
(``Babalou'').
   ``I've waited 20-some years to make this gig, and may I say it
was worth it,'' Miss Ball, 76, told the standing-room-only crowd
after a parade through Harvard Square past hundreds of admirers.
   She said she would fill the tiny brass pudding pot she received
with potpourri and place it in her New York apartment.
   The Hasty Pudding Club has named a Woman of the Year since 1951
and a Man of the Year since 1967. Comedian Steve Martin will be
honored Feb. 23.

Parton's footprints, handprints and a small rhinestone butterfly _
and that's all it's going to get.
   ``Several people asked me if I was going to leave the prints of
something else. I said, `Heavens no!' I'm afraid some little kid
might fall in it and get killed,'' the buxom entertainer said with
a giggle during ceremonies Tuesday attended by about 200 people.
   Star Walk, a year-old attraction at a new outdoor shopping

   Madonna, Sylvester Stallone and Bill Cosby
are among those nominated for an award they won't want to receive:
the Golden Raspberry for complicity in last year's worst movies.
   Norman Mailer, who directed the film of his novel, ``Tough Guys
Don't Dance,'' also took some lumps in nominations announced
Tuesday by the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation.
   The Razzies, a lighthearted parody of the Oscars, coincided with
today's scheduled annual Academy Award nominations.
   Stallone, the all-time Razzie champ with four wins, continued
the tradition with his arm-wrestling flick, ``Over the Top,'' which
got three nominations, including worst actor.
   Cosby received three nominations for star, author and producer
of ``Leonard: Part 6,'' which he disavowed and almost no one saw.
Madonna, last year's worst actress winner, is a contender this year
for ``Who's That Girl?,'' nominated for five Razzies.
   In addition to worst director, ``Tough Guys Don't Dance'' was
nominated for worst actress, Debra Sandlund, and worst supporting
actress, Isabella Rossellini.
   The Razzie ceremony will be held April 10. Winners, if they dare
to show up, will receive a trophy of a golf ball-size raspberry
glued atop a film reel and spray-painted with gold.

   Lillian Gish received the National Board of
Review's D.W. Griffith career achievement award for acting in 105
movies over 75 years from best friend Helen Hayes, who praised her
as a woman without fear.
   When Miss Gish, 91, was acting in the silent film ``Way Down
East,'' she spent two winter days floating down a New England river
on a real ice floe, her hand frostbitten as she trailed it in the
water and tears frozen on her eyelashes, Miss Hayes recalled in
presenting the award Tuesday.
   ``The picture came out fine and that's all that mattered to
Lillian,'' said Miss Hayes, 91.
   Miss Gish, recovering from a fall last month, did not attend the
ceremonies.
   The National Board of Review, founded in New York in 1909 to
fight censorship and reward excellence in motion pictures, has
presented D.W. Griffith awards since 1917.

   Johnny Carson, back at his ``Tonight
Show'' desk after a weeklong bout with the flu, apparently didn't
suffer any damage to his funny bone.
   In his opening monologue Tuesday night, Carson said he asked a
doctor who came to his home, ``How about some chicken soup?''
   Carson said the doctor replied, ``No, but if you wash your
hands, why don't you make me a tuna melt on sourdough?''
   Carson also asked the studio audience how many had had a similar
flu. When hands went up, he jokingly asked that they be moved to
the back of the room.
   Carson came in for rehearsal Feb. 9 but left before doing the
show. A ``Best of Carson'' rerun was shown that night and comic Jay
Leno rushed back from Florida to sit in as guest host.
   Carson spent the week recovering at his Malibu home, said NBC-TV
spokesman Charles Barrett.

<HEAD>Justice Finds No Conflict In Ginsburg's 16 Cable Matters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former antitrust chief Douglas H. Ginsburg
dealt with 16 different cable industry matters while holding cable
stock but either his role or his chance for personal gain was too
small to violate federal conflict-of-interest laws, the Justice
Department says.
   The department's decision not to request appointment of an
independent counsel for further investigation of the former Supreme
Court nominee was detailed in a 116-page report released Tuesday.
   The report by Assistant Attorney General William F. Weld, head
of the department's criminal division, summarized the results of a
three-month inquiry in which Justice and FBI officials interviewed
more than 50 people, including Ginsburg.
   Ginsburg did not return telephone calls seeking his reaction,
but his lawyers had joined the department in asking that the report
be released to the public.
   The report was released by the division of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here that appoints independent counsels to
investigate alleged wrongdoing by high federal officials.
   But the Justice Department's Office of Government Ethics says it
wants to read the report before deciding whether to do or say
anything about the case, according to its general counsel, Donald
Campbell.
   Separate from the criminal sanctions, a presidential executive
order prohibits actions that might give an appearance of conflict.
The penalty for violating this is administrative discipline.
   But Ginsburg has since become a member of the judicial branch,
sitting on the U.S. Court of Appeals here. All the ethics office or
any other executive branch agency could do now is issue a letter or
reprimand for a former employee.
   Weld said the department conducted a preliminary inquiry into
three matters that had been reported in news accounts. In addition,
department investigators came up with 13 other instances of
Ginsburg's involvement in cable issues, but Weld said these did not
even merit a preliminary inquiry.
   Ginsburg withdrew from consideration as a Supreme Court justice
last November after he acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana
while a professor at Harvard Law School.
   The investigation covered a period from 1983 to 1986 in which he
was either assistant attorney general in charge of Justice's
antitrust division or a deputy to the chief.
   During this period, his only substantial stock holding was about
$140,000 worth of Rogers Communications, Inc., a Canadian-based
cable operator which is also among the top 15 U.S. cable operators.
   The news reports about the cable dealings triggered the Justice
inquiry that began last November and was concluded with the Feb. 6
report released Tuesday. The marijuana use was not a subject in the
inquiry because no federal laws were violated.
   In one of the newly disclosed instances, Weld concluded that
Ginsburg's stock in Rogers Communications, Inc. might have risen in
value as a result of Ginsburg's participation in a copyright
infringement case before the Supreme Court.
   He said Ginsburg's participation, including ordering a brief
opposing Supreme Court review of the case and editing an early
draft, was substantial as required by the conflict-of-interest laws.
   And Weld said that case might have relieved Rogers of paying
some fees for transmitting copyright programs over its cable
systems. ``Judge Ginsburg, through his ownership of class B shares
of RCI, may have had an interest in RCI's no longer paying the
transmission fee,'' Weld wrote.
   But Weld added that ``any such interest would be remote, direct
and infinitesimal.'' In addition, he said, Ginsburg did not appear
to be aware of his financial interest.
   In one case in which the department did conduct a preliminary
inquiry, Weld concluded that Ginsburg participated personally and
substantially in a friend-of-the-court brief to the Supreme Court.
In that case, the high court for the first time extended First
Amendment protection to cable operators.
   But Weld said officials questioned by the department differed on
whether and how much Rogers would be helped or hurt by this ruling.
   In two previously reported matters involving comments filed by
the antitrust division with the Federal Communications Commission,
Weld concluded that Ginsburg's role was ``tangential and
unimportant'' in one case and ``insubstantial'' in the other.
   Weld handled the matter as acting attorney general because
Attorney General Edwin Meese III and four other more senior Justice
Department officials decided to take no part in the case.

<HEAD>Grain Pledge Surprises US Officials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unsually large Soviet pledge of 250,000
tons of grain to famine-plagued Ethiopia has generated surprise
among U.S. officials but concern over who will pay for delivery.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development has officially
welcomed the Soviet commitment, pointing out that it has encouraged
all potential donors to make a contribution to easing Ethiopia's
plight.
   As one of the world's largest grain importers, it is somewhat
unusual for Moscow to play the role of food donor. But Ethiopia is
a close Kremlin ally and has benefited for years from Western food
conributions.
   According to Agriculture Department figures, the Soviet Union is
expected to purchase about 32 million tons of grain during the year
ending next June 30. But Soviet grain harvests have been
comparatively good during 1986-87, surpassing 200 million tons in
consecutive years for the first time.
   The Soviet pledge was made three weeks ago, generating surprise
here because the largest previous donation by Moscow to Ethiopia
was 10,000 metric tons of rice during the 1984-85 famine.
   The latest food shortage is primarily the result of a severe
drought last summer.
   The 250,000-ton pledge exceeds the U.S. commitment by about
3,000 tons. An A.I.D. statement said the combined contribution of
Western nations exceeds half a million tons.
   The major unanswered question U.S. officials are asking is who
will pick up the cost of distributing the Soviet deliveries.
   A.I.D. said it would have no objection if private voluntary
organizations working in Ethiopia help in distribution of the
Soviet grains, but no request has been made thus far.
   ``We naturally assume that the Soviets will fund the cost of
distribution as A.I.D. has done for food provided by the U.S.
government,'' the agency said, estimating at $25 million the cost
of delivering the Soviet shipments.
   A U.S. official said that the Soviets have provided transport
aircraft to Ethiopia for food distribution in the past, as well as
trucks and Soviet drivers.

<HEAD>Sales Of Existing Homes Held Steady Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home prices skyrocketed in many Northeastern
cities last year, propelled by that region's prosperous economy,
while prices were falling in depressed farm and energy regions,
according to a survey by a real estate trade group.
   The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that prices on
existing homes rose 5.1 percent to a national average of $84,300 at
the close of last year, slightly ahead of consumer inflation, which
was up 4.4 percent in 1987.
   But the nationwide average masked widespread geographic
differences. Home prices shot up 32.2 percent in Providence, R.I.,
six times the national average. Three other Eastern cities, Albany,
N.Y., Hartford, Conn., and Washington, also saw home prices climb
by 18 percent or more.
   But the association said its survey of 53 metropolitan areas
found 14 cities where prices fell during the year. This list was
dominated by areas dependent on farming and energy industries.
   Houston suffered the biggest price decline, a drop of 7.2
percent, followed by declines of 5.6 percent in Oklahoma City and
5.5 percent in Des Moines. Des Moines was ranked as the most
affordable place to buy a home last year with a median price of
$52,000.
   At the top of the price scale were New York City, with a
mid-point price of $180,800, and Boston, with a selling price of
$178,600 at the end of last year. These two cities have held the
top two price positions for the past two years.
   Despite volatile mortgage rates and the October collapse of the
stock market, home sales remained near eight-year highs last year.
Sales totaled 3.885 million units in 1987, down a tiny 0.3 percent
from 1986. Both years represented the fastest sales pace since 4.05
million homes were sold in 1979.
   Alaska and Louisiana, two states which had suffered a big slump
in sales because of depressed energy industries, enjoyed a rebound
last year, leading the country along with Massachusetts with the
largest percentage gains.
   Sales in Alaska rose 26.2 percent and were up 18.8 percent in
Louisiana and Massachusetts. Twenty-two states had sales increases
last year.
   Others enjoying big gains were Georgia, with an 18.5 percent
increase and North Dakota and Maine, with advances of 17.9 percent
and 14.3 percent respectively.
   ``The Northeast continues as the strongest region but we saw
considerable strength in the South and Midwest, two areas which had
been lagging the rest of the country,'' said John Tuccillo, chief
economist for the realtors group.
   Twenty-two states suffered sales declines last year, led by a
13.8 percent drop in Washington state, a decline which erased a
15.5 percent gain of the previous year. Sales fell 13.3 percent in
Virginia, followed by declines of 9.7 percent in both Maryland and
Oklahoma.
   Analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a
last-minute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits
before the new tax law took effect on Jan. 1, 1987.
   Tuccillo predicted that price increases nationwide should be
lower than the 5.1 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to
decline by around 8 percent, in part because of slower economic
growth.
   Tuccillo predicted that the Northeast will continue to have the
highest home prices of any region, but he said the rate of increase
should slow.
   ``A leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated
activity,'' he said. ``The losses incurred by those in the New York
financial community are still having a lagging effect on home
buying in that area.''

   The new U.S.-Soviet nuclear missile pact is
seriously flawed but its defeat in the Senate would be a
politically unacceptable blow to the unity of the NATO alliance,
two national security experts say.
   Richard Perle, who recently stepped down as assistant secretary
of defense for international security affairs, is trying to
persuade the Senate to change the medium-range missile treaty.
   He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that
the pact should permit the United States to deploy medium-range,
ground-launched cruise missiles armed with non-nuclear explosives.
   But Perle said that if it became clear such an amendment would
have the effect of killing the treaty, ``I would not favor it.''
   Retired Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, until recently the supreme
allied commander in Europe, told the committee that he believes the
treaty overall will have an adverse impact on the military
situation in Europe. He said U.S. Pershing missiles, which are to
be destroyed under the treaty, are the one weapon that can strike
with assurance deep into Soviet territory from Western Europe.
   But he said the Senate is faced with a no-win situation because
it would be almost impossible politically for the United States to
keep its medium-range nuclear missile force in Europe, even if the
treaty were defeated.
   ``I would say that failure to ratify might well have a major
negative impact on NATO and the future viability of the alliance,''
Rogers said.
   He said the alliance must now insist on modernizing its force of
short-range nuclear weapons remaining in Europe as a hedge against
Soviet aggression.
   Both Perle and Rogers questioned whether Soviet compliance with
the new treaty could be adequately verified.
   But in closed-door hearings before the Senate Intelligence
Committee, a different sort of worry surfaced about the treaty's
verifications provisions.
   The concern centered on the on-site inspection provisions of the
treaty, which apply to both sides and permit teams of Soviet
officials access to certain U.S. missile facilities.
   ``I think on-site inspection presents problems,'' said one
committee source. ``One of the things we're trying to figure out is
how to keep tabs on the Soviets who are coming here.
   ``It's for sure they're going to be interested in a lot more
than looking at Disneyland,'' the source said, speaking on
condition he not be identified by name.
   The FBI has responsibility for counter-intelligence, but FBI
officials have balked at taking on the job of watching the Soviet
inspectors, said committee sources.
   Instead, they reported, FBI officials have suggested that the
Army should be given the task.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, reporting on a week-long trip by Senate leaders
to Europe, said he found a European consensus for modernizing
short-range nuclear weapons, but no agreement on which weapons to
build.
   Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said European leaders told
the senators ``that the INF treaty should be approved without
amendments and that following that, NATO should proceed with
modernizing those ground-based nuclear weapons that are eligible
under the treaty.''

<HEAD>Detroit Newspapers JOA Application Goes to Meese for Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III will decide
``as promptly as he can'' whether two Detroit newspapers should be
allowed to merge their business and production operations.
   On Tuesday, the last day for filing briefs before the case went
to Meese, attorneys for The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press
said denial of the joint operating agreement application would
result in the closure of the 156-year-old Free Press and the loss
of 2,200 newspaper jobs.
   Under a joint operating agreement, the newspapers would split
profits and combine their advertising, circulation and production
departments, but would retain separate news and editorial
departments.
   The newspapers said a joint operating agreement would result in
the elimination of 600 to 1,000 jobs.
   The application was filed under the Newspaper Preservation Act,
designed to prop up newspapers in danger of financial failure as a
means of preserving competing editorial voices in cities.
   The issue is decided in a quasi-judicial process, with the
Justice Department's antitrust division presenting arguments
against the proposed agreement and the newspapers arguing for it.
The attorney general acts as an impartial judge in making the final
ruling on the application.
   Mark Sheehan, Justice Department spokesman, said Meese ``will
act as promptly as he can,'' but that he probably will want his
staff to review and analyze the case first.
   The News is owned by Gannett Co. and the Free Press is owned by
Knight-Ridder Inc. The two papers have long been locked in a battle
for newspaper dominance in Detroit.
   The News, which is the larger newspaper, has lost $75 million
since 1979, and the Free Press has lost $100 million, according to
Knight-Ridder.
   Final briefs by the newspapers and the antitrust division
included discussion of the weight Meese should give to a decision
in January by directors of Knight-Ridder to close the Free Press if
a JOA is disapproved.
   The antitrust division contends that when the newspapers
announced their application for the joint operating agreement in
1986, Knight-Ridder was willing to continue subsidizing the Free
Press.
   ``Whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the
(Newspaper Preservation Act) should properly be determined as of
the time it enters into a JOA agreement, not on the basis of
decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval
under the statute,'' the division said.
   The newspapers countered that the board's announcement made it
clear that ``the choice now is between a JOA and the certain
closure of the Free Press.''
   Local 22 of the Newspaper Guild, which represents editorial
employees, voted 349-84 Monday night to continue opposition to the
JOA.
   But a brief filed by the newspapers included statements by five
other unions representing News and Free Press employees,
withdrawing opposition to the proposed agreement.
   Those unions said ``the JOA is the only way to assure the
survival of the Free Press and the preservation of two independent
editorial voices in Detroit.''

<HEAD>March 31 Deadline Firm on Beef and Citrus, US Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. trade officials have reiterated to Japan
that they will not extend a four-year agricultural quota agreement
beyond its March 31 expiration date.
   The agreement includes Japanese quotas on imports of American
beef and citrus fruit, restrictions to which U.S. officials now
object.
   Japanese Agriculture Ministry official Hidero Maki was informed
of the U.S. position during a visit here last week, said Gary
Holmes, a spokesman for the U.S. trade representative's office.
   U.S. refusal to extend the four-year quota agreement carried the
implied threat of taking Japanese import barriers against U.S.
citrus and beef before the international panel that resolves
disputes under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as
GATT. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said that
possibility would be considered.
   The expiring quotas cover fresh beef and fruit. The United
States earlier asked for a GATT ruling on Japanese restrictions on
the import of 12 categories of processed U.S. foodstuffs. Officials
said during the visit of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita last month
that Japan would abide by GATT findings.
   Imports of foreign agricultural products are a sensitive
political issue in Japan because of resistance from strong rural
factions of Takeshita's governing Liberal-Democratic Party.
   Although Japan is already the best customer for American farm
products, U.S. officials maintain that the huge U.S. trade deficit
with Japan and high consumer prices for home-grown foodstuffs
justify a freer Japanese market for imports.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities edged up in the latest auction to the highest level in
two weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
Tuesday at an average discount rate of 5.73 percent, up from 5.63
percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.03 percent, up from 5.85 percent

   The rates were the highest since Feb. 1, when three-month bills
sold for 5.74 percent and six-month bills averaged 6.11 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.91 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,855.20 and 6.32 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,695.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 6.59
percent last week after averaging 6.65 percent the week before.

<TEXT>
   Gardiner C. Means, an economist and author
whose work influenced much of the economic thinking of the New
Deal, has died at the age of 91.
   Means died Monday of complications from a stroke suffered six
months ago.
   Widely regarded as the father of the theory of administered
prices, Means was the author with Adolph A. Berle of ``The Modern
Corporation and Private Property,'' a study of the behavior of
major U.S. corporations.
   He came to Washington with the New Deal as economics adviser to
former secretary of agriculture Henry A. Wallace. He held a variety
of posts before leaving the government in 1943.
   Since 1958 he had been an independent economics consultant,
analyst and author specializing in the study of how the corporate
economy functions.
   He first published his theories on administered prices during
the 1930s, and they gained wide circulation in the 1950s and 1960s.
   According to the theory, certain corporate giants in industries
such as oil, steel and automobile manufacturing and some labor
unions have wide discretion over prices they set on their products
and their members' labor.
   They are able to set and hold _ or ``administer'' _ prices
without regard to fluctuations in demand. He observed that profit
levels were maintained simply by decreasing production and thereby
reducing costs when demand fell.
   He is survived by his wife, Caroline F. Ware.

<HEAD>GOP Turnout High At Precinct Meetings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CASEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson
showed his strength in statewide precinct meetings that drew a
record turnout, Republican officials said.
   The precinct meetings are the first step in the process leading
up to the Republican national convention in August. Those
participating in the meetings will choose the delegates to go to
county conventions and discuss what should be in the state's
platform.
   Although the delegates eventually chosen to go to the national
convention will be bound by the result of the GOP primary March 8,
the campaigns want good showings for their candidates at the
precinct meetings.
   ``Robertson had a good night around the state,'' said Tom Cole,
state GOP chairman. ``In rural areas, in the south and east,
Robertson clearly was the winner.
   ``He probably got 60 to 70 percent. That's not large numbers but
it's more than we have had in previous years.''
   Cole said Tuesday night that party officials didn't know exactly
how many people attended the meetings, but the figure could be as
high as 28,000, compared with between 12,000 and 13,000 last time.
   One Republican official said Monday that Robertson supporters
had been told to ``flood the precinct meetings.''
   ``We want as many delegates as possible at the convention,''
said Tommy Garrett, who is working for Robertson in Oklahoma City.
``We've been burned in conventions before. We always have trouble
when we hit the convention floor with the party establishment.''
   Those attending the precinct meetings selected delegates to the
county conventions, where delegates to the district and state
conventions are chosen.
   Each district will elect three delegates and three alternates to
the national convention.
   The state convention will pick 18 delegates-at-large and 18
alternates to the national convention.
   Republican county conventions are scheduled for March 5, with
congressional district meetings March 26 and the party's state
convention April 16. The national convention is Aug. 15-18.

   A woman seeking psychiatric help in a hospital
emergency room suddenly shot a social worker to death with a
handgun and held three people hostage before surrendering Tuesday
night, police said.
   Edith Anderson, 31, of suburban Rankin was arrested on homicide
and related charges in St. Francis Medical Center in the city's
Bloomfield neighborhood at about 10:15 p.m., according to police
Cmdr. Ron Freeman.
   Ms. Anderson apparently was sitting with hospital caseworker
Linda Rosen, 27, of Pittsburgh in the psychiatric waiting area of
the emergency room at about 8:55 p.m. when she shot Miss Rosen
without warning, according to police and to hospital spokeswoman
Shirley Freyer.
   ``The social worker was talking to this woman and ... there
didn't seem to be any conflict, and a security guard turned around
and heard four gunshots,'' Mrs. Freyer said. ``They were sitting, I
assume, side by side.''
   After the shooting, Ms. Anderson took two women and a man
hostage and held them for more than an hour before they were
released unharmed, police said. The hostages, who were not
identified, were waiting at the emergency room for a relative who
was being treated, police said.
   ``Everyone else in the emergency room was evacuated. The people
who were being seen in treatment rooms were taken out,'' Mrs.
Freyer said.
   Freeman said Ms. Anderson came to the hospital by herself
seeking psychiatric care.
   Police Chief Ralph Pampena said four to six shots were fired.
   After that, he said, Ms. Anderson went into a restroom and
pointed a handgun through a slightly opened door at the people
seated nearby, ordering them not to move.
   Police entered the emergency room and began talking to Ms.
Anderson in the bathroom, who allowed them to remove the wounded
caseworker, Pampena said. Miss Rosen died before getting medical
treatment, he said.
   Pampena said Ms. Anderson first let one of the three hostages go
free, then asked to talk to Eddie Edwards, a popular local
television talk show host. When Edwards arrived, the woman freed
the other two hostages, police said. Officers then managed to
distract her enough to be able to close the restroom door on her,
and eventually persuaded her to surrender.
   Police said the woman was being questioned by homicide
detectives during the night. No time had been set for an
arraignment and bail hearing.

<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late-deciding Republican voters confounded the
polls and boosted George Bush to his convincing victory over Sen.
Bob Dole in the New Hampshire presidential primary, analysts say.
   Voters who made their choice in the race's final days went
strongly for Bush, in part because of his superior campaign
organization, his ties to the Reagan administration and his
experience in office, exit polls indicated Tuesday.
   The result was a 9-point victory for the vice president, after
some polls had shown him leading Dole just barely, by 4 points in a
CBS News-New York Times poll and 2 points in an ABC News-Washington
Post survey.
   ``The voters of New Hampshire have a well-deserved reputation of
upsetting poll results, and tonight was a good example of that,''
said NBC News pollster Laurily Epstein. ``People change their
minds, and you can't poll for that.''
   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal exit poll found that 14 percent
of the GOP voters in New Hampshire made up their minds on primary
day, with 36 percent going for Bush and 29 percent for Dole.
Another 11 percent decided during the weekend, breaking 44 percent
for Bush to 31 percent for Dole.
   ``It was the undecideds. The undecideds went for Bush,'' said
John Berrigan, a poll analyst for ABC News. A key reason: Bush's
identification with President Reagan, who is very popular among New
Hampshire Republicans.
   ``The Reagan coattails were there,'' said Jerry Strom, an NBC
News poll consultant. ``People who like Reagan were going strongly
for Bush.''
   NBC's exit poll supported that contention. Three-quarters of
Republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set
by Reagan; 88 percent of Bush's supporters held that view, compared
with 66 percent of Dole's.
   There were fewer Reagan backers in Iowa, and more of them went
for Dole than for Bush, albeit narrowly, in the precinct caucuses
Feb. 8. Dole won big there while Bush suffered a third-place
embarrassment.
   Berrigan said New Hampshire's economic vitality could explain
Reagan's popularity in that state, and its benefit for Bush. ``You
may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here, a belief
that there may be a threat if I don't go with someone who's
following the same line,'' he said.
   Perhaps for similar reasons, a third of Republicans said
experience was the chief factor in their vote, and 54 percent of
them voted for Bush, to 37 percent for Dole, the CBS-Times poll
said. Dole won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strong
leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for Bush, but that group made
up just 19 percent of the GOP total.
   Another key for Bush was his extensive campaign organization in
New Hampshire. The CBS-Times poll found that 47 percent of Bush's
backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his
organization, while just 26 percent of Dole's supporters reported
contact by the Dole campaign.
   ``I think the thing that won it for Bush was his organization,''
said Warren Mitofsky, polling chief at CBS News.
   While the polls did not anticipate the extent of Bush's victory,
Mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race: Bush way ahead
before the Iowa caucuses, dropping sharply after losing to Dole and
Pat Robertson in Iowa, then halting his slide and rebounding during
the weekend.
   Speaking on CBS, Bush credited his victory to a surge of support
in the last 48 hours. ``I learned from that, fight back. Fight
on,'' he said. ``It's taught me a good lesson: Do not be
discouraged by the polling numbers.''
   The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democratic
side, where Michael Dukakis won handily, as expected. ABC had him
winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in
organization.
   The poll results also indicated Dukakis' backyard advantage. ABC
said 55 percent of Democrats rated Dukakis above average as
governor of neighboring Massachusetts, and 59 percent of them voted
for him. Moreover, the CBS-Times poll found that 20 percent of New
Hampshire's Democratic voters moved there from Massachusetts, and
four in 10 of them went for Dukakis.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt's second-place finish appeared to be aided
by his first-place showing in Iowa. Of the voters who made up their
minds after Iowa, 27 percent went to Gephardt, 26 percent to
Dukakis and 20 percent to Sen. Paul Simon, who finished second in
Iowa and third in New Hampshire.

   George Bush, the formal, patrician
Republican whose presidential bid had been thrown into sudden peril
with a trouncing in Iowa, stood in the lot at Cuzzin Richie's
truckstop.
   ``This is the real me,'' he insisted, climbing into the cab of
an 18-wheeler. ``This is my home turf.''
   It was three days after the vice president had been crushed in
an embarrassing third-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses.
Bob Dole, riding the wave out of Iowa, was surging here in New
Hampshire.
   But then came the new George Bush and his new campaign. With a
U-turn in style and approach, Bush came back and blunted Dole's
surge with a big victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
   Bush's formidable organization swung into high gear. The vice
president's association with President Reagan, which had hurt him
in Iowa, proved a big plus here _ one that Bush milked for all it
was worth.
   And an eleventh-hour advertising campaign, attacking Dole and
touting the support of Barry Goldwater, helped bring him back from
the edge of the abyss.
   The vice president went from a 20-point edge over Dole before
Iowa to as much as 8 points behind. But the tracking polls said
Dole peaked about Friday, the day the Bush campaign hit the
airwaves with a new ad accusing Dole of ``straddling'' major issues.
   In nearly final returns Tuesday, Bush held a 9-point margin over
Bush: 38-29.
   On the night of his big defeat in Iowa, Bush seemed stunned.
Asked if his big entourage, Secret Service protection and
arms-length style were getting in the way of reaching the people,
Bush answered that he wasn't sure.
   Still shaky the next day, Bush started before dawn to greet
workers at a factory gate. But few workers used that entrance and
Bush spent a good portion of the time talking to reporters.
   Then Bush tried out a new slogan: ``I'm one of you.'' Born in
New England and with a home in neighboring Maine, Bush appealed to
Granite State voters as his neighbors. But he drifted away from the
slogan, which was too close to the ``He's one of us'' theme Dole
had used in Iowa.
   Then, 36 hours after Iowa, New Hampshire voters saw the new
George Bush.
   Canceling a swing through the South, Bush flew back in from his
weekly lunch in Washington with President Reagan and went to the
giant Pheasant Lane Shopping Mall in Nashua to shake hands late
Wednesday.
   Munching a chocolate-chip cookie, Bush shook hands with dozens
of voters and heard some of them say he had their vote.
   ``That's good to hear,'' he told one supporter. ``It's a good
morale booster.''
   With that, gone were the formal events, the speeches, the ``town
meetings'' with the carefully orchestrated crowds.
   Now it was the informal George and ``impromptu campaign stops.''
   The first came at the East Coast Lumberyard in East Hampstead,
N.H. There, in a casual coat and a cap, Bush shook hands with
customers and staff and drove a giant forklift around the yard. It
was all for the benefit of the media, so the voters could see Bush
mixing with people and doing everyday tasks.
   Then it was onto Cuzzin Richie's, near Portsmouth on the
seacoast. He talked to truckers and drove a semi-rig around the
block _ with a Secret Service man hanging off the mirror and the
armored limousine right behind.
   To go with the new freewheeling style were tough new ads hitting
at Dole.
   One labeled Dole as a man who had straddled the issues of taxes,
the INF treaty and an oil import fee.
   Another _ a five-minute election-eve buy _ featured Barry
Goldwater, known as Mr. Conservative, backing Bush. Still another
hit at Dole for backing a national economic commission.
   That ``exists to provide political cover for a tax hike. If it
doesn't recommend a tax increase, I'll not only eat my hat, I'll
eat Bob Dole's hat,'' Bush said in the ad.
   Bush continued to campaign in malls and stores and nursing
homes, reaching out to people directly, in the retail campaigning
style that the state once insisted upon. He brought baseball great
Ted Williams to the state to add a celebrity touch to the final
days.
   All the while, his well-respected organization was cranking away
at high speed, focused on getting its 40,000 potential supporters
to the polls.
   The final piece of the puzzle was Bush himself.
   A private man in a public job, Bush was forced to begin talking
about himself _ not as a public official, but as a person.
   ``Mostly these days, I think of Lincoln _ `Here I stand, warts
and all,'' he told a group of senior citizens in Portsmouth.
   ``I have a tendency _ and I will confess to it _ to avoid going
on and on with great eloquent statements of belief. There may be
better orators out there, but nobody believes more strongly. ...
Maybe in some ways, I'm a little more taciturn than I could be,''
he said.
   ``I care too much to quit now. ... So can you help me?''
   New Hampshire Republicans heard and heeded that plea.

   A former employee of a Silicon Valley
defense contractor fatally shot seven people and wounded five
others at the company's offices Tuesday, including a woman who had
spurned him, authorities said.
   The man, identified by police as Richard Wade Farley, 39,
surrendered after barricading himself inside the building for about
six hours. Three officers grabbed him as he walked out with his
hands in the air and he was taken to the Santa Clara County Jail in
nearby San Jose.
   Employees dove under desks and inside closets as the gunman shot
his way into the two-story ESL Corp. buiding, witnesses said.
   As the siege continued into the evening, police negotiators
talked by telephone with the man, who at times was tearful and
``expressed a little remorse'' for his actions, said Lt. Tom Moore
of the Sunnyvale Public Safety Department.
   Two women and five men were killed, said Alex Michaelis,
commander of the safety department. They were not immediately
identified.
   The gunman, who was fired from the company three years ago, had
called police and said he shot three people on the first floor
``and as many on the second floor,'' said Capt. Al Scott of the
safety department. He was armed with a rifle, shotgun and two
handguns, Scott said.
   One woman was listed in critical condition; two others were in
good condition. The condition of two other victims was not
immediately available.
   The gunman said he entered the building planning to destroy
equipment but began shooting employees because ``he felt threatened
by them,'' according to Lt. Rueben Grijalva, the chief police
negotiator.
   On the second floor, he saw Laura Black, the woman who had
rejected his advances, Grijalva said. She slammed an office door in
his face and he shot her through the door, wounding her in the
shoulder.
   At least three people had been reported holed up in a computer
room and making telephone calls to police, while others were able
to escape.
   The shooting began about 2:30 p.m. at the subsidiary of TRW,
about 40 miles south of San Francisco, near San Jose.
   ``I saw a man walk up and I didn't really pay attention and then
just shortly later I heard bang, large bangs, and I realized it
must be shots,'' said witness Norma Kessler, who hid in her office.
   ``I was in the office by myself and I closed the door and it
locked and I got underneath my desk and I must have heard about 50
different shots over a period of time. I must have been in there
maybe 20 minutes, something like that.''
   Nearby, police found a motor home they believe was driven by the
gunman. Inside, officers found a quantity of ammunition, full cans
of gasoline and other explosive material, Scott said.
   Black had been a target of Farley's affections for about four
years, Moore said. Farley, who worked at ESL as a computer software
technician, reportedly followed Black and Black had tried to obtain
a restraining order to keep him away, he said. The two were never
believed to have dated, he said.
   ``It was described to me a situation that had turned into
harassment. He had, according to him, had given her a warning and
she didn't heed the warning and he said this was his way of making
a point,'' Scott said.
   ESL, or Electro-magnetic Science Lab, was established in 1964
and specializes in electronic warfare systems for the Navy, most of
them highly classified. Products include recognizance systems,
data-communications systems, computer simulation and image
processing.

<HEAD>Pentagon Confirms That Some Warships Being Withdrawn From Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Reagan administration says withdrawal of
some warships in the Persian Gulf represents a ``fine-tuning'' of
the U.S. presence, but it also is voicing concern over the conduct
of Iraqi forces in the region.
   There are currently 28 ships in the region, but the helicopter
carrier Okinawa, the battleship Iowa and two escorts are coming
home without being replaced, assistant secretary of defense Richard
Armitage said Tuesday.
   ``Our mission of protecting U.S. flag ships in the gulf remains
unchanged,'' Armitage said. ``We don't think the (overall) threat
has abated. However, we think we've learned a lot of lessons in the
mine-sweeping area and this allows us primarily to pull out (some
of the ships).''
   Armitage said the Pentagon no longer thinks it needs
mine-sweeping helicopters along with mine-sweeping ships, clearing
the way for the Okinawa's departure.
   Armitage, in charge of international security affairs, also said
the United States already had protested to Baghdad an incident
Saturday in which an Iraqi jet fired a missile near a U.S.
destroyer.
   He said the administration planned to send a team of military
officials to Iraq later this week to discuss the matter further.
   Armitage also said that the administration had no plans to offer
military protection to U.S.-owned ships flying foreign flags.
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``This represents a fine-tuning of our position in the Gulf
and not a policy change that would be reflected in overall forces
or in other countries' actions.''
   The remarks by Armitage were the first reflecting official
administration concern about Iraqi military operations near U.S.
ships. The United States thought it had won Iraqi agreement after
the deadly attack on the USS Stark last May to keep jet fighters
roughly 40 miles away from American warships.
   In Saturday's incident, an Iraqi jet failed to respond to Navy
radio calls and fired a missile that passed close to the destroyer
Chandler during a convoy operation.
   Armitage announced other moves that had been previously outlined
Jan. 26:
   _The aircraft carrier Enterprise has just replaced the carrier
Midway in the northern Arabian Sea, making it easier to order the
Iowa home. The Enterprise is a much larger, nuclear-powered carrier
with a larger air wing than that aboard the Midway.
   _The command ship of the Middle East Force, the LaSalle, will
soon be replaced in a routine rotation by the Coronado.
   _The amphibious landing ship Portland is being replaced by the
amphibious landing ship Trenton, which will be carrying Marine
Cobra attack copters.

   The U.S. dollar closed lower against the Japanese

   The dollar closed at 130.11 yen, down 0.09 yen from Tuesday's
close of 130.50, after beginning the day's trading at 130.30 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which rose 138.19 points Tuesday, gained 84.29 points or 0.35
percent to close at 24,429.95.
   Trading volume in the morning session was estimated at 400
million shares, up from the 340 million shares traded in Tuesday's
morning session.
   Currency trading was dull because there are no new developments
to move the market, said Shigeki Kawano, a senior currency trader
at Mitsubishi Bank.
   Following the release last Friday of favorable U.S. trade
figures for December, export-oriented shares like electronics
posted gains in morning trading. Investors also purchased
supermarket and department store stocks, reflecting a positive
trend in retail issues, dealers said.

<HEAD>In New Hampshire, a Change of GOP Minds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late-deciding Republican voters confounded the
polls and boosted George Bush to his convincing victory over Sen.
Bob Dole in the New Hampshire presidential primary, analysts say.
   Voters who made their choice in the race's final days went
strongly for Bush, in part because of his superior campaign
organization, his ties to the Reagan administration and his
experience in office, exit polls indicated Tuesday.
   The result was a 9-point victory for the vice president, after
some polls had shown him leading Dole just barely, by 4 points in a
CBS News-New York Times poll and 2 points in an ABC News-Washington
Post survey.
   ``The voters of New Hampshire have a well-deserved reputation of
upsetting poll results, and tonight was a good example of that,''
said NBC News pollster Laurily Epstein. ``People change their
minds, and you can't poll for that.''
   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal exit poll found that 14 percent
of the GOP voters in New Hampshire made up their minds on primary
day, with 36 percent going for Bush and 29 percent for Dole.
Another 11 percent decided during the weekend, breaking 44 percent
for Bush to 31 percent for Dole.
   ``It was the undecideds. The undecideds went for Bush,'' said
John Berrigan, a poll analyst for ABC News. A key reason: Bush's
identification with President Reagan, who is very popular among New
Hampshire Republicans.
   ``The Reagan coattails were there,'' said Jerry Strom, an NBC
News poll consultant. ``People who like Reagan were going strongly
for Bush.''
   NBC's exit poll supported that contention. Three-quarters of
Republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set
by Reagan; 88 percent of Bush's supporters held that view, compared
with 66 percent of Dole's.
   There were fewer Reagan backers in Iowa, and more of them went
for Dole than for Bush, albeit narrowly, in the precinct caucuses
Feb. 8. Dole won big there while Bush suffered a third-place
embarrassment.
   Berrigan said New Hampshire's economic vitality could explain
Reagan's popularity in that state, and its benefit for Bush. ``You
may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here, a belief
that there may be a threat if I don't go with someone who's
following the same line,'' he said.
   Perhaps for similar reasons, a third of Republicans said
experience was the chief factor in their vote, and 54 percent of
them voted for Bush, to 37 percent for Dole, the CBS-Times poll
said. Dole won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strong
leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for Bush, but that group made
up just 19 percent of the GOP total.
   Another key for Bush was his extensive campaign organization in
New Hampshire. The CBS-Times poll found that 47 percent of Bush's
backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his
organization, while just 26 percent of Dole's supporters reported
contact by the Dole campaign.
   ``I think the thing that won it for Bush was his organization,''
said Warren Mitofsky, polling chief at CBS News.
   While the polls did not anticipate the extent of Bush's victory,
Mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race: Bush way ahead
before the Iowa caucuses, dropping sharply after losing to Dole and
Pat Robertson in Iowa, then halting his slide and rebounding during
the weekend.
   Speaking on CBS, Bush credited his victory to a surge of support
in the last 48 hours. ``I learned from that, fight back. Fight
on,'' he said. ``It's taught me a good lesson: Do not be
discouraged by the polling numbers.''
   The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democratic
side, where Michael Dukakis won handily, as expected. ABC had him
winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in
organization.
   The poll results also indicated Dukakis' backyard advantage. ABC
said 55 percent of Democrats rated Dukakis above average as
governor of neighboring Massachusetts, and 59 percent of them voted
for him. Moreover, the CBS-Times poll found that 20 percent of New
Hampshire's Democratic voters moved there from Massachusetts, and
four in 10 of them went for Dukakis.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt's second-place finish appeared to be aided
by his first-place showing in Iowa. Of the voters who made up their
minds after Iowa, 27 percent went to Gephardt, 26 percent to
Dukakis and 20 percent to Sen. Paul Simon, who finished second in
Iowa and third in New Hampshire.

<HEAD>New Hampshire Primary Wins Provide Psychological Boost, But Few
Delegates</HEAD>

   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis leave New Hampshire today with a slight bump in their
delegate totals that keeps them both on top in the race for their
parties' presidential nominations.
   But the lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more
psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1,139
delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination or
the 2,082 delegates for the Democratic nomination.
   Vice President Bush, who picked up 38 percent of the Republican
vote in Tuesday's primary, gained 11 of New Hampshire's 23
delegates to the GOP National Convention. In all, Bush now has 61
delegates.
   Dukakis, who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in the
primary, won 9 of the state's 18 pledged delegates to that national
convention. The Massachusetts governor has 44.5 delegates.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas gained 7 delegates
in New Hampshire to bring his national total to 42, while Rep. Jack
Kemp of New York won 3 delegates to raise his total to 35.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the winner of last week's
Iowa Democratic caucuses, gained 6 national convention delegates
for his second-place showing in New Hampshire, and Sen. Paul Simon
of Illinois followed with 3 delegates. In the popular vote in New
Hampshire, Gephardt won 20 percent while Simon had 17 percent.
   Gephardt now has 39 delegates, while Simon has 33.
   Under Democratic Party rules, the national convention delegates
were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15
percent of the vote. In effect, that disqualified Jesse Jackson,
Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt
and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart from receiving any delegates
from New Hampshire.
   Jackson won 8 percent of the vote, Gore 7 percent, Babbitt 5
percent and Hart 4 percent.
   New Hampshire Republicans have a similar rule, but the threshold
is 10 percent. That meant former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, who
had 10.1 percent, picked up 2 delegates, but former television
evangelist Pat Robertson, who was within 1,100 votes of du Pont,
received no delegates because he had just 9.5 percent of the vote.
   Robertson already had 8 delegates, while du Pont had none before
Tuesday's primary.
   Among the Democrats, Gore already had 10.55 delegates, Jackson
had 9.8 and Babbitt had 4.
   The delegate totals for the Republicans include results from
Michigan, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Guam. Although
Iowa and Hawaii both have held GOP caucuses, precise delegate
figures cannot be calculated until later because of the way the
selection process is structured.
   The Democratic totals include results from Iowa and New
Hampshire, as well as an Associated Press survey of Democratic
governors and Democratic National Committee members who will serve
automatically as delegates to their party's convention. Some of the
Democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention.

<HEAD>Symbol of Anti-Castro Militancy Returns To Face Parole Charges</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead unlikely from closed, procedural parole hearing at jail

<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

   Anti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch returned here
confident he will have freedom after his third acquittal in
Venezuela on charges he planned the 1976 explosion of a Cuban
jetliner that killed 73 people, his lawyer said.
   Bosch immediately was taken into custody by U.S. marshals upon
his arrival Tuesday from Caracas. He faces charges of violating
parole on his 1972 conviction in a bazooka attack on a Polish ship
here.
   Bosch, 61, made a brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Linnea
Johnson, who scheduled a preliminary parole hearing for today. No
decision was expected.
   Bosch's attorney, Hank Adorno, said his client should be
released because he voluntarily returned to face the charges.
Adorno said Bosch fled the United States in 1974 only because his
life was in danger.
   ``He served 11 or 11{ years in a Venezuelan prison for a crime
he didn't commit,'' Adorno said. ``He should be allowed to live as
a productive member of the Cuban-American community.''
   But Adorno said legal technicalities made a quick release for
Bosch unlikely.
   ``He knew when he came here what he was getting into,'' said
Bosch's wife, Adriana. ``We are confident when it is all over he
will be free.''
   The news of Bosch's arrival took Miami's closely knit Cuban
community by surprise, but initial reactions were positive.
   ``At last the man is free,'' said Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the
influential Cuban American National Foundation, adding that the
community's reaction ``is one of rejoicing.''
   He said he recently received a letter from Bosch indicating an
embracing of the foundation's more peaceful approach to
democratizing Cuba.
   Bosch was found innocent in Venezuela of the bombing charges for
a third time Aug. 7 and was held in a secret location by Venezuelan
police for security reasons while awaiting an appeal by the
prosecution. But no appeal was filed within a 90-day limit and the
acquittal held.
   After Bosch fled to Venezuela, he was charged with planning the
Cuban airliner explosion. Most of those killed in the blast were
Cuban athletes who had competed in a Central American and Caribbean
Games competition in Venezuela.
   Venezuelans Hernan Ricardo and Freddy Lugo were sentenced to 20
years for the bombing. A fourth defendant, Cuban-born Luis Posada
Carriles, escaped from jail in 1986 and reportedly was fighting
with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Bosch contended he was framed by pro-Castro forces for the 1968
attack on the Polish freighter, which was engaged in trade with
Cuba. The ship was dented and there were no injuries, but the
United States formally apologized to Poland and the FBI cracked
down on militant anti-Castro groups.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar continued its decline against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo today after hitting a two-month closing high
Monday, while stocks rose for the fifth consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 130.11 yen, down 0.09 yen from Tuesday's
close of 130.50 yen, after starting the day at 130.30 yen. The U.S.
currency, which hit a two-month closing high of 131.00 Monday,
ranged from 130.25 yen to 130.48 yen in dealings today.
   Most dealers, up to 90 percent, are waiting for a new trend to
develop following the release of U.S. trade figures last Friday,
said a foreign exchange dealer at a major Japanese commercial bank.
   ``No one really believes there will be a solid improvement in
the U.S. fiscal deficit, but there are a lot of supportive elements
in the form of trust banks and other Japanese institutional buyers
backing the dollar,'' said the dealer. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which rose 138.19 points Tuesday, posted a
84.29-point gain to close at 24,429.95. A relatively heavy 700
million shares were traded in the first section.
   Retailers, trading houses and other import-related shares sold
well as buyers concentrated on firms expected to benefit from
growing domestic demand.
   Nobuo Ono of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest security house,
said the biggest factor now influencing the market was the dollar's
relative stability against the yen, combined with favorable market
conditions.
   ``The exchange rate is stable at around 130 yen and, while it's
not ideal, it's a far cry from the doomsday forecasts of 100 yen to
the dollar,'' Ono said.
   He also said the five-day rally on the stock exchange showed the
market was attracting investors.

   JoBeth Williams will portray surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould in an ABC television movie about the landmark court
battle over custody of ``Baby M,'' a network spokeswoman said.
   The two-part movie, to air at an undetermined date this spring,
will also feature John Shea, Dabney Coleman and Bruce Weitz, ABC
spokeswoman Laurel Whitcomb said Tuesday.
   The goal of the movie ``is to tell the story without adopting
any one point of view,'' Ms. Whitcomb said in a telephone interview
from Los Angeles.
   The movie will include an update at the end because the case is
still unfolding, Ms. Whitcomb said.
   The latest developments involve legal proceedings to determine
the visitation schedule for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, whose parental
rights to the 22-month old child were restored in a New Jersey
Supreme Court decision earlier this month.
   The state's highest court overturned a lower court decision that
upheld a $10,000 contract under which Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was
artificially inseminated with William Stern's sperm and bore the
child for him and his wife, Elizabeth.
   In addition to stripping Mrs. Whitehead-Gould of her parental
rights, the lower court last March 31 awarded custody to the Sterns.
   The Supreme Court maintained custody for the Sterns but voided
the contract and ruled that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was entitled to a
hearing on visiting the child.
   Attorneys for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and the Sterns have agreed to
try to reach an out-of-court settlement on visitation rights.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Harold Cassidy, said Tuesday
that his client would be seeking more visitation time than the
current two hours a week.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who originally called the child Sara,
``has agreed to call the child Melissa and do whatever it takes to
achieve harmony,'' the attorney said.
   Williams starred in ``The Big Chill,'' ``Poltergeist'' and
``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' and received an Emmy nomination for her part
in the TV movie ``Adam.''
   Shea, who starred in ``Witness'' and ``Windy City,'' will
portray Stern. Coleman, star of television's ``The Slap Maxwell
Story'' will star as Gary Skoloff, the attorney representing the
Sterns.
   Weitz will portray Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's former husband,
Richard, whom she divorced last year.
   Robin Strasser will portray Elizabeth Stern and Anne Jackson
will star as Lorraine Abraham, Baby M's court-appointed guardian.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's right to a fair trial
in criminal court will be severely harmed if his impeachment trial
starts Monday as scheduled, his lawyer told the Arizona Senate.
   Mecham attorney Murray Miller said Tuesday that conducting the
impeachment trial first would subject the criminal trial to
prejudicial publicity.
   ``In my judgment he will be convicted in the criminal trial if
this matter (the impeachment trial) is going to proceed and he is
convicted here,'' Miller said. ``It just is in the cards ... and I
fear for his liberty.''
   The Senate was expected to decide late today whether to delay
the impeachment trial. Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican,
said he expected the Senate to approve some type of delay but he
would not predict how long it would be.
   Miller said that if the Senate decides to go ahead with the
trial next week, he will ask a court to halt it. However, some
senators have questioned whether the courts have the authority to
order the Legislature to delay an impeachment trial.
   The Senate also decided to wait until today to reconsider a
policy that allows all 30 senators to meet in closed conference
during the impeachment trial.
   The House approved 23 articles of impeachment against the
Republican governor Feb. 5, accusing him of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund
and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by
a state official.
   Mecham is scheduled to stand trial March 9 on six felony charges
contained in an indictment that accuse him of fraud, perjury and
filing false documents in connection with the $350,000 loan. He
also faces a March 17 recall election.
   Miller said the Senate trial should be delayed until after the
criminal trial, or at least delayed 90 days to give him more time
to prepare his case.
   The House impeachment board of managers, which is overseeing the
prosecution in the Senate trial, said in a written response that
the Arizona Constitution does not require the Senate to await the
outcome of Mecham's criminal trial.
   The five-member House board said a delay would leave the state
government ``in limbo.'' Mecham has asked Secretary of State Rose
Mofford, who is acting governor, not to accept resignations from
his staff and not to approve any tax increases, which he opposes.
   House counsel William French said the criminal trial would not
be over until mid- to late May at the earliest. ``I think that's
too long for the state of Arizona to remain in a flux,'' he said.
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, a Republican, said he had
examined the records of other impeachment trials and did not find
that they had been delayed until after related criminal trials.
   The Senate met briefly Tuesday in a closed session to discuss
whether it should change its rule on closed conferences during the
trial. The conferences would be intended to let senators meet with
their lawyers, discuss possible questions to be asked and possibly
to hold final deliberations.
   The policy has been criticized by the media, and 11 senators
boycotted Tuesday's closed meeting.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Injunction On Japanese Gillnet Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court says Japanese salmon
fishermen who accidentally catch seals, killer whales and other
mammals are violating an animal protection law.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday upheld a preliminary
injunction issued by a federal district judge last June that
revoked a permit and halted gillnet fishing for salmon by Japanese
fleets in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska.
   In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel rejected an appeal by the
Federation of Japan Fisheries Cooperative Association to overturn
the preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson.
   The injunction was obtained by an environmental group and a
native Alaskan fisherman's organization to stop the accidental
taking of sea lions, fur seals, white porpoises and killer whales
that could be ensnared in the nine-mile-long gillnets.
   As issued by the secretary of commerce, the three-year permit
would have allowed the Japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5,250
Dall's porpoises in the northern Pacific Ocean _ including 789 in
the Bering Sea.
   The court ruled that the permit, which allowed the Japanese
fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took,
violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

<HEAD>Justice Says Not Enough Give and Take in Court Deliberations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says
there isn't enough give and take at the private conferences the
justices hold to review appeals and vote on pending cases.
   Scalia, the newest sitting justice, in an address at the George
Washington University Law School, said calling what the justices do
a ``conference'' is ``a misnomer.''
   ``Not very much conferencing goes on,'' Scalia said. ``I don't
like that. Maybe it's because I'm new or an ex-academic, maybe
because I am right.''
   Scalia said the primary purposes of the conferences are to
provide an opportunity for the justices to state their views on
cases and to tally up their votes.
   The conferences are held weekly when the court is in session.
Only the members of the court attend the closed-door meetings in
which they decide whether to hear particular appeals and make final
decisions on cases in which they have heard arguments.
   Scalia became a justice in 1986 and will be joined by on the
court by Anthony M. Kennedy, who will be sworn in Thursday as the
ninth member, filling a vacancy created when Justice Lewis F.
Powell retired last June.

<HEAD>Court: Humane Society May Sue To Stop Hunting On Federal Preserves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled the Humane
Society has legal standing to challenge the expansion of hunting on
federal wildlife preserves.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday
overturned a district judge's finding that the Humane Society of
the United States lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the
Interior Department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife
preserves.
   ``The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on
wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses
and environmental degradation, in addition to depleting the supply
of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view,'' the court
said in an opinion written by Chief Judge Patricia Wald.
   David J. Hayes, a Washington attorney who represented the Humane
Society, called the decision significant because ``it confirms that
environmental groups like the Humane Society have the right to
bring actions based on their members' concerns about harms to their
aesthetic interests.''
   While ruling the society had a legal right to sue, the court
upheld the Interior Department's decision to allow waterfowl
hunting on Chincoteague Island, Va.
   The appeals court decision sends a district court case back to
District Judge Thomas A. Flanneryfor a ruling on the merits of the
Humane Society's claims that the Interior Department had not
properly evaluated the wildlife populations of other preserves
before allowing hunting.

<HEAD>Weinberger Skeptical About Fundamental Kremlin Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
questions whether fundamental policy changes are taking place in
the Soviet Union and whether Mikhail Gorbachev can keep his post as
top leader.
   ``I think we have to be very careful if we assume there are
major policy changes,'' Weinberger said. ``I don't know ... how
firmly seated is the present regime. I don't think any of us really
know that.''
   ``I'm not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretary
of the Communist party of the Soviet Union who is very different,''
from the past, Weinberger told the Washington Foreign
Correspondents Association Tuesday.
   Weinberger, who was succeeded by Defense Secetary Frank Carlucci
late last year, described as ``surface changes,'' the new look at
the Kremlin. ``Gorbachev smiles from time to time, he wears much
better clothes, and he's younger and apparently in better health''
than past leaders, he said.
   ``The principal change I see in the Soviet Union is that they
are now actively courting world public opinion, campaigning for a
favorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they are
getting it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hart, Last Among Democrats, Says He's Looking For `Long-Term Gain'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Gary Hart, who finished dead last
in the primary he won in 1984, vowed to remain in the race despite
his poor showing.
   ``We're going to take this fight all the way across this nation
_ into the South, into the industrial Midwest and then we're going
to head West, where I live,'' Hart told a roomful of supporters
after finishing at the bottom of the Democratic field in the New
Hampshire primary.
   In nearly complete returns, the former Colorado senator had just
4 percent of the vote, but put the best face on it.
   His showing, he said, was ``500 percent better than Iowa,''
where he won barely 1 percent of the vote in last week's caucuses.
   Hart dropped out of the race last May after questions surfaced
about his relationship with model Donna Rice. He returned to New
Hampshire to re-enter the race in December, soared for a time in
the polls, then slumped to the back of the pack.
   Four years ago, Hart stunned the political establishment by
upsetting front-runner Walter Mondale in the New Hampshire primary,
gaining status as a credible candidate. He said he never expected
to do that well again this year.
   ``We have just begun. We are committed,'' said Hart.
   Earlier, Hart said his faltering campaign had enough money to
last until delegate-rich Super Tuesday on March 8.
   ``I've always mentally prepared for a long-term gain, not a
break-through early on,'' Hart said.
   Campaign manager Sue Casey said the candidate had $400,000 in
his campaign treasury _ enough, she said for three weeks of
campaigning prior to the caucuses and primaries in the 20 Super
Tuesday states.
   ``I don't have to do what other candidates have to do,'' Hart
said during a campaign stop in Portland, Maine, before the votes
were tallied. ``Other candidates have to make a certain showing to
get money and get support. We have support in 50 states.''

   A group of leading Israeli writers
called on the government to withdraw from the occupied territories
and conduct direct negotiations with Palestinian leaders.
   ``I am in favor of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as early
as tomorrow morning,'' author Amos Oz told more than 500 people who
gathered to protest Israeli policy in the occupied lands.
   ``I am in favor of a Palestinian state ... because that is the
way to life. Other ways lead to death.''
   The Association of Israeli Playwrights organized Tuesday's
gathering, which drew widely known actors, singers and poets,
including several who had not previously expressed their views
publicly on the unrest in the occupied lands.
   One of them, poet Erez Biton, said that the riots in the
occupied territories made it clear to him that through 20 years of
Israeli occupation the Palestinians had become a nation.
   ``I think this is the first time I'm not too mad at the
Palestinians,'' Biton said. ``From their point of view, their
behavior is absolutely one of honor.''
   The disturbances, which broke out Dec. 8, have intensified the
controversy among Israelis about what to do with the territories
captured during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud
Bloc, is against yielding any part of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip in return for peace. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, head
of the left-leaning Labor Party, favors compromise.
   Both Israeli leaders advocate peace talks with Jordan and refuse
to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is
outlawed in Israel as a terrorist group.
   According to U.N. figures, the unrest has left 54 Palestinians
dead, most by Israeli gunfire.
   The army has used live bullets, then rubber ones and finally
beatings to quell the protests. Israeli troops have wounded or
severely beaten hundreds of Palestinians and more than 1,000 others
been detained or jailed.
   Oz said the Israeli crackdown on Palestinian demonstrators was
increasing hatred between Arabs and Israelis. He predicted Israel's
occupation would eventually collapse whether the two sides reach
agreement or not.
   Yehoshafat Harkabi, a lecturer at the Hebrew University, said
Israelis and Arabs were beginning to realize they have no choice
but to accept one another.
   ``The Arabs have learned that if the conflict continues it will
become hell for both Israel and the Arab countries,'' said Harkabi,
a former army intelligence chief. ``Both the Palestinians and the
Israelis will suffer because both are in the same boat.''
   Harkabi said Israel must start negotiating right away.
   ``The longer we wait, the worse the conditions will be,'' he
said. ``I realized long ago that if Israel adopts a moderate policy
we will achieve the best possible terms.''
   Oz said peace advocates must persuade Likud voters to vote for
left-wing parties in elections scheduled for the fall.
   ``We must try to talk seriously with the many people in Israel
who are afraid to give (the West bank towns of) Nablus, Hebron and
Ramallah back to the Arabs because they are afraid the Arabs will
chase us out of Haifa as well,'' Oz said.
   ``The feelings are complicated. They include an element of
genuine fear, historical trauma, many years of Palestinian threats
and an element of right-wing demagogy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Death Toll in Attack on Temple Rises to Seven</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more people died today of injuries
sustained in a grenade attack on a Hindu temple a day earlier,
raising the death toll to seven, state-run Sri Lankan Radio said.
   The radio quoted hospital sources as saying two people succumbed
to their injuries early this morning. All the victims were Tamil
Hindus who were at the temple in southern Colombo to celebrate the
Mahashivaratri festival.
   Mahashivaratri day is celebrated as the birthday of Lord Shiva,
one of the three major gods in the Hindu pantheon.
   More than 60 people were in the Sri Kathiresan Temple when two
hand grenades were thrown into its inner chamber, witnesses said.
Five people were killed on the spot. At least eight others remain
hospitaized.
   Members of the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, are suspected of being behind the attack, a police
officer connected with investigations said.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Tigers attacked the temple because members of a rival militant
group, the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, had
sought refuge there.
   The Tigers, who have spearheaded a separatist guerrilla war for
a Tamil homeland since 1983, often have been blamed for attacks on
rival groups considered to be more moderate in their demands.
   Meanwhile, President Junius R. Jayewardene condemned the
assassination Tuesday of popular movie star and major politician
Vijaya Kumaranatunga.
   ``I have no doubt the whole island would consider this act of
terrorism with horror and condemnation,'' Jayewardene said in a
statement published by local newspapers today.
   Kumaranatunga, son-in-law of former Prime Minister Sirimavo
Bandaranaike, was shot at his Colombo residence by gunmen believed
to belong to an outlawed Sinhalese group. Another person injured in
the gunfire later died in hospital.
   State-run radio blamed the killings on the outlawed People's
Liberation Front, which has vowed to attack supporters of a peace
accord aimed at ending the Tamil separatist war. More than 150
killings have been blamed on the Front.
   India sponsored the peace accord last summer to bring the civil
war to an end.
   Kumaranatunga, secretary-general of the Sri Lanka People's
Liberation Party, was a vocal supporter of the July 29 accord.
   The Front claims the accord gives too many concessions to the
Tamils and has compromised the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. More than
42,000 Indian soldiers have been deployed on the island under the
terms of the accord to disarm Tamil rebels.
   Kumaranatunga acted in more than 100 Sinhalese films, mostly as
the leading man.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who form 75 percent of the population. More than 8,000
people have been killed in the year separatist war.

<TEXT>
   It was a ballgame, a prize fight, a poker game
and the always popular footrace. It was high stakes, make or break,
a snowslide, the shoe on the other foot, popcorn in a microwave.
   Amid a muddle of metaphors, the networks struggled Tuesday night
to impress viewers with the importance of the New Hampshire
primary, occasionally noting with belated cynicism that if they
weren't all there, it wouldn't really mean much.
   ABC anchor Peter Jennings opened his newscast Tuesday by noting,
``New Hampshire can't make a candidate, but it certainly can break
one.''
   He was seconded by Jeff Greenfield, who described the press
attention on the nation's first presidential primary as smothering
rather than covering and suggested ``one of the most interesting
aspects of the New Hampshire primary is not what we will know when
it's over, but what we won't know.''
   Vice President George Bush's surprisingly strong comeback was
the obvious lead. On the Democratic side, losers were news.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won as expected, so the question
became who among the remaining candidates would stay the course.
   For also-rans as well as front-runners, the task Tuesday night
was putting on the best face for the national television audience.
Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who finished out of the money, told
CNN's Mary Alice Williams he had managed to find his finish in the
low one-digits ``disappointing but not discouraging.''
   Later on NBC, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon noted more candidly of
his third-place finish, ``This isn't helping.''
   Dole, whose alleged ``mean-spiritedness'' became an issue in the
campaign, didn't help his image. In Greenfield's piece on ABC, he
was heard during a campaign stop muttering to an interloping Bush
supporter, ``Go back to your cave.''
   NBC's Tom Brokaw orchestrated the liveliest moment in the
night's coverage, with Bush in the studio and Dole live on a
monitor. Brokaw asked Bush what he would like to say to his
opponent.
   ``I wish him well and will see him in the South,'' said a
cheerful Bush. But when Brokaw asked Dole the same question, he
snapped, ``Stop lying about my record.''
   There were milder rematches between anchors and politicians.
   Rather interviewed Bush live for the first time since their
interview-turned-debate during the ``CBS Evening News'' last month
that sparked a flurry of complaints about Rather's aggressive
questioning. This time, Rather sat quietly and let Bush talk, then
happily characterized the New Hampshire win as ``a joy and a
jubilation'' for Bush.
   Brokaw again introduced Pat Robertson as a ``former television
evangelist,'' a term that last week in Iowa prompted Robertson to
suggest Brokaw was engaging in ``religious bigotry.'' Robertson let
it slide Tuesday night.
   CNN devoted most prime time to politics, but among the other
three networks, NBC was the only one to pre-empt prime-time
programming for election coverage with an hour-long special at 10
p.m. EST.
   ABC wrapped up at midnight in lieu of airing ``Nightline.'' All
the networks were set up in Manchester, N.H., and the candidates
made the rounds all night, but ABC bagged the idea of candidate
interviews due to the late hour of its special. Its brief
prime-time coverage no doubt had the biggest audience, however,
since it interrupted Olympics coverage.
   CBS wrapped up at 11:30 after devoting its regular weekly news
documentary ``48 Hours'' to the campaign trail.
   In a week when the show's format _ 48 hours of intense coverage
_ should have been eminently adaptable to a breaking news story,
``48 Hours'' fell flat, except for Lesley Stahl's poignant coverage
of high-class loser Bruce Babbitt. After his poor Iowa showing,
cameras caught two campaign workers embracing tearfully.
   ``We were the best,'' one said. ``No one will ever know it,''
added the other.
   The rest of the hour was about as exciting as watching political
placards flapping in the breeze.
   Other moments worth noting:
   Most meaningful background report: Stahl's examination of the
money issue and how it will determine who stays in the race.
   Most entertaining graphic: Those little straw hats on NBC.
   Most finely crafted simile: Rather's ``things are popping like
the popcorn in one of those microwaves.''
   Most eloquent comment: Jennings noting, ``Gary Hart, who said
let the people decide. The people decided. He came in absolutely
last.''
   Most timely promo: NBC's commercial for its 10 p.m. special, at
11 p.m.

<HEAD>Grenade Outside Israeli Embassy; 25 Killed In Bloody Regional
Balloting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grenade exploded outside a building
housing the Israeli Embassy, and the death toll in bloody regional
elections in the southern Philippines climbed to at least 25,
officials said today.
   The military reported that Communist rebels were suspected in
the ambush of a Philippine Constabulary patrol Tuesday in northern
Luzon's Mountain province. Eight troopers were killed and another
10 wounded.
   A constabulary report said one rebel was believed killed but his
body was carried away by his comrades.
   The military also reported that a rebel ammunition dump was
discovered in Luzon's Nueva Ecija province. It said troops
recovered more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, 132 pounds of
explosives and 125 blasting caps.
   Police Sgt. Danilo Donato said an M-2 grenade, rigged with a
timer, exploded about 9 p.m. Tuesday outside the Philippine Savings
Bank in suburban Makati, shattering windows but causing no injuries.
   Another grenade was found on the ground floor but failed to
explode, he said. The building houses the Israeli Embassy, but
Ambassador Meir Gavesh told The Associated Press he did not believe
the embassy was the target.
   ``We don't have any clues as to who could have possibly done
it,'' Gavesh said.
   Communist rebels this month threatened to attack Israeli targets
here because of Israel's alleged support of the Philippines
government's anti-insurgency campaign.
   Israeli diplomats deny the Jewish state is involved in the
campaign against the rebels. Philippine and Western intelligence
sources say there are thousands of Palestinians and other Arabs
living in the Philippines.
   In January, gunmen opened fire at the French ambassador as he
was leaving his office but he escaped injury. No one has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   Meanwhile, the government-run Philippine Information Agency said
at least 25 people had been killed and 50 others injured during
clashes between rival political factions in Sulu province, which
erupted three days before last Monday's regional elections.
   The military sent 4,000 troops backed by helicopters and
warships to the largely Moslem province to guard against election
violence. Sulu was the last province to hold regional elections,
which began Jan. 18.
   In other developments, an underground organization of pro-rebel
priests and nuns today accused the Roman Catholic hierarchy of
abandoning its mission to serve the poor by supporting President
Corazon Aquino's ``total war policy.''
   ``By giving blessings to the total war policy of the U.S.-Aquino
regime, the reactionary church leadership betrayed us all whom they
are supposed to serve,'' the Christians for National Liberation
group said in an advertisement in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
   ``Due to their fear of anything red, they virtually abandoned
their flock to be fed to the hungry wolves and modern day Neros,''
the group said, referring to the Roman emperor who persecuted
Christians.
   The CNL is a branch of the Communist-dominated National
Democratic Front. The statement followed recent charges by Cardinal
Jaime L. Sin, archbishop of Manila, that communists had infiltrated
the church's social welfare agency.
   On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said harsher laws are
needed to combat the 19-year-old Communist insurrection and restore
law and order in this turbulent country.
   But he said the rebellion was not at the stage where a state of
national emergency was needed.
   During his press conference, Ramos noted that 18 months ago, he
recommended that the government enact tougher laws to help the
military fight the New People's Army.
   His recommendations included lengthening the time suspected
rebels could be held without charge and restoring the death penalty
for ``heinous crimes'' such as treason and rebellion.

<HEAD>Aging Plutonium Producer To Be Mothballed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After months of debate, the U.S. Energy
Department has decided not to restart the flawed and aging N
Reactor, one of four reactors supplying the U.S. nuclear arsenal
with bomb-grade plutonium.
   The N reactor has been closed since January 1987 for about $70
million worth of safety improvements prompted by the nuclear
disaster that killed 31 people at the similarly designed Soviet
nuclear plant at Chernobyl.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington announced Tuesday the reactor
at the Hanford nuclear reservation will be placed on ``cold
standby'' status, forcing about 2,600 workers to be laid off in the
next two years.
   ``This decision signals the end of the plutonium production
mission at the Hanford site,'' said Mike Lawrence, Hanford
operations manager for the Energy Department.
   Plans for the mothballing of the reactor will be included in the
Reagan administration's proposed budget that will be sent to
Congress Thursday.
   A report prepared last year for the Energy Department projected
that a gradual phase-out of plutonium-producing operations at
Hanford by 1996 would result in the loss of more than 13,800 jobs
in the state.
   Gov. Booth Gardner and members of the state's congressional
delegation pledged to seek a way to cushion the economic shock.
   But Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., said, ``Frankly, the most likely
type of aid to come will be unemployment benefits.''
   Herrington said the decision to mothball the reactor was based
on a secret Department of Defense review of the nation's future
need for plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons.
   The Energy Department said demand for plutonium could be met by
three reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., and
through plutonium recovery from nuclear weapons retired as a result
of the recent U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   The Savannah River reactors are running at 50 percent power
because of safety concerns.
   The N Reactor, operated for the Energy Department by
Westinghouse Inc., shares several design characteristics with the
Chernobyl plant, including graphite in the reactor core to moderate
nuclear fission and lack of a containment dome.
   U.S. officials say the N Reactor, operated for the Energy
Department by Westinghouse Inc., was considerably safer than the
one at Chernobyl.
   The fate of the reactor, the last of nine plutonium producers
that have operated at Hanford since 1944, had been mired in
controversy. Proponents said the nation needed the plutonium while
opponents contended it did not, and that the reactor was unsafe.
   The ``cold standby'' status will begin next year shortly after
the safety improvements are completed and tested. The reactor could
be restarted, but that would take up to three years, Lawrence said.
   The N reactor employs 3,300 of Hanford's 14,000 workers. The
site is the biggest employer in the nearby cities of Richland,
Kennewick and Pasco, which have a combined population of about
130,000.
   ``State agencies will do everything they can to help those who
will be affected by the shutdown,'' Gardner said.
   Rep. Don Bonker said he and Sen. Brock Adams, both Democrats,
planned to introduce a ``military waste cleanup bill that we hope
will provide thousands of high-skilled jobs.''
   Over 40 years of defense wastes are temporarily stored in tanks
at the site. Under cold standby status, fuel will be removed from
the reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued, the
Energy Department said.
   Related plutonium processing plants, which employ more than
3,000 Hanford workers, will be gradually phased out in the 1990s as
the stockpiled plutonium is exhausted, Lawrence said.
   The decision to close the reactor ended a period of uncertainty
for local officials and plant workers.
   ``I'm just glad that we finally know what the decision is,''
said Richland Mayor John Poynor. ``We'll survive this and come out
stronger for it.''
   ``The reality of it hasn't hit home yet,'' said Stan Waggoner,
an N Reactor technician who learned of the decision as he came off
the afternoon shift Tuesday.
   Hanford was built in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project to

   ``Good Morning Vietnam'' greeted Disney Studios
with another victory in the weekend box-office horse race while
newcomer ``Shoot to Kill'' took second and ``Action Jackson''
debuted in third place.
   ``Good Morning Vietnam,'' starring Robin Williams as an
outrageous Armed Forces Radio disc jockey in Saigon, earned $7.9
million in the national weekend box office tally.
   ``Shoot To Kill,'' featuring Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent
chasing a maniac in the Pacific Northwest, sold $4.8 million in
tickets.
   ``Action Jackson,'' starring Carl Weathers and Vanity, grossed
$4.6 million. Weathers stars as a tough policeman who takes on a
corrupt auto tycoon.
   ``Three Men And A Baby,'' which had been following ``Good
Morning Vietnam'' for several weeks, was fourth with $4.3 million,
followed by ``Moonstruck'' with $3.7 million.
   ``The Serpent And The Rainbow'' fell from second place last week
to sixth place, but wasn't dead yet with $3.5 million in ticket
sales.
   ``She's Having A Baby,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth
McGovern, was in seventh place with $2.7 million. ``Satisfaction,''
starring Justine Bateman as a member of a garage rock band that
goes on the road, was in eighth place with $2.3 million.
   ``Ironweed,'' the Hector Babenco-directed movie starring Jack
Nicholson and Meryl Streep as characters from the third William
Kennedy ``Albany novel,'' was in ninth place after expanding to 599
screens.
   Tri-Star reported $2.2 million for ``Ironweed,'' a figure that
reflected four days' worth of ticket sales, while other companies
reported sales for three days, noted Exhibitor Relations Co.
president John Krier.
   Rounding out the top 10 was director Spike Lee's ``School
Daze,'' a musical comedy looking at life and social divisions
inside a mythical all-black university in the South. The movie
earned $1.49 million in its first week.
   Studios use the weekend box office to determine how well a movie
is doing. Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by
Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of

<HEAD>Khamenei Warns Against U.S. Influence in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's president told a visiting Soviet
official the United States and its allies may try to gain influence
in Afghanistan after the Soviet Union withdraws its troops, a news
agency reported today.
   Tehran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said President Ali Khamenei met Tuesday night with the Soviet
Union's deputy foreign minister, Vladimir Petrovsky.
   During the meeting, Petrovsky handed Khamenei a letter from
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev which touched on Afghanistan and
other issues, the report said. Petrovsky left for home today,
ending a six-day visit to Tehran.
   Khamenei, IRNA reported, told Petrovsky that Iran was pleased
with Gorbachev's policy on Afghanistan and renewed a call for the
speedy withdrawal of Soviet forces from that country, nine years
after their intervention.
   Gorbachev issued a statement Feb. 8 saying the Soviet Union
would begin withdrawing its 115,000 troops May 15 if indirect talks
between the Pakistan and Afghan governments produce an accord at
least 60 days before that.
   Gorbachev also stated for the first time that a pullout would
not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a
transitional Afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout.
   IRNA quoted Khamenei as telling Petrovsky that Iran was ``higly
pessimistic about the U.S. concern over Afghanistan and sees no
sincerity in its (U.S.) stance. Therefore, any plan for the
country's (Afghanistan's) future must prevent influence of the
United States and its Western allies.'' The United States supports
the Moslem rebels fighting the Afghan government.
   IRNA said the two officials also discussed bilateral relations.
   Soviet-Iranian relations have been improving steadily,
especially since Moscow torpedoed U.S. efforts to impose an
international arms embargo on Iran to force it into a settlement of
the 7-year-old war with Iraq.
   Moscow, however, has backed U.N. Security Council Resolution
598, which was adopted unanimously last July. The cease-fire
resolution was accepted by Iraq, but Iran insisted the Baghdad
government should be condemned as the aggressor and punished before
any settlement of the conflict is achieved.

   Share prices opened slightly firmer in London
today as traders reacted to news of a possible settlement of the
strike at Ford Motor Co.'s British plants and to a rise on Wall
Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index opened up 3.1
points at 1,737.7 and by 9:45 a.m. it was up 6.9 points at 1,741.5,
or 0.39 percent.
   Traders said 36 of the index's shares were showing gains in
quiet trading, 20 were showing losses and the rest were unchanged.
   The Ford strike had worried the market as traders feared it
heralded a round of higher private-sector pay claims in Britain. A
settlement reached by negotiators will be voted on Thursday by
striking workers.
   In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average
advanced 22.71 points, or 1.15 percent, to 2,005.97.

<HEAD>Army Ousts 7 Officers In Aftermath Of January Revolts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army ousted seven officers
accused of involvement in revolts that occurred last month at six
army camps and the Buenos Aires metropolitan airport.
   In a related development, President Raul Alfonsin on Tuesday
told a federal judge that the rebels who briefly took over Jorge
Newberry Airport in downtown Buenos Aires on Jan. 18 had plans to
assassinate him.
   Alfonsin, in a written account to Judge Juan Fegoli reported by
local news agencies, said investigators told him the mutineers that
occupied the airport control tower had plans to kill him after they
had assassinated Brig. Gen. Ernesto Crespo, air force chief of
staff.
   Crespo was en route on an airplane to the metropolitan airport
when the group of 18 air force rebels and rightist civilians took
over the airport. Crespo landed elsewhere, the plan unraveled and
the rebels surrendered without incident four hours later,
authorities say.
   Those ousted Tuesday included Lt. Cols. Luis Polo and Dario
Fernandez Maguer, who sided in Buenos Aires and Tucuman with rebel
leader Aldo Rico against troops commanded by Gen. Jose Caridi, army
chief of staff.
   Rico, who is being held in a military prison, faces rebellion
charges.
   Others ousted by the Defense Ministry and Caridi since the
three-day uprisings shook camps from Monte Caseros in the northeast
to southern Patagonia include Gen. Heriberto Auel, chief of
operations under Caridi.
   Auel on Tuesday asked for the formation of the tribunal to put
Caridi on trial because, Auel charged, the military has ``little
confidence'' in the abilities of the 56-year-old army chief of
staff.
   Only 44 of the 328 rebels taken into custody last month for
their roles in the uprisings remain in prison awaiting charges.

<HEAD>Trial Begins In Suit Seeking $22.5 Million From Military Magazine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for relatives of a murdered woman will
try to convince a federal jury that an ad in the military magazine
Soldier of Fortune led to her death and that the magazine should
pay them $22.5 million.
   Robert Black of Bryan was sent to the Texas death row for paying
$10,000 to a hitman to kill his wife, Sandra, in 1985. The alleged
triggerman, John Wayne Hearn, is serving life terms in Florida for
other killings.
   Marjorie Einmann, Mrs. Black's mother, and Gary Black, the
victim's 18-year-old son, contend in their civil suit that an ad
Hearn placed in the Denver-based publication brought him to the
attention of Robert Black.
   They are seeking $2.5 million in actual damages and $20 million
in punitive damages from the magazine, which calls itself a
publication for professional adventurers.
   ``Our case is there was another party in this crime _ Soldier of
Fortune,'' Ron Franklin, attorney for the plaintiffs, said at the
start of the trial Tuesday. He accused the magazine of giving Black
the means to accomplish the murder.
   Magazine attorney Larry Thompson defended the publication of the
ad.
   ``No one at Soldier of Fortune suspected anything criminal in
that ad or any other ad in Soldier of Fortune. We think the
evidence will clearly show Soldier of Fortune was not negligent,''
he said.
   Among questions asked prospective jurors earlier Tuesday before
a panel was selected was whether they owned a gun or had watched
``Rambo'' and John Wayne movies.
   The trial could last through next week, U.S. District Judge
David Hittner said.
   The ad in question appeared in four issues of the magazine in
late 1984, and sought former Marine and Vietnam veterans and
weapons specialists with jungle warfare expertise for ``high risk
assignments'' in the United States or overseas.
   CBS News reported Tuesday that Hearn said in a court deposition
that he had received 10 to 20 calls a day in response to the ad.
Most of the callers wanted to hire him for illegal acts, including
kidnappings, bombings and murder, the network said.
   Hearn claimed he was contacted by one group to murder Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   ``From a defense perspective, there's no doubt Hearn and Black
met as a result of the ad,'' Thompson said. ``But that is the only
thin thread with regard to Soldier of Fortune. With that ad, there
was no way for anyone to determine he was seeking criminal
conduct.''
   ``You bet we're going to win,'' publisher Robert Brown said. ``I
have no doubt about it.''
   Brown, wearing a pin-striped suit and cowboy boots, flipped
through the pages of one his magazines while Hittner took about an
hour to review motions filed by attorneys in the case.
   The suit, filed 13 months ago, originally sought about $100
million in damages. Glenn Einmann, Mrs. Black's father, recently
and without explanation removed himself as a plaintiff.
   Franklin, in arguments over pretrial motions, said Brown has
published and run ads in the magazine for books on learning how to
be a commando.
   ``Robert K. Brown says that never in his wildest dreams would he
think that the ad would result in criminal conduct,'' Franklin
said. ``Yet in the same issue of the magazine he has an ad for `How
To Be A Hitman.'''

<HEAD>Carnival Season Gives Way To Lent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The wild abandon of Mardi Gras gave way to
the sobriety of Ash Wednesday today as police cleared the French
Quarter of revelers hoping to forestall the end of the annual
street party.
   Two fatal accidents involving parade floats marred the feverish
excitement of the Carnival season, police said.
   Officially, the day concluded at midnight with the meetings of
the courts of Rex and Comus, the signal that Mardi Gras has given
way to 40 days of Lenten penance.
   ``I enjoy it to the max, but it's Ash Wednesday. Mardi Gras is
over. The normal standards of behavior now apply,'' Carl Seyler
Jr., a resident of the French Quarter, said early today.
   Nearly a million people immersed themselves this year in New
Orleans' naughty exhibition of drinking, dancing and parading, said
New Orleans police spokesman John Bryson.
   Revelers not ready to give up the Fat Tuesday ghost were shooed
into bars and clubs as uniformed officers and mounted police
announced on bullhorns that streets were being reopened and cleanup
crews were on their way.
   ``Mardi Gras 1988 is now over,'' police announced. ``Please
clear the streets and get off the sidewalks.''
   An 11-year-old boy was killed Tuesday afternoon when he was run
over by a truck float in suburban New Orleans, and an unidentified
man was killed when he leaped onto a tractor-trailer rig hauling a
float in city traffic, police said.
   The last float-related death was in 1984, Bryson said.
   ``This does not happen every year,'' he said. ``The safety
conscious individuals on the parade routes do not approach floats
that are moving.''
   Despite the accidents, which also included two incidents in
which people were injured badly enough to be hospitalized, police
described the crowds as generally well-behaved.
   Police spokesman John Marie said the Canal Street crowd was the
biggest he had seen in 18 years.
   ``I'm ready for it to be over, that's for sure. It's all good
and fun but I'm glad it's over with,'' said Carl Chosa of New
Orleans. ``I hope everybody comes back next year.''
   But Ray Mattingly of Memphis, Tenn., wasn't quite willing for
the bacchanalia to end.
   ``I think it should wind down of its own accord,'' he said. ``If
they don't close the bars, you should be allowed to be here as long
as you want to.''

   Teamsters union leader Jackie Presser should be
well enough to stand trial on labor racketeering and embezzlement
charges by July 12, his lawyer says.
   U.S. District Judge George W. White on Tuesday scheduled that
day for the start of the trial, marking the third time White has
set a trial date in the case.
   Presser, 60, is accused of creating a $700,000 scheme to pay
people who did no union work at Teamsters Local 507, where he is
secretary-treasurer. He was charged in 1986 with two counts of
labor racketeering, one of embezzlement and two of filing false
reports with the government.
   Last year, Presser underwent surgery for removal of a lung
tumor, but his doctors have since declared him free of cancer.
Chemotherapy and radiation treatments, however, have caused health
problems, and he is recuperating in Phoenix, said John R. Climaco,
Presser's lead defense lawyer.
   Climaco told the judge at an informal hearing Tuesday that
Presser ``should be able to stand trial'' by July. Presser was not
at the hearing.
   Climaco said Presser would agree to undergo a physical
examination next week at Georgetown University Medical School with
an endocrinologist the Justice Department has selected.
   Jutice Department lawyer William Lynch said the government wants
Presser examined as soon as possible. He said, ``We may even be in
here with a motion to move up the trial date.''
   After the hearing, Climaco said Presser works a maximum of two
hours on union business each day. The limit on his work load was
set by doctors, he said.
   Two co-defendants, Harold Friedman and Anthony Hughes, are also
scheduled to stand trial July 12. Friedman is a Teamsters vice
president and Local 507 president, and Hughes is the local's
recording secretary.
   Presser took over leadership of the 1.6-million member union
April 21, 1983, when a Teamsters' executive board allowed him to
complete the five-year term of Roy Williams, who was imprisoned on
a federal bribery conviction. Presser was re-elected in May 1986, a
few days after he was indicted.

<TEXT>
   Voters in a primary election set up a runoff
between former acting Gov. Martin J. Schreiber and state Sen. John
O. Norquist in the race to succeed Henry W. Maier, the nation's
longest-serving big-city mayor.
   Schreiber and Norquist topped a field of seven in Tuesday's
primary election and will meet in the April 5 runoff for the post
held by Maier for the past 28 years.
   Maier, 70, announced last year he was retiring because he felt
he was too old to seek another four-year term.
   Though Tuesday's election was non-partisan, both Schreiber and
Norquist have served in the past as Democratic officeholders.
   Each had stressed goals of economic development and job creation
in a campaign marked by few clashes, but their rhetoric showed
signs of heating up Tuesday night.
   Schreiber promised he would tell voters how Norquist's campaign
statements differed from past votes in the Wisconsin Senate on
issues affecting Milwaukee.
   Norquist, asked how he differed from his opponent, replied:
``I'd be the kind of mayor that would make a decision and stick
with it. I think the city wants a strong leader.''
   Complete, unofficial returns, with all 324 wards reporting, gave
Schreiber 44,984 votes, or just over 44 percent, and Norquist
40,575 votes, or just over 40 percent.
   Next were businessman and black community leader Lee E. Holloway
with 7,885 votes, or just under 8 percent, and community activist
Donna Horowitz Richards with 5,983 votes, or just under 6 percent.
Trailing with less than 1 percent of the vote each were: Willie G.
Lovelace, Kevin J. Robinson and Sandra Sherman.
   Schreiber, 48, joined the Wisconsin Senate in 1962. He served as
lieutenant governor from 1970 until 1977, when he took over as
acting governor after Gov. Patrick J. Lucey resigned to become U.S.
ambassador to Mexico.
   He lost to Republican Lee S. Dreyfus in the 1978 election, lost
again when he sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1982
and has worked in private business since then.
   Norquist, 38, served in the state Assembly from 1974-80 and was
elected in 1982 to the Senate, where he has served as assistant
Democratic majority leader.
   Maier was first elected mayor in 1960, scoring an upset over
U.S. Rep. Henry Reuss. He has has served as president of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors and president of the National League of Cities.
   Black activists said they will expect the next mayor to do more
than Maier has done to help minorities.
   Statistics released last fall by the Milwaukee Urban League show
Milwaukee is the most segregated major metropolitan area in the
country, and more than 40 percent of the city's black children live
in poverty.

<HEAD>The Streak Continues: Brits Win Pancake Race For Sixth Straight
Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBERAL, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the sixth straight year, a British
woman has defeated her American counterpart in the Shrove Tuesday
international pancake race.
   Marcia Strieff, who sprinted 415 yards carrying and flipping a
pancake in a frying pan, crossed the finish line Tuesday in 67.7
seconds to lead the field of 13 American women here.
   But it wasn't good enough _ Leslie Byrne covered a similar
course in Olney, England, in 62.9 seconds.
   Mrs. Strieff, 30, has won the Liberal leg of the trans-Atlantic
race all three times she entered it. The rules prevent her from
participating again.
   ``It's time for someone else to take a turn,'' Mrs. Strieff
said. ``... It would have been nice to have beat them at least
once.''
   According to legend, the race has been run in Olney since 1445,
when a forgetful housewife left for church on Shrove Tuesday with
her frying pan still in her hand. Liberal made it an international
event in 1950 by adding its own race after seeing reports of the
English competition.
   Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, is the day English
women traditionally make pancakes to use up cooking fat before Lent.
   The teams have 19 victories apiece. They tied once.
   ``I didn't think of the pancake, I just ran,'' said Mrs. Byrne,
a physical education teacher. ``I haven't done any training, though
sometimes when I take the dog out for a walk, I have a little
trot.''
   At Olney, about 700 spectators lined the twisting route as Mrs.
Byrne outpaced 19 other women in the dash from the market square to
the 14th century church in the town of 3,300 about 40 miles
northwest of London.
   A crowd estimated at 3,000, including Gov. Mike Hayden and his
wife, Patti, lined the route in Liberal, a community of about
17,000 just north of Oklahoma. Even more spectators turned out
later for the Pancake Day Parade, said Rosalee Phillips, the
secretary for the annual event.
   Mrs. Byrne received her prize of 100 pounds, or $175, in cash,
various gifts from town merchants, an inscribed silver tray from
the town of Liberal and a kiss from Clive Coverley, a ceremonial
official known as the town verger.
   At Liberal, Mrs. Strieff got the kiss of peace from S. Norman
Lee, British consul from Chicago, along with roses, a crown, a $500
savings bond and other prizes.

   The U.S. dollar eased slightly against most major
foreign currencies in early European trading today. Gold dropped
slightly in London and held steady in Zurich.
   Currency dealers said trading was thin because of holidays in
Asia and the lack of market-moving news.
   In West Germany, it was the first business day following a
holiday in most parts of the country, and the first opportunity for
many dealers to react to Friday's U.S. trade figures.
   The figures showed the trade deficit shrank in December to $12.2
billion from $13.2 billion in November.
   ``For some people, it's the first opportunity to take a position
or take profits,'' said a dealer with an American bank in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar continued its decline against the Japanese yen, closing
at 130.50 yen, down 0.99 yen from Tuesday. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 130.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7103 West German marks, down from 1.7120
   _1.4050 Swiss francs, up from 1.4038
   _5.7795 French francs, down from 5.7815
   _1.9194 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9200
   _1,258.50 Italian lire, down from 1,260.00
   _1.2690 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2687
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7449, slightly more
expensive than Tuesday's $1.7446.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price
for gold of $444 a troy ounce at mid-morning today, unchanged from
the opening bid, but down from late Tuesday's $445.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $444.50, unchanged from Tuesday.
   Hong Kong markets were closed for the Chinese New Year.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.36 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.39.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow Covers Colorado Foothills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow blanketed sections of Colorado today as light snow
was scattered over four states in the Northeast and the Midwest.
   The storm swept through southeastern and east central Colorado,
blanketing Pueblo with 4 inches in two hours Tuesday night. The
Denver and Boulder areas received 2 to 5 inches and Colorado
Springs and Rye got 4 to 6.
   A heavy snow warning was issued for the southeastern foothills
and east slopes of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, where 4 to 8
inches of snow were expected. A snow advisory was in effect for the
plains in the southeast.
   The storm was expected to spread in northern New Mexico, much of
which was under an advisory for 1 to 3 inches of snow.
   Light snow was scattered over northern Minnesota, Upper
Michigan, central and upstate New York and northern Maine. Light
rain fell along the coast of Washington state, while rain and a few
thundershowers dampened sections of the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
   Santa Ana winds up to 50 mph blew through Southern California. A
high wind warning was posted in the mountains and below canyons
from Ontario to San Bernardino, and a wind advisory was in effect
elsewhere below canyons of southwest California.
   Today's forecast called for rain, with snow in higher
elevations, from the Pacific Coast through northwest Montana;
scattered rain from southern and eastern Texas across the lower
Mississippi Valley; scattered snow showers over the southern
Rockies, southeast Colorado and northeast New Mexico and flurries
lingering over upstate New York and northern New England.
   Temperatures were expected to climb into the 40s and 50s in much
of the nation; the upper 20s and 30s in the northern and central
Rockies, and from the eastern Dakotas across the Great Lakes to
northern New England; and the 60s and 70s across California and
southern Arizona and from the southern two-thirds of Texas to the
southern Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 2 below
zero at Warroad, Minn., to 67 degrees at Brownsville, Texas, and
Santa Ana, Calif.

^In New Hampshire, a Change of GOP Minds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late-deciding Republican voters confounded the
polls and boosted George Bush to his convincing victory over Sen.
Bob Dole in the New Hampshire presidential primary, analysts say.
   Voters who made their choice in the race's final days went
strongly for Bush, in part because of his superior campaign
organization, his ties to the Reagan administration and his
experience in office, exit polls indicated Tuesday.
   The result was a 9-point victory for the vice president, after
some polls had shown him leading Dole just barely, by 4 points in a
CBS News-New York Times poll and 2 points in an ABC News-Washington
Post survey.
   ``The voters of New Hampshire have a well-deserved reputation of
upsetting poll results, and tonight was a good example of that,''
said NBC News pollster Laurily Epstein. ``People change their
minds, and you can't poll for that.''
   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal exit poll found that 14 percent
of the GOP voters in New Hampshire made up their minds on primary
day, with 36 percent going for Bush and 29 percent for Dole.
Another 11 percent decided during the weekend, breaking 44 percent
for Bush to 31 percent for Dole.
   ``It was the undecideds. The undecideds went for Bush,'' said
John Berrigan, a poll analyst for ABC News. A key reason: Bush's
identification with President Reagan, who is very popular among New
Hampshire Republicans.
   ``The Reagan coattails were there,'' said Jerry Strom, an NBC
News poll consultant. ``People who like Reagan were going strongly
for Bush.''
   NBC's exit poll supported that contention. Three-quarters of
Republicans said they wanted the nation to stay on the course set
by Reagan; 88 percent of Bush's supporters held that view, compared
with 66 percent of Dole's.
   There were fewer Reagan backers in Iowa, and more of them went
for Dole than for Bush, albeit narrowly, in the precinct caucuses
Feb. 8. Dole won big there while Bush suffered a third-place
embarrassment.
   Berrigan said New Hampshire's economic vitality could explain
Reagan's popularity in that state, and its benefit for Bush. ``You
may have a kind of status quo phenomenon going on here, a belief
that there may be a threat if I don't go with someone who's
following the same line,'' he said.
   Perhaps for similar reasons, a third of Republicans said
experience was the chief factor in their vote, and 54 percent of
them voted for Bush, to 37 percent for Dole, the CBS-Times poll
said. Dole won among Republicans looking chiefly for a strong
leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for Bush, but that group made
up just 19 percent of the GOP total.
   Another key for Bush was his extensive campaign organization in
New Hampshire. The CBS-Times poll found that 47 percent of Bush's
backers said they had been asked to vote for him by someone in his
organization, while just 26 percent of Dole's supporters reported
contact by the Dole campaign.
   ``I think the thing that won it for Bush was his organization,''
said Warren Mitofsky, polling chief at CBS News.
   While the polls did not anticipate the extent of Bush's victory,
Mitofsky said they did identify trends in the race: Bush way ahead
before the Iowa caucuses, dropping sharply after losing to Dole and
Pat Robertson in Iowa, then halting his slide and rebounding during
the weekend.
   Speaking on CBS, Bush credited his victory to a surge of support
in the last 48 hours. ``I learned from that, fight back. Fight
on,'' he said. ``It's taught me a good lesson: Do not be
discouraged by the polling numbers.''
   The exit poll results were less remarkable on the Democratic
side, where Michael Dukakis won handily, as expected. ABC had him
winning all ideological groups and beating his opponents soundly in
organization.
   The poll results also indicated Dukakis' backyard advantage. ABC
said 55 percent of Democrats rated Dukakis above average as
governor of neighboring Massachusetts, and 59 percent of them voted
for him. Moreover, the CBS-Times poll found that 20 percent of New
Hampshire's Democratic voters moved there from Massachusetts, and
four in 10 of them went for Dukakis.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt's second-place finish appeared to be aided
by his first-place showing in Iowa. Of the voters who made up their
minds after Iowa, 27 percent went to Gephardt, 26 percent to
Dukakis and 20 percent to Sen. Paul Simon, who finished second in
Iowa and third in New Hampshire.

   A sailor who struck, spared and guttered
his way through 14 days of bowling hopes to regain the world
marathon record and raise some money for a good cause, his
spokeswoman said.
   Chief Petty Officer Richard C. King's scores for only the first
13 days, which ended at noon Sunday, will be submitted to the
``Guinness Book of World Records,'' Pat Lewis said Tuesday.
   King suffered from blistered, bloodied and swollen hands and
feet but was pronounced in good condition at a hospital Monday and
then went to a hotel that donated a suite for his use in
recuperating, Ms. Lewis said.
   ``He's feeling real well,'' she said.
   The 39-year-old Pensacola Naval Air Station sailor's 312 hours
of knocking pins down would easily top the existing record of 217
hours, 55 minutes, she said.
   King was allowed five minutes off for each hour bowled but went
the first four days without a break to accumulate time later used
to get about two hours of sleep a night.
   The current record-holder bowled 2,028 games for an average of
9.3 games per hour, compared with King's 2,863 games and 9.2 hourly
average, Ms. Lewis said.
   Petty Officer Donnie Moore of the Jacksonville Naval Air
Station, set the present record, breaking a mark of 168 hours, 25
minutes that King set in 1984. King is using the marathon attempt
to raise money for Pensacola's Ninety and Nine Boy's Ranch for
abused children and Children's America, a missing-child registry
and assistance group based in Largo.
   Ms. Lewis said more than $6,000 had been collected, and she is
hoping the figure will increase to $10,000 by the time all the
checks are mailed. She said pledges will be accepted for the next
couple of days.

   A document purporting to announce a new
state holiday honoring an Indian chief was a forgery, and state
employees should plan to show up for work Friday, a spokesman for
Gov. Booth Gardner said.
   There will be no state holiday to honor Indian Chief Leschi, the
governor's press secretary, Dick Milne, said Tuesday.
   ``It's a fairly elaborate scam someone is pulling here,'' Milne
said of the bogus proclamation, which bore a slightly off-center
state seal. The governor's signature is ``an obvious forgery,'' he
said.
   And it's ``definitely not true'' that state employees, local
government workers and school children have the day off, he
stressed.
   The forged memo praises the Nisqually chief, ``the wise and
generous Leschi who was treated most unjustly. To honor this
distinguished orator and arbiter is an essential cornerstone of our
state's history.''
   The memo says Friday is a state holiday and that when Feb. 19 is
on a weekend day, it will be celebrated on a Friday or Monday.
   ``We haven't even been asked (about designating the holiday) or
even to issue a proclamation'' in commemoration of the day,'' Milne
said.
   Besides, Milne said, only the Legislature has the authority to
proclaim a state holiday.
   The governor's office has no idea who forged the document, Milne
said, adding that the culprit had a good knowledge of Indian
history.

   When Susan Lamb drove up to her house and
saw her father sitting at the curb in his police squad car, she
knew she was in trouble.
   ``I knew he was kind of mad,'' Susan said. ``He just said, `Did
you forget something?' I said, `Yeah, my seat belt.' ''
   Susan's father, Richard Lamb, is police chief in the tri-cities
of Raymond, Elk Run Heights and Evansdale.
   Susan was given an option: a $21.50 ticket or not driving her
car for two weeks. The choice was simple.
   ``I wanted to go out with my friends, my boyfriend. I just
decided to pay it,'' she said in a recent interview. ``My own dad.
But I don't know, it's his job and I can't expect him to give me
favoritism.''
   ``My daughter thinks I am fair,'' Lamb said. ``Of course ... all
her friends are kidding her about it.''

<HEAD>Student Protesters Deadlock On Agreement, Continue Occupation</HEAD>

   Minority students occupying a University
of Massachusetts building remained today after they failed to agree
on an understanding reached by their negotiators and college
officials.
   ``I'm not disappointed. I'm tired. We've been going at this a
long time,'' Dwayne Warren, a spokesman for the group, said at a 4
a.m. news conference announcing the deadlock.
   Two women wept in the halls of the New Africa House after about
100 protesters debated for five hours on the administration's
response to their eight demands.
   The demands included suspending five white students accused of
beating two blacks Feb. 7 and suspending campus police officers
accused of forming a lineup of blacks the same night in their
search for men who allegedly harassed women on campus.
   ``The students want immediate action, but the way the structure
is set up, you can't get that,'' said a student negotiator, David
Moore.
   Moore said the protesters planned to continue the debate at noon
today in the building they have closed to whites since Friday.
   All but one of the nine student negotiators were pleased with
the understanding reached with university Chancellor Joseph Duffey
after four hours of talks Tuesday.
   ``Not all the demands have been met, but all have been responded
to in good faith,'' Duffey said as he forwarded a written statement
to the students at 10:30 p.m Tuesday. ``There are things I cannot
do now, but we've agreed to plan to address general concerns.''
   But the mood quickly changed when the demands and Duffey's
response went before the 100 students occupying the building late
Tuesday.
   ``The vote is going very slowly and is being met with mixed
emotions,'' Roscoe Robinson, another spokesman for the protesters,
reported as the debate wore on.
   Warren had said the students were prepared to take over another
building if they failed to reach an agreement with university
officials.
   After the deadlock, however, he ruled it out. ``At this point
it's too radical an approach,'' he said.
   He declined to give details about the debate except to say that
students felt Duffey's response to their demands was vague.
   Administrators did not release the document sent to the
students, but Warren said it contained a promise of efforts to
improve minority students' conditions and increase financing of
minority programs.
   More than 500 white UMass students rallied Tuesday to support
the occupation.
   ``Hey, ho, Chancellor Joe, racism has got to go,'' white
supporters chanted as Duffey made his way to the building.
   Students and faculty members also read letters of support at the
rally, including a message from Democratic presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson.
   ``The students occupying the New Africa House have taken a
principled position on legitimate concerns,'' Jackson said in his
statement. ``The quality of leadership in the state and country can
be determined by how it handles such crises as this one.''
   The university moved classes that usually meet in New Africa
House, and officials have said they do not intend to force the
students out of the building.
   About 9 percent of the 25,000 students at the state's largest
public university are minorities, including 641 blacks.
   Last year, the university disciplined six white students who
pleaded no contest to charges stemming from a campus racial clash
in which a black student was beaten after the final 1986 World
Series game between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Mets.

   A convicted member of the Red Brigades
terrorist organization was freed from prison after the government
overturned a court decision to extradite him to Italy.
   Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas told reporters that
Maurizio Folini, 34, had been convicted ``on charges that were
mainly of a political character.''
   Koutsogiorgas added that a request by Folini for political
asylum in Greece would be considered ``as a separate matter.'' The
minister spoke to reporters after the government issued its
decision Tuesday.
   Folini, convicted in absentia by an Italian court in 1986 on
terrorism charges, was arrested in Athens on June 22, 1987, after
entering Greece on a false passport 12 days earlier.
   Italian authorities immediately requested his extradition.
   Last September, the Greek Supreme Court upheld a lower court
ruling that Folini should be extradited, but he remained in prison
pending Justice Ministry confirmation of the decision.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government had come under
fire from radical left-wingers seeking Folini's release.
   One group started a hunger strike two weeks ago outside Athens
University in the city center to press for his release.

   The Soviet Union has started dismantling some of
its missiles in East Germany although a superpower treaty scrapping
intermediate-range nuclear missiles has not been ratified, a news
agency reported.
   ADN, East Germany's state-run news agency, said missiles
stationed in Waren, 20 miles west of Neubrandenburg, have been
taken apart, put in crates and are ready for transport back to the
Soviet Union.
   ``With this step we can make an important contribution toward
disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and
the Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN said Tuesday night.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland today
printed a front-page report on the preparations for early removal
of the missiles. Neubrandenburg is north of Berlin.
   ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR (East
Germany). Troops in Waren dismantle ... rockets earlier than
expected,'' Neues Deutschland (New Germany) said in a headline to
its story.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the treaty in Washington last December, agreeing to eliminate all
land-based, medium- and shorter-range missiles.
   The agreement stipulates that the Soviets' shorter-range
missiles in East Germany and in Czechoslovakia are to be removed
within 18 months and medium-range U.S. and Soviet missiles within
three years.
   The Senate has not ratified the treaty. The Supreme Soviet, the
Soviet Union's parliament, is expected to approve the accord.
   In Washington, the State Department had no immediate reaction to
the report.
   A U.S. official, however, said the Soviets were free to take
down their missiles before the treaty takes effect. The official,
who demanded anonymity, said U.S. inspectors will go to East
Germany and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets
were complying with the treaty, if it is ratified.
   Although there was no comment in Moscow on the reported
dismantling, Gorbachev on Tuesday criticized Western European
countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the
superpower treaty.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Gorbachev as criticizing
Western European governments for ``the latest wave of praise for
the `nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of projects for
the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German
military rapprochement, and so forth.''
   West German government officials declined comment on the report
Tuesday night. ``It is too early for us to comment at this time,''
a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press.
   ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when
they would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Soviet
soldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12
rockets.''
   The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the
intermediate-range missile treaty, which bans weapons with a range
of 300 miles to 3,000 miles.
   East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading
missile crates onto transport vehicles.
   ADN quoted a Soviet military officer as saying the ``troops are
very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' The
rockets are to be sent back to the Soviet Union by train, ADN said.
   It said East German journalists who toured the missile base were
allowed to interview Soviet soldiers.
   Erich Honecker, the East German leader, indicated in January
that Soviet intermediate-range rockets stationed in East Germany
could be removed ahead of schedule, but he gave no specific
timetable.
   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22
rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice
missiles were stationed at the Neubrandenburg site, which holds the
largest numbers of SS-12s in East Germany. There are three other
SS-12 rocket sites in East Germany.
   In all, there are 54 SS-12s in East Germany, according to those
figures.
   The Soviet Union also has 53 SS-23 shorter-range nuclear rockets
in East Germany.

   Lindsay, 67, underwent a 4{-hour operation Jan. 27 to repair a

   Lindsay was a Republican congressman before being elected mayor

   Wechsler said the former mayor would spend the next few weeks at

   American labor leaders are breaking a
four-decade tradition of unqualified support for Israel, condemning
its use of ''unneccessary force'' against Palestinians on the West
Bank and in Gaza.
   The 14.3-million-member labor federation's executive council
approved the first-ever rebuke of Israel Tuesday after meeting with
Secretary of State George Shultz, who is scheduled to begin a tour
of the Middle East next week.
   The AFL-CIO's winter meeting was Shultz' last stop of an
extended weekend in southern Florida to gain support from
traditional friends of Israel for his effort to soften Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's opposition to entering new peace
negotiations.
   Shultz is seeking to promote a resumption of negotiations on
Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   Shultz addressed a meeting of the B'Nai B'rith Anti-Defamation
League in Palm Beach last Friday, seeking help from U.S. Jewish
leaders in pressing Shamir to show more flexibility.
   ``There's been so much emphasis on the process ... direct
negotiations on the one hand, an international conference or some
kind of international vehicle on the other ... that the discussion
has become a little sterile,'' he told reporters Tuesday. ``If we
are going to get going, we need to talk a little bit more about the
substance of what might happen.''
   Shamir has opposed a resumption of negotiations if they are
based on a premise that Israel will have to give up state control
of some of the occupied territories as a condition for peace.
   Shultz said the United States is ``not trying to stake out a
position of one kind or another'' on that issue. However, he said
getting ``to the substance in terms of things ... that would be
talked about when people address ultimate resolutions of the
Arab-Israeli conflict'' is needed to get the negotiations going
again.
   The AFL-CIO, while blaming Islamic fundamentalists for ``fueling
the flames of violence in the occupied territories,'' said the
Palestinian demonstrations did not warrant the ``unnecessary
force'' used by Israeli defense forces on occasion.
   ``No doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience
of the Israeli army in riot control and other police functions, and
to the frustrations of Israeli soldiers as they confront young
Palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs,'' the federation
said. ``These factors may explain, but they cannot excuse, and the
AFL-CIO cannot condone, the use of excessive force against
civilians.''
   The federation, however, rejected what it called a ``notion that
Israel must now redeem itself by turning the West Bank and Gaza
Strip over to the Palestine Liberation Organization.''

   Refusing to give his name, the man threw up his hands to
indicate he could no longer talk to reporters about the six-hour
ordeal.
   About 90 minutes earlier, Richard Farley, 39, of San Jose
surrendered to police after the shooting rampage at the company
that fired him two years ago for harassing female coworkers, police
said.
   Shocked employees consoled each other before they slowly left
for home.
   Several broke into sobs while others cried hysterically after
the ordeal, said Daryl Anderson, a business analyst who hid beneath
her desk during Farley's six-hour standoff with police.
   Anderson said several employees watched in horror as co-workers
were slain.
   Dr. Luther Cobb at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center said one
man who was shot four times told him he had looked out the door of
his office to find out what the commotion was about and found
several wounded people.
   He dragged one wounded man into his office and shut the door,
but the gunman shot through the door, killing the man he was trying
to save and wounding him, Cobb said.
   Anderson was in her second-floor office when she said she heard
the gunshots. ``I was under my desk in the fetal position for six
hours, '' she said.
   Heather Scott, the 13-year-old daughter of ESL computer analyst
Gregory Scott, said she visited her wounded father in the hospital,
where he was reported in stable condition today after being shot in
the face and hand.
   ``He looked pretty good. He said he didn't want to talk about it
and I didn't really want to hear about it,'' she said.
   David Vossbrink, community relations officer for the city of
Sunnyvale, said Farley recently had lost another job and was deeply
in debt.
   ``This guy's life was falling apart,'' said Vossbrink.

   Two landscapers, charged with stealing a
35-foot magnolia tree, admitted that uprooting the tree and hauling
it away was a bad idea, police said.
   ``They said ... that they were really sorry they did it,'' said
Fulton County Police Officer Mark Smith. ``They said they were
going to put the tree back, but they were afraid they would be
caught.''
   Rick Howard Brown and Herbert David Bowles, both 27, might avoid
legal trouble if they're willing to pay for the tree and fill in
the hole where it stood.
   Frann Faulkner Layton, owner of the vacant house where the tree
stood, said Tuesday she would consider dropping charges if they
make amends.
   The tree was plucked Jan. 30 by two men using a hydraulic shovel
and truck, police said. Smith said the tree was replanted at a home
several miles away.
   He said Brown and Bowles were charged Monday with theft and
ordered to appear in court next week.

<HEAD>Columnist Predicts Failure of Shultz's Mideast Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz's
forthcoming Middle East tour will fail to advance Arab-Israeli
peace efforts because of Washington's ``flirtation'' with Israel, a
leading columnist said today.
   Moussa Sabry also blamed ``American influence and Zionist
(Israeli) terrorism'' for wrecking a plan by the Palestine
Liberation Organization to send a ship on a protest voyage from
Nicosia to Israel this week.
   Shultz is to make the regional tour late this month to discuss a
reported U.S. peace plan.
   The blueprint, according to reports from Washington and
Jerusalem, calls for an international forum to launch Arab-Israeli
talks in April on interim Palestinian self-rule in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Negotiations on a final
settlement for the two territories would open in December.
   The plan was reported to have been outlined in a recent area
tour by Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy.
   ``I am not convinced that the U.S. administration under Ronald
Reagan will move effectively as a partner in the peace process,''
Sabry wrote. ``It's all very well to make tours of capitals in the
area. It's all very well for Murphy or Shultz to come to the
region. But these trips will bring no results.''
   Sabry, one of a group of Egyptian journalists known to be close
to President Hosni Mubarak, was writing in his periodic column on
the front page of the state-owned newspaper Al-Akhbar. He often is
critical of Israel, but his comments about the United States were
harsher than usual.
   Citing next November's U.S. presidential election, he wrote:
``This is the year when Democratic and Republican candidates vie
for the Jewish vote. This is when the flirtation with Israel heats
up. I even venture the belief that the object of the U.S.
administration's flirtation is (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak)
Shamir, the leader of extremism.''
   Sabry appeared to imply that Washington prefers Shamir to his
moderate coalition cabinet partner, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,
whose Labor Party favors territorial concessions to the Arabs.
   On the PLO ship, Sabry said, ``American influence and Zionist
terrorism that tried to destroy the vessel'' were the reason why
the planned protest voyage to Israel has been stalled.
   The PLO charged that Israeli agents planted a mine that blew a
hole and crippled the Cypriot ferry Sol Phryne on Monday as it was
being readied to carry Palestinian deportees, international
observers and reporters to Israel.
   Israel vowed to prevent the ship from entering its waters.

   Israeli soldiers opened fire
on Palestinian demonstrators in a West Bank village today, killing
one with a shot through the heart and wounding four others, Arab
reports and hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed that soldiers fatally shot one Arab and
wounded four in clashes in the village of Shuyukh, northeast of the
city of Hebron.
   Two officers opened fire after more than 100 Shuyukh residents
attacked an army patrol with stones and bottles, said an officer in
Shuyukh. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Also today, the Norwegian ambassador apologized to Israeli
officials for saying the conduct of Israeli troops in the occupied
territories was worse than that of German troops who occupied
Norway during World War II.
   Ambassador Torleiv Anda apologized after he was summoned to the
Foreign Ministry and met with the ministry's political
director-general, Yossi Beilin.
   Doctors at Alia Hospital in Hebron said a 25-year-old Shuyukh
resident was killed by a shot that pierced the heart. The Palestine
Press Service identified him as Ismail Mohammed Hussein.
   Alia doctors also said they treated four Shuyukh residents for
gunshot wounds in the legs and arms and four women for beating
injuries.
   One of the wounded, Khaled Abu Rumei, told The Associated Press
from his hospital bed that soldiers had entered the village at
about 5 a.m. to round up suspected agitators.
   ``They started breaking into houses and taking people away,''
said Rumei's mother, who would not give her first name. She said
soldiers clubbed her when she tried to stop them from detaining one
of her sons.
   The army declared the village a closed military area, and
soldiers turned back reporters who went to the scene in early
afternoon.
   The army, meanwhile, clamped a curfew on the nearby village of
Sair, the site of frequent anti-Israeli protests, the army official
said. He said soldiers detained several residents, but did not have
further details.
   During the meeting with the Norwegian ambssador, Beilin
expressed his ``sharp protest'' to Anda, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Ehud Gol.
   ``The ambassador expressed regret that his words were understood
in a way which has caused embarrassment,'' Gol said.
   Anda told Israel radio after the meeting that ``there was a
misunderstanding that I wanted to compare these two regimes, and
I'm very happy to have the opportunity to clarify.''
   Anda told reporters Tuesday that many Norwegians were comparing
the conduct of the Israeli army to the behavior of Nazi troops who
occupied Norway for five years during World War II.
   ``What the Germans did, including beating and torturing
prisoners and suspects, was very bad,'' the Jerusalem Post
newspaper quoted Anda as saying. ``But we do not remember them
going out into the streets to break people's arms and legs or
pulling children out of their homes at night.''
   The army today said seven Palestinians were wounded late Tuesday
in clashes at the Fawwar refugee camp south of Hebron. Aliya
Hospital officials said that, in addition to gunshot victims, they
treated 12 Arabs who were injured by rubber bullets or beatings.
   Also Tuesday, soldiers shot and wounded two Palestinians in the
West Bank village of Kabatiyeh and a third in the nearby city of
Jenin, hospital officials said. The army confirmed one protester
was wounded in Kabatiyeh.
   In another development, Transport Minister Chaim Corfu hinted
Israel was involved in bombing the ferry that was to carry 130
deported Palestinians back to Israel. The Palestine Liberation
Organization, which sponsored the voyage, has accused Israel of
responsibility for the bombing Monday at the port of Limassol,
Cyprus.
   Corfu warned that if the PLO bought another ship for the trip,
``its fate will be the same.''
   Speaking on Israel radio Tuesday, Corfu said: ``We knew we
wouldn't allow the boat to reach Israel. If we could prevent its
departure, that was obviously the right thing to do.''
   In Parliament Tuesday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was
questioned about his policy of beating Palestinians to stop riots.
He said the beating orders were necessary and ``to the best of my
knowledge and judgment, are legal.''
   Rabin said soldiers have exceeded orders ``in many cases'' and
confirmed troops used a bulldozer earlier this month to bury alive
four Arabs near Nablus. The Arabs were saved by other Palestinians.
   Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, deputy chief of staff, said a
sergeant-major and a non-commissioned officer were detained in
connection with the incident.
   Barak said soldiers had no choice but to use beatings to try to
curb nearly 2{ months of riots in the occupied lands.
   He said more than 200 Israelis had been injured, most of them
lightly, and that 53 Arabs had been killed since disturbances began
Dec. 8. The United Nations puts the death toll at 54.

   Sen. Paul Simon said today that unless
he wins in either Minnesota or South Dakota next Tuesday, he will
drop out of the race for president.
   ``I'm having a press conference ... where I'm going to say I
have to win in either Minnesota or South Dakota, receive additional
funding from small donors ... or I'm going to have to withdraw from
the race,'' Simon said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Simon said his third-place finish in New Hampshire was
``strong,'' but added that he ``can't indefinitely come in second
and third.''
   ``We have a good base in Minnesota and South Dakota. ...I think
we have a real shot at one or both of those states,'' he said.
Minnesota holds caucuses next Tuesday while South Dakotans go to
the polls in a primary election.
   Simon said earlier that while finishing behind New Hampshire
Democratic winner Michael Dukakis and second-place Richard Gephardt
wasn't what he had hoped for, he will not change the focus of his
campaign.
   ``No, absolutely not,'' the Illinois Democrat said as he edged
out of his election night headquarters amid a swarm of reporters
and cameras. ``The message has to be the same. That's what I
believe.''
   Speaking earlier to supporters gathered at a restaurant, he
vowed to be the advocate for ``a nation that once more cares for
working men and women, that fights for the less fortunate, that
stands up for middle-class Americans who want to send their
children to college, that reaches out to build a world that is
safer for our children and generations to come.''
   Simon's national campaign spokesman attempted to put the best
face on the third-place showing, maintaining that the candidate
``turned conventional wisdom topsy-turvy'' even before the New
Hampshire vote.
   Spokesman Terry Michael said Simon was able to blunt Gephardt's
momentum coming out of Iowa, and that New Hampshire was a lock for
Dukakis.
   Simon has acknowledged that finances are a problem for his
campaign, and he had hoped for a second-place showing in New
Hampshire to aid in fundraising.
   Michael said the Simon campaign had debts of about $500,000,
with about $200,000 on hand, but expected to raise another $300,000
to $400,000 this week.
   Simon, after congratulating his backers for their efforts, urged
them not to give up.
   ``You have not been campaigning just for some fellow wearing a
bow tie,'' he said. ``You have been campaigning for a cause.''
   Simon was accompanied on a makeshift stage by his wife, Jeanne,
and other supporters when it partially collapsed as he began his
remarks.
   Recovering quickly, Simon joked, ``Believe it or not, the
platform I stand on is a bit `solider'.''

   Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt,
looking South after their one-two finish in New Hampshire's
Democratic primary, said today that campaign themes should not
change with the region. Paul Simon said he would withdraw from the
race unless he wins one of two contests next week.
   ``People in the South aren't voting for a zip code. They're
voting for the president of the United States,'' Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Gephardt, appearing on the same program, characterized his
second place finish in New Hampshire as a victory. ``The reason we
won,'' he said, ``is because we got off the plane last week and
began saying the same thing in New Hampshire that we said in Iowa.''
   Dukakis said the race still was ``wide open.'' Gephardt said it
had now come down to him and Dukakis.
   Meanwhile, Simon, who came in third, said, ``I have to win
either in South Dakota or Minnesota. Otherwise I'm going to have to
withdraw.''
   Dukakis, the three-term governor of next-door Massachusetts, won
Tuesday's primary with a strong 17-percentage point margin over the
Missouri congressman. He was leaving today for the next major
battleground, the South.
   Even as he did, however, Dukakis acknowledged that his victory
didn't decide the race but drew the battle lines more clearly. ``I
think it's going to go all the way to the last primary,'' he said.
   Gephardt, whose victory in Iowa's caucuses eight days earlier
was largely overshadowed by the brawl on the Republican side,
accomplished his chief aim _ finishing ahead of fellow Midwesterner
Simon.
   ``I love New Hampshire,'' Gephardt said.
   ``It's a result that we needed here,'' Gephardt said. ``It
appears to be that we've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race in the rest of
the country, but that could change.''
   Dukakis won 37 percent of the vote and said the victory gives
him momentum heading into the delegate-rich primaries on March 8,
when contests are set in every state of the South but one.
   The Massachusetts governor won nearly as many votes as his next
two closest challengers combined, and he was leaving immediately
for the next round of campaigning in Atlanta and Florida.
   ``Last week in Iowa our message started to shine through, and we
won a bronze,'' he said, a reference to his third-place finish in
that state's caucuses. ``Tonight here in New Hampshire, our message
came through loud and clear. We went for the gold and we won it.''
   Gephardt had 20 percent and Simon, the Illinois senator, had 17
percent.
   Jesse Jackson's 8 percent put him in fourth place, ahead of
Tennessean Albert Gore Jr.'s 7 percent. Bruce Babbitt finished with
just 5 percent and headed for Washington to meet with advisers and
wrestle with the question of whether to withdraw.
   Finishing last with 4 percent was Gary Hart, the prohibitive
front-runner a year ago who saw his presidential hopes wrecked with
embarrassing disclosures about his personal life.
   When he re-entered the race in mid-December, Hart said, ``let
the people decide,'' and in New Hampshire their decision wasn't the
one he wanted. He said it would take 30 to 60 days ``to determine
if I can put together a viable candidacy,'' and suggested he may
scale back the scope of his effort.
   ``It's a disappointing showing but we're not discouraged,'' Hart
said.
   Gephardt was leaving New Hampshire before dawn for stops in
South Dakota and Wyoming, both of which have contests in the next
three weeks.
   Gephardt was betting on gaining a boost in South Dakota and
planned to be in that small state six out of the next seven days _
even though its primary next Tuesday is a beauty contest where
voters express a preference but don't award nominating delegates.
   He came into New Hampshire saddled with debt, as was Simon. Both
face the prospect of a three-week campaign where the costs of
buying television airtime across the South are enormous, and where
they may be forced to select states to contest while bypassing
others.
   ``We're not badly in debt,'' Gephardt said. ``We're in good
shape. Money is coming in.''
   Gore's fifth-place finish wasn't good enough to give him any
boost going into the South, as he had hoped. Gore spent a lot of
money in New Hampshire but not a lot of time, and he departed the
state for much of the final week while his competitors dominated
the airwaves.
   Simon was heading to Minnesota, which like South Dakota has its
contest next Tuesday and where he must do well to stay in the race.
   Simon had predicted he would beat Gephardt and challenge Dukakis
in New Hampshire, but he insisted ``we're moving on.''
   Jackson and Gore, both of whom have an enormous stake in the
Super Tuesday primaries across the South, were campaigning there
today. Jackson was heading to Florida and Gore watched the returns
from Texas.
   All the candidates were converging on Texas, where the first of
a series of Southern debates is set for Thursday night in Dallas.
The Republicans debate there on Friday.
   Although the first primary of the 1988 campaign was likely to
winnow the field, none of the losers displayed a willingness to
leave the race right away. The most likely candidate appeared to be
Babbitt, and Jackson said he talked with Babbitt about gaining an
endorsement if the former Arizona governor quits the race.
   ``No way,'' Babbitt insisted when asked if he would withdraw.
But he said he planned meetings with supporters to ask, ``Should I
wage a guerrilla campaign or should I withdraw and do something
else?''
   Although far more was at stake in New Hampshire, 18 nominating
delegates were awarded by the primary results. Dukakis collected 9,
Gephardt 6 and Simon 3.
   The rest got none.

   Police escorted Licio Gelli into a
northern Italian prison today after he was extradited from
Switzerland to face charges in the collapse of Italy's largest
private bank, Italian media reported.
   Gelli, 69, was taken to a prison on the outskirts of Parma,
where high-security precautions include television monitoring of
his cell and testing of his food for possible poisoning, according
to state-run RAI radio.
   Gelli faces fraud charges related to the 1982 collapse of Banco
Ambrosiano, the country's biggest private bank, which has close
ties to the Vatican.
   The Swiss supreme court rejected Italian extradition requests
for alleged political crimes, including charges that Gelli was
involved in the Aug. 2, 1980, bombing of thee Bologna train station
that killed 85 people and wounded 200.
   Under the terms of the extradition, Gell, also will be exempt
from an eight-year jail sentence imposed by an Italian court that
found him guilty of financing arms and explosives purchases by
right-wing terrorists.
   Gelli surrendered to Swiss officials on Sept. 21, 1987, after
being a fugitive for more than four years.
   He escaped from Champ-Dollon prison on Aug. 10, 1983, after
serving only three days of a two-month sentence for entering
Switzerland on false papers. He also was awaiting extradition to
Italy at the time.
   Swiss police originally arrested Gelli in September 1982 when he
tried to withdraw funds from a frozen Geneva bank account linked to
a South American branch of Banco Ambrosiano.

   The Metro Council has killed a bill to
ban sex in city-owned or operated buildings, rejecting a
councilman's argument that the measure was needed to stop
harassment of female workers.
   ``There are already laws that take care of this matter,'' said
Councilman Tom Sharp, who moved to table the bill Tuesday night.
   The council killed the bill by voice vote on first reading,
before it could be considered by a council committee.
   George Darden, the measure's sponsor, said he was disappointed.
   ``I thought the council would give me the courtesy to pass my
bill onto second reading and I could refer it to the attorney
general for a ruling to see if it did have merit to it.''
   ``I've got many people in my area who complain of harassment on
the job,'' he said. ``They say they can't be promoted without being
available to the boss man.''
   Darden said he would look for some other way to address the
problem.

   A policeman trying to rescue a woman who fell

himself and disappeared, authorities said.
   The Mississippi River Bridge Authority policeman, whose name was
not released, was assigned to the ferry Tuesday because of Mardi
Gras crowds, said MRBA Cpl. George Eberhardt.
   Eberhardt said the officer and a deckhand went to the woman's
rescue about 7:30 p.m.
   ``They were trying to pull her up when they fell in,'' he said.
   Others on board grabbed the deckhand and the woman and pulled
them aboard, Eberhardt said.
   A Coast Guard helicopter and boat searched for the officer but
found no sign of him, said Coast Guard spokesman Glenn Lamont. The
officer was not wearing a life jacket, he said.

   East German newspapers today printed pictures of
dismantled missiles and hailed Soviet preparations for removing
SS-12 nuclear missiles before a superpower treaty scrapping
intermediate-range weapons is ratified.
   ``In the name of reason. A historic moment awaits,'' said a
banner headline in the Junge Welt (Young World), the Communist
Party's youth newspaper.
   ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR (East
Germany). Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlier
than expected,'' Neues Deutschland (New Germany) said in a headline.
   Waren is 20 miles west of Neubrandenburg and about 90 miles
north of Berlin.
   ``Removal of missile troops ... starts earlier than expected.
Transfer to the Soviet Union and destruction of their type SS-12
armaments in the U.S.S.R.,'' the East Berlin daily Berliner Zeitung
said.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN said Tuesday night that
missiles in Waren had been taken apart, put in crates and were
ready for transport back to the Soviet Union.
   ``With this step we can make an important contribution toward
disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and
the Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN said.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the treaty in Washington last December, agreeing to eliminate all
land-based, medium- and shorter-range missiles.
   The agreement stipulates that the Soviets' shorter-range
missiles in East Germany and in Czechoslovakia are to be removed
within 18 months and medium-range U.S. and Soviet missiles within
three years.
   The Senate has not ratified the treaty. The Supreme Soviet, the
Soviet Union's parliament, is expected to approve the accord.
   In Washington, the State Department had no immediate reaction to
the report.
   A U.S. official, however, said the Soviets were free to take
down their missiles before the treaty takes effect. The official,
who demanded anonymity, said U.S. inspectors will go to East
Germany and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets
were complying with the treaty, if it is ratified.
   Although there was no comment in Moscow on the reported
dismantling, Gorbachev on Tuesday criticized Western European
countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the
superpower treaty.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Gorbachev as criticizing
Western European governments for ``the latest wave of praise for
the `nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of projects for
the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German
military rapprochement, and so forth.''
   West German government officials declined comment on the report
Tuesday night. ``It is too early for us to comment at this time,''
a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told

   ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when
they would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Soviet
soldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12
rockets.''
   The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the
intermediate-range missile treaty, which bans weapons with a range
of 300 miles to 3,000 miles.
   East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading
missile crates onto transport vehicles.
   ADN quoted a Soviet military officer as saying the ``troops are
very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' The
rockets are to be sent back to the Soviet Union by train, ADN said.
   It said East German journalists who toured the missile base were
allowed to interview Soviet soldiers.
   Erich Honecker, the East German leader, indicated in January
that Soviet intermediate-range rockets stationed in East Germany
could be removed ahead of schedule, but he gave no specific
timetable.
   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22
rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice
missiles were stationed at the Neubrandenburg site, which holds the
largest numbers of SS-12s in East Germany. There are three other
SS-12 rocket sites in East Germany.
   In all, there are 54 SS-12s in East Germany, according to those
figures.
   The Soviet Union also has 53 SS-23 shorter-range nuclear rockets
in East Germany.

<HEAD>Measure Restricting Promotion of Homosexuality Clears Final Hurdle</HEAD>

   Legislation prohibiting local governments from
promoting homosexuality is virtually certain to become law after
the House of Lords defeated an amendment that would have limited
the measure to state-owned schools.
   The Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament, voted
90-48 on Tuesday night to defeat the amendment.
   The restriction on promoting homosexuality is included in a
legislative package proposed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative administration.
   The vote represented the legislation's last parliamentary hurdle
and the package has been penciled in for entry onto the statute
books on June 1. The package only needs to complete a formal final
reading in Parliament for it to become law.
   The bill stipulate that local authorities _ which run public
libraries, some theaters and most state schools _ must not
``intentionally promote homosexuality.'' Authorities that defy the
ban can be sued by individuals or penalized by auditors for
misusing funds, according to the legislation.
   The amendment defeated by the House of Lords sought to limit the
ban on promoting homosexuality to one area only _ state-owned
schools.
   A Labor Party member, Lord Willis, also tried to include wording
saying the proposed law is not a license to discriminate against
homosexuals, but his effort failed when the time allotted for
debate ran out.
   Arguing for the measure, Home Office Minister Lord Caithness
said ``gay pride'' programs and the promotion of gay rights in
youth clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize
homosexuality.
   ``Young people are susceptible to these intolerable influences .
.. Activities such as a Lesbian Gay Strength and Pride Week are, in
the government's view, at least as likely to glamorize
homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as
anything a teacher might do,'' he said.
   Lord Longford of the socialist opposition Labor Party told the
House of Lords the measure smacked of a ``general queer-bashing
campaign.''
   Mrs. Thatcher complained last fall that children were being
taught ``they have an inalienable right to be gay.'' Her government
has accused some left-wing local authorities of using state funds
to promote homosexuality.
   Leftist local governments, including those running inner city
London and the northern cities of Manchester and Sheffield, have
been criticized by conservative newspapers in Britain for giving
grants to gay and lesbian community groups.
   The government also has acted to curb spending by local
authorities and plans shortly to introduce controls on what is
taught in state-owned schools, whose day-to-day running is in the
hands of local government.
   Critics said the homosexuality measure, known as Clause 28, was
a setback for gay rights in Britain and a swing toward
authoritanian rule by Mrs. Thatcher and her government. Walls in
London and other cities were covered with slogans attacking Clause
28 as repressive legislation.
   Some critics of the measure also said the word ``promote'' is so
vague it could allow local authorities to censor works by E.M.
Forster and other famous homosexual writers in public libraries and
theaters.
   The government has denied prejudice and dismissed that criticism.
   Homosexual acts in private between consenting civilian males who
are at least 21 years old were legalized by the Sexual Offenses Act
in 1967, although the age limit is widely ignored by Britain's gay
community.
   Homosexuality between males in the armed forces is outlawed.
   For centuries until 1836, the death penalty was used to deter
sodomy in Britain. Until 1967, it was punishable by imprisonment.
   Oscar Wilde, the homosexual Irish-born playwright, was sentenced
to two years imprisonment with hard labor in 1895, and, until the
passing of the 1967 act, male homosexuals lived in constant fear of
blackmail. The 1967 act referred only to males, as British law has
never banned lesbianism.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
rejoicing that ``we went for the gold and won it'' in New
Hampshire's presidential primary, sought today to parlay that
glitter into solid Southern support.
   ``People in the South aren't voting for a ZIP code; they're
voting for the president. ... The next president of the United
States has got to be somebody who can bring this country
together,'' he said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   While polls show him in the middle of the pack in the South,
where most states hold primaries or caucuses on March 8, Dukakis
hopes what worked in next-door New Hampshire will play in Dixie as
well.
   Dukakis was flying today to Atlanta and Tampa for rallies.
   ``I had to prove to them that I was a viable candidate for the
presidency,'' Dukakis said. ``The South is very much a part of this
country. The goals, dreams, the values of the South are very much
the same as the northeast.''
   Dukakis scored a convincing win over Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, who in turn edged Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who has
financial worries. Dukakis said ``I would think it's going to be
difficult'' for Simon to continue in the race.
   But the Massachusetts governor faces strong Southern competition
from two Democrats who finished behind the front-runners in New
Hampshire _ Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore. Gephardt
is also expected to do well in the South.
   Dukakis was looking ahead to the Southern battle even as he made
his victory speech in New Hampshire.
   ``Some people have been asking how a New Englander can hope to
do well on Super Tuesday,'' Dukakis said. ``They want to know what
my `Southern strategy' is. The fact of the matter is, I don't have
a southern strategy. I don't have a northern strategy or a western
strategy. I have an American strategy.
   ``I believe in the kind of politics where you say the same
thing, wherever you go in our country. A campaign that unites
America and doesn't divide it. The people of Texas and Florida
aren't asking where candidates are from. They're asking where
they'll take us.''
   Overall, the speech focused on principles and general ideas, for
the most part, and stayed clear of specifics and political details.
   ``Thank you, the people of New Hampshire, for starting us off on
the road to the White House,'' Dukakis told a gathering of about
1,000 supporters in Manchester.
   Dukakis consultant Michael Goldman said the governor plans to
spend nearly $4 million in the South. Gore, for his part, has
launched a $1 million media campaign.
   Dukakis was confident enough about Tuesday's outcome to talk
about his plans for Super Tuesday before the polls closed. The
March 8 presidential extravaganza involves primaries and caucuses
in 20 states, including 14 southern and border states.
   ``We're going to contest every one of those states,'' Dukakis
said. ``I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.''

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee said today that
while he was concentrating on the South his presidential rivals
picked up harmful ``political baggage'' by taking narrow positions
while campaigning in other parts of the nation.
   ``They all came out for mandatory controls on agricultural
products ... that would be a disaster in the South,'' Gore said on
``CBS This Morning.''
   Overall, Gore says, he has no regrets about skipping the Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary because there was no point in
spending ``$1 million on two or three delegates.''
   ``We're saving that for the 1,400 delegates here in the Super
Tuesday states,'' Gore said Tuesday night after meeting with a
group of about 20 Houston businessmen including former Texas Gov.
Mark White.
   Gore maintained his focus on Southern states involved in next
month's Super Tuesday primaries while most presidential candidates
were in New Hampshire awaiting results of that state's leadoff
primary.
   ``We made a decision not to spend $1 million on two or three
delegates,'' Gore said.
   Gore campaigned little in New Hampshire and finished fifth in
the Democratic race there with about 7 percent of the votes. He
said that was better than he expected but the big test is yet to
come.
   ``Super Tuesday changes all the rules,'' Gore said. ``I think
what we've seen were some rather inconclusive results in Iowa, and
the fact that the Iowa momentum did not have much of an impact on
New Hampshire indicates that Super Tuesday is a completely new ball
game.''
   He said the candidates involved in Iowa and New Hampshire are
bringing to Texas and other Super Tuesday states a set of positions
on issues that are not in touch with mainstream voters.
   Gore's campaign already has started television commercials in
major markets in Texas as well as national advertisements on Cable
Network News and cable-distributed WTBS in Chicago.

   Augsburg College officials have changed their
minds about naming part of a new building after a major donor
because they learned he had mailed thousands of hostile letters to
interracial families.
   The college will, however, keep the $500,000 Elroy Stock donated
last year, as well as other contributions made over 20 years.
   ``The positions and actions of Mr. Elroy Stock, as reported in
the media, have disturbed, angered and saddened hundreds of
individuals and families, including members of the Augsburg
community,'' college President Charles Anderson said Tuesday after
a regents committee meeting.
   ``For some persons, to have the name of Mr. Stock on a wing of
our new building would be misunderstood to mean the college agrees
with his stance,'' Anderson said.
   Anderson, who is white and has a black daughter-in-law, said he
received three anonymous letters himself from Stock.
   Stock, a 65-year-old retired executive of West Publishing Co.
who lives in Woodbury, gave the Lutheren college $500,000 for a new
worship, drama and communication building. It was the largest
single gift last year to the college, which has 2,100 students.
   ``Mr. Stock's way of acquiring the funds is through honest
work,'' Anderson said. ``Whatever Mr. Stock has done, he has had an
opportunity to use his means to do some good for a lot of people. I
see no reason why he should be denied that opportunity.''
   Stock, a 1949 Augsburg graduate, told WCCO-TV on Tuesday that he
was disappointed by the decision not to name the building wing
after him.
   ``It's all over,'' he said. ``I don't want to even think about
it. If they want to take it off, I'm not going to care.''
   WCCO-TV reported last week that Stock had been sending unsigned
letters to interracial couples for 14 years. The station said the
letters included such comments as, ``A dog breeder would not think
of producing mongrel dogs, so why should the human race be
mongrel?''
   Anderson said he was convinced after meeting with Stock over the
weekend that Stock is sorry he hurt people with the mailings.
   After a five-year investigation, postal officials linked the
letters to Stock in early 1987, said Sterling McKusick, a retired
U.S. Postal Service inspector. McKusick had received about 1,000
complaints, the earliest dating to about 1982.
   But Stock could not be prosecuted because he had not broken any
laws. Complaints ceased shortly after Stock was confronted by
authorities in March 1987, McKusick said.
   Anderson said no one at the college was aware of the situation
until school officials were contacted by WCCO.

   Bob Dole, beaten back by George Bush in the
New Hampshire Republican primary, today renewed his allegations
that the vice president had distorted his record and promised to
counterattack, while Jack Kemp said he could unite the GOP's
conservative wing.
   From top to bottom, the 1988 Republican presidential race was as
hot and furious after the New Hampshire primary as it had been
before. No one talked of withdrawal and all looked south for new
battles.
   For his part, Bush denied that his campaign had distorted Dole's
record.
   ``I'm sorry he feels that way,'' the vice president said in an
interview aired today on CBS.
   Interviewed on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Dole said the
Bush camp first tried ``character assassination'' in Iowa.
   ``That didn't work,'' he said, ``so they start on distorting
your record. ... Unless they want to get back on the straight and
narrow and withdraw some of their attacks, we're going to have to
counterattack.''
   Kemp said that although he finished third overall in New
Hampshire's GOP contest, he was first among the conservatives. And
he said he could ``bridge the gap'' between the conservative wing
and Pat Robertson's ``evangelical Christian'' wing.
   Kemp was crowing because he finished ahead of former Delaware
Gov. Pete du Pont and Robertson, a former television evangelist. A
week ago, he finished a weak fourth in Iowa, while Robertson was
second.
   In the first-in-the-nation balloting, here were the numbers at
the end of the counting: Bush, 39 percent and Dole, 29 percent.
   Kemp had 13 percent; du Pont, 10 percent; and Robertson, 10
percent.
   Alexander Haig, who dropped out of the race Friday, got less
than 1 percent.
   Bush, Dole and Kemp were slated to be in Washington today, while
du Pont headed for Wilmington, Del.
   Robertson was campaigning in South Carolina and Florida, two
Southern states where he hopes to win a few primaries early next
month.
   ``Tomorrow morning we go into the South and they're going to be
playing in my backyard,'' Robertson said. ``I'm throwing the
gauntlet down to Bob Dole and George Bush: South Carolina is the
first Super Tuesday state and I'm going to beat you there
convincingly.''
   South Carolina holds a Republican primary on March 5, three days
before the Super Tuesday mega-primary on March 8.
   Du Pont, who won the endorsement of the Union Leader of
Manchester but did not turn that into a victory, vowed to press on.
   ``I'm going south...without question,'' he said. ``We did much
better in New Hampshire than we did in Iowa. We'll do much better
in the south than we did in New Hampshire...The point is, we've all
finished together, probably within a half point of each other.''
   Bush expressed heartfelt thanks to New Hampshire Republicans,
whom he told a week ago ``I'm one of you.''
   ``Thank you, New Hampshire,'' Bush said. ``On to the South,
where we're going to rise again.''
   The battling to get into place for Super Tuesday _ when 16
states will hold Republican events _ began even before the tally
was finished in the Granite State.
   Dole was being interviewed by NBC's Tom Brokaw, when the
anchorman turned and asked if Dole had anything to say to Bush.
   ``Yeah, quit lying about my record,'' Dole said testily.
   Dole said Bush's ads that claimed Dole wants to raise taxes just
aren't true.
   ``I don't mind being attacked on my record when we have a
difference, but to just right out, flat out, distort the record,
then I think we need to call attention to that,'' Dole said. ``It's
unfortunate that the vice president of the United States, who knows
better, would sink to that level.''
   Asked later about the Dole remark, Bush said, ``I don't know
what he's talking about.''
   ``If it hadn't been for the distortion of my positions on tax
increases and an oil import fee, I'd be 10 points ahead,'' Dole
added.
   Dole had been riding a wave out of his Iowa win a week ago
Monday, rising to as much as an eight-point lead over Bush in some
overnight polls.
   But Bush and his campaign did an about-face in the middle of the
week _ dropping the formal campaign style, launching the attacks on
Dole's record and talking a lot about himself and his own feelings.
   Bush was also helped by President Reagan's popularity in New
Hampshire. In Iowa, where the administration is blamed for economic
woes, his White House tie was a liability.
   And at the end of the week, Bush brought in conservative hero
Barry Goldwater to polish his conservative credentials. And he
stood on the stage with baseball hero Ted Williams, adding a
celebrity sheen in a state that watched Williams perform miracles
for the Boston Red Sox.

   Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas
and pro-Israeli militiamen fought for six hours in south Lebanon
today, leaving at least 17 fighters dead and four wounded.
   A police spokesman said the two sides used rockets, mortars, and
automatic rifles in the clash south of the Christian town of
Jezzine, 10 miles east of the port city of Sidon.
   He said seven fighters of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia were killed and four wounded when Shiite Moslem guerillas
of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, ambushed their
patrol at 6 a.m. outside Jezzine.
   The South Lebanon Army ``sent reinforcements to the area and
fought a six-hour battle killing 10 attackers,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to
regulations.
   He said that after the killing of its fighters, Hezbollah
pounded the battle scene, two miles southeast of Jezzine, with
mortar fire. It later recovered the bodies of six of its men.
   The South Lebanon Army is based in a six-mile deep
Israeli-occupied border strip in south Lebanon and carries out
frequent patrols into Jezzine, a Christian town outside the zone.
   Israel established the so-called security zone along the border
after the withdrawal of the bulk of its occupation army from south
Lebanon in 1985, three years after it invaded the country.
   Hezbollah comprises Shiite zealots, who are backed by Iran's
Islamic revolution.

   A man who first said strong winds blew his
bride off a cruise ship now claims Israeli secret agents killed his
wife in retribution for a book he wrote about human rights abuses.
   Scott Robin Roston, 36, who is being held for investigation of
murdering his wife, 26-year-old Karen Waltz Roston, made the
allegation Tuesday in a statement released by his lawyer after an
appearance in federal court.
   Meanwhile, the San Diego County coroner's office said Mrs.
Roston died from ``strangulation associated with drowning, which
was determined to be a homicide.''
   Doctors performing the autopsy found contusions on Mrs. Roston's
neck as well as other signs she had been in a struggle, according
to an FBI affidavit filed in U.S. District Court.
   Roston initially had said his wife had been blown overboard by
wind while jogging Saturday aboard the Star Dancer as it returned
to Los Angeles from their honeymoon cruise.
   The ship's captain, Thomas Wildung, said winds were light.
   In his new statement, Roston claimed the agents drugged him,
leaving him with no memory of that night.
   He said Israeli agents had tried unsuccessfully to kidnap him in
the past and that U.S. agents also had pursued him because he held
documents showing U.S. government involvement in what he called
Israel's ``gross violation of human rights.''
   ``He feels that this murder is the result of a book he published
last year in New York City in which he exposed the numerous human
rights abuses which he perceived in Israel,'' said Roston's
attorney, Paul Potter.
   Potter said he would seek a psychiatric examination of his
client and added that Roston may have received a psychiatric
discharge from the Navy.
   Calls to the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles were referred to
an official who was out of town and unavailable for comment.
   At a detention hearing Tuesday, Roston was ordered by U.S.
Magistrate John R. Kronenberg to remain in custody at Terminal
Island federal prison without bail, said Mary McMenimen,
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. His next court date was
scheduled for March 8.
   Mrs. Roston's body was found Saturday floating in the Pacific
Ocean 44 miles southwest of San Diego. It was taken to San Diego
while the Star Dancer, owned by Admiral Cruises of Miami continued
on to Los Angeles.
   Roston, who had moved to Santa Monica in June from Lantana,
Fla., was questioned by FBI agents upon arrival in Los Angeles and
later arrested.
   Books in Print lists Scott Robin Roston as the author of
``Nightmare in Israel,'' published in 1987 by Vantage Press, a
vanity publishing house in which authors pay for the publication of
their works.
   The Rostons were married Feb. 4 in Las Vegas, Nev., and shortly
afterward embarked on the Mexican cruise they won in a contest,
Roston's father said.
   Meanwhile, the head of the California Chiropractors Association
said Roston, who has been identified as a chiropractor by his
mother and roommate, is not licensed to practice either in
California or Florida.

<HEAD>FAA Proposes Rule To Expand Use Of Aircraft Altitude-Reporting
Transponders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration wants all
aircraft operating near 254 of the nation's airports to have
devices that automatically inform air traffic controllers of a
plane's altitude.
   The devices, called Mode C transponders, are already required on
commercial aircraft. The regulation, proposed Tuesday, would affect
private planes operating within 40 miles of the designated airports.
   The regulation would also require all aircraft operating at
6,000 feet or move above the surface in controlled airspace to
carry the transponders.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said increased use of the
devices would ease the burden on controllers and reduce the
potential for collisions and close encounters between planes.
   ``By taking advantage of the existing aviation technology, this
rule, if adopted, will provide a significant enhancement to the
safety of our nation's flying public,'' McArtor said.
   The proposed rule would implement legislation passed by Congress
to require expanded use of the transponders.
   The FAA now requires the transponders for aircraft operating at
12,500 feet or more above sea level and in so-called terminal
control areas around the nation's 23-busiest airports. Last June,
the agency proposed a rule requiring Mode C transponders for
aircraft operating within 30 miles of such airports.
   The FAA said increased use of the transponders allows the
display of altitude information on an air traffic controller's
radar screen, can warn controllers of possible conflicts, provide
low-altitude warnings, and activate a collision-avoidance system in
aircraft that have such a system.
   The proposed rule will be open to public comment through March
28.

   Republican Jack Kemp, armed with a
third-place New Hampshire finish ahead of Pat Robertson, predicted
today that he would continue to do well against his fellow
conservative in the Southern primaries.
   Robertson is ``certainly a conservative but a rather negative
conservative,'' Kemp said. ``I don't think Pat Robertson can
ultimately be the candidate of the conservative South.''
   Kemp, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
celebrated his finish ahead of former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont
and Robertson as a victory in a ``race for the conservatives'' in
the Republican Party.
   He said that race was separate from the ``race for the
traditional, moderate wing of the party'' between Vice President
George Bush and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   ``I'd like George and Bob to withdraw,'' he added wryly.
   Final unofficial results from Tuesday's first-in-the-nation
primary gave Kemp 13 percent of the vote, placing him behind Bush,
who had 38 percent, and Dole at 29 percent. Du Pont and Robertson
each received 10 percent, with du Pont slightly ahead.
   The New York congressman called the results a victory,
particularly after Robertson's surprise second-place finish in the
Iowa caucuses.
   ``There's two contests in this party,'' Kemp, his family at his
side, told about 400 supporters at a hotel ballroom bedecked with
red, white and blue balloons.
   ``There's the contest for the establishment wing of the
Republican Party, and there is a contest for the conservative wing.
We won the contest for the conservative wing....
   ``And the thing that's happening now _ and you can feel it right
here in New Hampshire _ finally we've dragged Bush and Dole out of
discussing their resumes and their tax returns and where they're
born and into discussing issues.''
   ``With you and the type of folks that you represent around this
country, ladies and gentlemen, the growth, hope and opportunity
wing of the Republican Party is going to prevail over the orthodox,
status-quo wing of our party,'' Kemp said.
   Kemp campaign adviser Roger Stone said the third-place finish
would help Kemp substantially in the South.
   ``As the agenda moves South, it's the most conservative part of
the country, and we think his message will be well accepted
there,'' Stone said.
   ``A former pro football player who's a strong anti-communist and
is strong on defense issues is better for the South than a
Connecticut Yankee son of a Wall Street banker,'' he said,
referring to Bush.
   Stone said the campaign has about $100,000 on hand and a list of
100,000 donors nationwide. He predicted that Tuesday's results will
increase Kemp's ability to raise funds.

   Jesse Jackson said today that his fourth
place finish in New Hampshire's Democratic primary ``proved we
could broaden our base'' and that he expects to win as the
presidential campaign moves South.
   ``Our message of end economic violence and stop drugs from
coming into our country hit at the heart of the families of working
people,'' he said in an interview on CBS ``This Morning.''
   He said that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, ``We proved that we
could broaden our base, appeal to voters across the country.''
   Jackson finished ahead of rivals Albert Gore, Bruce Babbitt and
Gary Hart in Tuesday night's New Hampshire primary and last week's
Iowa caucuses. He already has met with Babbitt to ask for his
support.
   ``In many ways, he has been a part of the heart and soul of this
campaign,'' Jackson said of Babbitt. ``We have an awful lot in
common.''
   Jackson had campaign appearances scheduled today in Tallahassee,
Fla., and Mobile, Ala.
   ``I'm a son of the South. I know its ways,'' Jackson, a South
Carolina native, said after the returns were counted Tuesday night.
   ``I've worked harder and longer to make the new South new than
anyone in this campaign,'' Jackson said, citing his work for voting
rights and open housing.
   Jackson was particularly jubilant about his New Hampshire
showing. He said his campaign spent only $45,000 in the state, far
less than opponents Michael Dukakis, Paul Simon and Richard
Gephardt, yet it gathered enough support to give him momemtum going
into Super Tuesday.
   ``We defied the odds. ...They outspent us 10-to-one, and yet we
keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger,'' Jackson said.
   Gore, who also eschewed a strong New Hampshire effort in favor
of southern campaigning, will not pose a problem for Jackson, the
civil rights leader said.
   ``I'm not worried about anybody,'' he said.
   Jackson also jabbed at primary winner Dukakis. ``We cannot just
take the uncollected taxes of the Reagan revolution,'' he said,
referring to Dukakis' plan to cut federal budget deficits by
collecting $110 billion in overdue income taxes.
   Supporters, who munched on cold fried chicken and clustered
around televisions to check on network projections, said fourth
place was more than satisfactory.
   ``It's real acceptable. Fourth is about what we'd like to do
here, so we're happy,'' said state Rep. Robert Cushing, Jackson's
state campaign co-chairman.

<TEXT>
   Fountains of pink and green sparks shot up from
alleys and bangs and crackles filled the air as China today
welcomed the Year of the Dragon with the traditional fireworks
greeting.
   The government decreed a cutback this year in firecracker sales
in Beijing due to the high toll in injuries and property damage.
But when midnight struck, residents brought out their firepower in
force.
   The Lunar New Year, renamed Spring Festival after the 1949
Communist takeover, traditionally is China's most important
holiday. It has been welcomed with more than usual fanfare because
this is the Year of the Dragon, the most auspicious of the 12
animals in Chinese astrology.
   The symbol of China is considered lucky for business, marriage
and the ``dragon babies'' born before it ends.
   Vietnam ushered in the Lunar New Year with an official
remembrance of its historic Tet Offensive 20 years ago.
   The official Voice of Vietnam radio recounted myths of the
dragon. But much of the broadcast, punctuated by the sounds of
battle, was devoted to recalling the offensive that began Jan. 30,
1968.
   Communist forces then attacked more than 100 cities and towns
throughout South Vietnam, suffering enormous casualties as U.S. and
South Vietnamese forces drove them back.
   The offensive convinced some Americans the war was unwinnable
and fueled the U.S. anti-war movement instrumental in achieving an
American withdrawal in late 1973. The communists went on to win in
1975.
   ``The attacks sent shock waves across the world and shook the
White House,'' said the broadcast monitored in Bangkok. ``The U.S.
ruling circles were forced to think of a withdrawal and to sit down
at the negotiating table in Paris.''
   In South Korea, millions of people crowded trains and buses to
join their families for the New Year's celebration, which begins on
Thursday in Korea. As many as 7 million people were expected to
travel cross-country to spend the holiday feasting, playing
traditional games and enjoying other festivities.
   Nearly everyone in Hong Kong _ wealthy businessmen, factory
workers, maids, restaurant waiters _ left their jobs to welcome the
Lunar New Year with feasts, gambling and visits to relatives with
gifts of candy and ``Lai See'' (Lucky Money) for children.
   Top Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping welcomed the New Year at a
party in Shanghai, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It was
the 83-year-old Deng's first reported public appearance since Jan.
20.
   Xinhua said Deng received an ovation from the more than 700
people attending the party at the Shanghai Exhibition Center, and
that he waved back, ``all smiles.''
   Markets in China were crammed with festival foods, railroad
stations were full of holiday travelers and signs emblazoned with
dragons heralded the start of the year 4686.
   Thousands of people from Taiwan, where Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists fled after the communist victory of 1949, were
expected to visit the mainland. Last year, Taiwan's government
lifted a ban on visits to allow family reunions.
   Government statistics indicate about 400,000 of Hong Kong's 5.7
million people had left by Tuesday for holidays abroad, and many
more were expected to go.
   The pro-Beijing China Travel Service estimated 1.8 million
people from Hong Kong would spend the holiday in China, primarily
in the neighboring province of Guangdong, where many have their
ancestral roots.
   A company official said about 6,000 people from Taiwan were
expected to visit the mainland.
   During the New Year festivities, normally thrifty Chinese throw
financial caution to the winds and blow several months' pay on good
cheer, gifts and games of chance.
   About $2.7 million worth of fireworks were sold in Beijing last
year and some families spent as much as $54, the equivalent of two
months' pay.
   This year, the government reduced the supply by 30 percent.
Fireworks were blamed last year for 3,040 fires that killed 17
people and caused nearly $1 million in damage.

<HEAD>Defense Issues Likely On Agenda When Chancellor Visits Washington</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Kohl's departure and

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key defense issues such as short-range
nuclear missiles and chemical weapons are likely to be on the
agenda when Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets with President Reagan in
Washington this week.
   Kohl left for Washington today for the three-day visit that will
include talks with President Reagan, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and leading members of Congress.
   The opposition Social Democratic party called on the chancellor
to press for a reduction in short-range nuclear missiles in central
Europe during the Washington talks.
   ``The chancellor should work toward a concept for the withdrawal
of short-range missiles,'' the party's arms control expert, Karsten
Voigt, was quoted by the Neuen Osnabruecker newspaper as saying.
   In recent days, West German government officials have pointed
out differences of opinion on these topics and urged the NATO
alliance to develop an overall arms control strategy before
pursuing new talks with the Soviet Union.
   ``Before we sit at the table with the Soviets on new
(disarmament) proposals, we need to have agreement within the
(NATO) alliance on overall strategy,'' a top-ranking West German
official told reporters Tuesday.
   Officials said Kohl is likely to press for a worldwide ban on
chemical weapons.
   U.S. officials have said it would be difficult to verify such a
ban, but West German experts contend that verification problems can
be worked out.
   ``We think the (East-West) chemical weapons talks have reached a
point where it is possible to reach an agreement this year,'' said
the West German official, who spoke on condition that he not be
further identified.
   The official said West Germans are aware that U.S. arms control
negotiators are emphasizing working out reductions in strategic
nuclear weapons and don't feel that the Geneva-based chemical
weapons talks are on the brink of agreement.
   ``But it is important for us to represent our European interests
within the (NATO) alliance,'' he added.
   Short-range nuclear missiles, or those with a range of less than
300 miles, are expected to be a main point of Kohl's talks in
Washington. U.S. officials in recent weeks have emphasized the
importance of implementing a 1983 NATO decision to upgrade the
short-range nuclear weapons in central Europe.
   U.S. and other NATO officials have said the short-range missiles
are now more important to the alliance because of last December's
superpower arms treaty which, if ratified, will scrap all
land-based, medium-range missiles.
   But the West German government says NATO must first develop
overall arms control strategies and insists on reductions in Soviet
superiority in conventional arms before upgrading the alliance's
short-range missiles.
   ``The Federal Republic (of Germany) sees no need for an isolated
decision on modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclear
weapon systems at this point,'' Friedhelm Ost, chief government
spokesman, said Monday.
   ``Such decisions should be taken only after new overall
(disarmament) concepts are worked out,'' he added.

   A woman who police say gave birth to
premature twin boys in her apartment and then smoked cocaine while
they died in her bathroom has been charged with two counts of
murder.
   The charges were filed Tuesday against Deborah Stewart, 36.
   Stewart's ``behavior during the pregnancy and after the births
caused the deaths,'' by Aaron Payne, senior deputy Alameda County
district attorney.
   Sgt. C.D. Williams said the woman told him ``when you're smoking
cocaine, your reasoning goes out the window.''
   She said she gave birth to the first baby Thursday morning and
left him squalling on the bathroom floor while she returned to her
bedroom to continue using cocaine, officers said.
   She gave birth to the second infant in the afternoon, leaving it
wrapped in a towel in the bathroom.
   It was not until Thursday night, when she thought she was going
to pass out from blood loss, that Stewart called an ambulance, she
told authorities. She did not mention the births until she was en
route to the hospital, police said.
   Police found the infants' bodies after being notified by a
paramedic who had taken Stewart to Merritt Hospital.

   NASA says it will choose in April between two
crew escape systems for the space shuttle, in time to install the
system in the shuttle Discovery for the restart of the manned
flight program.
   Discovery now is scheduled to lift off from the Kennedy Space
Center on Aug. 4. It already is outfitted with an escape hatch that
can be jettisoned with explosives, a change from previous flights,
in which opening the hatch was a laborious, time-consuming effort.
   One of the emergency systems would have crew members, one at a
time, hook on to small tractor rockets stored in the cabin. The
astronauts would be pulled clear of the spacecraft and would
parachute to the ocean.
   The second system, first tested in wind tunnels and now by
military volunteers in C-141 aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base in
California, involves a telescoping pole that would extend down and
to the rear of the shuttle. Astronauts would attach themselves to
rings on the pole, slide clear of the shuttle and then parachute.
   ``The two systems, the pole and the rocket, both provide the
capability for us to get away from the wing should we have to jump
out the side,'' Rick Hauck, commander of the five-man crew on the
first mission, told a Senate hearing Tuesday.
   ``If both those tests turn out to be adequate to do the job, I
think it would be common sense that we would prefer to have the
system that is the simplest, that involves the least amount of
potential hazard.''
   The escape system would be useful only on a controlled, level
flight, not while the shuttle's booster rockets are firing, as was
the case in the Challenger accident in 1986.

<TEXT>
   An Afghan guerrilla leader today
urged Pakistan not to sign an agreement to end the civil war in
Afghanistan unless an opposition government is established there
first.
   ``It will be a historic blunder if Pakistan signs the Geneva
peace agreements in their present forms,'' Gulbaddin Hekmatyar,
chief of the Islamic Party guerrillas, told a news conference.
   Meanwhile, a Soviet foreign ministry official accused Pakistan
of trying to delay the pullout by demanding an agreement on the
makeup of a new interim Afghan government.
   A final round of the U.N.-sponsored talks between Islamabad and
Kabul is to open in Geneva on March 2. Negotiators are expected to
try to reach peace agreements to end the eight-year war, which has
pitted the Moslem guerrillas against an estimated 115,000 Soviet
troops and a small Afghan army.
   Pakistan, the United States, China and other countries support
the guerrillas and are represented by Islamabad at the Geneva
talks. Soviet views are represented by officials from Kabul.
   Hekmatyar, who heads the largest group in the seven-party
guerrilla alliance headquartered in Pakistan, said Islamabad should
retain its present demand for a government dominated by the
guerrillas and shared by other Afghans to be installed in Kabul
before a peace accord is signed.
   In a statement Feb. 8, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev offered
to start withdrawing his troops on May 15, provided the peace
agreements are signed by March 15.
   He said that a pullout would not be contingent on a separate
agreement on the makeup of a transitional Afghan government.
   Hekmatyar said the proposal implied that the Moscow-backed
government of President Najib would remain in power and the
insurgents would play no role.
   ``Gorbachev's proposal will cunningly leave the Najib government
in power when the Soviets withdraw, and Afghan refugees will be
allowed to return home. But it will not lead to peace,'' said
Hekmatyar, considered among the most hardline of the guerrilla
leaders.
   Hekmatyar renewed the guerrillas' call for Moscow to begin
direct talks with the guerillas. The Soviets and the insurgents, he
said, are the only parties involved in the Afghan fighting.
   Such negotiations could lead to the formation of an interim
government which will organize elections to establish a permanent
elected government and a parliament, he said.
   Hekmatyar said the seven guerrilla parties would draw up a list
of people acceptable for the proposed government. The names would
include guerrillas, Afghan refugees and Afghan Moslems and exclude
communists, he said.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
that Pakistan has been trying to delay the pullout by urging the
Soviet Union to find a formula for a future Afghan government.
   ``A domestic Afghan settlement is a cause for the Afghans
themselves. And it depends only on them which ways to choose for
the purpose,'' Gerasimov said.
   Outside parties can assist the process, but not at the expense
of the withdrawal talks, Gerasimov said in remarks reported by the
Tass news agency.
   He said ``the Pakistani side's attempts to keep away from
concluding the Geneva process are tantamount to an intention to
frustrate the entire Afghan settlement.''
   The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said in a statement Feb. 16 that
only by linking its withdrawal to an agreement on an interim
government could the Soviet Union assure an end to the fighting.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei told the Soviet deputy foreign
minister Vladimir Petrovsky that any pullout accord must prevent
the United States and its allies from wielding influence in
Afghanistan, according to a report broadcast Tuesday by Tehran's
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Soviet government with another, and remained to fight the
insurgents. Many of the guerrilla groups fight from bases across
the border in neighboring Pakistan.

<HEAD>Swapp Says He's Sorry Officer Killed, But Says He Warned The

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of the polygamist family that
held off police for 13 days says he's sorry a corrections officer
was killed in the shootout that ended the siege, but that
authorities had been warned not to go onto the property.
   And Addam Swapp, 26, who was wounded in the gunfight, said he
learned in a divine revelation that his life was spared because of
his willingness to risk all for God.
   Swapp is being held in the Salt Lake County Jail pending trial
on attempted murder and bombing charges. The bombing charges stem
from an explosion at a Mormon chapel a half-mile from the
polygamists' farm at Marion, 50 miles east of Salt Lake City. The
explosion led authorities to stake out the compound and to the
13-day standoff.
   Another family member is suspected in the fatal shooting of Lt.
Fred House, a dog handler with the state Corrections Department.
   The bombing allegedly was in revenge for the death of polygamist
patriarch John Singer, who was killed in a confrontation with
authorities nine years ago. Swapp is married to two of Singer's
daughters, and was a leader of the family along with Singer's
widow, Vickie. They blame the Mormon Church, of which their group
is an offshoot, and police in Singer's death.
   Swapp, in a telephone call to The Salt Lake Tribune from jail,
brought up Singer's death, saying, ``Two people died in all of
this, just remember that,'' and Singer's ``blood still lies on the
ground there, too.'' His comments were published in today's Tribune.
   Swapp noted that he had warned of possible violence in a letter
to the governor. His note said in part, ``TAKE A WARNING _ any man
of yours which attempts to cross the Boundaries of this place,
without our Permission, will be treated as an aggressive act on
your part and we will Defend ourselves in any matter we see fit.''
   ``And that's what happened,'' Swapp said.
   Asked if he felt bad about the death, he said, ``Very. Yes I do.
... Of course, I do.''
   Swapp said he was surprised to find himself in jail but believes
God wants him there for a new mission.
   ``The siege is over,'' he said. ``That price has been paid. Now
the Lord has a different mission and a different way, and he wants
to continue ... bringing forth this kingdom of God.''
   ``I do think the Lord is going to use the courts, and a lot of
stuff is going to come out,'' he said.

   The motion picture industry's most coveted
award, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuettes
have been produced so far.
   Weighing 8{ pounds and standing 13{ inches tall, Oscar was
created by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios art director Cedric Gibbons,
who went on to win 11 of the trophies.
   Oscar, manufactured by the R.S. Owens Co., Chicago, is made of
Britannia metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. From
1942 to 1944, the trophy was made of plaster, but winners were
later presented with the real thing.
   According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,
the only engraving mistake was in 1938 when the best actor trophy
given to Spencer Tracy for ``Boy's Town'' read: ``Best Actor: Dick
Tracy.''
   The Academy holds all the rights on the statue and ``reserves
the right to buy back an Oscar before someone takes it to a pawn
shop,'' said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.
   The most-nominated film was ``All About Eve'' in 1950. It got 14
nominations. ``Ben-Hur'' in 1959 was the most-awarded film with 11,
and Walt Disney was the most-awarded person with 32.

   Jesse Jackson said today he hopes to get
support from Bruce Babbitt if Babbitt drops out of the Democratic
presidential race as expected, while Paul Simon set the stage for
his withdrawal if he doesn't ``win somewhere'' next week.
   Jackson, who finished fourth, said he and Babbitt discussed the
former Arizona governor's political future as voters were casting
the ballots that left Babbitt in sixth place Tuesday night.
   ``He wanted to discuss what his options were, which he is still
wrestling with with his wife Hattie,'' Jackson said on ``CBS This
Morning.'' ``He's not made a final judgment.''
   Jackson quickly added, ``I hope I get his support.''
   Simon, who finished third in the Democratic race behind Michael
Dukakis and Richard Gephardt, said the balloting next week would
determine his political future.
   ``I have to win either in South Dakota or Minnesota, and we have
to get additional campaign contributions,'' he said on NBC. ``Those
two things have to be there, otherwise, I'm going to have to
withdraw. ... You have to win somewhere.''
   After Iowa's caucuses last week, Alexander M. Haig Jr. withdrew
from the Republican presidential race.
   Babbitt, who also appeared on the CBS program, indicated today
that he would like to continue his campaign, saying, ``I've devoted
a year to talking to the American people.''
   His wife, who joined him in the interview, added: ``I think
we'll keep going with the message of this campaign.''
   Babbitt said Tuesday it was premature for Jackson and former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart to be wooing his backers, saying he would
spend a few days in Washington and ``call and talk to my supporters
all over the country and ask them this question: `How ... can we
keep this reform movement alive?'''
   He had said prior to the New Hampshire primary that the state's
voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy.
   Republican Rep. Jack Kemp of New York got 13 percent of the GOP
vote and voiced optimism today over his third-place showing behind
Vice President George Bush and Dole.
   ``We're going to do well in Minnesota,'' Kemp said on the ABC
program.
   The New York congressman added that ``people recognize we are
viable, we are confident that we will be able to raise money.''
   Pete du Pont, who got 10 percent of the GOP vote, found cause to
cheer in that fourth-place showing just ahead of Pat Robertson in
the five-man Republican race.
   ``Point is, we've all finished together,'' du Pont said of the
trio on the GOP's bottom rung. And on his prospects in the days
ahead: ``We did much better in New Hampshire than we did in Iowa.
We'll do much better in the South than we did in New Hampshire.''
   Robertson, who finished with 9 percent, said the South would be
a welcome change after Iowa, which was Dole's neighborhood, and New
Hampshire, which was claimed by Bush: ``Tomorrow morning, I go into
the South, and they're going to be playing in my backyard.''
   For the Democrats, though neither Jackson nor Gore got a New
England boost to take South, both were sure to find friendlier
territory in Dixie.
   ``We've already been saving our resources for Super Tuesday,''
said Gore in an interview from Houston on CBS. ``I've spent more
time here than other candidates.''
   Both Hart and Jackson, who happened upon Babbitt at Cable News
Network's studio in Manchester as the votes rolled in Tuesday
night, huddled with the former Arizona governor to ask his support
should he withdraw.
   ``Our message has tremendous overlap. ... I hope that in time we
will work out some common ground in terms of our politics,'' said
Jackson, who finished with 8 percent, ahead of Gore's 7 percent,
Babbitt's 5 percent and Hart's 4 percent.
   Hart said he expects to be a candidate ``as far ahead in the
future as I can see.'' But he added, ``I understand that there are
standards that have to be met in terms of delegates and votes,'' he
said. ``It will take at least 30 to 60 days to determine if I can
put together a viable candidacy.''

   Democrat Richard Gephardt, cheered by
his second-place showing in New Hampshire's primary, said today
that voters will buy his ideas because ``this is not a candidacy,
this is a cause.''
   Gephardt continued his campaign theme of change, as he left New
Hampshire for South Dakota, which holds a primary next Tuesday.
   ``This is not a candidacy, this is a cause. And the cause is
changing America _ a new trade policy, a new agriculture and energy
policy, inspiring and motivating our corporate leaders to stop the
paper profits and to start looking at how we do the business of
America again to make good products,'' he told CBS' ``This
Morning.''
   Gephardt said his showing in the New Hampshire Democratic
presidential primary leaves him positioned ``to do great in the
South.''
   ``It appears to me that we've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race
through the rest of the country,'' Gephardt said Tuesday night.
Final but unofficial results gave Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis 37 percent, Gephardt, the congressman from Missouri, 20
percent and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, 18 percent.
   At his campaign headquarters in Manchester, Gephardt began a
jubilant victory statement by saying, ``I love New Hampshire.''
   ``Everybody said the Gephardt campaign couldn't do it in New
Hampshire,'' he told cheering supporters.
   ``Well, we said that this is one nation, one people ... and we
proved that the people of New Hampshire are a part of this country
and care about this country and about this cause.''
   Gephardt insisted that his campaign's finances were in good
shape for the move south. He said loans to the campaign were made
against federal matching funds, which he will receive later.
   ``It's a cash-flow situation,'' he said. ``We didn't borrow
money that we didn't have coming. So we're in good shape. We're
going to do fine for Super Tuesday.''
   Gephardt pointed to a recent USA Today poll that put him first
in the South in front of Dukakis, Simon, Al Gore and Jesse Jackson.
   Asked whether Simon's third-place showing would put him out of
the race, Gephardt said he didn't know.
   ``Paul has run a good campaign, he's a fine man and that's his
decision,'' he said.
   Simon and Gephardt had been concentrating their fire on each
other until the weekend, when both switched to advertisements
attacking Dukakis.
   Jim Demers, co-chairman of Gephardt's New Hampshire campaign,
noted that Dukakis now has ``a gold (medal) and a bronze'' after
his third-place Iowa showing and Tuesday's victory. Gephardt picked
up the metaphor later, saying, ``I've got a gold and a silver.''
   Gephardt said he was especially happy to have won in Manchester,
which is the state's largest city. There he beat Dukakis 29 percent
to 27 percent.
   Gephardt planned to leave the state early this morning for South
Dakota, where he will spend six of the seven days before the
state's primary Feb. 23.

   Mayor Dick Crawford easily defeated his
challenger in the Republican primary for City Hall, and will face a
state senator in the April general election.
   ``We've been looking to get this out of the way so we can get to
the main event,'' Crawford said after his victory Tuesday night
over businessman Tom Quinn.
   Crawford, 54, who waged a minimal primary campaign, won the
Republican nomination with 14,952 votes, or 61 percent, according
to unofficial results from all 188 precincts. Quinn received 38
percent of the vote, or 9,327 votes.
   Crawford's opponent in the April 5 race is Democratic state Sen.
Rodger Randle, who contended Quinn's relatively strong showing
against an incumbent indicates voters are not pleased with Crawford.
   Quinn only recently joined the GOP to stop Crawford from running
unopposed, Randle also noted. Quinn, a sign company president, had
defeated Democratic Mayor Terry Young in the 1986 primary.
   ``It certainly would have to be a disappointment to Mr. Crawford
to have Mr. Quinn run so well against him,'' Randle said.
   Randle won the Democratic nomination with 57 percent of the
ballots cast, or 20,507 votes. Former Tulsa water and sewer
Commissioner Patty Eaton came in second with 13,361 votes, or 37
percent.
   The other four candidates in the Democratic primary received a
little more than 5 percent of the votes cast.
   Tuesday's election had a record turnout, with more than 70,000
of the 250,000 registered voters casting ballots, Tulsa County
Election Board Secretary Scott Orbison said.
   Randle, 44, has been a member of the Oklahoma Legislature for 17
years and served as Senate president pro tempore. He lost his first
race for mayor in 1978 to Republican Jim Inhofe, now a congressman
from Oklahoma's 1st District.

   A fire broke out today in an unoccupied
fifth-floor room of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, forcing about 150
people to flee the building to a snowstorm outside.
   Flames leaped from windows on the fifth floor of the aging,
10-story building, and smoke continued to pour out for an hour
after it was evacuated.
   Soviet firefighters were summoned to the scene in midafternoon
and were escorted by U.S. Marine guards into the embassy compound.
The blaze apparently began in an unoccupied room in an area
undergoing renovation.
   Philip Brown, a senior embassy spokesman, said the cause of the
fire had not been determined. No injuries were reported.
   The building, leased to the United States by the Soviet
government since the 1950s, was to have been replaced by a new
diplomatic complex. But the embassy building at the center of that
complex remains vacant and unfinished following discovery that it
was riddled with Soviet eavesdropping devices.
   About 150 embassy employees were in the building when the fire
broke out. Ambassador Jack Matlock was not at the embassy at the
time but returned after the evacuation, press attache Richard
Gilbert said.
   Gilbert said the fire ``might be construction related, but it
has not been determined.'' The spokesman said there was no serious
damage to the main working areas of the embassy, which are located
on the sixth floor and above.
   Most of the 40 apartments once used by guards and diplomats have
been vacated in recent months as officials have moved into the
modern brick townhouses that surround the new embassy building.
   The diplomats and embassy workers were ordered out of their
offices and stood on the sidewalk in a snowstorm to watch firemen
combat the fire.
   The blaze occurred in a section of the building that had been
used to house Navy Seabees _ members of construction battalions _
and workers brought to Moscow on temporary assignment. But a
spokesman said the corner room where the fire broke out was not
being occupied at the time.
   Much of the building, which is in poor repair, is under
renovation while officials in Washington ponder what to do with
their new embassy building less than a block away.
   A Soviet fire official said the blaze was confined to one room
and that no injuries were reported. Embassy employees were told to
take the rest of the day off because the building could not be
occupied for at least several hours.
   Brown said embassy officials decided about 30 minutes after the
blaze was discovered that they couldn't contain it without
assistance, and Moscow fire trucks were called to the scene.
   Marine guards, who are responsible for security inside the
compound, escorted the firemen and their vehicles into the
courtyard of the pre-revolutionary mansion and accompanied the
firefighters as they trained hoses on the blaze and entered the
main embassy building with gas masks and extinguishers.
   U.S. Reps. Dan Mica, D-Fla., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, during
an inspection of the embassy last April, pronounced it ``a firetrap
and unsafe by accepted standards for general working conditions.''
   A more serious fire ravaged the top floors of the embassy
building in August 1977. Officials said afterward the damage was
particularly severe because Ambassador Malcolm Toon refused to
permit Soviet firefighters to enter the top-security embassy
communications center and some of its most sensitive work areas to
combat the blaze.
   In Washington, a senior official said the fire was contained to
an unclassified area and was unrelated to talks that Secretary of
State George P. Shultz will open Sunday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``The fire was a fire,'' said Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne L. Ridgway. ``It would be totally wrong, it would be
fiction, to try to have it have anything to do with the upcoming
visit.''
   Shultz will hold talks with Shevardnadze on arms control
negotiations, human rights and a prospective withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan. They also will make preparations for a
summit meeting in Moscow next spring between President Reagan and
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Ms. Ridgway, who is in charge of the European bureau at the
State Department and will accompany Shultz, said the fire
``affected our communications somewhat'' with the embassy and that
she did not have all the details.
   The embassy and its operations in Moscow have been the center of
controversy for more than a year.
   A scandal exploded around accusations that Marine guards,
influenced by Soviet women with whom they were illicitly
associating, had permitted Soviet agents inside secret areas of the
embassy when no diplomats were present. Those charges were never
proved, but a Marine was convicted in August of espionage.
   Officials disclosed in 1986 that the new $191 million embassy,
already five years behind schedule, would not be finished or
occupied until they decided whether it could be made secure from
electronic bugs.
   Proposals include razing part or all of the new building or
building a new structure in the complex to house communications
facilities and secret operations.

   Narcotics agents mistakenly raided a
minister's house after counting from the wrong end of the block,
officials said.
   ``I thought they were robbers,'' said Hector Sanchez, whose
daughter, Noemi, woke him up early Sunday to say three men were in
the backyard with crowbars and guns.
   Sanchez, a minister at the Spanish Assembly of God Church, says
he asked the men what they wanted and they told him to stop or be
shot. They then followed him into the house, Sanchez said.
   ``When he (one of the officers) told me he was from the state
police, I was relieved,'' Sanchez said. ``But I was still
frightened.''
   His wife and two daughters sat in the living room while the men
went through the house and out front, where they ran into the rest
of the raiding party _ and learned of their mistake.
   Sgt. Don Bush blames of the Department of Public Safety
narcotics division blames ``human error.''
   The department had assigned men to two groups, Bush said. One
group was supposed to enter the targeted home from the front, and
the other _ the group that raided the Sanchez home _ was supposed
to guard the rear.
   Because the houses don't have numbers on the back, the group in
the rear was instructed to count houses from the corner, Bush said.
The problem, he said, was that they started counting at the wrong
end of the block.
   Later Sunday, public safety officers and the Abilene Police
Department's Special Services Bureau arrested seven people down the
block.

   The Journal of the American Medical Association
says it will not comply with an order to name an essayist who
claimed in a recent issue to have committed a mercy killing.
   A subpoena was served Tuesday by the Cook County state's
attorney's office regarding a Jan. 8 essay titled ``It's Over,
Debbie,'' said Kirk Johnson, general counsel for the nation's
largest organization of doctors.
   Although the AMA ``strongly condemns'' mercy killing, its
journal will not comply with the subpoena, he said in a statement.
   ``Dr. George Lundberg, the editor in chief of JAMA, has invoked
the privilege protecting information obtained by reporters in the
course of their work as provided in the Illinois Reporter's
Privilege Act,'' Johnson said.
   The act says a person seeking privileged, or protected,
information must apply in writing to the circuit court to set aside
the protection, he said.
   The act also says the court may overrule the privilege only
when, after a hearing, it finds all other sources have been
exhausted and disclosure of the information ``is essential to
protection of the public interest,'' said Johnson.
   ``Because the state's attorney's office has not complied with
these requirements of the act, JAMA will not comply with the
subpoena,'' the attorney said.
   Terry Levin, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said
Tuesday, ``We have no comment, and in fact, are not confirming we
are even looking into this.''
   In the article, a doctor described injecting a fatal dose of
morphine into a terminally ill young woman he had never seen before
who suffered from ovarian cancer.
   AMA officials have said they did not verify the purported mercy
killing but believe it was based on fact. They said the author
requested anonymity.
   Handing over information would ``inhibit JAMA and other media
from publishing information from sources who wish to remain
anonymous,'' Johnson's statement said. ``Thus, disclosure would
strike at the heart of the Reporters Privilege Act and the First
Amendment interests which it seeks to protect.''
   The AMA and its journal are based in Chicago. The essay did not
indicate where the author lived or where the purported incident
took place.

   ``The Last Emperor,'' Bernardo
Bertolucci's tragic saga of China's boy emperor, captured top
honors today with nine nominations, including best picture, for the
60th Motion Picture Academy Awards.
   It was followed by seven nominations for ``Broadcast News,'' the
romantic comedy of life in a network news bureau. Among the
nominees were newcomer Holly Hunter, cited in the best actress
category for her portrayal of a frenetic producer.
   Following those two films, with six nominations each, were:
``Empire of Sun,'' the Japanese invasion of China as seen through a
boy's eyes; ``Fatal Attraction,'' the chiller of a woman's revenge
against a spurning lover, and ``Moonstruck,'' the comedy of love in
a volatile Italian-American family.
   All four except Steven Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun,'' were
nominated as best picture. The fifth nominee was John Boorman's
``Hope And Glory.'' And Spielberg once again was denied a
director's nomination, as he was in 1983 for ``The Color Purple.''
   ``I think it's extraordinary that a picture like this that's so
completely English should get this kind of acclaim,'' Boorman, said
in a telephone interview from his Paris apartment.
   Two-time winner Jack Nicholson won his ninth nomination as the
1930s bum in ``Ironweed,'' and Robin Williams was nominated for
best actor with his role as the antic disc jockey in ``Good Morning
Vietnam.''
   Also nominated: Michael Douglas, ``Wall Street''; William Hurt,
``Broadcast News''; and Marcello Mastroianni, ``Dark Eyes.''
   ``It made me not only proud for our film `Wall Street,' but it
reminded me what a wonderful part (writer-director) Oliver Stone
had created,'' said Douglas, son of actor Kirk Douglas, from New
York.
   Another double Oscar winner, Meryl Streep, won her seventh
nomination for ``Ironweed.'' Also in the best actress race: Cher,
for ``Moonstruck''; Glenn Close, ``Fatal Attraction''; Miss Hunter;
and Sally Kirkland for ``Anna.''
   Nominees for supporting actor were Albert Brooks, ``Broadcast
News''; Sean Connery, ``The Untouchables''; Morgan Freeman,
``Street Smart''; Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck''; and Denzel
Washington, ``Cry Freedom.''
   All are first-time nominees except Gardenia, named for ``Bang
The Drum Slowly,'' in 1973.
   All the supporting actresses were nominated for the first time:
Norma Aleandro, ``Gaby - A True Story''; Anne Archer, ``Fatal
Attraction''; Olympia Dukakis, ``Moonstruck''; Anne Ramsey, ``Throw
Momma From The Train''; Ann Sothern, ``The Whales Of August.''
   The nominees for best direction were Adrian Lyne for ``Fatal
Attraction''; Boorman for ``Hope and Glory''; Bernardo Bertolucci,
``The Last Emperor''; Norman Jewison, ``Moonstruck''; Lasse
Hallstrom, ``My Life As A Dog.''
   A surprise omission was James L. Brooks for his direction of
``Broadcast News.'' His only previous film as director, ``Terms of
Endearment,'' won him the award in 1983.
   Brooks was at the Berlin Film Festival and was told of the
film's seven nominations by telephone.
   ``He was quite thrilled with seven nominations. Yes, I'm sure he
was somewaht disappointed about not getting that (nomination for
best director),'' said publicist Pat Kingsley. ``But he was so
thrilled for the actors. He was also thrilled with the screenplay
nomination.''
   As expected, Louis Malle's remembrance of his wartime childhood,
``Au Revoir Les Enfants,'' was nominated as France's entry for best
foreign language film. The other nominees: ``Babette's Feast''
(Denmark); ``Course Completed'' (Spain); ``The Family'' (Italy);
``Pathfinder'' (Norway).
   Best original screenplay nominations went to Malle for ``Au
Revoir Les Enfants''; Brooks, ``Broadcast News''; John Patrick
Shanley, ``Moonstruck''; Woody Allen, ``Radio Days''; and Boorman
for ``Hope And Glory.''
   For best screenplay adaptation, nominees included Tony Huston
for ``The Dead''; James Dearden, ``Fatal Attraction''; Stanley
Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford, ``Full Metal Jacket'';
Mark Peploe and Bertolucci, ``The Last Emperor''; and Lasse
Hallstrom, Reidar Jonsson, Brasse Brannstrom and Per Berglund, ``My
Life As A Dog.''
   The popular ``Dirty Dancing,'' scored its only nomination for
its song: ``(I've Had) The Time Of My Life.'' Also nominated in
that category: ``Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now'' from ``Mannequin'';
``Shakedown'' from ``Beverly Hills Cop II''; ``Storybook Love''
from ``The Princess Bride''; and the title tune from ``Cry
Freedom.''
   The Academy could not be accused of chauvinism in the director's
category; for the first time, all five nominees are foreigners.
Lyne and Boorman are English, Bertolucci is Italian, Jewison is
Canadian and Hallstrom is Swedish.
   Some of the highly advertised films came up short. The
prestigious ``Cry Freedom'' was mentioned only for supporting
actor, score and song.
   Miss Streep seems headed for the record book. So far, she has
been nominated seven times for her 14 films. Also impressive is
Miss Close with four nominations in seven movies.
   The nominees were announced at dawn by actress Shirley MacLaine
and Academy President Robert Wise.

   The Academy has already announced one winner: Billy Wilder for
the Irving G. Thalberg award, presented for ``consistently high
quality of motion picture production.'' The
director-writer-producer of ``The Lost Weekend,'' ``Sunset
Boulevard,'' ``Stalag 17,'' ``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Apartment''
and other films has won six Oscars.
   With one exception, nominations for the Academy Awards are made
by the individual branches: actors nominate for acting, directors
for directing. All of the 4,400 voting members nominate the best
picture of the year.
   The awards are voted by all members, with a few exceptions. For
short subjects, documentaries and foreign-language films, voters
must attend screenings or certify that they have seen the nominees.
   One category is missing this year: best original song score. The
requirements are five original songs by one writer or team of
writers for a single film, and no film qualified.
   After the announcements, publicists traditionally return to
their offices to plot campaigns for their nominees, ncluding trade
advertising, special screenings, media tours and promotional
mailings to Academy voters.
   The awards will be televised by ABC on April 11 from the Shrine
Auditorium. Among the stars scheduled to appear onstage: Audrey
Hepburn, Robin Williams, Chevy Chase, Gregory Peck, Marlee Matlin,
John Candy, Glenn Close, Anjelica Huston and Paul Newman.

<HEAD>Roy Cohn Autobiography Says Judge Decided Rosenberg Sentence in
Advance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late Roy Cohn says in his autobiography that
the judge in the famous Rosenberg spy case decided before the trial
that he would put Julius Rosenberg to death.
   Cohn was a member of the prosecution team. Excerpts from his
yet-to-be published autobiography, written with journalist Sidney
Zion, were published Tuesday in New York Magazine.
   Cohn, who was 24 at the time of the 1951 spy trial, also
asserted that U.S. District Judge Irving R. Kaufman telephoned him
during the trial to seek his advice on a penalty for Ethel
Rosenberg.
   Cohn said he recommended the death penalty.
   The Rosenbergs were convicted of selling atomic secrets to the
Soviet Union and were executed in 1953.
   A law clerk for Kaufman, who is still on the bench, said, ``The
judge is not available, and it's the policy of the chambers not to
comment on press reports.''
   Cohn, who became chief counsel to Sen. Joseph McCarthy during
the ``Red scare'' hearings of the 1950s, died of heart failure and
AIDS-related illnesses in August 1986.
   During a stormy career that included bitter run-ins with the
Internal Revenue Service and many public figures, Cohn's veracity
was frequently challenged.
   In the book, Cohn recalled that Kaufman said he sought divine
guidance before deciding on the Rosenbergs' sentences.
   ``I can't confirm or deny this. So far as I know, the closest he
got to prayer was the phone booth next to the Park Avenue
Synagogue. He called from that booth to a phone behind the bench in
the courtroom, to ask my advice on whether he ought to give the
death penalty to Ethel Rosenberg. ... There was never any question
about Julius: Kaufman had told me before the trial started that he
was going to sentence Julius Rosenberg to death.''
   Cohn said Kaufman was concerned about public reaction to a woman
being executed.
   Cohn said he told Kaufman ``that she's worse than Julius ... so
unless you're willing to say that a woman is immune from the death
penalty, I don't see how you can justify sparing her.''

   A mysterious blast ripped through the
side of a Japanese auto carrier in the southern Persian Gulf today,
but divers later determined that the ship had only ran aground,
salvage executives said.
   Salvage tugboats with divers aboard had rushed to help the
4,842-ton ton motor vehicle carrier Prosper World after the
explosion was reported.
   When asked about damage, the captain reported that a tank was
leaking, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The captain was identified as a Korean.
   After the divers went into action, monitors heard them telling
the captain by radio that ``he had just ran aground, and the whole
bottom plate (of the vessel) was wrinkled.''
   They also told him he had a 15-by-9-inch hole in the keel which
they could patch up, but he needed to head to a dry dock for
repairs.
   The vessel flies the Liberian flag and is operated by the
Hyogo-based Masumoto Shipping Co., they said. It was leaving the
gulf after delivering a cargo of cars.
   The incident occurred about 11 miles off the southern gulf
emirate of Dubai at 2:30 p.m.
   People on shore reported hearing the explosion and thinking it
was thunder.
   Iranian gunboats are active in the southern gulf, where they
attack neutral commercial shipping in retaliation for Iraqi raids
on Iranian oil tanker lanes.

   A passenger's throat was slashed by another
traveler on a flight from Panama City to Miami, authorities said.
   Eduardo A. Noel, 35, was in critical condition today at Jackson
Memorial Hospital, a hospital spokewoman said.
   Noel was sitting near the rear of the Eastern Airlines L-1011
when a man attacked him Tuesday with a pocketknife, Eastern
spokeswoman Paula Musto said. Passengers are allowed to carry
pocketknives with blades of less than 4 inches.
   ``There really was not any sort of struggle, and not many
passengers were involved,'' Ms. Musto said.
   Authorities said they did not know the motive for the attack.
   A doctor on the flight, Steve Fortus, of St. Augustine, used his
hand to stanch the bleeding and held an oxygen mask over the
victim's face, officials said.
   ``He was already slipping out of consciousness, and he was
bleeding very heavily from his neck,'' Fortus said. ``He probably
would have died in a couple of minutes if we didn't stop the
bleeding.''
   The jet, carrying 143 passengers and 23 crew members, was flying
over Cuba when Noel, who is from Panama, was stabbed. The flight
received landing priority, and touched down at Miami International
Airport about 45 minutes later, officials said.
   Robert Dean Clark was arrested when the plane landed. The FBI
charged him with crime aboard aircraft-attempted murder.
   Clark, a former resident of Austin, Texas, and Corona Del Mar,
Calif., reportedly has lived in Panama City for the last seven
months and worked at financial institutions there, the FBI said. He
was scheduled to appear before a U.S. magistrate later today.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller said Noel, an aviation inspector, was
traveling to Miami to examine a plane that his employer, Copa
Airlines, was considering buying.

   Pat Robertson said today that the South is
``a different ball game'' as he seeks to regain momentum after
finishing last in New Hampshire's leadoff Republican presidential
primary.
   Robertson, appearing on NBC's ``Today'' show, played down the
controversy over his statement Sunday that the Soviets had placed
nuclear missiles in Cuba. ``I was not hurt by more than 400 or 500
votes,'' he said.
   He said his biggest problem in New Hampshire was organization.
``I'm not an issues person, I'm an organizational person,'' he said.
   But he said the South was ``a different ball game.''
   ``We're going to have the finances and the people to do the job
down there,'' he said.
   Robertson finished a surprising second in the Iowa caucuses Feb.
8, behind Senate GOP leader Bob Dole and ahead of Vice President
George Bush. In New Hampshire, he was last among the five remaining
GOP contenders.
   Aide Marc Nuttle said Robertson had a larger base to work from
in Iowa, partly because the religious program he was formerly with,
700 Club, had a wider viewership there.
   But the South will be a different story, Robertson told several
hundred cheering supporters. Dole had claimed Iowa as his backyard,
while Bush had said the same of New Hampshire, but in the South,
``they're going to be playing in my backyard,'' said Robertson, a
native of Virginia.
   ``I'm throwing the gauntlet down to Bob Dole and George Bush:
South Carolina is the first Super Tuesday state, and I'm going to
beat you there convincingly,'' Robertson said to cheering, stomping
and chants of ``We want Pat!''
   The crowd cheered again when one supporter yelled out, ``You've
got the biggest backyard, Pat!''
   Robertson aides, meanwhile, accused other campaigns of ``dirty
tricks,'' including the cutting of telephone lines to Robertson's
Manchester headquarters sometime Monday night. Robertson political
strategist Richard Pinsky would not say which campaign he suspected.
   Robertson planned to fly this morning to Greer, S.C., where a
rally and news conference was scheduled at the airport. Robertson
then planned to fly to Orlando, Fla., and later to Miami, where he
was to attend a Cuban-American rally.

   Detectives today questioned a woman charged
with fatally shooting a caseworker in a hospital emergency room
while waiting for psychiatric help, authorities said.
   Edith Anderson, 31, briefly held three people hostage after the
shooting Tuesday night before she surrendered, police said.
Detective Jack Bauer said today authorities had three addresses for
her _ Pittsburgh and nearby North Braddock and McKeesport.
   She was arraigned early today on a charge of criminal homicide,
but will not enter a plea until a preliminary hearing, yet to be
scheduled.
   Ms. Anderson and the hostages were being questioned by homicide
detectives this morning.
   ``She came seeking psychiatric help,'' police Cmdr. Ron Freeman
said. ``The hospital caseworker was helping her at the time. For
some reason, she pulled out a gun and started shooting.''
   Ms. Anderson apparently was sitting with hospital caseworker
Linda Rosen, 27, of Pittsburgh, in the psychiatric waiting area of
the emergency room at St. Francis Medical Center when she pulled
out a gun, he said. Miss Rosen was shot in the back as she turned
to flee, he said.
   Freeman said Ms. Anderson then ran into a bathroom within the
glass-enclosed waiting room and, holding the door ajar, pointed a
handgun at an unidentified man and two women who were waiting for a
relative.
   ``They just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time,'' he said.
   ``Everyone else in the emergency room was evacuated,'' hospital
spokeswoman Shirley Freyer said.
   Paramedics heard the shots and radioed for police, said Margaret
Rizza, spokeswoman for the Public Safety Department.
   Police talked with Ms. Anderson, who allowed them to remove the
wounded caseworker, said Police Chief Ralph Pampena said. Miss
Rosen died before getting treatment, he said.
   Freeman said Ms. Anderson asked to speak to Detective Robert
White, with whom she went to high school. When he arrived, Ms.
Anderson released one hostage, he said.
   Freeman said she then asked to talk to Eddie Edwards, operations
manager and a talk show host on WPTT-TV. When Edwards arrived, the
woman freed the remaining hostages and then asked for cigarettes,
he said.
   White slid the cigarettes across the floor. As she reached down
to pick up the pack, White's partner, Lou Conova, slammed the
bathroom door closed and shoved a row of chairs up against the
door, said Lt. Jim Dickerson.
   Police held a bulletproof shield against the door, and minutes
later another detective persuaded Ms. Anderson to surrender, police
said.

<TEXT>
   Rebels bombed a high school theater during
a performance marking the anniversary of Burma's independence,
killing 11 students and a villager and wounding 133 people, a
newspaper said today.
   The state-run Working Peoples' Daily said five students were
killed instantly when the time bomb, put under a seat, exploded
last Friday at Momouk State High School in Momouk. The school is in
Kachin state, about 500 miles north of Rangoon.
   Six other students and a villager later died at a hospital, the
report said. It said most of the wounded were students.
   The attack was blamed on Kachin rebels. A number of groups,
including the Kachin Independence Army, have been fighting the
Rangoon government for greater autonomy. The Kachins are the
strongest anti-government group after the communists.
   The high school bombing occurred on Union Day, which
commemorates the Feb. 12, 1947 signing of an agreement by various
Burmese national groups to jointly receive independence from
Britain.
   Five days before the attack, 17 people were wounded in an
explosion at an open-air theater where a show marking Union Day
festivities was under way, the paper said. That blast occurred in
Shan state, 380 miles north of Rangoon.
   Military officers who took journalists and foreign diplomats on
a tour of Kachin state last month alleged that rebels not only
bombed railway lines and public buildings but also private homes
and places where festivities are held.
   Government forces last year were reported to have overrun two
Kachin strongholds near the Chinese border after a series of
battles.

   Santa Ana winds gusting to 60 mph whipped
across Southern California today, overturning small planes and
tractor trailers, closing a freeway and fanning fires. One man was
electrocuted when he stepped on a power line.
   ``The stoplights are swaying,'' said Frank Donadee, a Pomona
resident. ``I've never seen them sway before ... There's a lot of
debris that's blowing very, very fast in the streets.''
   Julio Mendoza, 39, of Azusa was killed as he stepped on a live
wire, apparently downed by the wind, while helping to douse a fire
on a neighbor's lawn, said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy
Detta Roberts.
   ``We've got a lot of problems. We've got a lot of wires down.
We've had a structure fire. We've had two brush fires, and we have
probably around a 55 percent to 65 percent power outage in our
precinct area,'' said Sgt. Joe Oblek at the sheriff's Altadena
Station.
   At John Wayne Airport, four small aircraft were flipped over by
the winds. Two planes were reported overturned at El Toro Marine
Air Station, and two more were tossed about at Van Nuys Airport,
officials said.
   Ten miles of the Foothill Freeway between Duarte in the San
Gabriel Valley and Pomona were closed at 4:30 a.m. when fierce
gusts made driving dangerous, said California Highway Patrol
Officer Shirley Gaines.
   In the Glendora area of the San Gabriel Valley, three big rigs
were toppled by the wind, said CHP Officer Monty Keifer. Two more
big rigs had overturned in the Ontario and Riverside areas.
   A six-mile stretch of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu was
without power this morning as wind blacked out the homes of actors
Sean Penn and Bruce Willis and oil magnate Marvin Davis, among
others.
   More than 5,000 Southern California Edison customers in the
Altadena, Sierra Madre, Torrance and Monrovia areas _ where winds
were estimated at 50 mph to 60 mph _ lost power shortly before
midnight, spokesman Bob Krauch said. About 1,000 to 2,000 were
still in the dark hours later, he added.
   Brief outages also were reported in the Hollywood, Venice and
West Los Angeles areas, she said.
   The Santa Ana winds were expected to diminish by tonight, giving
way to clear skies and lower temperatures in most areas Thursday,
the National Weather Service said.

   Bob Dole said today that he made a mistake in
not responding to charges from George Bush in the closing hours of
the New Hampshire primary campaign, but aides promised Dole would
react ``very, very forcefully'' to future attacks.
   The Senate Republican leader, looking to recover from a big loss
in the Granite State Tuesday, vowed to correct what he said are the
lies in Bush's campaign ads.
   ``I'm going to try to go out and straighten it out. I'm not
going to run from it. I'm not known for running from a fight,''
Dole said at the Manchester airport before flying to Washington.
``I never said I was going to raise your taxes. I didn't say I was
advocating a $10-a-barrel import fee. But that's what Bush's ads
say and they are not true.''
   Flying back to take part in the Senate debate on campaign
financing, Dole was asked if he had been too soft on Bush.
   ``Probably,'' Dole told reporters on the plane.
   And queried on whether he should have not let Bush's charges go
unanswered, Dole said, ``Yes, that's my guess.''
   Dole said in Manchester that he thought he had done well to
finish second against Bush in a state the vice president says is
his neighbor. But he said the boost he got out of his Iowa victory
on Feb. 8 was overrated.
   ``I think our expectations got out of hand,'' Dole said. ``I
think we sat on our hands for three days.''
   Dole brushed aside suggestions that he would now return to the
style of the ``mean old Bob Dole'' saying the nation is seeing a
``mean George Bush.''
   ``They've got the axes and they seem to be swinging them in
every state,'' Dole said.
   William Brock, Dole's campaign manager, underscored the new
forcefulness the campaign plans against Bush attacks.
   ``When he does it from now on, we're going to respond very, very
forcefully,'' Brock said on the plane. ``We're tired of it. We're
sick to the gills of this type of tactic.''
   But Brock said the campaign would not respond ``in kind,
negative against negative.''
   ``We're not going to play their game. We're not going to put up
with the effort to distort the record,'' Brock told reporters. ``We
don't have to wallow in the mud with them to answer their charges.
... When they are wrong, we are going to point it out.''
   Although Bush's convincing victory Tuesday night blunted Dole's
post-Iowa momentum, Dole and his aides forced a positive face on
the New Hampshire results.
   But the frustration was apparent when Dole and Bush were
interviewed from different locations by Tom Brokaw of NBC.
   After Bush wished Dole well as the campaigns moved south, Dole
made his sharp comment, referring to last-day television ads by the
Bush campaign that claimed Dole supports tax increases and Social
Security cuts.
   ``You shouldn't distort someone's record,'' Dole said. ``I could
do that to him, but I won't.''
   He vowed to ``straighten out my record. It won't take long.''
   ``For the campaign of a sitting Republican vice president to
engage in the kind of base distortions of this weekend is demeaning
to that office and demeaning to our party,'' said Sen. Warren
Rudman of New Hampshire, a key Dole backer.
   Dole's own big win in Iowa last week had helped boost his
standing in New Hampshire polls. Once 20 points behind, he pulled
even a few days before the voting.
   But the drive faltered, and Tuesday nights results left the
Senate minority leader at 29 percent, nine points behind Bush.
   Dole was still 16 points ahead of the next GOP contender, Rep.
Jack Kemp, and Dole and his aides insisted Tuesday night that
Bush's victory was nothing to crow about.
   ``Obviously we would have liked to have won here,'' Dole said.
``We didn't quite do that, but we did a lot.''
   Brock said: ``We were down more than 20 points eight days ago,
and to have come this close _ that is a tremendous commentary on
Bob Dole. It's also a commentary on the softness of the vice
president's supporters.''
   But he also indicated that the tone of the campaign is likely to
change, saying Bush has ``21 days to start telling the truth and
dealing with issues, and we're going to give him a countdown, day
by day.''

   A ground crew chief in the Illinois Air
National Guard was sucked into an engine intake of an F-4D Phantom
jet and was killed, authorities said.
   Sgt. Martin Gaither, 28, of Williamsville died Tuesday in
surgery at Memorial Medical Center, Sangamon County Deputy Coroner
Bruce Martin said.
   Gaither was involved in a series of engine checks on the flight
line, where aircraft are prepared for takeoff, said Air National
Guard Capt. Bob Lael.
   Gaither walked in front of a running engine and was drawn into
the intake chute, Lael said.
   Initial reports indicated the engine was running at 80 percent
of its maximum power, but an investigation will be required to
determine its exact speed at the time of the accident, Lael said.
   Gaither was a full-time employee of the Guard's 183rd Tactical
Fighter Group for four years, Lael said.

<TEXT>
   A New York state law forbidding loitering in
subway, train or bus stations is unconstitutional because it puts
people too much at the mercy of police, the state's top court ruled
today.
   The law forbids people from sleeping in transportation
facilities or staying there without giving authorities a
``satisfactory explanation'' of what they're doing.
   In a decision written by Judge Vito Titone, the Court of Appeals
said the statute failed to give a ``person of ordinary
intelligence'' notice that his conduct is against the law.
   ``Such a generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct
calculated to cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent,
thereby failing to give adequate notice of what conduct is
prohibited,'' Titone wrote in the 7-0 ruling.
   The court ruled unanimously in favor of two New York City men
who were arrested in 1985 for loitering in incidents at Penn
Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
   Paul Bright was arrested after showing an open satchel to
passersby at Penn Station. When Bright failed to produce
identification to a policeman, he was told he was being arrested
for loitering. He was also charged with possessing stolen credit
cards, according to court records.
   Alfred Clark was arrested at the Port Authority after he failed
to give police an explanation of what he was doing there. An
officer searching Clark had found cocaine and a pipe in his jacket.
   The Manhattan District Attorney's office argued that the
requirement that police give a ``satisfactory explanation'' why the
conduct is illegal was enough to make the law stand.
   But the court said the law leaves it up to the police officer to
decide whether an explanation is satisfactory. That, Vitone wrote,
makes the law unconstitutional.
   Requiring a person to explain his actions also violates a
person's right to remain silent when questioned by police, the
court said.
   ``He is faced with the choice of either foregoing his
constitutional right to remain silent in the hope that his
explanation will satisfy that particular law enforcement official,
or invoking his constitutional right to remain silent and being
arrested,'' Vitone wrote.
   Barbara Sheehan, who argued the case for the district attorney's
office, said she would withhold comment until she has a chance to
read the ruling.
   An anti-loitering law was first enacted by the Legislature in
1939. The law then noted that subways and railroad stations had
become attractive for ``fakers, perverts, pickpockets, loiterers,
sleepers, flimflam men, etc. who infested these properties night
and day.''
   After being amended in 1953, the law was passed in its current
form in 1965.

   East German newspapers today printed pictures of
dismantled missiles and hailed Soviet preparations for removing
SS-12 nuclear missiles before a superpower treaty scrapping
intermediate-range weapons is ratified.
   ``In the name of reason. A historic moment awaits,'' said a
banner headline in the Junge Welt (Young World), the Communist
Party's youth newspaper.
   ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR (East
Germany). Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlier
than expected,'' Neues Deutschland (New Germany) said in a headline.
   Waren is 20 miles west of Neubrandenburg and about 90 miles
north of Berlin.
   ``Removal of missile troops ... starts earlier than expected.
Transfer to the Soviet Union and destruction of their type SS-12
armaments in the U.S.S.R.,'' the East Berlin daily Berliner Zeitung
said.
   West Germany's main opposition party, the Social Democrats,
called on the West German government to follow East Germany's lead
in getting rid of nuclear weapons early.
   The party's disarmament expert in Parliament, Hermann Scheer,
told reporters in Bonn today that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government should respond with early scrapping West Germany's 72
Pershing 1A missiles.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN said Tuesday night that
missiles in Waren had been taken apart, put in crates and were
ready for transport back to the Soviet Union.
   ``With this step we can make an important contribution toward
disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and
the Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN said.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the treaty in Washington last December, agreeing to eliminate all
land-based, medium- and shorter-range missiles.
   The agreement stipulates that the Soviets' shorter-range
missiles in East Germany and in Czechoslovakia are to be removed
within 18 months and medium-range U.S. and Soviet missiles within
three years.
   The Senate has not ratified the treaty. The Supreme Soviet, the
Soviet Union's parliament, is expected to approve the accord.
   In Washington, the State Department had no immediate reaction to
the report.
   A U.S. official, however, said the Soviets were free to take
down their missiles before the treaty takes effect. The official,
who demanded anonymity, said U.S. inspectors will go to East
Germany and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the Soviets
were complying with the treaty, if it is ratified.
   Although there was no comment in Moscow on the reported
dismantling, Gorbachev on Tuesday criticized Western European
countries for what he called a lack of enthusiasm for the
superpower treaty.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Gorbachev as criticizing
Western European governments for ``the latest wave of praise for
the `nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of projects for
the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the Franco-West German
military rapprochement, and so forth.''
   West German government officials declined comment on the report
Tuesday night. ``It is too early for us to comment at this time,''
a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press.
   ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when
they would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Soviet
soldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12
rockets.''
   The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the
intermediate-range missile treaty, which bans weapons with a range
of 300 miles to 3,000 miles.
   East German television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading
missile crates onto transport vehicles.
   ADN quoted a Soviet military officer as saying the ``troops are
very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in our unit.'' The
rockets are to be sent back to the Soviet Union by train, ADN said.
   It said East German journalists who toured the missile base were
allowed to interview Soviet soldiers.
   Erich Honecker, the East German leader, indicated in January
that Soviet intermediate-range rockets stationed in East Germany
could be removed ahead of schedule, but he gave no specific
timetable.
   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22
rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice
missiles were stationed at the Neubrandenburg site, which holds the
largest numbers of SS-12s in East Germany. There are three other
SS-12 rocket sites in East Germany.
   In all, there are 54 SS-12s in East Germany, according to those
figures.
   The Soviet Union also has 53 SS-23 shorter-range nuclear rockets
in East Germany.

<TEXT>
   Alain Savary, the education minister whose policies
sent millions protesting in the streets and threatened to bring
down the government, has died, the Socialist Party announced today.
He was 69.
   According to the statement, Savary had been hospitalized for
several weeks with a serious infection. It did not say when he died
or state the cause of death.
   A member of the French Resistance during World War II, Savary
had a reputation for being soft-spoken but stubborn.
   He was one of the leaders of the post-Liberation French
government, a member of the National Assembly and first held
ministerial positions under President Charles de Gaulle.
   As education minister, Savary proposed a bill in 1984 that
attempted to institute President Francois Mitterrand's campaign
promise to revamp the nation's private education system.
   Among other things, the reform bill gave local authorities more
control over management and financing of private schools, where
nearly 16 percent of France's 12 million children are educated.
   The Savary Law inflamed passions for months. Opponents felt it
threatened the basic right to choose how to educate their children.
Supporters wished to hold Mitterrand to his election promise of
creating ``a unified, secular public education service.''
   A daylong demonstration against the bill drew at least 1.5
million people to the capital on June 24, 1984.
   Organizers compared the crowds to those that thronged the Champs
Elysee in 1968 after student riots and in 1944 after the liberation
of Paris.
   Pierre Mauroy, the premier at the time of the Savary Law
controversy, said the reforms had been ``totally misunderstood,''
but the Socialists, who long opposed private schools, withdrew the
bill.
   The controversy caused a government reshuffle in which Savary
resigned. He was replaced by Jean Pierre Chevenment, and Mauroy was
replaced by Laurent Fabius.
   Lionel Jospin, secretary of the Socialist Party, expressed his
``very sincere condolences'' to the family and friends of Savary,
who served as education minister from 1981 until 1984.
   ``Courageous, lucid, discrete, Alain Savary put loyalty and
honor behind his convictions. He will remain one of the great names
of Socialism,'' said Jospin.
   Savary was party secretary from 1969 to 1971 and ``was one of
the moving forces behind the (party's) renaissance,'' Jospin said.
   ``He represented Socialism, with his strong sense of morality,
his sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization'' of
Africa, Jospin said.
   Born April 25, 1918, in the French colony of Algiers, Algeria,
Savary was a strong advocate of decolonization. He served as
secretary of state for Moroccan and Tunisian affairs in 1956, but
quit to protest French actions during the French-Algerian War.

   Three Soviet technicians will take a look
at the town of Magna to get a general feeling for the community
where their countrymen could be stationed if the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces treaty is ratified.
   Dave Porter, a spokesman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
State Department officials had confirmed the Soviet team was
expected in Utah today for a two-day review. An American contingent
was to conduct a similar tour in the Soviet Union.
   Porter said the Soviet technicians planned to tour Magna, about
25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, this afternoon. He said
specific details were not available.
   Magna, population 8,500, is a few miles from the Hercules
Bacchus West plant. Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a
compound near the plant if the Senate ratifies the INF treaty,
signed Dec. 7 by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The treaty would eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weaponry
in both countries' arsenals.
   The countries' inspection teams could be in place within 60 days
of the treaty's ratifications, officials say.
   The Soviets would monitor Hercules, which developed motors for
the Pershing II missiles, banned under the treaty, from 1979 to
1987.
   The Soviet technicians will be accompanied by four members of
the State Department's On-Site Inspection Agency, Porter said.
   Today, the Soviets will make a ``very general visit to (Magna).
It will just be the town, the stores, just to get a feeling for the
area,'' he said.
   On Thursday, the three technicians will conduct a similar tour
of Salt Lake City and then leave Friday, Porter said. He said no
news conferences or statements were planned.
   The Soviet and American advance teams will meet in Moscow a week
after the tours to discuss housing, travel and other arrangements,
Hatch's office said.
   Pershing II missile motors no longer are built at Hercules, but
the company has a contract for third-stage motors for the
intercontinental MX missile.

<TEXT>
   The state parole board today ordered
convicted rapist Gary Dotson, who was freed by the governor when
his accuser recanted in 1985, to return to prison for at least six
months for violating his parole.
   The Illinois Prisoner Review Board said it had declared Dotson a
parole violator for failing to report to his parole officer on Dec.
24.
   Dotson was convicted of rape in 1979. In 1985, Cathleen Crowell
Webb, now a New Hampshire homemaker, recanted her testimony that
Dotson had raped her when she was a teen-ager.
   After three days of hearings in 1985, Gov. James R. Thompson
commuted Dotson's 25- to 50-year sentence to time served. The
governor did not pardon Dotson, saying he did not believe the
recantation.
   After several subsequent brushes with the law, Dotson was again
threatened with prison.
   Today's decision involved Dotson's failure to check in with a
parole officer and a confrontation he had at a suburban bar.
   The board ordered Dotson held in state prison until Aug. 16,
when he will be eligible for parole again, said Nic Howell, a
spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.
   During the six months he is in prison, Dotson was ordered by the
board to join a substance-abuse program. Dotson told the board
during a hearing Tuesday at the Joliet Correctional Center that he
is an alcoholic and needed treatment.
   ``He's going to remain in prison for six months and then he'd be
transferred into some sort of a community-based rehabilitation
program at that time (Aug. 16) as a condition of his parole,''
Howell said today by telephone from Springfield.
   At Tuesday's hearing, Dotson, 30, said, ``I plan on seeking
full-time treatment.''
   Earlier last year, he was convicted on drunken driving charges,
and was later returned to prison for violating terms of parole
after that conviction.
   He was paroled Christmas Eve in what Thompson called a
``last-chance'' deal. But Dotson failed to check in with his parole
officer and, two days later, was involved in a confrontation at a
bar that landed him back behind bars.
   Prosecutors have dropped battery charges against Dotson in the
incident in which, officials said, he had argued with bar employees
over a sandwich and stabbed a cook in the hand.

<HEAD>Court Sees Right to Order Sterilization, Won't Spell Out
Guidelines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Iowa Supreme Court today said lower
courts may authorize sterilization of mentally retarded people but
refused to spell out guidelines under which the procedure is
appropriate.
   In a narrowly drawn opinion, the justices agreed that courts can
act on a request that mentally retarded people be sterilized even
though a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977.
   ``We conclude that our district courts possess subject matter
jurisdiction over, and accordingly may hear and determine,
applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally
incapacitated ward,'' the high court said.
   A stinging dissent said the court was wandering into a subject
``shot through with searching social and ethical questions.''
   ``In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to
the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant
social and ethical issues,'' said Justice K. David Harris. ``Future
litigants, faced with unanswered questions of great social and
ethical dimensions, or with missing ingredients of a vague
application process, will continue to press us for determinations
we are singularly unfit to reach.''
   But the majority rejected that reasoning.
   ``Stated another way, we do not believe our courts lack
jurisdiction over a case merely because the case is important or
unavoidably includes a constitutional dimension,'' the court said.
   The 7-1 decision came in a Polk County case in which Jan and
Tekla Matejski are the legal guardians of their 33-year-old
mentally retarded daughter, court records said.
   The couple filed an application with a lower court seeking
authorization to have their daughter sterilized, but a lawyer
appointed by the court to guard the woman's rights objected,
claiming there's no provision in Iowa law allowing sterilization.
   Polk County Judge Glenn E. Pille agreed and dismissed the
application.
   Both sides appealed, arguing over whether courts have the power
to order sterilization, but going one step further and asking the
high court to set groundrules.
   Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the Legislature
repealed a law providing for sterilization of people ``who are
mentally ill or retarded, syphilitic, habitual criminals, moral
degenerates, or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society.''
   But while agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests,
the high court refused to spell out guidelines.
   ``We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the
posture of the present case,'' the court said. ``The excursion
suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory
opinion.''
   Harris said the decision would haunt the justices.
   ``At what level of mental retardation can sterilization be
compelled?'' Harris asked. ``What board or body, if any, will
suggest statewide standards?

   Nine-year-old Kendall Smith, smiling and
carrying a new musical keyboard under his arm, walked out of the
hospital today, more than a month after he fell into a pond and was
trapped 40 minutes under the ice.
   ``He's a normal kid and he's going to go back to doing the
normal things,'' Dr. Karen Powers told reporters at a news
conference.
   ``We're all humbled as caretakers to see what many of us would
consider _ if not miraculous _ a near-miraculous recovery,'' added
Fred Tecklenburg, another of Kendall's attending physicians at the
Medical University of South Carolina Hospital.
   He said Kendall, who lives in Dillon, is one of about five
children in the medical literature to have recovered after having
been under water for more than 30 minutes.
   Kendall, wearing black jeans with suspenders, a blue striped
shirt and a white hat, was asked how he felt. ``Good,'' he said and
smiled shyly. He said he knew he would have to go back to school
but said he wasn't quite ready for that.
   In addition to the keyboard, donated by a electronics store,
Kendall also received a bicycle from a store.
   Ms. Powers said Kendall might need more therapy to build his
strength and endurance and might start back at school on a half-day
schedule. Tecklenburg added Kendall tested at his age level on
standardized tests administered about 10 days ago.
   Kendall and two other children were playing on the frozen
surface of a pond Jan. 12 when the ice gave way. His companions
were rescued quickly but it was almost 40 minutes before rescuers
pulled Kendall out with grappling hooks.
   Doctors have said the time he spent under the water is as long
as has been recored for anyone who has survived a near-drowning. In
icy water, the body's metabolism slows and the brain doesn't need
as much oxygen.
   The reflex is particularly powerful in children, doctors say.
   Kendall was in a coma for two weeks, but, when he regained
consciousness, made dramatic improvement.

   Many firefighters and other rescue workers deserve
commendations for their ``heroic behavior'' during London's worst
subway fire, the chairman of a public inquiry into the fatal blaze
said Wednesday.
   The Nov. 18 fire at the King's Cross subway station killed 31
people.
   ``It is apparent a number of firemen and other members of the
emergency services behaved with exemplary conduct and displayed
heroic behavior on the night of the disaster at King's Cross,''
said chairman Desmond Fennell.
   ``At the end of the investigation, I hope it will be possible to
commend them individually.''
   Fennell did not specify what sort of commendation he anticipated.
   London's Chief Fire Officer, Gerald Clarkson, told the inquiry
that officials have visited subway systems in Moscow, Tokyo,
Singapore and Brussels to study their firefighting methods.
   Previous testimony at the inquiry has indicated the fire was
probably started by a lighted match dropped under a wooden
escalator.

Commission meeting be held at the truce village of Panmunjom on
Feb. 23.
   Command officials said the move was in response to a North

   If held, it would be the 441st meeting since the Korean
armistice agreement was signed in 1953.
   North Korea gave no reason for calling the meeting but observers
here believe the communist state hopes to discuss joint U.S.-South

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Accept More Amerasians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has accepted for
resettlement 604 more Amerasians and their relatives but is still
waiting to discuss its proposal to resettle all Amerasians within
two years, a U.S. official said Wednesday.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said a
team of U.S. officials held interviews with the latest group of
half-American children and family members in Ho Chi Minh City on
Feb. 4-15.
   U.S. officials have approved the applications of 1,672
Amerasians and family members since Hanoi broke a long deadlock and
resumed the resettlement program in September, Petzing said.
   But he said there was no word on when the two sides would
discuss the two-year program proposed by the United States.
   ``We are still awaiting a date from the Vietnamese for this
meeting to take place,'' Petzing said.
   Two U.S. congressmen said after visiting Hanoi last month that
Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's deputy premier and foreign minister, had
agreed in principle to the proposal. Reps. Robert J. Mrazek,
D-N.Y., and Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., had said there soon would be
talks to work out a formal agreement.
   Mrazek and Ridge co-sponsored a bill, signed into law on Dec.
22, that requires that all Amerasians be resettled in the United
States within two years. It also created a new category of
immigrants, Amerasians, who have been leaving Vietnam as refugees.
   U.S. officials estimate there are about 10,000 Amerasians _ and
twice that number of relatives _ still in Vietnam. They were
fathered by U.S. servicemen and civilians during America's military
involvement in Vietnam, which ended with a pullout in 1973.

<TEXT>
   A human rights activist detained a year
ago after accusing government troops of torturing and killing
civilians has appealed to President Yoweri Museveni for his
release, according to reports Wednesday.
   Lance Sera Muwanga, secretary-general of the Sweden-based Uganda
Human Rights Activists, issued the appeal from Mulaga Hospital
where he was transfered under guard 10 days ago from the maximum
security Luzira prison.
   ``I have never been an enemy of Museveni's government and had I
been one I would have preferred to work from outside rather than
within,'' Muwanga told government-owned New Vision newspaper.
   The government did not respond immediately to Muwanga's request.
   Muwanga returned to Uganda in 1985 from Sweden where he fled in
the 1970s to escape Idi Amin's military dictatorship. He formed his
human rights monitoring group in Sweden.
   He has been held without charge since Feb. 25, 1987, two weeks
after he accused Museveni's National Resistance Army soldiers of
torturing and killing civilians in northern Uganda.
   Museveni, a former guerrilla leader, took power in January 1986
following a five-year insurgency and vowed to end human rights
abuses committed by soldiers under Amin, who ruled from 1971-79,
and during civilian President Milton Obote's 1980-85 rule.
   New Vision said Muwanga was transfered to the hospital Feb. 7
for treatment of pinched nerves and high blood pressure. An
official for the Uganda-based Africa Human Rights Organization, who
spoke on condition he not be identified, said Muwanga was in
``appalling condition'' and paralyzed on his left side.

   About 1,500 construction workers
marched through this Slovenian capital Wednesday chanting ``We want
bread!'' and ``Down with bureaucracy!'' to protest low pay and
falling living standards, witnesses said.
   The workers of the Grosuplje building enterprise stopped work on
Tuesday to demand a 50 percent wage hike and better quality of food
in their canteen, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   On Tuesday and Wednesday they marched to the republic's assembly
building, carrying Communist Party, Slovenian and Yugoslav flags, a
witness told The Associated Press.
   Yugoslavia, faced with its worst-ever economic and social
crisis, was hit last year by an unprecedented 1,570 strikes
involving more than 365,000 workers.
   Most of the strikes have been confined to factory premises, but
the Grosuplje strike marks the third major instance in three months
of worker dissatisfaction in the streets.
   On Nov. 17, about 5,000 steelworkers in Skoplje, the capital of
the southern Republic of Macedonia, protested low pay.
   On Dec. 10, some 1,500 workers of a machine-tool factory in
Ljubljana also marched to protest low wages.
   Tanjug said an average January salary at the Grosuplje
enterprise amounted to the equivalent of $280. Average salaries in
Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most developed republic, are the equivalent
of $250, significantly higher than the Yugoslav average of about
$150.
   Inflation runs at an annual rate of 170 percent and living
standards have officially fallen by at least a third since 1981.

Baroque Jewish Town Hall, the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said.
   The group visited also the World War II Jewish ghetto of Terezin

22,OOO Jews killed by the Nazis during the war. Their ashes were
cast into the nearby Ohre river by the Nazis.
   Prague rabbi Daniel Meyer said the group traveled privately to
Czechoslovakia and was not invited by any official authority. It
was the largest such group to visit Czechoslovakia since the end of
World War II.

   Leaders of white supremacist groups
discussed poisoning the water of New York and Washington to
undermine the government, a prosecutor said today in his opening
statement at the trial of 14 supremacists.
   Authorities contend the defendants sought to establish an Aryan
nation, and robbed, bombed, killed, counterfeited and committed
other crimes from July 1983 to April 1985 to reach their goal.
   Ten defendants are accused of conspiracy to overthrow the
government by force. Five are accused of a conspiracy to kill a
federal judge and an FBI agent and two are accused of transporting
across state lines money stolen from an armored truck in California
in 1984.
   The defendants have been identified by the government as members
of right-wing racist groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan and The Order.
   In his opening argument in U.S. District Court, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Steve Snyder told the all-white jury that the poisoning
scheme was discussed by defendants James Ellison and Robert Miles
on one occasion in 1983, and Ellison and Richard Butler on another.
Ellison had about 200 pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession at
that time, Snyder said.
   Miles, 63, of Cohoctah, Mich., and Butler, 69, of Hayden Lake,
Idaho, are considered two of the top three supremacist leaders. The
third, Louis Ray Beam Jr., 41, of Houston, also is on trial.
   Snyder told the jury that Beam, in a speech at a 1983 white
supremacist gathering, called for war against the government and
said, ``If you don't help me kill them ..., you're going to have to
beg for your own child's life and the answer will be `no.'''
   Snyder said Miles made a speech urging the use of robberies to
finance supremacist activities. Over the next 18 months six
robberies by supremacists netted more than $4 million, the
prosecutor said.
   The library at Butler's Church of Jesus Christ Christian (Aryan
Nations) contained books with titles like these, Snyder said: ``How
To Kill Vols. 1-6,'' ``Unconventional War,'' ``The Anarchist's
Handbook.''
   Several of the defendants are serving prison sentences and are
representing themselves, although they also have court-appointed
attorneys.
   During selection of 12 jurors and six alternates Tuesday, the
three blacks among the 64 potential jurors were eliminated through
the use of peremptory challenges, in which lawyers can strike a
limited number of people from the panel without showing cause.
   The judge declined a defense attorney's request Tuesday to ask
black prospective jurors whether they would be fair to defendants
who believe in separation of the races and in white supremacy.
   Beam is a former grand dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
in Texas. Texas authorities said Beam led a campaign of violent
intimidation of Vietnamese fishermen in the Galveston area. In a
letter obtained by government agents Beam said the United States
was under the control of a Zionist Occupation Government.
   Butler leads a church that has attracted some white
supremacists, including some who formed The Order, whose members
turned to violence to bring about the downfall of the national
government, say government investigators.
   Miles is head of the Mountain Church of Jesus Christ the Savior
at Cohoctah. A former grand dragon of the KKK in Michigan, Miles
was convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school buses in
Pontiac, Mich., then under a court order to desegregate its schools.
   Besides those three, others charged with conspiracy are Robert
Neil Smalley, 31, Fort Smith, Ark.; and six men already in prison:
David Eden Lane, 48; Bruce Carroll Pierce, 32; Ardie McBrearty, 59;
Richard Joseph Scutari, 39; Andrew Virgil Barnhill, 30; and Richard
Wayne Snell, 56.
   Snell received a death sentence for the 1983 murder of a
Texarkana, Ark., pawn shop operator and life in prison without
parole for the 1984 murder of an Arkansas state police trooper.
   Snell and four others were also charged with conspiring to
murder a federal judge and an FBI agent. The other four were
William H. Wade, 68, and his son, Ivan Ray Wade, 34, both of
Smithville, Ark.; Lambert Miller, 36, Springfield, Mo.; and David
Michael McGuire, 24, St. Louis.
   Snell, McGuire and Miller also were charged with attempting to
murder the judge and the FBI agent.
   Pierce and Lane were convicted in Denver last year of civil
rights charges stemming from the slaying of Jewish radio talk show
host Alan Berg.
   Conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a
$20,000 fine. Interfering with a federally protected right
resulting in death carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment,
as do the charges of conspiracy to murder or attempt to murder
federal officials.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli National Tourist
Bureau has canceled an advertisement it was running in Dutch
newspapers that said Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were only ``a stone's
throw'' apart, a bureau spokesman said Wednesday.
   The bureau withdrew the ad because of the ongoing unrest in the
Israeli-occupied territories, where Palestinian youths frequently
hurl rocks and other objects at troops, said spokesman Albert
Kooistra.
   The ad, which ran last week in two newspapers and in three TV
program guides, was meant to emphasize the short distances between
Israel's cities and other tourist sites, Kooistra said.
   ``The distance between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem? About a stone's
throw,'' Kooistra quoted the ad as saying.
   ``Speaking figuratively, that's true, only I think the text must
have caused something of a shock in the current context,'' he said.
   Jerusalem, another frequent venue for recent protests, and Tel
Aviv are about 37 miles apart.
   Kooistra said the bureau had received about a dozen protest
calls and letters and decided to drop the ad this week ``because of
the emotions it triggered.''
   The ad had been written in August, well before the unrest
erupted, Kooistra said.
   ``We found out too late that the slogan is unfit,'' he said.

   Scores of religious protesters converged on the
British Defense Ministry on Wednesday and daubed anti-nuclear
slogans on the building with ashes.
   Police said 57 people were arrested, mostly for criminal damage,
but Defense Ministry business was not disrupted.
   The demonstration was organized by Christian CND, an
interdenominational faction of the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, to coincide with Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent,
when ashes are put on the forehead as a sign of pentinence.
   The Rev. Paul Bayes, chairman of the group, said all 63 people
who took part in the demonstration had intended to get arrested.

<HEAD>Judge Reprimands Attorney for Comparing Demjanjuk Case to Dreyfus
Case</HEAD>

   A judge in the Nazi war crimes trial of John
Demjanjuk today reprimanded a defense attorney for comparing the
proceedings to the Dreyfus case, in which a Jewish officer in the
French army was falsely convicted of treason.
   Presiding Judge Dov Levine ordered defense attorney Paul Chumak
to retract the statement and said, ``No court in the world would
allow such unfair claims to be made.''
   Chumak refused repeatedly, but when Levine threatened to cite
him for contempt of court, both sides agreed to take the issue up
at Thursday's session.
   Chumak told the court during closing arguments that ``Capt.
(Alfred) Dreyfus was convicted at the beginning of the century on
the basis of false documents in a wave of anti-Semitism.
Paralleling this with anti-Ukrainianism, this trial has all the
earmarks of the Dreyfus trial.''
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk is accused of being ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers that killed
850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in
1942 and 1943.
   Demjanjuk, 67, a retired Ohio autoworker, claims he is a victim
of mistaken identity. He says he served in the Soviet army, was
captured by the Germans in 1941 and remained in prisoner of war
camps until 1943.
   Earlier, Chumak alleged that the Soviet secret police forged a
key piece of prosecution evidence as part of an elaborate
conspiracy to discredit the Israeli court and create a rift between
Ukrainians and Jews in the Soviet Union.
   Chumak said the KGB forged the document _ Demjanjuk's alleged
Nazi identity card _ so it could accuse the court of injustice if
Demjanjuk were convicted.
   Levine responded sharply, calling the theory ``distasteful.''
   The Soviet-supplied document is the so-called Trawniki card. The
prosecution alleged it was issued to Demjanjuk at Trawniki, a Nazi
training camp for death camp guards near Treblinka.
   Chumak also sought to discredit prosecution witness Patricia
Smith, one of several experts who testified to the authenticity of
the card.
   Ms. Smith, an anthropologist, authenticated Demjanjuk's picture
on the Trawniki card by superimposing it on video footage of the
defendant taken two years ago.
   Chumak called Ms. Smith's method an ``unexplored field'' and
said it was not accepted by the scientific community.
   The defense is to wrap up its case Thursday, and a verdict from
the three-judge panel is expected by April. If convicted, Demjanjuk
could face the death penalty.

<TEXT>
   A federal court jury began deliberations today
on whether six men and two women are members of the Westies, a gang
of thugs that allegedly terrorized Manhattan's Westside for two
decades.
   U.S. District Judge Whitman Knapp turned the case over to the
jury following last-minute instructions on how to conduct their
deliberations. The trial began last October.
   A 17-count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants
were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the
Manhattan neighborhood once known as Hell's Kitchen 20 years ago
and held sway there through a series of murders and other crimes.
   Among the crimes allegedly committed to further the Westies's
goals were eight murders, three attempted murders and five murder
plots, according to the indictment.
   The indictment also listed 10 alleged co-conspirators who had
been killed before the charges were brought in March.
   Prosecutors Mary Lee Warren and David Brodsky claimed the
Westies had dismembered some victims' bodies to enhance their
reputation and eliminate competitors.
   The government also claimed the Westies forged an alliance with
the Gambino organized crime family, said to be the nation's most
powerful, and even shot a labor leader as a favor to reputed
Gambino boss John Gotti.
   But lawyers for reputed Westies boss James Coonan and his seven
co-defendants have denied the existence of the Westies as an
organization.
   Even government witnesses have conceded the name Westies was
created by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly
Irish-American hoodlums.
   The defense also attacked the credibility of those prosecution
witnesses, admitted former gang members who turned informants in a
bid for leniency. Coonan's attorney, Gerald Shargel, claimed all
were unreliable because they were criminals seeking to cut a deal
with the government.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis today
pointed their campaigns southward after decisive New Hampshire
victories, and Bob Dole promised to counterattack unless the vice
president stops ``distorting the Dole record.'' Bush denied he had
done anything wrong.
   Richard Gephardt, who finished second to Dukakis, said he was in
the race to stay. However, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, third among
Democrats in New Hampshire after finishing second in Iowa, said he
will have to drop out unless he can win next week in either South
Dakota or Minnesota. Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt said he had
``a divided mind'' about whether to continue but that Jesse Jackson
had already asked for his support if he should drop out.
   Dole, the big Republican winner in Iowa last week, said Bush's
comeback victory in New Hampshire was at least partly due to Bush
TV commercials that Dole said distorted his record.
   ``I'm going to try to go out and straighten it out,'' he said at
the Manchester, N.H., airport before flying back to Washington.
``I'm not going to run from it. I'm not known for running from a
fight.''
   Bush, who returned to Washington Tuesday night, was reluctant to
talk about Dole's accusation. However, when questioned during a
brief exchange with reporters today, he replied, ``I think I said
it wasn't true, but I'll be glad to say that.''
   ``You all want me to talk about Sen. Dole. I want to talk about
the issues,'' Bush said. ``I'm not going to dwell on it, you see, I
don't want to be drawn into something like that.''
   Bush added, ``People in New Hampshire like clean campaigns, and
they endorsed me overwhelmingly.''
   Tuesday night, Dole had accused Bush of ``lying about my
record.''
   Bush, asked about that in an interview taped for CBS-TV today,
said, ``I'm sorry he feels that way.''
   Were you lying? Bush was asked.
   ``No,'' he answered quietly.
   Bush won 38 percent of the Republican vote _ and 11 delegates to
the GOP convention _ in complete returns. Dole had 29 percent of
the vote and seven delegates. They were followed by Rep. Jack Kemp
of New York, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and former
television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Dukakis lived up to expectations by carrying his neighboring
state by 16 percentage points over Rep. Gephardt of Missouri, last
week's winner in Iowa.
   The turnout was a record _ 154,012 Republican voters and 119,041
Democrats for a total of 273,053 compared with 261,243 in 1980.
This year's figure was estimated to represent a bit less than half
the state's registered voters.
   In other comments today:
   _Dukakis, who won by a big margin in a state bordering
Massachusetts where he is the governor, said on ABC-TV that he can
also do well in the South, which dominates the Super Tuesday
primaries on March 8. ``People in the South aren't voting for a ZIP
code; they're voting for the president of the United States,'' he
said.
   _Simon said on NBC-TV he would have to win next week,
``otherwise, I'm going to have to withdraw. ... You just can't
continue to run second and third.''
   _Gephardt said on ABC that whoever remains in the race, he
himself will ``do well because we're connecting with the voters on
my ideas.''
   _Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who beat out former television
evangelist Pat Robertson and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont for
third place among the Republicans, said his showing proved his
standing among the conservatives who form the base for himself, du
Pont and Robertson.
   _Robertson, on the other hand, said, ``This was a small spread
between Jack and me.'' He added, ``New England is not my natural
constituency. ... Going into the South, it's a different ball
game.''
   ``On to the South, where we're going to rise again,'' exclaimed
a euphoric Bush late Tuesday night. He won a solid victory after
seeing his earlier 20-point lead in the polls melt in New Hampshire
after his embarrassing third-place finish in Iowa behind Dole and
Robertson.
   For all the attention they got, Granite State voters managed to
keep the presidential races in both parties in turmoil, offering
just enough support to also-rans to give them an excuse to struggle
on toward Super Tuesday, with its enormous 20-state risks and
rewards.
   Among the Republicans, Kemp finished third with 13 percent, and
three delegates. Du Pont edged out Robertson, 10 percent to 9
percent. Du Pont's total was high enough to win two delegates;
Robertson got none.
   In the delegate totals, after Bush's 61 came Dole with 42, Kemp
with 35 and du Pont with two. The winning Republican needs 1,139
delegates.
   Among the Democrats, after Dukakis, with 36 percent of the vote
and nine delegates, came Gephardt with 20 percent and six delegates
and Simon with 17 percent and three delegates.
   The other Democratic finishers _ Jackson with 8 percent, Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. 7 percent, Babbitt 5 percent and Gary Hart 4
percent _ didn't do well enough to pick up any delegates.
   In the delegate totals, after Dukakis' 44.5 came Gephardt with
39 and Simon with 33. The victorious Democrat needs 2,082 delegates
for the nomination.
   Though he got no delegates, Jackson said he was ``happy because
in Iowa and New Hampshire we proved we could broaden our base.''
Asked how he expected to do in the South, he said, ``I expect to
win.''
   Bush was exultant at his showing. Quoting Mark Twain, he said,
``Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.''
   Dukakis belittled Gore's regional strategy.
   ``Tomorrow, we head South,'' said the Massachusetts governor.
``I don't have a Southern strategy,'' he said. ``I don't have a
Northern strategy or a Western strategy. I have an American
strategy.''
   Six states will vote before Super Tuesday, but it was clear
Tuesday night that the campaigns were looking ahead to March 8 when
20 states on the Democratic side and 16 on the Republican will
offer the biggest one-day delegate prize of the campaign.
   Minnesota and South Dakota take the spotlight next. Republicans
and Democrats hold caucuses in Minnesota and primaries in South
Dakota next Tuesday.
   In the New Hampshire Democratic primary, Gephardt and Simon,
fighting for Democratic runner-up, were also in a battle for money.
Both campaigns are in financial trouble and needed a second-place
finish to keep contributions coming in.
   With a first in Iowa and a second in New Hampshire, Gephardt was
able to claim, ``I'm in good shape.''
   South Carolina's Republican primary is Saturday, March 5, three
days before Super Tuesday.
   Gore, the Tennessee senator who passed up Iowa and spent less
time than his rivals in New Hampshire, watched the returns from
Houston, Texas, where he said ``Super Tuesday changes all the
rules. It's a completely new ballgame.''

   Vice President George Bush said today he will
take ``nothing for granted'' as turns his attention to the South
after his victory over chief rival Bob Dole in New Hampshire's
Republican presidential primary.
   Bush, thanking campaign workers at his national headquarters
here, also denied that he had distorted Dole's record in the waning
days of the New Hampshire campaign _ as Dole had charged Tuesday
night. ``I think I said it wasn't true, but I'll be glad to say
that,'' he told reporters.
   After spending today in Washington, Bush heads Thursday to South
Carolina, Missouri and Texas, three states among 20 that are
holding presidential contests on Super Tuesday, March 8.
   The vice president's strong New Hampshire showing Tuesday
followed his third place finish in Iowa, behind Dole and Pat
Robertson.
   Bush today steadfastly refused to discuss Dole's charge that the
vice president had made false statements about the Kansas senator's
record on such issues as the budget deficit and taxes.
   ``You all want me to talk about Sen. Dole. I want to talk about
the issues,'' Bush said. ``You want to talk about history. I want
to talk about the future. ...
   ``I'm not going to dwell on it, you see, I don't want to be
drawn into something like that,'' the vice president said.
   Bush added, ``People in New Hampshire like clean campaigns, and
they endorsed me overwhelmingly.''
   ``The system worked. You can take them in the chin, you can get
up and you can fight again,'' he said. ``So now, go on to Super
Tuesday. We're going to fight hard. We're going to take nothing for
granted. We're going to take a positive message _ a message that
was good in New Hampshire and is just as good (elsewhere).''
   ``We're moving into a new dimension now,'' said Lee Atwater,
Bush's national campaign manager. ``The next big contest is Super
Tuesday. Seventy percent of the delegates you need to get the
nomination are going to be chosen that one night.''
   Atwater said that whoever walks out of the Super Tuesday
contests with the lion's share of the delegates will win the
Republican nomination.
   ``George Bush has got a 3-1 lead on delegates now,'' Atwater
said. ``He's going to keep a 3-1 lead in delegates.''
   Bush told several hundred supporters jammed into a hotel
ballroom that ``you haven't chosen a man, you've chosen a course,
to expand our prosperity, to see that it touches every hamlet.''
   ``You've chosen to back a strong America, an America strong
enough to bring peace to the entire world,'' he added.
   Bush said things had dramatically turned around in the last two
days of the campaign and that he did a better job in getting his
message out. He also flew in a conservative hero, former Sen. Barry
Goldwater of Arizona, to help him gain votes.
   ``Elections hinge on two things, the candidates and the
issues,'' said Atwater. ``We had the best candidate. We had the
only candidate talking about issues. This leaves Dole as a loser
here, but I certainly wouldn't get overconfident. We've got a long
campaign ahead of us.''

   Michael Douglas watched today's televised
Oscar nominations announcement from his den, actress Holly Hunter
slept through the broadcast, and writer Tony Huston and director
Steven Spielberg weren't talking.
   Actress Olympia Dukakis' reaction to her ``Moonstruck''
nomination was captured by TV cameras and ``Broadcast News''
writer-director James Brooks was dressing in a Berlin hotel when he
learned of the film's seven nominations.
   Nominees were announced at dawn in Beverly Hills by actress
Shirley MacLaine and Robert Wise, president of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The timing is designed for live
East Coast network coverage.
   Many of the nominees watched the TV anouncement, while others
were notified by publicists.
   Huston was awakened at his Beverly Hills home by publicist
Sheila Barr and told about his best screenplay nomination for ``The
Dead.'' His father, director John Huston, died last year.
   Tony Huston recalled his late father's advice years ago to
another Oscar nominee who didn't know what to say to reporters
about the nomination. The senior Huston said: ``Don't say _
listen.''
   ``Tony said he's gotten this far collaborating with Dad, and he
thinks now he should take heed of his advice,'' said Miss Barr.
   Once again, the Academy snubbed Spielberg as director, although
his ``Empire of the Sun'' earned six nominations.
   Spielberg was out of town, unavailable and presumably ``has no
reaction,'' said Chris Kelly, his spokeswoman at Amblin Productions.
   The moment wasn't private for Miss Dukakis, nominated as
best-supporting actress in ``Moonstruck.'' About 30 people,
including an ``Entertainment Tonight'' TV crew, were in her
Montclair, N.J., home to monitor her reaction.
   The cousin of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who won the
Democratic New Hampshire primary hours earlier, said she was
grateful, then added: ``Like my cousin, I'm in the running and now
I'm waiting for `Super Monday' in April.''
   ``Broadcast News'' writer-director Brooks was at the Berlin Film
Festival and was told of the seven nominations in a telephone call
from publicist Pat Kingsley. Brooks also was overlooked in the
director category.
   ``He was quite thrilled with seven nominations. Yes, I'm sure he
was somewaht disappointed about not getting that (nomination for
best director),'' she said.
   The publicist said nominees actor Albert Brooks and Miss Hunter
still were asleep an hour after their nominations were announced.
   Douglas, best actor nominee for ``Wall Street,'' sat in the den
of his New York apartment to watch the announcement of his first
acting nomination on television.
   ``I watched this morning and I looked at the names and
photographs of my fellow nominees and it made me not only proud for
our film `Wall Street' but it reminded me what a wonderful part
(writer-director) Oliver Stone had created,'' Douglas said.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Glenn Close, nominated for her role as a
vengeful, psychotic woman in ``Fatal Attraction,'' which she said
``represents the work of an extraordinary team of people.''
   Miss Close was at her New York country home when informed about
her nomination by telephone from friends.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers

   Feb. 10
   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel on Navy mothers:
   Call it outmoded thinking if you will, but we find it disturbing
that a large percentage of women in the U.S. Navy who have babies
are unmarried.
   Of 789 active-duty women who used the San Diego Naval Hospital
for childbirth from July 1986 through May 1987, 323 were unmarried.
Of the latter, 69 percent elected to stay in the Navy.
   A four-out-of-10 illegitimacy rate may not be considered
astonishing for some, but the Navy surely ought to hew to a higher
standard.
   This also is more than a moral issue. Pentagon officials ought
to wonder what effect this situation might have on national
security. Unwed pregnant sailors and mothers surely have more on
their minds than defense of the nation.

   Hannibal (Mo.) Courier-Post on the court ruling against the
Army's ban on homosexuals:
   The court has the power and the authority _ at least until the
ruling is appealed or overturned _ to direct the armed forces to
admit homosexuals.
   But the court would be hard-pressed to enforce compliance with
the spirit as well as the letter of the law.
   It's far too early to tell how the court ruling will affect the
armed forces.
   But we can say with reasonable certainty that if the armed
forces do not want homosexuals, they will find ways of forcing them
out, court order or no court order. ...
   The great majority of Americans still regard homosexuality with
contempt, and it takes more than a judicial order to change
attitudes.

   The Orange County (Calif.) Register on Postal Service cutbacks:
   In most businesses, if one company announces it will shorten
hours and cut back service, its competitors leap into action,
trying to win over dissatisfied customers.
   Not so in the mail biz, a legally protected monopoly for the
U.S. Postal Service. Who loses? The letter writers, as usual.
   With the Postal Service starting ... to cut back hours and
eliminate Saturday window service and Sunday mail pick-ups, the
time is right for Congress to allow some semblance of competition
for mail delivery. ...
   The latest cutbacks in service are being blamed on budget cuts.
Congress in December trimmed $1.25 billion from the Postal
Service's appropriation for 1988 and 1989.
   The Postal Service, which should not be dependent on the
taxpayers at all, is woefully unprepared for that reality.
   Forcing post office officials to sink or swim in competitive
waters is the surest way to reform an otherwise highly inefficient
monopoly.

   Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan:
   Officials in Washington are treating as ``a positive step'' the
announcement of a tentative timetable for withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan. It is, and they should.
   Ever since he came to power in 1985, Soviet party boss Mikhail
Gorbachev has been sending signals that he would like to end his
nation's bloody and unsuccessful attempt to impose a puppet
government on the Afghans.
   What makes the most recent statement important is that it
contains dates: full withdrawal over a 10-month period beginning
May 15.
   The mood in Washington was that while the administration would
prefer to see all Soviet troops withdrawn by the end of the year,
it should not throw up any roadblocks.
   That is a sound decision.

   The Asbury Park (N.J.) Press on Pat Robertson:
   (Pat) Robertson has a long road ahead of him. The dual nature of
his background and candidacy can never be overlooked.
   And while skeptics call him ``a preacher in politician's
clothing,'' his career suggests that he may be more like ``a
politican in preacher's clothing.''
   Robertson's real challenge is to convince the mass of voters who
are not Christian fundamentalists that he would not allow his
religious views to interfere with affairs of state, while at the
same time holding on to his ``invisible army.''
   But is America ready for a president with a ``pipeline'' to God,
as Robertson boasts? Perhaps it is.
   Ronald Reagan proved there's political capital to be mined on
the religious right. And, like the president, Robertson does have a
way with TV cameras.

   The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash., on Kurt Waldheim:
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim hopes to wipe away the past and
trust that the world will forgive and forget his part in the dark
history of World War II Germany.
   His reasoning is threadbare: that everyone who served in the war
knew what was happening _ the deportations, mass murders, torture;
that he merely followed, rather than gave, orders.
   ``To deduce that knowledge constitutes some kind of crime is
simply not correct,'' Waldheim claims.
   And he is right. But while not a crime, that knowledge coupled
with his failure to act against those atrocities is a moral outrage.
   After a five-month investigation, an international panel of six
historians decided to put aside a conclusion on Waldheim's moral
responsibility for war crimes he had knowledge of as a lieutenant
in the German army from 1942 to 1945; instead, the historians let
the facts speak for themselves, with the world and history to pass
judgment.
   The facts speak loudly, but Waldheim's lies cry out. If his past
is not something of which he is ashamed and afraid, why is he
weaving such a web of deceit? ...
   If Waldheim has his way, the chapter on his involvement in World
War II atrocities is closed now. He says he will not step down as
Austria's president _ and he shouldn't have to.
   Austria ought to pull the rug out from under him.

   The Oregonian, Portland, Ore., on presidential candidates and

   It has been popular for presidential candidates to go into Iowa,
heart of the Corn Belt and a state heavily damaged by the farm
recession, and advocate greater use of ethanol. ...
   What happens to ethanol after Iowa? The Pacific Northwest and
all other grain-growing regions have a stake in the answer because
of the wisdom of finding uses for grain now grown in excess. ...
   (The issue) ought to continue to have attention in New
Hampshire, Super Tuesday, the nominating conventions, next fall's
debates, and the inaugural address in January.
   Ethanol is not just an Iowa issue.

   Lewiston (Maine) Daily Sun on privatization of the Postal
Service:
   The push is on for privatizing the U.S. Postal Service. Every
time the Postal Service requests a hike in the price of stamps,
privatization proponents crawl out of the woodwork with renewed
vigor. ...
   Sure the current operation has its drawbacks and the service is
slow and unreliable at times. The post office is a traditional
favorite whipping boy for people carrying a grudge. ...
   Despite several well publicized success stories of the public
sector saving money, there are obvious limitations to privatization
and the contracting out of public services.
   Some examples of gross abuse have occurred with defense
contractors, construction projects and in the health care industry
as well.
   Moreover, removing essential services such as the mail delivery
from the public sector could decrease accountability.
   With an annual budget of more than $30 billion, the U.S. Postal
Service affects much of the nation's business and is crucial to the
economy as a whole. ...
   Free enterprise is great when applied correctly. But it is not a
panacea to provide the answers to all siutuations.

   Port Arthur (Texas) News on U.S.-Soviet relations in the Bering
Sea:
   It's still not clear whether Soviet military personnel have been
sneaking on to St. Lawrence Island, a desolate chunk of U.S. soil
in the Bering Sea, but the possibility of these surreptitious
visits cannot be discounted either.
   St. Lawrence Island is about 50 miles off the coast of mainland
Alaska, but it's only 37 miles off the mainland of the Soviet Union.
   It is inhabited by 650 Eskimos, and recently some islanders have
been finding Soviet-made items on the island such as beer cans,
batteries, a gas mask, buoys with explosive charges, pieces of
Soviet uniforms, etc.
   Island residents also report seeing mysterious strangers _ some
clad in wet suits and scuba gear _ who run off when encountered.
   The ``official'' Pentagon response is that the material is
flotsam and jetsam washed ashore by ocean currents, but that
doesn't explain how some of it was found far inland or why it
included items which don't float, such as batteries.
   The Reagan administration should send a firm note to the Soviet
Union stating that such adventures _ if they are occurring _ should
cease immediately.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on Paraguay's election:
   What do you do if you hold an election and nobody participates _
nobody, that is, but the person in power and a couple of toadies?
   What you do is proclaim a Great Victory afterwards, and say how
democratic you are for letting people vote like that.
   This is what happened in Paraguay on Sunday (Feb. 14) when
dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner swept to an eighth five-year term
as president by a margin of more than 88 percent.
   The free nations of the hemisphere should react to Sunday's
fraudulent vote by declaring it to be just that, and by reaching
out _ as the United States already has done _ to the democratic
opposition.
   It is there that Paraguay's future lies, not with an aged
dictator so unsure of his own rule and so fearful of dissent that
he must fix his periodic re-election.

   The Woonsocket (R.I.) Call on the Iowa caucuses:
   It's remarkable that over 3,000 newsmen and women spent hundreds
of thousands of hours covering the Iowa caucus and ended up shocked
and surprised when Pat Robertson received substantially more
support than Vice President Groege Bush. How can that be? ...
   If there is a lesson in all of this, it may be that Robertson
actually talked in detail about programs to deal with America's
problems while other candidates merely said they were capable of
waving magic wands. We don't think voters believe in magic wands
anymore.
   Perhaps others will now be forced to spell out their programs.
That would be refreshing. We would like to know, for example, how
they will solve the deficit question, what they will do about the
foreign trade imbalance, how they will guarantee continued health
for social security. ...
   Win or lose, Robertson may have forced this kind of approach on
all candidates. If so, we owe him a considerable debt of gratitude.

   The Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on South Dakota's Feb. 23
primary:
   Any one of several candidates would make a good nominee, but we
believe Michael Dukakis would be the best candidate for the
Democratic Party.
   Dukakis lacks national experience, but he is an intelligent,
pragmatic and forceful governor. He has effectively presided over
Massachusetts' good economic fortune. He is the top Democratic
candidate.
   We believe the Republican race comes down to Bob Dole and George
Bush. As we compare the two, however, there is one key difference:
leadership potential.
   In that regard, Dole stands out. We believe Dole would be the
best nominee for the Republican Party. He has government
experience, leadership ability and a broad understanding of rural
America and the rest of the nation.

   Determined never to play a ``nice girl'' again,
Mary Tyler Moore says her new television series ``will be a more
reality-based comedy.''
   The actress, who's still trying to put the perky Mary Richards
character from her ``Mary Tyler Moore Show'' days behind her,
begins shooting a new half-hour comedy-drama next month that will
air on CBS in the fall.
   Ms. Moore, 50, promises the new show, in which she plays a
divorcee who inherits two children with a new marriage, will fare
better than her short-lived comeback series, ``Mary,'' in 1986.
   ``I didn't like that show at all,'' she says in the March issue
of Ladies' Home Journal. ``It wasn't fun, it wasn't believable.''
   Still, she says she doesn't understand the vengeance with which
critics attacked the show. ``It was like drop-kicking a puppy,''
she said.

   Director John Waters' new film is hair curling,

   ``Hairspray'' had its premiere Tuesday night at the Senator

capital of the world.''
   Film star Divine and singer Ric Ocasek of the Cars were on hand
as 900 people paid $25 for the screening and the Hairhopper Ball at
the Baltimore Museum of Art. Approximately $15,000 was raised to
benefit the organization AIDS Action Baltimore.
   ``Hairspray,'' filmed in Baltimore last summer, tells the story

   Rugs, furniture and clothes from a Manhattan

gawkers and bidders alike.
   ``This is basically the dregs of the apartment,'' said
Christie's East Assistant Vice President Linda Waters of the gowns,
paintings and assorted bric-a-brac that were sold.
   Among the most popular items, not surprisingly, were shoes owned
by Marcos' wife, Imelda, whose footwear fixation was
well-publicized in the days following the fall of the Marcos regime.
   Virginia Bell, who came to Tuesday's auction from Martin's

shoes to add to her collection of 600 pairs.
   ``I'm the Imelda Marcos of Martin's River,'' said Mrs. Bell, who
paid from $60 to $90 for each size 9AA pair.
   The items, including lime-green satin pillows and purple quartz
bookends, were left in the seven-bedroom Fifth Avenue apartment.
Proceeds of the sale, part of more than $1.2 million in Marcos
property Christie's has sold in the past year, will go toward land

   The residents of this western
Massachusetts community will have a say in whether actress Jane
Fonda should be welcomed or shunned if she comes to town to film
scenes for a new movie.
   Chicopee aldermen agreed Tuesday night to hold a public hearing
on the issue at a date to be set later.
   Under consideration by the aldermen is a proposed resolution
saying that Ms. Fonda, who became controversial for her outspoken
statements and actions during the Vietnam War, would not be welcome
in Chicopee. Aldermen in Holyoke passed a similar resolution, 11-4,
two weeks ago.
   ``She has all the right in the world to come to Chicopee. But I
do believe the veterans have a constitutional right to protest her
visit,'' said Mayor Joseph H. Chessey Jr.
   Chicopee and Holyoke have been chosen as backdrop for a few
scenes in the movie ``Union Street'' because of their 19th-century
mills and canals. Fonda will play a woman who teaches a struggling
mill worker to read.
   Most of the film is to be shot in Waterbury, Conn.

   A man fired from a defense plant for
harassing women stalked the company for six hours, fatally shooting
seven people and wounding four others as terrified employees hid
under desks and in offices until he surrendered, authorities said.
   Among the injured was a woman who spurned his attentions, police
said.
   Richard Wade Farley, 39, of nearby San Jose walked from the
sprawling two-story ESL Corp. building about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday with
his hands in the air. He was quickly surrounded by three officers
and taken to the Santa Clara County Jail.
   ``I'm not crazy _ I know I will die as a result of this,'' the
chief negotiator, Sunnyvale Public Safety Lt. Rueben Grijalva,
quoted the gunman as saying before the surrender.
   Daryl Anderson, an ESL business analyst, said she was in her
second-floor office about 2:30 p.m. when the gunman came down the
hall firing shots. She said bullets punctured her office door.
   ``I was under my desk in the fetal position for six hours,'' she
said. ``I figured there was a sniper in the building. The worst
part of all was being there all by myself in the dark. All the time
I thought he was right out there in the hall.''
   The bodies of two women and five men were found when police
swept through the Silicon Valley building after the arrest, said
Commander Alex Michaelis of the Sunnyvale Department of Public
Safety.
   After the incident, police said five people were wounded. But
this morning, Lt. Tom Moore reduced the number of injured to four,
adding he could not immediately explain the discrepancy.
   Police seized a rifle, a shotgun, 9mm and .380-caliber handguns
and two bandoliers of ammunition after the gunman left his hiding
place in a second-floor room.
   Grijalva said Farley told him he invaded the building to wreck
equipment.
   ESL, or Electro-Magnetic Systems Laboratories, a subsidiary of
TRW Inc., was established in 1964 and specializes in electronic
warfare systems for the Navy, most of them highly classified.
Products include reconnaissance systems, data-communications
systems, computer simulation and image processing. It employs about
2,200 people.
   Police said the gunman took no hostages, but that many employees
had to hide under desks or in locked rooms.
   On the second floor, the gunman met the woman who had spurned
him, 26-year-old engineer Laura Black. When she slammed an office
door in his face, he shot her through the door, Grijalva said. He
said Farley told police he shot the others because ``he felt
threatened by them.''
   At one point, Farley began crying when talking about his mother,
the lieutenant said.
   Black was wounded in the shoulder, police said. She was listed
in stable condition at Stanford University Medical Center after
surgery.
   Farley had worked at ESL as a computer software technician
before he was fired two years ago after complaints that he sexually
harassed Black and other female employees, said Jean Tuffley, of
the company's personnel department.
   Farley, who lived by himself in a dilapidated bungalow,
allegedly followed Black over four years, and Black had tried to
obtain a restraining order to keep him away, Moore said.
   ``It was described to me as a situation that had turned into
harassment. He had, according to him, given her a warning (to
return his attentions) and she didn't heed the warning and he said
this was his way of making a point,'' said Capt. Al Scott.
   Near the ESL building, which is about 40 miles south of San
Francisco, police found a motor home they believe was driven by the
gunman. Inside, officers found ammunition, full cans of gasoline
and other explosive material, said Scott.
   At one point during the negotiations, the gunman ``expressed a
little remorse'' for his actions, said Moore.
   It was not clear how many of his victims the gunman knew.
   One of those killed was identified by company officials as
Lawrence J. Kane of San Jose. The rest were not identified this
morning.
   Authorities today identified the injured, in addition to Black,
as: Richard Townsley, 44, in stable condition with a gunshot wound
to the chest; Greg Scott, 39, in good condition with gunshot wounds
to the forehead and body; and Pattie Marcotte, 41, was in surgery
this morning to repair a broken elbow suffered as she fled.

   Leftist guerrillas launched
simultaneous attacks at dawn today on army bases in the eastern
part of the country and claimed to have killed or wounded scores of
government troops.
   But Armed Forces chief Gen. Adolfo Blandon told reporters in the
eastern city of Usulutan that six army troops, two guerrillas and
six civilians were killed during the attack.
   The strikes, the largest guerrilla action in nearly a year,
occurred only hours before the foreign ministers of the five
Central American nations met in San Salvador to evaluate
implementation of a regional peace plan.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN, attacked the 6th Infantry Brigade base in Usulutan, 68 miles
southeast of San Salvador, the clandestine rebel Radio Venceremos
said.
   It claimed the rebels inflicted 190 casualties, but did not
break down the dead and injured.
   Army helicopters combed the area in search of the guerrillas,
and more than a dozen houses near the base were totally or
partially destroyed, Blandon said.
   A police spokesman in Usulutan said that a family of five,
including three children, was killed when their house was destroyed
during the rebel strike.
   The coordinated attacks were the largest in scale since the FMLN
attacked the 4th Infantry Brigade in the northern province of
Chalatenango last March 31, causing 70 deaths, including that of a
U.S. military adviser, and more than 100 wounded.
   Radio Venceremos said another 25 army troops were killed or
wounded today in other dawn attacks in the eastern provinces of San
Miguel and Morazan. Guerrillas destroyed a cotton cooperative, 70
utility poles, one electrical substation, two bridges and a
telephone transmission station, rebel and police reports said..
   Dubbed,``Death to the Killers of Herbert Anaya Sanabria,''
today's operation launched a new rebel offenbsive to disrupt
legislative and municipal elections slated for March 20, the
broadcast said.
   Anaya was coordinator of the independent Salvadoran Human Rights
Commission when he was gunned down Oct. 26.
   Rebel-aligned political parties have boycotted previous
elections, saying the security of their prospective candidates
could not be guarateed.
   The FMLN warned last month it would not permit elections in
areas under its control or in dispute.
   The regional peace plan, signed by the presidents of El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica, calls for
cease-fires, democratic reforms and an end to aid to insurgencies
in Central America.

   The New Hampshire primary was a great
triumph for two disparate groups, the Republican establishment and
lovers of political chaos.
   George Bush, the quintessential establishment candidate, emerged
from the ashes of Iowa to regain the mantle of Republican
front-runner but his victory brightened the hopes of those who
cherish rousing political brawls and hope for at least one this
year that goes all the way to the convention floor.
   Of course it is the Democrats, with their looser rules and lack
of a clear leader, who really provide hope for an open convention.
Michael Dukakis' triumph put him temporarily atop the Democratic
field, but none of the seven candidates has demonstrated national
appeal.
   And so it's ``On to the South.'' The candidates are all taking
dead aim on the March 8 election day when most of the South and
some key states outside will select enough delegates to settle the
races in both parties.
   But don't bet on a Super Tuesday resolution. The big stakes _
1,307 Democratic delegates in 20 states and 700 Republican in 16
states may only confuse the contests rather than settle them.
   You have to like Bush's chances, but both parties offer
scenarios that argue for long hard fights.
   Two Democrats without obvious appeal in Dixie _ Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Dukakis _ split the two early events and
now are confronted by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Jesse
Jackson on their own turf.
   Jackson finished fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire, solid
showings in two states which have very few minority voters who
provide his base of support. There is no reason to think that any
of the other Democrats can compete with Jackson for the large black
vote in the South.
   As a Tennessean who has positioned himself to the right of the
rest of the Democratic field, Gore has run a Super Tuesday strategy
that will test a generation-old political assumption _ that you
can't win the nomination without competing in the early events.
   ``I think Super Tuesday changes all the rules,'' said Gore.
``It's a completely new ball game.''
   It's a dicey strategy, but even if it falls short Gore may get
enough support on March 8 to establish his candidacy and perhaps
leave Jackson as the biggest winner of delegates that day.
   Then it would be on to the Midwest for four Democrats _ Jackson,
Dukakis, Gephardt and Gore.
   That prospect would delight Republicans. But they could be in a
muddle of their own.
   If the Southern contest were Bush versus Sen. Bob Dole, the
outcome would appear tilted in favor of the vice president, who has
a strong organization throughout the region, a strong
identification with President Reagan, and roots in the biggest plum
of all, Texas.
   But it won't be a two-man fight for the Republicans; Rep. Jack
Kemp lives to fight on in the South and Pat Robertson will be
battling on his home turf.
   Bush and Dole are battling for the same voters, while Robertson
has a constituency all his own, many of them people activated
politically by a desire to support the former evangelist.
   Republican rules make it almost impossible for the presidential
race to go all the way to the convention in New Orleans next
August. Chances are better that two candidates _ or maybe even
three _ will fight for the 175 delegates at stake in California's
winner-take-all Republican primary on June 7. But if there are
three Republicans battling for that delegation, the field may be so
split that even a California win would not put someone over the top.
   All in all, it's a volatile mix on both sides. On the morning
after New Hampshire, a good bet is that Super Tuesday will settle
nothing _ certainly among the Democrats _ and the cry that night
will be, ``On to California, by way of Illinois, New York...''

   Pope John Paul II celebrated an Ash Wednesday Mass
in a 5th century church on Rome's Aventine Hill overlooking the
city.
   During the two-hour ceremony marking the beginning of Lent, the
45-day period leading up to Easter, the pontiff recalled the
phrase, ``We are ashes,'' as he urged listeners to remember their
mortality.
   As he led a procession to the church of Saint Sabina, the late
afternoon sun, unseasonably warm for mid-February, brightened the
touches of gold in his vestments and those of accompanying clergy.
   Under the muted half-light that entered the church through the
filigree-traced windows, the pontiff smudged a mixture of ash and
holy water on the foreheads of cardinals. Other clergy administered
to the crowds of people who surged forward to receive the
benediction.
   The period of Lent, observed by fasting and penitence,
commemorates Jesus' fasting in the desert.

<HEAD>Party Heads Support More Money for Presidential Transitions</HEAD>

   The chiefs of the Republican and Democratic
national parties told Congress Wednesday that they support
increasing the amount of federal money spent on presidential
transitions.
   The bill would increase to $3.5 million the government
assistance that goes to a president-elect to begin making
arrangements for a new administration. The original 1963 law
provided $900,000, which was increased to $2 million in 1976.
Advocates have complained that 12 years of inflation have made that
insufficient.
   ``The scope and complexity of activity required for an efficient
transition has increased significantly over the years,'' Paul Kirk,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.
   He said new presidents must immediately begin filling more than
3,000 executive appointments and preparing a federal budget for
presentation to Congress within three months.
   Under the legislation, the federal money would go to the major
parties, which would be reimbursed for transition tasks they
perform. Both party leaders voiced approval of this mechanism.
   Frank Fahrenkopf, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said the national parties have the facilities and equipment to do
transition work efficiently, and that the job would ``reinforce
their traditional role of providing personnel and support for their
candidates.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the committee, said that
even if the financing increase is approved, the money provided
might still be too low.
   ``I wish we could say it will cover this thing,'' he said. ``I
doubt that it will.''
   The legislation would require public disclosure of the sources
and use of privately donated transition money, and provide for
reimbursement to each political party of up to $200,000 for
transition work performed before the general election.

   Former Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban met
today with Secretary of State George P. Shultz to discuss a new
U.S. initiative for Mideast peace talks, but cautioned against
expecting too much from the American mediation effort.
   Eban told reporters after his 30-minute meeting with Shultz that
``one must not see too distant horizons'' for the plan Shultz is
taking to Israeli, Jordanian and Egyptian leaders later this month.
   Eban, an ally of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, said he hoped
Shultz can overcome reservations expressed by Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir about the U.S. plan.
   Shamir is concerned that the proposals, which reportedly call
for talks to begin in April between Israel and its Arab neighbors
on Palestinian autonomy, will force Israel to cede land to the
Arabs.
   The U.S. plan, which has not been made public, envisions that
negotiations on a final settlement for the territories that Israel
captured in the 1967 Middle East war would begin in December.
   The Reagan administration ``is trying to set the basis for
continued efforts'' by the next administration to advance the
Arab-Israeli talks, Eban said.
   As part of his efforts to obtain continuity and congressional
approval for his ideas, Shultz will be meeting later in the day
with members of the Senate. He held a similar meeting Tuesday night
with some 25 members of the House to outline his views.
   Shultz's activity came in response to two months of
Israeli-Palestinian violence in which at least 53 Palestinians have
been killed.
   Eban, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington and head of the
Israeli parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee, follows
on the heels of Ehud Olmert, another parliament member, who met
with Shultz on Sunday. Olmert is a close, trusted friend of Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who faces opposition from Shimon
Peres in the fractious coalition government.
   Olmert told Shultz that Shamir was concerned over the U.S.
proposal to set December as the date for talks on the future of the
occupied territories. Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc,
is concerned that such talks would lead to demands for land
concessions to the Arabs.
   Likud is opposed to giving back any of the captured territories,
which it views as a biblical heritage and a strategic buffer zone
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Peres' Labor Party is
willing to relinquish some land for peace and supports an
international conference to sponsor peace talks.
   Egypt and Jordan said Monday the United States should not
advance interim solutions to the Palestinian problem.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said ``we have taken the
position that any plan must clearly include: first, an overall
settlement of the problem and, second, an international conference
as a framework without any attempt to outflank it.''
   Prime Minister Zaid Rifai of Jordan, who met in Cairo on Monday
with Mubarak, said that Jordan opposed ``partial solutions or
projects for self-rule'' in the West Bank and Gaza. Jordan wants a
final settlement through an international conference, he added.
   Rifai reiterated Jordan's demand for a United Nations-sponsored
international conference with the participation of the Security
Council's five permanent members and all concerned parties,
including the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shultz will visit Israel, Jordan and Egypt starting about Feb.
25, some 24 hours after returning to Washington from meetings in
Moscow.
   While in Moscow, Shultz is expected to sound out the Soviets on
their position regarding Mideast peace talks.
   Privately, Israeli officials have suggested Shultz might suggest
to his counterpart Edouard Shevardnadze that the United States
would do all it can to ease a Soviet pullout from Afghanistan, in
return for which the Kremlin would ensure the support of its Arab
allies in the Mideast for Shultz's plan.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Bill To Provide Health Coverage to Uninsured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
on Wednesday approved a controversial bill that would require
employers to provide health coverage to more than 20 million
uninsured people.
   The 10-6 vote came after nearly two hours of discussion ranging
from denunciations of the insurance industry to a spirited debate
over socialism and senators' own health coverage.
   Nevertheless, when it was all over, Sen. Edward Kennedy, the
committee chairman, was pleased.
   ``We've got a very positive attitude here,'' he said. ``The
health issue's on the national agenda. ... It's going to be
difficult for people to oppose this program.''
   The so-called ``minimum health'' bill sponsored by Kennedy,
D-Mass., would require employers to offer a minimum package that
includes hospital care, doctor care, diagnostic and screening
tests, pre-natal and well-baby care, and limited mental health
treatment. The policies would cap out-of-pocket catastrophic costs
at $3,000.
   Coverage would have to be offered to employees working 17.5
hours a week or more, and their dependents. Small family farms
would be temporarily exempted from coverage requirements.
   New businesses would be able to phase in coverage over two
years. And, under an amendment adopted Wednesday, firms of five or
fewer people would have five years to phase in benefits.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cover
up to 23 million of an estimated 37 million people without
insurance. The new coverage would cost about $27 billion, CBO said,
but it would be offset by about $12 billion in savings on
administrative costs, charity care and other outlays.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the Kennedy plan taxes Americans
indirectly through businesses and called it ``socialism, pure and
simple.''
   A frustrated Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, responded that
congressional medical services, all free and conveniently located
in the Capitol, are ``the most socialized medicine in America.''
   His voice rising, Harkin continued, ``Every senator takes part
in it. Every House member takes part in it. But will they vote it
for everyone else in America? No.''
   Hatch, equally frustrated, said he would vote to end the free
care for members of Congress _ but declined to stop his own visits
immediately on principle.
   ``We're a bunch of hypocrites,'' Hatch conceded. He added a
moment later, ``I have to admit I use it, but I don't use it as
much as most people, I think.''
   Hatch called the Kennedy bill a $30 billion solution to an $8
billion problem and likened it to ``using a sledge hammer to crack
an egg.''
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen, in a letter
Tuesday to Kennedy, also criticized the scope of the proposal. He
said it would ``impose an unduly intrusive and centralist solution,
one wholly disproportionate to the dimensions of the problem being
addressed.''
   Bowen said the problem is ``limited in scope'' and could be
resolved with sharply focused plans at the state level.
   The only state with compulsory employer-sponsored health
insurance is Hawaii. Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, said 13
percent of Hawaiians were uninsured before the plan, compared to 5
percent now. Coverage requirements are more extensive than the
Kennedy bill, he said.
   ``None of the businesses are complaining. Businesses are
prospering as usual,'' Matsunaga said. ``It's working beautifully.
I think it can work nationally.''
   Several senators criticized the insurance industry and small
business groups for failing to help develop a consensus approach to
closing the health insurance gap.
   ``If the (insurance) industry refuses to participate, it'll be
the government that does the job. Then they'll come along and say,
`Let us in, let us in,''' said Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn. As for
small business, ``they don't want any bill. Period. Over and out.''

<HEAD>Meese Makes Seventh Appearance Before Iran-Contra Grand Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Wednesday
made his seventh appearance before the grand jury investigating the
Iran-Contra affair, presumably for more questioning about his 1986
weekend probe of the arms-for-hostages deals.
   Among other things, the grand jury impaneled early last year by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is believed to be focusing on
Meese's Nov. 22-23, 1986 investigation that uncovered the diversion
of arms-sale profits to the Nicraguan rebels.
   In recent weeks, the grand jury has heard testimony by Assistant
Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who found a memo
revealing the diversion in National Security Council files, and
Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper, another member of the
team.
   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who was
present when President Reagan ordered Meese to conduct the
investigation and also when the attorney general reported his
findings, has testified recently.
   Meese also has testified six other times before a different
grand jury investigating his financial dealings with a former
officer of the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand jury
appearances, but the Justice Department says he is cooperating with
the investigation and is not a target of Walsh's probe.
   Meese's investigation was criticized by congressional committees
that held hearings last summer on the Iran-Contra affair. The
panels faulted Meese for not recruiting Justice Department lawyers
with more experience investigating criminal cases and for failing
to take notes during interviews with top administration officials
after he learned about the diversion.
   The congressional committees said Meese's failure to secure
National Security Council files allowed documents to be shredded by
then-national security adviser John M. Poindexter, NSC aide Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North and others.
   Poindexter resigned and North was fired after Meese announced
that arms-sale profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels.
   Poindexter and North are targets of the Walsh's investigation.
Indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks.

   Gunmen today kidnapped a U.S. Marine
officer who headed an observer group assigned to a United Nations
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
   The Pentagon identified the victim as Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, chief of the 75-man observer group attached to the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon. UNIFIL sources originally identified him
as Lt. Col. Richard Higgins.
   A Pentagon official said Higgins was on temporary detail serving
as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's Lebanon
Observer Group. Higgins, 43, is a native of Danville, Ky., the
official said.
   U.N. sources said Higgins was kidnapped in the late afternoon on
the coastal highway between Lebanon's southernmost port of Tyre and
the border town of Naqoura, site of UNIFIL's headquarters.
   No group claimed responsibility for the abduction, which brings
to 25 the number of foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in
Lebanon. One source said Higgins was returning from talks with
Shiite Moslem militia officials.
   ``Higgins was driving in a U.N. Jeep station wagon from Tyre to
Naqoura behind a similar vehicle in which two other observers were
traveling,'' UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said.
   He said the first vehicle went around a bend in the road, ``and
when the two observers noticed that Higgins' car was not following
them, they stopped and drove back, only to find Higgins' station
wagon abandoned,'' Goksel said.
   Israel radio monitor Mickey Gurdus, who monitors radio stations
in Lebanon, said Higgins was kidnapped by three gunmen driving a
Mercedes car. Gurdus did not give the source of his information.
   The gunmen stopped Higgins' vehicle, forced him to board their
car and speeded off toward the village of Shabrikha, Gurdus said on
Israel radio.
   Goksel denied an earlier report that Higgins had an escort of
Fijian troops from UNIFIL, and said the American officer was in his
station wagon alone.
   Goksel said UNIFIL helicopters and ground troops were seaching
for Higgins.
   In Washington, a Defense Department official who spoke on
condition of anonymity confirmed that Higgins had been kidnapped
and gave a similar account of the kidnapping.
   He said 16 Americans are assigned to the observer group,
although not all might be inside Lebanon at the same time. Goskel
had said there were six Americans assigned to the group.
   Goksel said said members of the group do not carry weapons.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said President Reagan was
informed of the incident at his California ranch before he left on
a flight to Washington.
   ``We are still investigating, trying to learn more about it,''
Reagan said as he boarded Air Force One.
   Higgins was returning from a meeting in Tyre with Abdel Majid
Saleh, a political leader of the mainstream Amal Shiite Moslem
militia, a UNIFIL official told the The Associated Press in
Jerusalem. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the meeting took place in a friendly atmosphere.
   The UNIFIL command declined to answer questions about the
abduction. But one U.N. source in Naqoura said the area of the
abduction is close to the Shiite Moslem villages of Ras el-Ein and
Deir Qanoun.
   The two villages are controlled by Justice Minister Nabih
Berri's Amal militia. But the influence of extremist Shiite
factions loyal to Iran has been steadily growing in both villages,
Tyre-based reporters said.
   UNIFIL was set up in 1978 on a mission to restore peace and
security and assist the Lebanese government in ensuring the return
of its effective authority in southern Lebanon.
   In June 1982, after Israel's invasion of Lebanon, UNIFIL also
was given the interim task of extending protection and humanitarian
assistance to the people in the area.
   UNTSO was organized to observe and maintain the cease-fire
ordered by the U.N. Security Council in July 1948 and supervise the
general armistice agreements between Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon
and Israel, the Pentagon said. It serves as the focal point for all
United Nations Middle East peacekeeping operations and monitors
cease-fire violations on the border.
   Higgins is married to Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, who works at
the Pentagon. She declined comment. He has a 17-year-old daughter
by a previous marriage.
   Twenty-four other foreigners, including eight Americans, are
missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon.
   The longest held hostage is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson was seized in
west Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Two Scandinavians were kidnapped Feb. 5 as they were driving
just outside the southern port of Sidon.
   Jan Stening of Sweden and William Jorgensen of Norway worked for
the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. No group claimed responsiblity
for their abduction, but U.N. officials said their abductors were
Palestinians acting without a political motive.

   Col. Jean-Claude Paul, whom a Miami
businessman called the main cocaine trafficker in Haiti, runs an
army unit that is quartered at the National Palace and known as the
country's most brutal.
   A Western diplomat said: ``Paul is very popular with his troops.
He likes to spread money around to them, and commands them
directly. There is no normal chain of command.''
   The palace's latest occupant, President Leslie Manigat, promised
in his inaugural speech Feb. 7 to stop drug trafficking in his
impoverished Caribbean nation.
   Manigat mentioned no names and was escorted into the palace
after the address by military guards, including Paul, who carried
an Uzi submachine gun. His Dessalines Battalion barracks are
attached to the rear of the palace.
   Before the inauguration, Paul often served as unofficial
bodyguard to Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and Gen. Williams Regala. They
were the military members on of the three-man provisional junta
that ruled for two years after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled
the country Feb. 7, 1986.
   Paul is a stocky man of medium height, about 40, who customarily
wears a ring, necklace and heavy bracelet of gold. Except for his
role as informal bodyguard, for which he equips himself with an Uzi
and holstered Colt .45, he seldom appears in public.
   Osvaldo Quintana, a 35-year-old businessman, told reporters
Monday in Miami that he arranged a cocaine shipment with Paul,
using an airstrip on the colonel's ranch to smuggle the drugs to
Florida via the Bahamas.
   He said he knew of involvement by higher Haitian officials
extending up to the junta, but would not give names.
   His lawyer, Ellis Rubin, said he wanted Quintana to testify
before the Senate committee investigating alleged drug smuggling by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's military commander and the
power behind his country's government.
   Rubin said his client had testified before a federal grand jury
in Miami investigating illegal drug activity in Haiti.
   Quintana said he ran a seafood operation until becoming involved
in smuggling in August 1986. He met Paul in December of that year
and arranged for 220 pounds of cocaine to be shipped to the United
States, the Miami man said.
   ``We flew out of his own personal ranch in Haiti,'' Quintana
told the news conference.
   No one in Haiti has publicly accused Paul of drug trafficking,
although rumors of his involvement are rife in diplomatic circles
and among retired military officers.
   A U.S. diplomat would not confirm or deny reports of Paul's
connection with drug trafficking but acknowledged the airstrip
existed. He described it as ``a funny-looking highway that starts
nowhere and ends nowhere, near the border'' with the Dominican
Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Another Western diplomat said Paul owns a ranch equipped with an
asphalt landing strip near Thomazeau, about 20 miles east of
Port-au-Prince. He said it is believed the ranch, on the Cul-de-Sac
Plain near the frontier, once belonged to Duvalier.
   All the diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The 700-man Dessalines Battalion, largest unit in Haiti's
6,000-man army, is also known as the most violent. Men wearing the
blue Dessalines shoulder patch killed most of the nearly 40
civilians shot by soldiers during anti-government strikes and
protests in 1987.
   On the day of the aborted election Nov. 29, when thugs with guns
and machetes killed at least 34 people and wounded 75, Western
reporters and election observers saw truckloads of Dessalines
soldiers stand by without intervening.
   Gen. Carl Nicolas, the army chief of staff, refused a request by
The Associated Press for an interview with Paul.
   Anaise Chavenet, spokeswoman for the Information Ministry, said
Tuesday: ``The government will not give an opinion on this affair
as long as it is not officially informed (by U.S. officials)
through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.''
   On Monday, Ms. Chavenet said of Paul: ``I personally think that
he is being singled out for attack, like Noriega in Panama.
President Manigat has pledged to fight drug trafficking. I don't
know how he feels about Col. Paul.''
   Asked during a recent interview at his home about reports of
drug smuggling by the army, Manigat said: ``I can't base my
judgment on rumors.''
   The Western diplomat who mentioned Paul's popularity with his
men said the Dessalines Battalion ``is the only unit really feared
here.''
   He said Duvalier created the elite, 300-man Leopards Battalion
in the early 1980s to check the power of Paul's unit. The Leopards,
the 100-man navy, the 100-man air force and the 1,000-man
Presidential Guard have the reputation of being more humane and
professional.
   After Duvalier fled, the diplomat said, Paul recruited about 100
members of the dictator's Tonton Macoute private militia, which
terrorized Haiti during 29 years of Duvalier family rule.

   ``The Last Emperor,'' a panoramic
drama of modern China, scored top honors with nine nominations
Wednesday in an Oscar race that included Cher, Robin Williams and
Michael Douglas but overlooked directors Steven Spielberg and James
L. Brooks.
   ``Broadcast News,'' the comedy-romance set in a television news
bureau, followed with seven nominations including those for stars
William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks. James Brooks was
nominated as producer and writer, but surprisingly, not as director.
   Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' tied ``Fatal Attraction'' and
``Moonstruck'' with six nominations, but Spielberg was not
mentioned for his direction, nor did the film make the best movie
list. In 1985, Spielberg's ``The Color Purple'' collected 11
nominations, but none for the director.
   Joining ``Broadcast News'' and ``The Last Emperor,'' the life
story of China's last monarch, as contenders for best picture were
``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Hope and Glory'' and ``Moonstruck.''
   Bernardo Bertolucci, the Italian director of ``The Last
Emperor,'' said in Rome that ``even if I've been making films for
25 years, today for the first time I feel like I passed my exams
with flying colors, the sensation of becoming an adult.''
   Of the best picture nominees, ``Fatal Attraction'' was the only
one to place among the Top Ten money makers of 1987., It was third
with a gross of $129,358,990, behind ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' and
``Platoon,'' which won the Oscar for best picture last year. But
most of the nominated films opened near the end of the year and are
still selling tickets.
   Two-time winners Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep were nominated
as best actor and actress for their roles as Depression-era
low-lifers in ``Ironweed.''
   Best actor nominees also included Douglas for ``Wall Street'';
Hurt, ``Broadcast News''; Marcello Mastroianni, ``Dark Eyes'';
Williams, ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
   Douglas learned the news watching television at his New York
apartment. He said, ``It made me not only proud of our film `Wall
Street,' but it reminded me of what a wonderful part Oliver Stone
created.''
   Joining Streep on the best actress list: Cher, ``Moonstruck'';
Glenn Close, ``Fatal Attraction''; Miss Hunter, ``Broadcast News;''
and Sally Kirkland, ``Anna.''
   ``I'm ecstatic to be nominated,'' said Miss Close at her country
home in New York. ``I'm especially thrilled that so many connected
with the film have been nominated.''
   Sean Connery, who never was nominated as James Bond, placed
among the nominees for supporting actor with his role as the steely
Chicago cop in ``The Untouchables.'' Others in the race: Albert
Brooks, ``Broadcast News''; Morgan Freeman, ``Street Smart'';
Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck''; Denzel Washington, ``Cry
Freedom.''
   All of the supporting actresses were first-time nominees: Norma
Aleandro, ``Gaby _ A True Story''; Anne Archer, ``Fatal
Attraction''; Olympia Dukakis, ``Moonstruck''; Anne Ramsey, ``Throw
Momma from the Train''; Ann Sothern, ``The Whales of August.''
   The directors branch of the Academy neglected Spielberg and
Brooks to reward five foreigners: Britons Adrian Lyne, ``Fatal
Attraction,'' and John Boorman, ``Hope and Glory''; Bertolucci,
``The Last Emperor''; Canadian Norman Jewison, ``Moonstruck''; and
Swede Lasse Hallstrom, ``My Life as a Dog.''
   James Brooks was reached at the Berlin Film Festival by his
publicist, Pat Kingsley, who reported: ``I'm sure that he was
disappointed at not getting the nomination (for his direction). But
he was so thrilled for the actors, and he was thrilled for the
screenplay nomination.''
   Brooks was nominated for best original screenplay, along with
Louis Malle, ``Au Revoir Les Enfants''; Boorman, ``Hope and
Glory''; John Patrick Shanley, ``Moonstruck''; Woody Allen, ``Radio
Days.'' Both Malle and Boorman based their scripts on their boyhood
experiences in World War II.
   A fourth Huston entered the Academy ranks. Tony Huston was
nominated for his adaptation of James Joyce's ``The Dead.'' If he
wins an Oscar, he would be following in the footsteps of
grandfather Walter, father John and sister Anjelica.
   Tony Huston was awakened with the news by his publicist Sheila
Barr. He told her of his late father's advice when an Academy
nominee once asked what he should say to the press. ``Don't say _
listen,'' instructed John.
   ``Tony said he had gotten this far collaborating with his dad,
and he thinks he should take heed of his advice,'' said Miss Barr.
   Also nominated for screenplay adaptation: James Dearden, ``Fatal
Attraction''; Stanley Kubrick, Michael Herr, Gustav Hasford, ``Full
Metal Jacket''; Mark Peploe and Bertolucci, ``The Last Emperor'';
Hallstrom, Reidar Jonnson, Brasse Brannstrom, Per Berglund, ``My
Life as a Dog.''
   All of the foreign language film nominees come from Europe: ``Au
Revoir Les Enfants'' (France); Babette's Feast'' (Denmark);
``Course Completed'' (Spain); ``The Family'' (Italy);
``Pathfinder'' (Norway).
   The nominees for best song: ``Cry Freedom'' (title song);
``(I've Had) The Time of My Life'' from ``Dirty Dancing'';
``Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now'' from ``Mannequin''; ``Shakedown''
from ``Beverly Hills Cop II''; ``Storybook Love'' from ``The
Princess Bride.''
   Nominations for the 60th Academy Awards included other notable
omissions besides those of Spielberg and Brooks. Pioneering star
Lillian Gish was overlooked for ``The Whales of August,'' but the
acting branch saluted Miss Sothern, who started her film career in
1929 in ``The Show of Shows,'' for her role as a compassionate
neighbor in ``Whales.''
   Steve Martin received critics' raves for his Cyrano in
``Roxanne,'' but neither his performance nor the script he wrote
won an Academy mention. But the manic Williams won a nomination _
rare for a flat-out comedy performance _ for ``Good Morning,
Vietnam.''
   Academy voters resisted the high-pressure campaign for ``Nuts.''
Stars Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfus were not among the
nominees. Also among the missing: John Lone, ``The Last Emperor'';
Elaine Stritch, ``September''; Maggie Smith, ``The Secret Passion
of Judith Hearne''; Faye Dunaway, ``Barfly''; director Hector
Babenco, ``Ironweed.''
   The Academy Awards return to the Shrine Auditorium on April 11
after a 40-year absence. The ceremonies will be televised on the
ABC network.

<HEAD>Israelis in Heartland Feel Less Threatened by Arab Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riots in the occupied lands are only an
hour's drive from Tel Aviv, but there are no outward signs that the
unrest is dampening spirits in Israel's entertainment capital.
   On a recent Saturday night, young couples crowded into the
popular Cherry's Cafe, and the decibels were as deadly as ever at
the Cafe Dan discotheque, which caters to the punk rock crowd.
   ``People's day-to-day life is not affected unless they have
Arabs working for them. I think a lot of people ignore the trouble,
because it seems far away,'' said Rickie Gal, a rock singer whose
blond hair was streaked with a slash of red.
   But, sitting in a cafe on Dizengoff Street, the center of Tel
Aviv's night life, Ms. Gal said she was recording her first
political song to protest the violence. ``It says `Yes, enough
war,' and `No' to hate and the use of force.''
   Because Israel is about the size of Rhode Island, little happens
that is geographically remote. Tel Aviv is only 50 miles from the
Gaza Strip and 30 miles from Nablus, the West Bank's largest city.
   The psychological distance is much greater because a large
percentage of Israelis rarely, if ever, visit the occupied lands
unless they are forced to by an army call-up.
   In contrast, Jeruslem-area houses have had picture windows and
windshields smashed by rioters, and several private cars have been
torched.
   In neighborhood meetings, Jewish residents have warned they will
use guns if necessary to defend their homes if police are unable to
do so.
   Israelis in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, which has 1.5
million Jews and about 10,000 Arabs, say they feel much less
threatened than Israelis who live 45 minutes away in Jerusalem,
which borders the West Bank and has a one-third Arab population.
   ``In Tel Aviv, being so fully Jewish, you never really feel
events like this the way you do in Jerusalem. There is a different
feeling in the air. People go on with their life as usual,'' said
Benny Cohen, a spokesman for the city.
   He said the mood was summed up in a current pop song by army
singers from the Southern Command Band titled ``Tel Aviv Is Not
Worried.''
   ``People are very aware of the situation and caught up in it,
but Jerusalem is a more political city. By nature, the ratio of
politics to barroom conversations is lower in Tel Aviv than in
Jerusalem,'' said Zeev Chavets, an Israeli author and immigrant
from Pontiac, Mich.
   Tel Aviv residents have been called to reserve duty in the
occupied areas just like other Israelis. They employ some of the
40,000 Arabs who provide menial labor for Tel Aviv hotels,
restaurants, construction sites and factories.
   Frequent Arab strikes have affected city garbage collection.
More than half the 350 Arabs stayed home and several hundred Arab
restaurant workers fled Tel Aviv's restaurant district this week
after being threatened.
   Shaptai Bahar, owner of the Hippopotame restaurant, said six
Arabs, including both cooks, went home after two Arab militants
came to the kitchen and threatened to harm the workers' families if
they did not observe a boycott of Israeli businesses.
   Tel Aviv is Israel's intellectual capital, and the uprising by
Palestinian nationalists has spurred many to urge peace
negotiations and an end to the use of force against the 1.5 million
residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Association of Israeli Playwrights organized a gathering in
the Tzavta theater Tuesday that drew widely known actors, singers
and authors, including several who had not previously expressed
their views publicly on the unrest.
   ``The most difficult struggle is taking place in the minds of
Israelis. It's a struggle between emotions and reason,'' Ely Sarid,
33, said during a debate with a group of young intellectuals and
artists who gathered in his apartment.
   Sarid, a teacher of filmmaking who was a tank commander in the
1973 Middle East war and has done reserve duty in the West Bank,
said the unrest has made him ready to challenge the authorities.
   ``If I am called up, I will go. But I won't beat anyone or do
anything to support the occupation,'' he said. ``If they put me in
a tank, I will aim the cannon outside the borders.''

<HEAD>West Germans Urged to Match East German Missile Rollback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's main opposition party
pressured the government Wednesday to follow Moscow's lead and
scrap some nuclear missiles before a U.S.-Soviet missile treaty
goes into effect.
   Hermann Scheer, disarmament expert for the opposition Social
Democrats, said Chancellor Helmut Kohl should respond to the early
Soviet missile reductions by dismantling West Germany's 72 Pershing
1A missiles.
   ``Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust in
disarmament which the leadership in East Berlin has been working
toward with the Soviets,'' Scheer, speaking on behalf of the party,
told reporters.
   East Germany's state-run news agency, ADN, reported Tuesday that
the Soviet Union had dismantled SS-12 nuclear missiles in Waren, an
East German site about 90 miles northwest of Berlin.
   The SS-12s are included in a U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate
the superpowers' medium- and shorter-range missiles.
   Kohl announced before the superpower pact was signed that West
Germany would scrap its Pershing 1A missiles as part of a new
treaty. The Pershing 1A missiles are owned by West Germany, but the
United States controls the rockets' nuclear warheads.
   On Wednesday, East German newspapers printed photos of
dismantled missiles and hailed the Soviet preparations for removing
the SS-12s before the treaty is ratified.
   ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from (East
Germany),'' the Communist party's official newspaper New Germany
said in a banner headline.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the treaty in Washington last December. The agreement stipulates
that the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in East Germany and in
Czechoslovakia are to be removed within 18 months and medium-range
U.S. and Soviet missiles within three years.
   Three Senate committees are debating the treaty and ratification
may come during the summer. The Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's
parliament, is expected to approve the accord.
   In Washington, the State Department had no immediate reaction to
the report. But a U.S. official who demanded anonymity said the
Soviets were free to remove their missiles before the treaty takes
effect.
   The official said U.S. inspectors will go to East Germany and
all other Soviet missile sites to verify compliance with the treaty
if it is ratified.
   ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when
they would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Soviet
soldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12
rockets.
   ``With this step we can make an important contribution toward
disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and
the Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN wrote.
   East German leader Erich Honecker said in January that Soviet
intermediate-range rockets based in his country could be removed
ahead of schedule, but at the time gave no specific timetable.
   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22
rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice
missiles were stationed at Waren, which has the largest numbers of
SS-12s in East Germany. There are three other SS-12 sites in the
country.
   The Soviet Union also has shorter-range SS-23 nuclear missiles
based in East Germany.

<HEAD>OSHA Letter Prompts Rust Engineering Officials To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president and four other officials
of an engineering firm have resigned in the wake of allegations
that one of the executives improperly tried to influence a federal
safety agency.
   The allegations stem from a letter written in December by Fred
W. Graham, Rust Engineering Co.'s manager of safety and security,
to an official of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, in which Graham offered to testify favorably about
the agency before a congressional committee.
   In return, Graham wrote, he sought OSHA's agreement to
``reasonable'' penalties against Rust Engineering, based in
Birmingham, Ala., for safety violations at Bridgeport's
garbage-to-energy plant.
   Graham was one of the five who resigned Tuesday, said company
spokeswoman Sherry Cook.
   Rust is building the $200 million plant in Bridgeport. Last
week, OSHA proposed $54,000 in penalties against the company for
alleged safety violations at the site.
   Cook confirmed that the resignations were the result of a letter
written by Graham to OSHA in December. She said company President
Joseph de la Campa had reviewed and approved Graham's letter before
it was sent to OSHA.
   Earlier this month, the company retracted the letter and said it
was unauthorized. Cook on Tuesday reaffirmed that statement, saying
that the letter had been unauthorized despite de la Campa's
approval.
   Rust officials said in a statement, ``The actions taken (sending
the letter to OSHA) were not in keeping with the high professional
standards of the company.''
   The Department of Labor's inspector general's office and the
Connecticut U.S. attorney's office are investigating whether Rust
officials sought to improperly influence OSHA.
   Also resigning Tuesday were Nicholas Bouler, an attorney; Ronald
Luster, manager of construction; and L.G. Wright, Rust
Engineering's Bridgeport project manager.

   More than 800 telephone calls and letters
from National Rifle Association members have flooded a New York
county executive's office opposing the candidacy of Police Chief
Tony Bouza for a post there.
   Bouza is one of four finalists for police commissioner in
Suffolk County, N.Y., east of New York City on Long Island.
   He has been a outspoken critic of the NRA and its stand on gun
control, and is a leading critic of a proposed
``right-to-bear-arms'' amendment to the Minnesota Constitution,
which is supported by the NRA.
   ``We have no feeling one way or the other as far as the other
candidates are concerned,'' said Dick Sorrentino, an NRA field
representative for New York and New Jersey. ``Suffolk County has
problems to begin with as far as pistol licensing goes. It's very
restrictive. We certainly don't need someone with (Bouza's)
feelings on gun ownership in charge of pistol licensing.
   ``Bouza's made his stand very publicly and we couldn't ignore
it,'' Sorrentino said. ``We had to make our feelings known.''
   Other finalists are Anthony Voelker, a 35-year veteran on the
New York City Police Department; Daniel Guido, chief of police in
Stamford, Conn.; and Martin O'Connor, chief of Long Island's Nassau
County police support division.
   The NRA has more than 25,000 members in Suffolk County. But Brad
O'Hearn, a spokesman for Suffolk County Executive Patrick Halpin,
said the NRA's telephone and letter-writing campaign is unlikely to
influence Halpin's decision on a new police commissioner. That
decision is expected next week.
   Bouza's third term as Minneapolis police chief expires at the
end of the year.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Americans Are Healthy But Feel Lousy</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release at 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have never been healthier, but they feel
worse and worse, a doctor says.
   Dr. Arthur J. Barsky calls this ``the paradox of health.'' The
nation's collective health has improved dramatically over the past
30 years, yet people report increasingly high rates of disability
and a general dissatisfaction with their health.
   Barsky, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, blames
this on several factors, including people's obsession with diet and
exercise and their unrealistic expectations of what medicine can do
for them.
   Writing in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, Barsky
noted that the life expectancy of a child born in 1984 was 75
years. In 1900, it was 47. Since 1970 alone, the life expectancy
has increased by four years.
   However, surveys show that people report twice as many episodes
of disabling illness now than they did in the 1920s, before the
introduction of antibiotics. In the 1970s, 61 percent of Americans
said they were satisfied with their health. A decade later, this
had fallen to 55 percent.
   ``Our subjective feeling of healthiness and physical well-being
has decreased, even though there have been major advances in our
actual, objective health status,'' Barsky wrote.
   One reason is medicine's conquest of diseases that kill quickly.
It lets people grow old so they die with diseases that linger.
People who are saved from pneumonia and tuberculosis live long
enough to be afflicted with arthritis and diabetes.
   ``Thus, we live longer, but a greater proportion of our life is
spent in ill health,'' he wrote.
   Among other factors cited by Barsky:
   _People's fascination with diet, exercise and healthy living
means they spend more time thinking about their bodies. This erodes
their sense of well-being, because they are more negative about
their health when they dwell on it.
   _The proliferation of do-it-yourself diagnostic kits, health
magazines, fat farms and other health products makes people more
conscious of trivial symptoms. Every twinge and ache becomes the
sign of a horrifying disease. This, along with news media
exaggeration of such rare health problems as toxic shock syndrome,
``induces a cultural climate of alarm and hypochondria, undermining
feelings of well-being.''
   _People go to the doctor twice as often as they did 50 years
ago. Frequently they seek help for such minor complaints as sore
muscles, colds and upset stomaches. This ``medicalization of daily
life'' leads people to think that all of their discomforts are
curable, and they are disappointed when they are not.

<HEAD>Biltmore Theater Goes for Over $5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Biltmore Theater, one of the largest houses
on Broadway, has been sold for $5.35 million, and the new owner
says he'll try to use it as a cabaret theater.
   Morris Gluck, who bought the theater at auction Tuesday, said
through a spokesman that he plans to keep the 948-seat house as a
theater. But other theater owners said the high price could force
Gluck to develop the site's air rights.
   The auction started with a base price of $4 million. The sale
was tentative, pending the working out of final details.
   Gary Waskow, a spokesman for Properties at Auction, which
managed the sale, said Gluck was negotiating with an unidentified
producer interested in becoming a new tenant in the building.
   ``The proposed tenant has in mind to use the Biltmore as a
cabaret theater,'' said Rene Frank, president of Properties at
Auction. ``They want to try something that has never been done in
New York.''
   The interior of the theater, which opened in 1925 at on West
47th Street, was given landmark status late last year, so any
changes would have to be approved by the city. The building comes
with 136,000 square feet of air rights on Broadway.
   The last long-running hit in the theater was the musical
``Hair,'' which closed in 1972 after more than four years.

<HEAD>Disciplinary Inquiry Ordered In Ulster Police Shootings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Ireland police Wednesday announced a
disciplinary inquiry against officers involved in the killing of
six unarmed men in the province in three incidents in late 1982.
   The investigation, headed by Charles Kelly, chief constable of
the Staffordshire force, will delve into a controversy that has
resurfaced this year to embarrass the British government and
seriously damage its relations with Ireland.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
said the inquiry was ordered by its chief constable, Sir John
Hermon. It did not say how many officers would be investigated or
what penalties they might face.
   The announcement came three weeks after the government disclosed
that evidence had emerged of perjury and subversion of justice in
an alleged cover-up of the circumstances of the shootings.
   On Jan. 25, the government said it would not prosecute the
police officers involved, provoking angry reactions from Dublin as
well as British opposition politicians.
   The decision to take disciplinary action was seen as an attempt
to placate the Irish government, while the opposition Labor Party
said it confirmed longstanding allegations of police misconduct in
Northern Ireland.
   ``This is perhaps one of the most serious and grave statements
we have heard about the British security forces in Northern
Ireland,'' said Kevin McNamara, Labor's spokesman on Northern
Ireland, in a House of Commons debate.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King told Parliament:
``Undoubtedly serious mistakes were made which have damaged the
reputation of the RUC.''
   He said the issues ``go to the heart of the problems faced by a
police force using the normal processes of law while fighting a
ruthless and vicious terrorist enemy.''
   The shootings were investigated for two years by John Stalker,
then assistant chief constable of Manchester.
   He found that five deaths occurred when police, in separate
incidents, fired on moving cars. The occupants were unarmed but
were acknowledged by their organizations as guerrillas. The sixth
victim was a teen-ager who stumbled on a guerrilla explosives
hideout that was under police surveillance and was shot in
still-unexplained circumstances.
   Stalker this month published a book claiming he was dumped from
the inquiry because his findings threatened to implicate senior RUC
officers in murder.
   King said the inquiry would determine whether to bring
disciplinary action against officers up to the rank of chief
superintendent. The Northern Ireland Police Authority, a
police-civilian watchdog body, would have to decide whether more
senior officers should be disciplined, he said.
   King also outlined structural changes in the RUC prompted by the
lessons of the 1982 shootings.
   In Dublin, in a parliamentary debate on the worsening state of
Anglo-Irish relations, Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said
recent controversies concerning Northern Ireland had aroused
``strong feelings of Irish public opinion.''
   Besides the 1982 shootings, he cited:
   _ The British appeals court's refusal Jan. 28 to grant a retrial
to six Irishmen serving life sentences for twin bomb attacks that
killed 21 people in 1974. The six claim they are innocent and were
convicted on faulty forensic evidence and confessions they say were
beaten out of them.
   _ Britain's refusal to fulfill conditions set down by Ireland
for the extradition of Irish terrorist suspects to British police
under a new extradition treaty that took effect Dec. 1.
   _ The British government's announcement Tuesday that it will
make its controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act a permanent law,
rather than requiring annual parliamentary renewal.
   The 13-year-old act empowers police to hold terrorism suspects
for up to seven days without charging them or giving them access to
a lawyer.

<TEXT>
   Bob Dole on Wednesday portrayed George Bush
and his aides as the hatchetmen of the GOP presidential campaign
with ``all the axes in town ... swinging them in every state.''
   Dole promised to swing back if attacked again.
   ``You're seeing a mean George Bush. You ought to take a look at
some of the things they have been doing and saying,'' Dole declared
as he tried to rebound from his stinging defeat at Bush's hands in
New Hampshire on Tuesday.
   The Kansas senator said he had been too soft on Bush and had
erred in the final days of the campaign by not responding to
negative ads run by the vice president's campaign.
   Bush, meanwhile, denied he had done anything wrong.
   ``I'm not going to dwell on it, you see, I don't want to be
drawn into something like that,'' the vice president said to
reporters. ``People in New Hampshire like clean campaigns, and they
endorsed me overwhelmingly.''
   Sticking with his contention that the Bush ads were false, Dole
said he would not make the same mistake again. He was careful to
say that his aides would do the heavy lifting in the
counterattacks, which were already under way.
   ``The problem with George Bush is that he hasn't got a record,''
Dole campaign manager Bill Brock told reporters on the campaign
plane from New Hampshire. ``If somebody can tell me what he has
done in the last seven years, I'll buy somebody a steak.''
   Brock, however, said Dole officials would not distort the record
as they said Bush had done. ``We don't have to wallow in the mud
with them to answer their charges,'' he said.
   Dole himself did try to stay away from a role in the
counterattacking, which is a sensitive subject in light of his
reputation as once the toughest hatchetman of the GOP. Asked if the
new tactics threaten to revive that old image, Dole said it is the
Bush campaign that faces the image problem.
   ``They have all the axes in town. They seem to be swinging them
in every state,'' he said.
   Dole pointed to an ad run by the Bush campaign in New Hampshire
that accused him of straddling the issues of taxes, an oil import
fee and the medium-range missile treaty. And Brock reminded
reporters that Bush's Iowa campaign manager had attacked Dole for
``cronyism'' and ``mean-spiritedness'' and raised questions about
his wife's blind trust.
   Dole blamed part of his New Hampshire problem on the surge of
expectations that built after he trounced Bush in the Iowa caucuses
on Feb. 8.
   ``If expectations hadn't gotten so good, it would have been a
victory today,'' Dole told reporters at the airport in Washington.
``We didn't win. But that's only one step along the way. We're
going to South Dakota and Minnesota.''
   Dole talked with reporters on the campaign plane as it flew from
Manchester to Washington, where Dole spent the day in meetings and
in a Senate debate on campaign financing. He was asked if he had
been too soft on Bush.
   ``Probably,'' Dole replied.
   Should he have fired back at Bush?
   ``Yes, that's my guess,'' he said. ``I think we sat on our hands
for three days.''
   As for the dispute distorted ads, Dole said at the Manchester
airport, ``I'm not going to run from it. I'm not known for running
from a fight.''
   ``I never said I was going to raise your taxes. I didn't say I
was advocating a $10-a-barrel import fee. But that's what Bush's
ads say and they are not true.''
   It was Brock who laid out the new tactics for the Dole campaign
against possible future Bush attacks.
   ``When he does it from now on, we're going to respond very, very
forcefully,'' Brock said on the plane. ``We're tired of it. We're
sick to the gills of this type of tactic.''
   ``George, campaign on your own,'' Brock lectured Bush via the
media. ``Earn it on your own. Don't try to put somebody else down.''

<TEXT>
   Gary Dotson, the convicted rapist who was
freed from prison in 1985 after his alleged victim recanted, on
Wednesday was ordered behind bars for at least six months for
violating the conditions of his parole.
   The Illinois Prisoner Review Board rejected Dotson's plea for
another chance and ruled that he had violated the terms of parole
for failing to report to his parole officer last Dec. 24.
   The board ordered Dotson held in state prison until Aug. 16,
when he will be eligible for parole again and may be released from
prison if he complies with conditions set by the board, said Nic
Howell, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.
   Dotson was ordered by the board to undergo a substance abuse
treatment program while in prison.
   Dotson's case drew national attention when Cathleen Crowell
Webb, now a New Hampshire homemaker, recanted her testimony that
Dotson had raped her when she was a suburban teen-ager.
   After three days of hearings in 1985, Gov. James R. Thompson
commuted Dotson's sentence of 25 to 50 years to the six years he
had served. The governor did not pardon Dotson, saying he did not
believe the recantation.
   Since then, Dotson has had numerous scrapes with the law, which
under the good-conduct terms of his commutation could result in him
being ordered to serve out the remainder of his sentence.
   Dotson was imprisoned last year for violating his parole terms
by being convicted on drunken driving charges. Thompson freed
Dotson a second time when he modified his 1985 commutation order to
allow Dotson out on Dec. 24 in what the governor called ``a
last-chance deal.''
   Two days later, Dotson was arrested after a bar fight in
suburban Calumet City. Prosecutors later dropped battery charges in
that incident, but Dotson remained in jail on a ``parole hold.''
   Dotson told the review board during a hearing Tuesday that he is
an alcoholic and needed treatment.
   The ruling disappointed Dotson's family.
   ``I just don't understand why they've got to keep him in jail,''
said Laura Dotson, one of his five sisters. ``Why can't they just
put him in a halfway house or something? He's been in jail long
enough for something he didn't do. We want him in a rehab _ but not
in jail.''

<HEAD>Southern Leaders Outline Issue Agenda For Presidential Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern political leaders from both parties
on Wednesday outlined a series of issues they want the presidential
candidates to address as they shift their attention to Super
Tuesday.
   A report, prepared for the candidates by the Sunbelt Institute
and the Congressional Sunbelt Caucus, detailed issues ranging from
rural development to welfare reform to energy and environmental
policy.
   Former Virginia Gov. Chuck Robb told a news conference that the
report lists problems that need attention in the South, but does
not outline a list of acceptable solutions that might be
interpreted as a ``Southern litmus test'' for the presidential
candidates.
   Rep. Michael A. Andrews, D-Texas, chairman of the sunbelt
caucus, said the report will ``help define and clarify some of the
issues that confront the nation and our region.''
   ``The candidates have got to change their focus and address
issues of concern to our region,'' he said. ``For the first time,
the South's political voice (through Super Tuesday) will match the
South's number of voters.''
   Andrews said, for example, that none of the candidates have
explained their goals and plans for the space program, which is
vital to the economies of Alabama, Texas and Florida.
   He said the South also is facing a social crisis, with one out
of every five Southerns on welfare, and the presidential candidates
will be expected to respond with meaningful welfare reform
proposals.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., said the level of illiteracy in the
South is a major problem that Southern voters want the presidential
candidates to address as they head toward Super Tuesday.
   A total of 20 states, 14 of them in the South, will hold
primaries or caucuses on Super Tuesday, March 8. The Democrats will
be vying for 1,307 delegates in 20 states while the Republicans
battle for 700 delegates in 16 states.

<HEAD>Hospitals Waging Moral War against Smoking: Survey</HEAD>

   Nine out of 10 American hospitals have policies
restricting smoking, and a growing number are banning smoking from
their premises entirely, according to a study released Wednesday.
   More than half the surveyed hospitals that restrict or ban
smoking said they had a moral responsibility to do so, according to
Stuart A. Wesbury Jr., president of the Chicago-based American
College of Healthcare Executives.
   ``Health-care executives are taking seriously their role in
promoting wellness,'' Wesbury said at a news conference where he
released results of the college's survey of 770 hospitals.
   ``The number of respondents who report they have banned smoking
is extremely impressive when one considers the nature of a
hospital,'' Wesbury said. ``It's not easy to simply say `no
smoking' with the number of people, many of them under tremendous
stress, who use the facility each day as patients or visitors.''
   Of the 90 percent of respondents with smoking policies in effect
last year, 8 percent had outright bans on smoking by employees,
physicians, patients and visitors, the college found.
   In 1981, a survey of more than 3,000 hospitals by the American
Hospital Association found ``maybe one or two in the country'' with
outright bans on smoking, said Lynn Jones, manager of
worksite-health promotion for that Chicago-based organization.
   Typical of those with smoking bans is St. Cloud Hospital of St.
Cloud, Minn., a 489-bed hospital that banned smoking last November.
   Sister Paul Revier, organizer of its smoke-free policy, said
exceptions are made for patients in the hospital's
chemical-dependency and psychiatric wards and for patients who
obtain written permission to smoke from a doctor.
   Fewer than 10 such physician orders have been written since the
policy went into effect, she said.
   There had been no problems with employee smoking, Sister Paul
said, adding she did not expect any to arise. The hospital offered
its employees educational programs and stop-smoking classes for a
year before the ban began, she said.
   ``People are in a sense embarrassed to smoke among other
employees,'' she said.
   John Frobenius, the hospital president, said St. Cloud's
smoke-free policy had created less of a stir than he had expected,
although he said one woman chose to have her baby at another
hospital rather than give up smoking during her stay.
   The University of Chicago Medical Center will go smoke-free on
April 1, said Kenneth Bloem, executive vice president of the
654-bed complex, which includes three hospitals and 100 outpatient
clinics.
   ``This is the second phase of a long-term policy to eliminate
smoking (from the center) altogether,'' Bloem said.
   ``We have looked at smoking as a major public-health problem and
see this as an opportunity for our institutions to promote the
health of patients, staff and visitors as well as maintaining the
health of our patients,'' he said.

<HEAD>Greek Fugitive Indicted in Paintings Caper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities are seeking a fugitive who
fled to Greece after allegedly stealing three valuable paintings
from a wealthy family and arranging to have them sold by a New York
auction house.
   The paintings were recovered after they were auctioned but
before they were shipped to the buyers.
   A federal grand jury last week indicted John Zentefis, a former
foreman at a Chicago storage warehouse, in the thefts from heiress
Mary Bates Harrington.
   The paintings _ ``Summer, Montclair'' by George Inness, ``End of
Day'' by Jean C. Cazin, and ``River Landscape'' by Alexander H.
Wyant _ were once owned by Chicago coal magnate George Bates
Harrington and his wife, Sophia.
   Harrington died in 1960 and his wife died in 1963. The paintings
were inherited by Ms. Harrington, who placed them in storage at a
Federal Moving and Storage Co. warehouse in Chicago.
   Zentefis worked at warehouse, according to the indictment. In
1979, Federal Moving and Storage went bankrupt and the boxes were
supposed to be transferred to the warehouse of a different company.
   In 1984, a friend of the Harrington family noticed that
``Summer, Montclair,'' a 100-year-old landscape painting, had been
listed in a circular sent out by Sotheby's, the well-known auction
house. The FBI was notified, and agent Robert Spiel was dispatched
to New York, according to the indictment.
   Spiel found that ``Summer, Montclair' had been auctioned to an
unidentified London man for $90,750. The other two paintings had
been sold to other buyers for a total of $4,375.
   Zentefis received $76,000 and fled to Greece, the indictment
alleged, while Sotheby's kept the rest of the money as a commission.
   Spiel confiscated the still unshipped art works and brought them
back to Chicago, where the paintings are now being held in storage
by the Art Institute of Chicago.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Vesselinovitch began a grand jury
investigation and the family hired attorney Gordon Nash to sort out
the affair.
   Eventually, Sotheby's paid back the disgruntled purchasers of
the works, which a Cook County judge said belong to Ms. Harrington.
   ``It's amazing we found them,'' she said.

   An Air National Guard ground crew chief
who was sucked into an engine intake of an F-4D Phantom jet died
from massive internal injuries, authorities said Wednesday.
   Sgt. Martin Gaither, 28, of Williamsville died Tuesday during
surgery at Memorial Medical Center, Sangamon County Deputy Coroner
Bruce Martin said.
   Gaither was inspecting engines on the flight line, where
aircraft are prepared for takeoff, when the accident happened, said
Capt. Bob Lael, spokesman for the Illinois Air National Guard.
   He walked in front of an engine that was running and was drawn
into the intake chute, Lael said.
   Gaither was coherent and conscious when he was pulled from the
engine intake, Lael said. But the guardsman suffered a ruptured
spleen and other internal injuries that caused his death, according
to the coroner's office.
   Gaither had worked for four years for the Guard's 183rd Tactical
Fighter Group, Lael said.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Hits 5-Year Low; Some Economists Fear
Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction suffered a second
consecutive monthly decline in January, dipping to the weakest pace
since the end of the last recession, the government reported
Wednesday.
   The 1.9 percent January decline in construction of single-family
homes and apartments, reported by the Commerce Department, raised
new concerns among some economists about the possibility of a
recession this year.
   However, other analysts pointed to a second government report
showing that industrial production rose for the fourth consecutive
month in January. The 0.2 percent rise in industrial output
followed larger gains of 0.4 percent in both November and December.
   Economists are looking for continued strength in manufacturing,
bolstered by rising export sales, to offset expected weakness in
the consumer sector.
   The January decline in housing construction followed an even
larger 15.5 percent December plunge and pushed building activity
down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units,
the slowest pace since a rate of 1.30 million units in December
1982, just as the last recession was ending.
   Housing is being watched very closely in the aftermath of the
record 508-point drop in the stock market last October because it
is often one of the first sectors to weaken at the onset of a new
recession.
   Economists said the two consecutive monthly declines in housing
construction did not guarantee a recession, especially since other
economic sectors have been showing strength. But analysts said
further weakness in this important industry would be troubling.
   ``If housing continues to weaken, it would obviously increase
the chances of a recession,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, head of the
WEFA Group, formerly Wharton Econometrics. ``The rise in exports
would not be enough to offset a big drop in housing and consumer
spending. A lot will depend on what happens in the next few
months.''
   ``The weakness suggests that people have been scared by the
stock market crash and are unwilling to take on the commitment of a
home mortgage,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources
Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   Other analysts said that unusually severe January weather had
contributed to the decline in starts last month and they predicted
better figures in coming months, particularly in view of the fact
that mortgage rates have been dropping in recent weeks.
   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages have fallen to a nationwide
average of 9.84 percent, down almost a full percentage point since
Jan. 1 and the first time they have been in single-digits since
last April.
   ``We expect housing starts will pick up in February and March.
Interest rates are lower and consumer confidence and employment
have both strengthened,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vice
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The weakness last month came from a 2.9 percent decline in
construction of single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate
of 1.01 million units.
   This drop offset a 0.8 percent increase in construction of
multi-family housing, which edged up to an annual rate of 366,000
units. That was still 35 percent below the level of activity in the
apartment sector a year ago. Activity in the apartment sector
reflects a slump that followed enactment of the new tax law, which
removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real
estate.
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of
Home Builders, said that a rate of single-family starts above 1
million still reflected strength in that sector, but he said the
overall industry was being held back by the prolonged slump in
apartment activity.
   He said multi-family construction is likely to fall further,
especially in the South, where vacancy rates are high.
   In January, construction starts fell 17.1 percent in the South
to an annual rate of 469,000 units. Starts were down an even larger
21.8 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of 223,000 units.
   Two other regions showed strength, however. Starts rose 27.6
percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of 291,000 units and
were up 21.2 percent in the West to a rate of 394,000 units.
   Building permits, considered a good sign of future activity,
fell 8.2 percent in January to an annual rate of 1.25 million
units, the lowest level for permits since January 1985. Permits had
fallen 7.4 percent in December.
   The Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production
showed the January strength came from production of non-durable
goods, which rose 0.4 percent. Production of durable goods, items
expected to last three years, showed no increase last month as a
big drop in auto and steel production offset increases in the
output of light trucks and defense equipment.

   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. dismissed his poor showing
in New Hampshire and sought support Wednesday in Southern states,
saying too much emphasis had been put on early presidential
contests.
   He also criticized fellow Democratic candidates, accusing them
of being out of touch and saying, ``I see all of the other
candidates as peas in the same pod.''
   ``This is the kickoff of the main event in this election year,''
Gore said at a conference for supporters telecast from Houston.
``This is the time we kick our campaign into high gear.''
   He made his comment about ``peas in the same pod'' earlier, in
an interview on ``CBS This Morning.'' In that same interview, he
said his rivals picked up some harmful ``political baggage in the
form of positions they adopted'' in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   In Houston, Gore said he had no regrets about skipping the New
Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses and turning his money and
attention to the South, where more than a dozen states have
contests on March 8, known as Super Tuesday.
   The Tennessee senator, who finished fifth in the New Hampshire
primary Tuesday with about 7 percent of the vote, had campaigned
little there and in Iowa, where he also did poorly.
   ``The importance of Super Tuesday is not simply in the fact that
almost half the delegates will be selected on March 8,'' Gore said.
``The importance of Super Tuesday is also in the fact that there
are people all over the United States who have been waiting to see
more power given to Democrats at the grass-roots level in the
selection of a Democratic nominee.''
   The conference was telecast to an estimated 52 locations in more
than 30 cities. About 40 supporters attended at the site of the
telecast in Houston.
   Gore said three Democratic rivals _ he later identified them as
Jesse Jackson, Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis _ ``have taken
positions on foreign policy and defense policy that are completely
out of touch with the mainstream voters in this country.''
   Gephardt, who finished second in New Hampshire and won the Iowa
caucuses, has flip-flopped on issues in his campaign, Gore said.
   ``It is now very widely known that Dick Gephardt's positions
adopted for the Iowa caucuses are just completely at odds with what
he's done in the last 12 years in the House and Senate,'' he said.
``There's a very long list; it's not just one or two positions.''
   Gore had other scheduled stops in Beaumont, Texas; Shreveport,
La., and Dallas on Wednesday as he continued his campaign in the
South and other Super Tuesday states.
   ``We're going to win it because we've conserved our resources to
aim right at the Super Tuesday states,'' he said.

   Florida's first million-dollar lottery
winner has already changed his telephone number because people keep
calling to suggest ways of sharing or investing his fortune.
   Thomas Sawyer's hands were still shaking after winning the grand
prize Saturday when a woman in the crowd handed him a pamphlet for
a charity and walked away without saying a word.
   That was just the beginning of the hassles of being a new
millionaire, Sawyer said.
   Actually, he isn't quite a millionaire. His after-tax winnings
of $800,000 were transferred into his bank account Tuesday.
   Sawyer's win was the more astounding because he never bought a
ticket, something he says he'll never do because he's opposed to
all lotteries.
   Instead, he found a ticket that had been discarded in front of
his store and sent it in to the million-dollar drawing, which
included about 460,000 other entries.
   Proceeds from the lottery are earmarked for education, and on
Wednesday, Florida's assistant commissioner of education received a
check for $46.2 million, representing the first installment. The
game has generated sales of about 300 million $1 tickets in five
weeks.
   ``It's a red-letter day for us,'' said Lottery Secretary Rebecca
Paul. ``We're extremely proud and pleased.''
   The money will be used to pay for such items as student
financial aid, dropout prevention programs, equipment, library
books and training programs for February and March.
   Lt. Gov. Bobby Brantley, who presented the check to Laurey
Stryker, assistant commissioner of education, said he wanted to
emphasize that the lottery won't generate enough money to take care
of all education needs and that Gov. Bob Martinez wants the
proceeds to be used for one-time expenses to enhance education,
rather than for operating costs.
   Since the drawing, Sawyer said his telephone hasn't stopped
ringing.
   ``I've got a few calls from charities,'' he said. ``But they're
not as big a hassle as the various investment companies. ...
Everybody says they want to help.''
   Sawyer said he had his telephone number changed Monday to an
unlisted number. But that didn't stop aggressive fortune-seekers
who somehow learned his new number.
   At home, his wife and daughters screen the calls. Several
employees do the same at his St. Petersburg paint store.
   ``There are undoubtedly a million charities worth giving to,''
Sawyer said. ``I don't question that. Everyone can't support
everything. Even the government can't do that, and they've got a
lot more money than I do.''
   Sawyer already has pledged 10 percent of the money to his church
and does not know whether he will give any of the remaining money
away.
   Sawyer said he will take advice from the accountant who has
handled his business finances for the last several years. There
will be no special consultants or high-priced investment firms, he
said.

<HEAD>PLO `Temporarily Postpopnes' Voyage to Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The PLO said Wednesday it had shelved
plans for a ``ship of return'' to take 130 deported Palestinians to
Israel, two days after the vessel was bombed in a Cyprus harbor.
   PLO officials said a last attempt to charter another ship had
failed.
   ``We have now decided to temporarily postpone the date of
sailing,'' said Sheik Abdul-Hamid al-Sayeh, president of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO legislature. He was the first
person Israel deported after capturing Arab east Jerusalem in the
1967 Middle East war.
   He told a news conference the voyage would take place ``in the
near future,'' but organizers would not mention a date. They sent
home the hundreds of people, including observers and journalists
scheduled to make the trip, who had been in Athens for nine days.
   Those involved said it may have been the largest non-violent
protest ever attempted by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Hanna Nasser, a member of the organizing committee and
interpreter for Sayeh, called the effort a success because ``it has
shown the world the amount of terrorism that is directed by Israel.
   ``It is ready to blow up a ship simply because it has
Palestinian people going on a peaceful mission,'' said Nasser, who
was president of Bir Zeit University in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank before he was deported.
   The Sol Phryne, a ferry obtained for the voyage, was damaged
Monday by a mine attached below the waterline at Limassol, Cyprus.
   PLO officials accused Israel of planting the mine, which ripped
a six-foot hole in the ferry's hull.
   Israeli officials did not deny it and Transport Minister Chaim
Corfu said that, if the PLO gets another ship, ``its fate will be
the same.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the voyage ``a declaration
of war.'' Bassan Abu Sharif, PLO spokesman, claimed earlier that
Israel made the search for a ship difficult by threatening owners
and crew members. The voyage initially had been scheduled to begin
Feb. 9 at Piraeus, the port of Athens.
   The voyage was intended to focus attention on Israel's policy of
deporting Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The U.N. Security Council declared last month that such expulsions
are illegal.
   Jordanian and Palestinian figures say up to 3,000 Palestinians
have been deported since 1967.
   On Sunday, the day before the ship was mined, three PLO officers
were killed in Limassol by a bomb planted in their car.
   Thousands of Palestinians and Jordanians attended a funeral
Wednesday in Amman, Jordan, for two of the victims, Mohammad Bassam
al-Tamimi and Mohammad Hassan Bheis. The body of the third man,
Marwan Kayyali, was taken to Lebanon for burial.

   A few leftovers from the New Hampshire
primary campaign, tales of food and love, laughs and life along the
political trail:
   First, the food. Presidential candidates have such tight
schedules they often don't get a chance to eat.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois detoured through a Burger King
drive-in for a hamburger on one swing. Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of
Arizona dined on finger sandwiches at a Head Start center.
   But Vice President George Bush ate three breakfasts within an
hour one morning _ not because he was hungry, but because the polls
had him running behind Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Bush had switched his campaign style to one of more informality,
sliding into booths with voters for pancakes at Bickford's family
restaurant, coffee at Dunkin' Donuts and anEgg McMuffin at
McDonald's.
   The next morning, on voting day in the New Hampshire primary, a
woman at the polls told Bush she had skipped breakfast to see him.
   ``I'm not having breakfast today,'' he said. ``I had three of
them yesterday.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Now, some love notes:
   Bush's son, Neil, met a young woman from Nashua named Sharon
while campaigning for his father in the New Hampshire primary eight
years ago. George Bush lost that one to Ronald Reagan, but Neil
Bush won Sharon. They were married and came back to campaign for
Bush this time.
   After Simon had telephoned Soviet refusenik Elena Keis-Kuna in
Leningrad to offer his support and best wishes, she sent him a
kiss. On that same day, Sunday, Valentine's Day, Simon campaigned
in the streets of Manchester. One of his stops was a florist's shop
where he presented his wife, Jeanne, with red roses. She gave him a
real kiss.
   Babbitt may not have won the hearts and minds of the voters in
New Hampshire, finishing sixth among the seven Democratic
candidates, but he's a winner to Hattie, his wife. Often at his
side, she would reassure him, ``You're my candidate.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It helps to be able to laugh a little, especially when you're
hurting a lot.
   While Babbitt came up a loser when the votes were counted, he
wins an award for best self-depreciating humor.
   Example: ``You know a guy came up to me in Des Moines and shook
his head and said to me, `Babbitt, you were in it right up to the
very beginning.'''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   And, you know, a candidate's gotta do what a candidate's gotta
do.
   When Alexander Haig announced his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination in Manchester, he praised New Hampshire
voters for being intelligent and for not falling for campaign
imagery.
   Then he got caught up in it himself, flying to the far north
country to remote but politically famous Dixville Notch where the
few residents grab a lot of attention in the media every primary
year by casting the nation's first votes.
   By the time those ballots went in the box this time, though,
Haig had given up his campaign.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   And it's nice to get a little help from your friends, especially
if they are heavy hitters.
   Bush brought in some for his campaign. He had Ted Williams, the
Boston Red Sox baseball Hall of Fame slugger, on his side. He also
had the GOP's Mr. Conservative, Barry Goldwater, the former Arizona
senator and the party's 1964 presidential nominee, in his corner.
   And jazz artist Lionel Hampton performed at house parties. His
vibes turned out to be good ones for Bush, who found in New
Hampshire just the note he wanted: Victory over Dole.

   Australian Craig Logan picked a crisp, cloudless
day for his first trip to the top of the Empire State Building
Wednesday. But he did it the hard way _ he ran.
   Logan led a field of 79 men and 27 women who thundered up the
stairwell to the top of the 102-story landmark for glory, fitness
and the first-place prize of a MacIntosh computer in the 11th
Annual Empire State Building Run-Up. His winning time was 11
minutes, 29 seconds.
   ``It wasn't too bad, really,'' Logan, a 26-year-old pastry chef
from Melbourne, said modestly. Still, he admitted, ``It gets a bit
boring, going around and around and around.''
   The top women's finisher was Olympic hopeful Janine Aiello, of
San Francisco, whose time of 13 minutes, 43 seconds, was 28 seconds
off her women's record in the event, set in 1985.
   Ms. Aiello, a native of Suffern, N.Y., interrupted her training
for the Olympic marathon to compete for the fifth time in the
event. ``It feels great,'' she said after her victory. ``My mom was
here, my aunts from New York. It was just so great to see their
faces.''
   Logan said he won the opportunity to compete in the Empire State
Building Run-Up by winning a similar event last August in a
56-story hotel in Melbourne. ``That one felt harder,'' he said.
   He attributed his victory in part to being the first man into
the stairwell _ no small advantage, considering the crunch of
bodies that followed him.

   Naked as the day she was poured, a nude
woman on display with 22 other sculptures in a tony art gallery is
attracting more than passing glances.
   ``You can tell she's real; look at the dirt on the soles of her
feet. It's a dead giveaway,'' one spectator said Tuesday as he
viewed the kneeling polyvinylid sculpture titled ``The Sphinx'' by
Californian John De Andrea.
   The eye-catching work is part of an exhibit showing through
March 8 at the Helander Gallery in this posh island resort.
   The $86,000 sculpture, with blue eyes, ashen hair pulled into a
loose bun and pearl earrings, ``was chosen as the window piece
because she is an exemplary of the exhibit and an excellent work of
figure,'' said gallery curator Wendy Cohen. ``Also, because we knew
the effect she would have.''
   ``The only drawback is that we have to clean the windows five
times a day because of the hand prints and noses pressed to the
glass,'' said Helander owner Bruce Helander.
   It took five painstaking months for De Andrea to cover the
figure with layers of transluscent flesh-toned paint, and add
veins, freckles and beauty marks, Ms. Cohen said.

   ``Buck Bundy'' cleared the hurdles and
pulled ahead of the pack with determination in his beady eyes. When
he crossed the finish line first, the men in business suits cheered.
   The race over, the victorious mouse and 49 other racing rodents
like him are loaded into an aquarium until the next gig.
   ``Buck Bundy'' and his friends are on the fast track for
success, judging from the way the mouse-racing business has been
going for Ron Penland, of Kansas City, Mo.
   Penland, 38, has been taking his mice on the road to entertain
at parties and conventions for 11 years. He was in Springfield
Tuesday for a meeting of the Illinois Grain and Feed Association.
   Penland, known as ``the Mouse Man,'' makes a good living calling
the mouse races. The going rate to set up the 16-foot track adorned
with cat photos in Kansas City is a minimum of $350.
   The creatures need very little training before hitting the
track, he said.
   Their colors _ gray, white, black, spotted or two-tone _ help
distinguish them during the heat of competition. Look-alike mice
get their tails colored with felt-tip markers.
   Penland says he doesn't encourage gambling, but just in case, he
posts the career winnings of the mice in each race on a posterboard.
   The entrepreneur says he has never been bitten by the mice, but
did acknowledge one job hazard: the smell, which can be as bad as
that of racing pigs.

   President Reagan is planning to name William
A. Brown, a leading expert on Soviet affairs, as the new U.S.
ambassador to Israel, a senior U.S. official said today.
   Brown, 57, now the U.S. envoy to Thailand, will replace Thomas
R. Pickering, a career foreign service officer who has served in
Tel Aviv since 1985 and is being considered for another post in the
State Department.
   Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate, Brown will play an
important role in the growing U.S. drive to promote peace talks
between Israel and Jordan.
   His job would entail trying to persuade a reluctant Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to yield territory on the West Bank in
exchange for a settlement.
   Shamir's resistance to a concession opposed by the Likud
coalition could test the diplomatic skill of the 32-year veteran of
the foreign service.
   Brown served as deputy ambassador to Tel Aviv _ the United
States does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital _ from 1979
to 1981. He is known primarily as an expert in Soviet and Asian
affairs, and as a linguist.
   Brown, a Harvard graduate and ex-Marine, speaks Russian,
Chinese, French, Japanese, Mongolian and Malay. He was a leading
contender for the ambssador's post in Moscow, probably the most
important in the foreign service, before Jack Matlock was selected
by Reagan in January 1987.
   One of the touchy angles in U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East is
the role to be played by the Soviet Union. Jordan insists on
Moscow's taking an active part, while Shamir is opposed to its
participation in consideration of an Arab-Israeli settlement.
   Shamir's two main reasons are that the Soviets generally support
Arab positions and Moscow does not have diplomatic relations with
Israel. Ties were broken by the Soviets in 1967, when Israel
defeated Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the Six-Day war.
   Last year, however, the Soviets sent a diplomatic delegation to
Israel, and a small Israeli group is likely to go to the Soviet
Union this year.

<HEAD>Congressmen to Sue Census Over Count of Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of members of Congress announced
Wednesday that they plan to sue the Census Bureau in an effort to
force the agency to delete illegal aliens from its count in 1990.
   Some 40 members of the House joined the Federation for American
Immigration Reform in announcing that the suit would be filed
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, spokesmen said at a
news conference here.
   The group contends that including the estimated 2 million or
more illegal aliens in the national head count, which is used to
distribute seats in the House of Representatives, will cause unfair
shifts of seats from one state to another.
   Census officials say they are required to count everyone by the
U.S. Constitution, which does not mention citizenship but only
instructs that the House apportionment be based on the ``whole
number of persons'' residing in the various states. That approach
was upheld by a federal court in a similar suit, brought by the
same immigration reform group, before the 1980 Census.
   Nonetheless, Dan Stein of the immigration reform federation
contended that illegal aliens should not be allowed to be part of
determining the political structure of the United States.
   Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said the Census Bureau should actually
count everyone but that it should develop a method to determine how
many people are illegally in the country, and them deduct that
number from the figures used for reapportioning Congress.
   Rep. Jan Meyers, R-Kan., suggested including a question on the
Census form asking whether respondents are U.S. citizerns.

   South and North Korea accused each other
Tuesday of planting a bomb on a South Korean jetliner that crashed
in November, killing all 115 people aboard.
   Choi Kwang-soo, South Korea's foreign minister, told the
15-member Security Council two North Korean agents put a bomb on
the plane to sabotage the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. It crashed
into the sea Nov. 29 off Burma.
   He cited the public confession in January of a Korean woman who
said she planted the bomb on orders of Kim Jong Il, son of North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung. She and a man, traveling with forged
passports, left the plane and were arrested in Bahrain, where the
man committed suicide.
   Communist North Korea's ambassador, Pak Gil Yon, claimed South
Korean agents carried out the bombing on the eve of presidential
elections to rally support for government candidate Roh Tae-woo.
Roh won the election.
   The council met at the request of Japan and South Korea for an
airing of complaints about alleged state terrorism by North Korea.
The two Koreas are non-voting observers at the United Nations.
   Western diplomats said they did not expect a resolution to be
presented because it probably would be vetoed by the Soviet Union,
an ally of North Korea.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave
unanimous approval Wednesday to legislation ratifying an
international agreement to control ozone-destroying chemicals.
   The legislation, endorsed on a voice vote, is tied to last
September's agreement by industrialized nations to cut production
of widely used chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, by up to 50 percent by
1999.
   CFCs, used as refrigerants, aerosol can propellants and
industrial solvents, migrate into the stratosphere, where they
destroy the ozone molecules that help screen the Earth from the
sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   The Montreal Protocol on CFCs is slated to take effect once it
has been ratified by 11 nations representing at least two-thirds of
the world's 1986 consumption of the CFC compounds covered under the
pact.
   The United States was a driving force behind the landmark
environmental protection agreement. Supporters are pushing for
prompt U.S. ratification as an example to other nations.

<TEXT>
   Mega-hit moviemaker Steven Spielberg was
snubbed again Wednesday by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences as a nominee best director, although his ``Empire of the
Sun'' earned six nominations.
   Spielberg, the top moneymaking director of all time but never a
winner for best director, was out of town and presumably ``has no
reaction,'' said Chris Kelly, his spokeswoman at Amblin Productions.
   Spielberg was nominated for direction in ``Jaws,'' ``Raiders of
the Lost Ark'' and ``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial.''
   Five years ago ``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial,'' the
biggest-grossing movie in history, did not win either for best
picture or for Spielberg's direction.
   Then, two years ago, and after such smashes as ``Jaws,'' ``Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``E.T.'' and the ``Indiana Jones''
adventures, it seemed Hollywood's establishment would embrace ``The
Color Purple,'' a drama fraught with social significance.
   However, Spielberg was not nominated for his direction, though
the Directors Guild of America voted its 1985 best-directed film
prize to Spielberg and ``The Color Purple.''
   This year, Spielberg was in distinguished company among the
overlooked.
   James L. Brooks was nominated for producing the best-picture
nominee ``Broadcast News'' and for writing it, but not as director.
   The directors branch of the Academy neglected Spielberg and
Brooks to reward five foreigners: Britishers Adrian Lyne (``Fatal
Attraction'') and John Boorman (``Hope and Glory''); Italian
Bernardo Bertolucci (``The Last Emperor''); Canadian Norman Jewison
(``Moonstruck''); and Swede Lasse Hallstrom (``My Life as a Dog'').
   Nominations for the 60th Academy Awards included other notable
omissions besides those of Spielberg and Brooks. Pioneering star
Lillian Gish was overlooked for ``The Whales of August.''
   Steve Martin won critical raves for his performance in
``Roxanne,'' but neither his performance nor the script he adapted
from the play ``Cyrano de Bergerac'' won an Academy mention. The
manic Robin Williams, won a nomination _ rare for a flat-out comedy
performance _ for ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
   Academy voters also resisted the high-pressure campaign for
``Nuts.'' Stars Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfus weren't among
the nominees. Also among the missing: John Lone (``The Last
Emperor''); Elaine Stritch (``September''); Maggie Smith (``The
Secret Passion of Judith Hearne''); Faye Dunaway (``Barfly''); and
director Hector Babenco (``Ironweed'').
   The Academy Awards return to the Shrine Auditorium on April 11
after a 40-year absence. The ceremonies will be televised on the
ABC network.

   All eyes turn toward Texas this week as Democratic
and Republican presidential candidates converge on Dallas for the
first major event of the Super Tuesday campaign _ the Texas debates.
   The 12 candidates who survived the New Hampshire primary have
set their sights on the 20 states holding primaries on Super
Tuesday, March 8, focusing much of their attention on Texas, which
leads the states with 183 Democratic and 111 Republican delegates.
   ``Texas is the crown jewel in this because we are the largest,''
said state Democratic Party Chairman Bob Slagle.
   The debates, which will be aired nationally on the Public
Broadcasting System from Southern Methodist University, begin
Thursday at 9 p.m. EST with the Democratic candidates. The GOP
hopefuls debate the following night.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., a Tennessee Democrat who calls Southern
states key to a presidential win, and Vice President George Bush, a
Republican candidate who maintains a Houston address, say they
welcome the chance to debate in Dallas.
   Topics likely to take center stage in the debates include
economic issues in the Southwest, including unemployment and the
energy industry.
   Bush, a former congressman from Houston who still claims it as
his home, is all too familiar with Texas issues such as energy,
immigration policy and the business climate, said Kevin Moomaw, his
Texas political director in Austin.
   ``Certainly, with a 40-year association in this state, and with
George Jr. from Midland, he understands what's going on down
here,'' Moomaw said.
   Presidential candidates with Southern ties may have the edge in
the debates, which come only two days after the New Hampshire
primary, in which Bush won the Republican race and Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis outdistanced the Democratic field.
   Gore, a Democrat, de-emphasized the New Hampshire primary and
Iowa caucuses in his strategy, concentrating his efforts on the
South.
   ``With 20 states and about 40 percent of the delegates chosen on
that day, it made sense to focus his efforts down here,'' said Tom
Jurkovich, Texas coordinator for the Gore campaign in Austin.
``Being from the region gives him an understanding of the people
and concerns. That gives him a certain edge.''
   Gore was dead last in Iowa after pulling his campaign out of
that state last year.
   ``This is our chance to counter Iowa and New Hampshire and say
those two states are too big for their britches and their britches
are not all that big at that,'' Slagle said.
   The debates are sponsored by The Dallas Morning News, KERA-TV
and Texas Monthly magazine. Roger Mudd, a special correspondent on
``The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour'' and former co-anchor of ``NBC
Nightly News,'' will moderate.
   All the candidates are expected to take part in the debate.
   ``Besides those issues, what's important is how these guys come
across, and it may be that many Texans will now start focusing on
the presidential race,'' Slagle said. ``Texans have said they want
to be able to have a say early on who the next president is.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has written the seventh
encyclical of his papacy, a major document summarizing and updating
the Roman Catholic Church's concerns for social and economic
justice.
   The encyclical, a letter addressed to church leaders, will be
released by the Vatican on Friday.
   The document is entitled in Latin ``Sollicitudo Rei Socialis,''
meaning the social concern of the church.
   John Paul announced the document himself, declaring in a speech
in December that it was being written to coincide with the 20th
anniversary of the social encyclical ``Populorum Progressio''
(Development of Peoples) published by Pope Paul VI in 1967. That
document stressed the needs of Third World countries for a better
deal from the developed world.
   John Paul said the new encyclical would ``reveal the new themes
and respond to the new problems'' of social development in the past
two decades and that he hoped the document would spur concrete
proposals for international cooperation.
   The Rome newspaper La Repubblica said the document is expected
to reflect the pope's concerns for the excesses of both the
free-market capitalist and totalitarian systems and his emphasis on
the importance of human values.
   Throughout his papacy, John Paul has stressed the human element
in the productive process, the primacy of people over things.
   This was the theme of his other major social encyclical, ``On
Human Work,'' issued in 1981.
   During a visit to Canada in 1984, he delivered an indictment of
unfettered capitalism and urged governments to re-order their
economic priorities so that human needs were put before mere
financial gain.
   John Paul was following a tradition that has seen Catholic
social teaching evolve to respond to the problems spawned by modern
industrial society.
   The encyclical ``Rerum Novarum'' (Condition of the Working
Classes) issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 defended the right to hold
private property, but insisted that material goods had to meet the
needs of all humanity.
   Paul VI's 1967 encyclical took this further as it stressed the
needs of the Third World and its economic development.
   The encyclical proposed higher taxes on the rich, regulation of
world trade, expropriation of large estates if they impeded general
prosperity, and the establishment of a world fund in which some of
the money spent on arms would be used to ease poverty in the world.
   ``Private property does not constitute for anyone an absolute
and unconditioned right. No one is justified in keeping for his
exclusive use what he does not need, when others lack
necessities,'' Paul VI wrote.
   John Paul has used his encyclicals to criticize the materialism
of communist and capitalist countries, warn that the arms race
threatens the destruction of mankind, and to condemn atheism and
Marxism.
   In addition to the encylical on work, the others were titled:
``Christ the Redeemer'' (1979), ``The Father of Mercy'' (1980)
``Apostles of the Slavs'' (1985), ``The Holy Spirit, the Giver of
Life'' (1986) and ``The Mother of the Redeemer'' (1987).

   This wealthy bedroom community could
probably field a celebrity all-star team for any sporting event,
but its days in Little League competition may be numbered because
of a shortage of adult volunteers.
   ``It seems to be a combination of parents being busy and a
little lazy,'' said Little League President Joseph Arcudi, who has
been involved in the sport for 14 years.
   ``We've only asking for a few hours each week for a 14-week
season. I've never seen such a lack of interest.''
   Westport, a community 50 miles northeast of New York City, is
home to a number of celebrities, including actors Paul Newman,
Joanne Woodward, Frank Gorshin and Sandy Dennis; and writers A.E.
Hotchner, Robert Ludlum and Frank Deford, as well as executives who
commute to the city.
   Arcudi said he plans to hold a meeting on the league's future in
mid-March to try to attract volunteers. He said he needs at least
10 more people to fill jobs such as coaches and equipment managers
for the town's program, which serves more than 330 boys age 7 to 12.
   ``If not enough people come forward, there will be no Little
League,'' Arcudi said. ``A reduced season is not any good because
kids don't learn what they should in that amount of time.''
   Steve Keever, director of Little League Baseball Inc., with
headquarters in illiamsport, Pa., said he has not heard of another
community in the country whose Little League program is in jeopardy.
   There are about 2.5 million children ages 7 to 18 who
participate in Little League in 28 countries, he said. In
Connecticut, there are 34,900 Little League players on 2,500 teams.
   Keever called Westport's situation ``too bad'' because the
youngsters ``are the ones to suffer.''
   ``If apathy is the reason, it's going to take a localized effort
to make people realize the benefits of the program so it does not
go down the drain,'' Keever said. ``Our program is founded upon
volunteers. Without them, we're nothing.''
   ``Little League is not dying,'' said Westport Little League
Secretary Linda Abraham. ``Our enrollment is up and we are not
bankrupt. There are just not enough parent volunteers to run the
organization.''

<TEXT>
   George Bush's surprising showing in the New
Hampshire primary marks a volatility in voter decision-making that
may continue to trouble pollsters as the 1988 campaign unfolds,
analysts said Wednesday.
   Pre-election polls released as late as Tuesday morning generally
missed the extent of the last-minute swing that gave Bush his
9-point victory over Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, they said. Most surveys
had indicated a dead heat.
   ``It's the timing and the volatility of this. Nothing is
anchored,'' said Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup
Organization, whose final New Hampshire poll had put Bush 8 points
behind Dole. ``There's a lot of bouncing around.''
   The problem is an old one for pollsters: Their surveys are out
of date as soon as they are completed, and cannot account for voter
turnout or for very late changes brought about by advertising or
campaign organization.
   ``For many years there has been a feeling that pre-primary
polling is hazardous to one's health, in the early states in
particular. This year, on the Republican side, that's how it was,''
said Laurily Epstein, pollster for NBC News. ``People change their
minds, and you can't poll for that.''
   Epstein and others noted that the polls had correctly tracked
trends in the race, if not anticipating the precise outcome. All
showed Bush well ahead last month, then slipping badly after Dole
and Pat Robertson beat him in the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8. They had
Dole taking a narrow lead by Friday, then Bush rebounding to a thin
edge during the weekend and Monday.
   ``The tracking polls understated the size of his win. But
tracking polls are only an indication of expectations beforehand,''
said Warren Mitofsky, polling chief for CBS News. ``The thing that
polls can do best is show you direction. It showed the direction,
the movement to Bush the last few days.''
   The final CBS News-New York Times survey, done Sunday and
Monday, had a 4-point lead for Bush, 34 to 30 for Dole; The final
result was within the survey's margin of sampling error of 6
points. The last ABC-Washington Post poll, with results from
Saturday through Monday, had it 32 to 30 for Dole; the Boston Globe
had it 31-30 for Bush, and the Boston Herald-WBZ poll had it 32-30
for Bush. NBC News eschewed late polling.
   The greatest gap was for Gallup, whose last poll, done from
Friday to 4 p.m. Sunday, had Dole with 35 percent and Bush with 27.
Kohut said the dichotomy between that poll and the Bush-Dole result
would prompt changes at Gallup: later polling, if possible, and
greater sensitivity to the vagaries of candidates' support.
   In retrospect, Kohut said, two-thirds of Bush's backers had told
Gallup they supported the vice president strongly, while only half
of Dole's supporters said they felt strongly about him. The finding
was an indication of Bush's ability to turn out his vote, and
Dole's weakness in that area.
   ``We knew Bush's support was strong and Dole's was soft, but we
didn't put enough emphasis on that,'' Kohut said. ``The lesson is
that even if a front-runner's lead seems stable, it remains
vulnerable to last-minute changes if it is soft. Not pointing that
out was a real failure on our part.''

   Rival political groups clashed during
regional elections in Sulu province, and rebels ambushed a police
patrol in northern Luzon. At least 33 people were killed in the
incidents, the government said Wednesday.
   Suspected communist rebels killed eight Philippine Constabulary
troopers and wounded 10 others in Mountain province during the
Tuesday ambush, a constabulary report said.
   It said one rebel was believed killed but his body was carried
away by his comrades.
   The government-run Philippine Information Agency said at least
25 people were killed and 50 others injured during fighting in Sulu
that began three days prior to last Monday's regional elections.
   The military sent 4,000 troops, helicopters and warships to the
province to guard against election violence. Sulu was the last
province to hold regional balloting that began Jan. 18 but was
delayed by political violence.
   Also Wednesday, Israeli Ambassador Meir Gavesh told The
Associated Press he did not believe his embassy was the target of a
grenade that exploded Tuesday night outside the building in which
his embassy is located.
   The embassy is on an upper floor of the Philippine Savings Bank
building in suburban Makati.
   Police said the grenade broke windows but caused no injuries.
Another grenade that failed to explode was found on the ground
floor. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Communist rebels threatened earlier this month to retaliate
against Israelis in the Philippines because of Israel's purported
support for the government's anti-insurgency campaign. Israeli
diplomats deny their country is involved in the fight against the
rebels.
   Also on Wednelsday, an underground organization of pro-rebel
priests and nuns accused the Roman Catholic church of abandoning
its mission to serve the poor by supporting President Corazon
Aquino's ``total war policy'' against communist insurgents.
   ``By giving blessings to the total war policy of the U.S.-Aquino
regime, the reactionary church leadership betrayed us all whom they
are supposed to serve,'' the Christians for National Liberation
said in an advertisement in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
   The group is a branch of the communist-dominated National
Democratic Front. The statement followed recent charges by Cardinal
Jaime Sin, archbishop of Manila, that communists had infiltrated
the church's social welfare agency.

<HEAD>Bush Says His N.H. Victory Strategy Will Work In The South</HEAD>

   Vice President George Bush said Wednesday he
is ``absolutely convinced'' the presidential campaign strategy that
carried him to victory in New Hampshire will work in the South.
   ``We stayed on those issues. We don't have to change a single
thing,'' Bush told campaign staff workers a day after beating Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas, his chief rival for the GOP presidential
nomination, in New Hampshire.
   Bush denied he had misstated Dole's positions on taxes, an
oil-import fee and arms control in negative ads that flooded New
Hampshire's airwaves.
   After he finished behind Dole and Pat Robertson in the Feb. 8
Iowa caucuses, Bush revamped his basic stump approach and scrapped
a heavy-security campaign style to mix and mingle with voters in
New Hampshire, the first primary state.
   Bush also sought in the days before Tuesday's balloting to avoid
direct clashes with Dole, although his commercials charged Dole
straddled the fence on several issues.
   Asked to respond to Dole's claim that he had lied about the
Senate GOP leader's record, Bush replied, ``I think I said it
wasn't true, but I'll be glad to.''
   ``You all want me to talk about Senator Dole. I want to talk
about the issues,'' Bush said. ``You want to talk about history. I
want to talk about the future.''
   ``I'm not going to dwell on it,'' he said. ``You see, I don't
want to be drawn into something like that. Keep it (the campaign)
on a high plane. Talk about the issues. People in New Hampshire
like clean campaigns and they endorsed me overwhelmingly.''
   ``The system worked. You can take them in the chin, you can get
up and you can fight again,'' Bush said. ``So now, go on to Super
Tuesday. We're going to fight hard.''
   Bush commented to reporters as he prepared to leave Thursday on
the first of several trips into the South, the focal point of the
Super Tuesday competition.
   Bush tentatively planned trips to Missouri and Texas on
Thursday, while aides spoke of a possible trip to South Carolina on
the same day.
   Bush hopes to win the March 5 primary in South Carolina, giving
him a boost as he heads into the March 8 round of 16 GOP primaries
and caucuses _ with 700 delegates at stake _ including a dozen
primaries in the South. There will be 2,277 delegate votes at the
GOP national convention, with 1,139 needed to win the nomination.
   Bush said he felt the ``grass-roots'' campaign approach used in
New Hampshire would appeal to voters in the South.
   But he also said ``we're taking nothing for granted. We're going
to take a positive message _ a message that was good in New
Hampshire and is just as good. ... It's just as good as we go
South. I'm absolutely convinced of that.''
   Barbara Pardue, a Bush campaign spokeswoman, said the vice
president will continue his new-look campaign strategy of meeting
and greeting voters. ``A lot more people to people,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ship Runs Aground; Iran Says U.S. Cutback is `Defeat'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

   A Japanese-owned auto carrier ran aground
in the Persian Gulf on Wednesday, and although there were initial
fears it had struck a mine, divers determined it had only scraped
its bottom.
   Iran, meanwhile, reacted to the announced cutback in U.S. naval
forces in the region by saying the move represented a defeat for
American ``militaristic policy.''
   At a news conference, Assistant Defense Secretary Richard
Armitage confirmed that the battleship Iowa and two escort vessels
had left the Arabian Sea in recent days and the helicopter carrier
Okinawa was about to depart from the gulf.
   Tehran radio, monitored in London, said the pullout showed ``the
ineffectiveness of Washington's policies in the Persian Gulf ...
and the disgraceful defeat of futile military moves carried out in
support of the Iraqi regime and reactionary Arab countries and in
the form of direct action against (Iran's) Islamic revolution.''
   It said Washington was searching for a way to withdraw without
losing face for itself or its European allies, a reference to the
five countries that joined last year's buildup of forces to protect
commercial shipping from Iranian mines and attacks.
   The 4,842-ton motor vessel Prosper World was heading out of the
gulf after delivering a cargo of new cars when it ran aground.
   Initial reports from shipping sources in Dubai quoted the
captain of the Liberian-flag ship as reporting an explosion and oil
leak. Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London later said
flatly that the Prosper World had ``hit a mine'' 12 miles off the
coast.
   Divers who inspected the ship informed its captain, a South
Korean, that he had ``just run aground, and the whole bottom plate
was wrinkled.''
   The ship, owned by the Masumoto Shipping Company of Hyogo,
Japan, was believed in no danger and was heading for a drydock for
further inspection and repairs, the sources said.
   No vessel is reported to have struck a mine in the Persian Gulf
since the small ocean survey ship Marissa I, flying the Panamanian
flag, was blown up off Saudi Arabia on Sept. 4. Four crew members
died.
   Since then, senior officers of the United States and other
Western navies have declared the threat from mines sown by Iran
``under control'' and have ordered a reduction in the number of
mine-hunting vessels in the gulf.
   Armitage, in his meeting with reporters, disclosed that Iran,
for the first time in recent memory, had used one of its
U.S.-supplied F-14 Tomcats in a combat role, shooting down an Iraqi
fighter-bomber with an American-made Sidewinder missile. Previous
F-14 activity had been limited to reconnaissance, he said.
   The F-14 was one of 10 remaining from the late Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi's air force. Armitage gave no details, but it
apparently was involved in a dogfight on Feb. 8, when Iran claimed
it shot down three Iraqi jets.

<TEXT>
   The uncle of a Marine lieutenant colonel
kidnapped in Beirut on Wednesday said he expects his nephew will
act like an officer and a gentleman.
   ``He loves his country. He is capable of standing up as well as
an ordinary man will under the circumstances. ... I don't think
they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his
country in any way. I think he would die first,'' said Delbert
Eagle, uncle of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   Higgins' father, William F. Higgins, was extremely ill in a
Louisville hospital Wednesday. His sister, Mary Fisher, was with
the elder Higgins and asked not to be disturbed. The Pentagon said
Higgins had come home this fall on emergency leave to visit his
father.
   The Pentagon said Higgins, 43, was on temporary detail serving
as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's Lebanon
Observer Group.
   U.N. sources said Higgins was kidnapped in the late afternoon on
the coastal highway between Lebanon's southernmost port of Tyre and
the border town of Naqoura, site of the U.N. force's headquarters.
   Higgins' family lived in Garrard County in central Kentucky when
he was born and later moved to Louisville, where he was graduated
from Southern High School in 1963. Much of his leisure time was
spent with his uncle.
   ``He fished a lot with me. He drove me from time to time. He
drove me to California once, to Florida, down south a couple of
times. We were pretty close together as he grew up,'' said Eagle,
86, a former circuit court judge.
   ``Yes, he wanted to be in the military service. He always talked
about wanting to go to the military service. He wanted to go to
West Point,'' Eagle said.
   He was appointed to West Point, but elected instead to study at
Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC scholarship. He was
commissioned a 2nd lietenant when he graducated in 1967, with a
business degree.
   He later earned masters' degrees in human resources management
at Pepperdine University in California and in political science at
Auburn in Alabama.
   A high school friend said students at Southern were surprised
when Higgins went into the Marines.
   ``You think of the Marines as being macho-type, and he really
wasn't like that. But he seems to have done all right at it,'' said
Rudy Fischer, now a lab technician at Rohm and Haas Chemical Co. in
Louisville.
   ``He was involved in a lot of social activities, played football
and was one of the top students in the class,'' Fischer said.
``Just pretty much an average guy.''
   Ralph Allen, an assistant principal at Southern High School, was
a math teacher there when Higgins attended and was also a neighbor.
   ``He was a top student and very active in school. He played on
the football team. He came from a good family and was well liked,''
Allen said.
   Eagle said Higgins was more studious than athletic but was a boy
who ``liked to hunt and fish and romp in the woods.''
   Higgins is married to Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, who works at
the Pentagon. He has a 17-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.

<HEAD>Campaigns Scramble For Cash as Super Tuesday Looms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the biggest primary day in history three
weeks away, presidential campaigns are hoarding their cash and
searching for more to pay for campaigning and television
advertising time in the 20 Super Tuesday states.
   Sen. Paul Simon said bluntly on Wednesday that his presidential
campaign cannot continue unless he draws more money. By contrast,
well-heeled Democrat Michael Dukakis has $4 million available for
the most pivotal date of the 1988 primary season on March 8.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, straining for the Republican nomination against
better-funded opponents, said his campaign is in the black and
counting on his third-place showing in New Hampshire to help boost
fund raising.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who relied on this year's federal
matching funds to pay off sizable debts, said Wednesday that money
is not a problem for him at this point.
   ``We're raising money at a good clip,'' he said.
   Gephardt will need a good influx to remain competitive with
Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn. in the South.
   Gore is not as flush as Dukakis, but has already has a big media
jump on his opponents, thanks to his strategy of concentrating on
the South while his opponents vied on the battlefields of Iowa and
New Hampshire.
   Last week Gore launched a $1 million-plus TV campaign across the
country.
   ``We will outspend every other candidate toward Super Tuesday,''
deputy press secretary Paul Risley said. He declined to give an
overall spending figure, but said said the campaign has $2.2
million in cash on hand and intends to spend a minimum of up to $3
million on media alone toward Super Tuesday.
   He said the current Gore commercials, featuring a biographical
message, are running in 14 South and border states and nationwide
on Cable News Network and other cable stations.
   Dukakis, who has concentrated considerable resources on the
delegate-rich Super Tuesday states of Florida and Texas, has $4
million in the bank, deputy press secretary Steven Akey said
Wednesday. He said the campaign's media buys had not been decided
yet for Super Tuesday, but that several fund-raising events are
scheduled and, ``We have the resources to go the distance.''
   Despite Simon's successful fund-raising events in Boston and in
New York last week, where $140,000 was raised on the heels of his
second-place finish in Iowa caucuses, his campaign has debts of
nearly $500,000, said his press secretary, Terry Michael.
   ``I have to win either in South Dakota or Minnesota, and we have
to get additional campaign contributions. Those two things have to
be there, otherwise, I'm going to have to withdraw,'' Simon said.
   Simon spokesman David Carle later tried to paint the financial
picture more positively.
   He said Simon hoped to raise $150,000 at four events in Chicago
on Wednesday night. Another event was planned Thursday morning in
St. Louis, and a ``very, very good'' response was coming from the
48,000 solicitation telegrams the campaign sent out to capitalize
on the Iowa results, he said.
   ``These two weeks are shaping up to be record-breaking for the
campaign,'' in terms of money, Carle said, estimating a total of up
to $600,000 might be raised.
   Babbitt, who is to announce Thursday whether he will continue
his struggling presidential bid, will end up about $150,000 to
$200,000 in debt if he drops out now, said his press spokesman Vada
Manager.
   He said the campaign has about $30,000 in cash on hand, and that
contributions ``slowed to a trickle'' after Babbitt's poor showing
in the Iowa caucuses last week.
   ``After New Hampshire, it's going to be worse,'' he said.
   On the Republican side, Kemp ended the year seriously in debt
but said his campaign has raised $300,000 a week for the past five
weeks, and is now operating in the black, thanks also to some $3.9
million in federal matching funds he received since Jan. 1.
   He said he intends to hit up his list of 110,000 contributors in
a fund-raising push for Super Tuesday.
   Super Tuesday could mean budget-watching of a different type,
with the well-heeled Vice President George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole and
former TV evangelist Pat Robertson budgeting to keep spending low
enough so they can save their big cash caches for states that come
later.
   Bush has raised $20.4 million so far and has a series of
fund-raisers scheduled to reach the campaign's goal of $33 million,
said treasurer Fred Bush. Although the campaigns are limited by law
to $27 million in overall primary campaign spending, legal and
accounting costs are exempted from the limit.
   Bush, with $8 million in the bank, is not worried about the cap,
however, said spokeswoman Ede Holiday. Although he had spent more
than $13 million by the end of the year, only $7.9 million was
applicable against the ceiling.
   Dole was well-situated with $4.1 million in available cash and
no outstanding debts, said campaign spokesman Tim Archie.
   Pat Robertson, on the other hand, had spent $12.4 million
against the cap, and Dole spent $9.5 million against it by the end
of 1987.
   Well-funded campaigns must budget carefully so they can spend
enough on the later states without going over the $27 million limit.

   Soviet firefighters overseen by Americans
extinguished a fire Wednesday in the U.S. Embassy, the aging
building the United States has been unable to abandon because of
bugging devices that riddle a new structure.
   About 150 embassy employees were evacuated and sent home for the
day, embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert said. No one was injured.
   U.S. Embassy officials said Soviet firefighters were called to
put out the fire in an unoccupied fifth-floor residential section
after they decided embassy personnel couldn't extinguish it on
their own.
   The Soviets responded promptly and were ``escorted at all times
by American employees,'' inside the building, said Gilbert, who
briefed reporters in the wet snow outside the mustard-colored
embassy's main door after the fire had been brought under control.
   The 10-story embassy building, on busy Tchaikovsky Street near
the center of Moscow, has been the source of controversy for more
than a year.
   Last spring U.S. officials said they had determined a new
eight-story red-brick office building directly behind the old one
could not be occupied immediately because of Soviet listening
devices apparently installed during construction.
   The $191 million structure already was five years behind
schedule at the time. Proposals have included razing part or all of
the new structure, or building a new office to house communications
and secret operations.
   U.S. Reps. Dan Mica, D-Fla., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said in
April that the old embassy building rented by the United States
since the early 1950s was a ``firetrap and unsafe by accepted
standards for general working conditions.''
   A renovation of the building has been under way since then.
   Gilbert said the fire ``might be construction related,''
although its cause has not been determined. It apparently started
near a stairwell, he said.
   He said there was no damage to the main working areas of the
embassy, which begins on the sixth floor.
   Embassy Second Secretary Michael Hurley, who was in his
eighth-floor office at the time of the blaze, said the smell of
smoke increased before he evacuated.
   ``Somebody came through shouting excitedly, `There's a fire,
everybody out of the building!''' Hurley said.
   He said he locked up his safe and left the building by a stairs
that normally is closed. ``The lower I went, the more smoke I could
see,'' he said.
   ``People were excited, but there was an orderly exit,'' Hurley
said.
   Embassy employees gathered in the rear courtyard to watch the
blaze. ``Flames were leaping out of the building. Obviously it was
a very hot fire, and it was coming out of one window,'' Hurley said.
   Ambassador Jack Matlock was away from the embassy at the time
but was alerted and returned to the site, Gilbert said.
   Last fall, employees underwent fire drills conducted by State
Department experts, Hurley said.
   Viktor Kononov, Moscow's fire chief, told the Tass news agency
that firefighters responded in four minutes to a call from one of
the Soviet guards who are stationed outside the embassy.
   He said U.S. guards ``wouldn't let us in for about five minutes
more: they were apparently waiting for clearance from senior
officials.''
   Firefighters found ``three rooms and a small hallway with traces
of uncompleted repairs were on fire, with flames enveloping tables,
chairs and construction garbage,'' he said, adding that it was
extinguished in 20 minutes.
   A more serious fire hit the top floors of the building in 1977,
and officials said afterward the damage was severe because
Ambassador Malcolm Toon refused to permit Soviet firefighters to
enter the top-security embassy communications center and some of
its most sensitive work areas.
   Last spring, a scandal erupted around charges that U.S. Marine
guards had permitted Soviet agents inside secret areas of the
embassy.
   The charges never were proven, but Marine Sgt. Clayton Lonetree
was convicted in August of espionage for giving the Soviets embassy
floor plans and the identities of U.S. intelligence agents after he
had become sexually involved with a Soviet woman.

<HEAD>Education Minister Whose Policies Sparked Protests Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alain Savary, whose policies as education minister
in 1984 caused street protests and a change in Socialist
governments, died Wednesday at age 69.
   A Socialist Party statement said Savary had been hospitalized
for several weeks with a serious infection, but did not give the
cause of death.
   Savary proposed a bill in the National Assembly in 1984 to carry
out President Francois Mitterrand's campaign promises to revamp the
system of private education.
   Among its provisions, the complex reform bill gave local
authorities more control over management and finances of private
schools. It also gave teachers in those schools the option of
retaining their status or choosing civil service status, and linked
state subsidies to the number of teachers who preferred the change.
   Nearly 16 percent of France's 12 million school children attend
private schools, of which 94 percent are Roman Catholic and heavily
subsidized by the state.
   The Savary Law inflamed passions for months. Opponents felt it
threatened their right to choose how their children would be
educated. Supporters wanted to hold Mitterrand to his promise to
create ``a unified, secular public education service.''
   More than 1 million people joined daylong demonstrations across
France on June 24, 1984.
   Pierre Mauroy, then premier, said the reforms had been ``totally
misunderstood'' but the Socialists withdrew the bill.
   Jean Pierre Chevenment replaced Savary as education minister and
Mauroy gave way as premier to Laurent Fabius.
   Savary, who was in the French Resistance during World War II,
had a reputation for being soft-spoken but stubborn.
   He was a leader in the government formed just after liberation
and a member of the National Assembly, and held ministerial
positions under President Charles de Gaulle and in other
governments.
   Born April 25, 1918, in Algeria, then a French colony, he was a
strong advocate of decolonization of Africa.
   Lionel Jospin, secretary of the Socialist Party, said Wednesday:
``He represented socialism, with his strong sense of morality, his
sense of justice and his commitment to the decolonization.''

   U.S. industrial production edged up 0.2
percent in January despite big declines in auto production and
steel, the government said Wednesday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said that the January increase was
just half the 0.4 percent gain recorded in both November and
December.
   Private analysts said this slower growth was consistent with
their view that the economy will slow considerably in the early
part of 1988 as businesses work off a backlog of unsold inventories
built up during the final three months of 1987.
   Strength in domestic production helped push the overall economy,
as measured by the gross national product, to a robust annual
growth rate of 4.2 percent from October through December. However,
nearly three-fourths of that strength went into inventories rather
than final sales.
   Analysts said this backlog will have to be worked off in coming
months and will translate into an extremely sluggish economy in the
first three months of this year.
   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, a private
forecasting firm, said that the smaller rise in industrial
production was consistent with this view.
   ``We are seeing a slowdown in domestic demand, not only for
cars, but other consumer durables and this will hold down
industrial production even though we are getting some offsetting
strength from stronger export sales,'' he said.
   Some economists are predicting GNP growth could be an actual
negative number from January though March, but most expect growth
will resume in the spring, keeping the country out of a recession.
   ``We are seeing that while the economy is slowing down, things
are not stopping. We think we will have sluggish growth in the
first half of the year but no recession,'' said David Wyss, senior
financial economist at Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   The January increase in industrial production, the fourth in a
row, left output 6 percent above where it was a year ago, providing
further evidence of the rebound manufacturers are enjoying as the
weaker dollar boosts U.S. exports to record levels.
   The Reagan administration is counting on the export strength to
keep the country out of a recession this year.
   Output in the manufacturing sector rose 0.2 percent in January
following a much larger 0.5 percent December advance.
   The strength came from industries producing non-durable goods,
where production rose by 0.4 percent.
   Output of durable goods, items expected to last at least three
years, showed no change at all in January.
   Production of cars fell by 7.4 percent in January to an annual
rate of 6.5 million units. The impact of this fall was offset in
part, however, by an increase in production of light trucks and
mini-vans, which have now captured about one-third of the U.S.
consumer market.
   Also contributing to the weakness last month was a decline in
iron and steel production, which fell back following a sharp rise
in December.
   The mining industry suffered a 0.6 percent drop in January, the
second consecutive monthly downturn. This sector, which includes
oil and gas well drilling, has been battered by depressed
conditions caused by falling world energy prices.
   The utility sector had a big 1.3 percent increase in January,
reflecting colder-than-normal weather which drove up the use of
electricity and natural gas.
   The various changes left the industrial production index at
133.8 percent of its 1977 base of 100.

<HEAD>Court: Humane Society May Sue To Stop Hunting On Federal Preserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday revived a
lawsuit challenging the expansion of hunting on federal wildlife
preserves when it ruled the Humane Society had legal standing to
bring the case.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
overturned a district judge's finding that the Humane Society of
the United States lacked the requisite legal standing to sue the
Interior Department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlife
preserves.
   ``The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting on
wildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpses
and environmental degradation, in addition to depleting the supply
of animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view,'' the court
said in an opinion written by Judge Patricia Wald, chief judge.
   ``These are classic aesthetic interests, which have always
enjoyed protection under standing analysis,'' Wald wrote.
   David J. Hayes, a Washington attorney who represented the Humane
Society, called the decision significant because ``it confirms that
environmental groups like the Humane Society have the right to
bring actions based on their members' concerns about harms to their
aesthetic interests.''
   An appellate decision upholding the dismissal of the lawsuit by
U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Flannery ``would have made it
difficult for any wildlife group to bring suit for the protection
of wildlife,'' Hayes said.
   While ruling the society had a legal right to sue, the court
upheld the Interior Department's decision to allow waterfowl
hunting on Chincoteague Island, Va.
   The appeals court sent the case back to Flannery to rule on the
merits of the Humane Society's claims that the Interior Department
had not properly evaluated the wildlife populations of other
preserves before allowing hunting.
   James Goodrich, executive vice president of the Wildlife
Legislative Fund of America, Inc., a hunters' group, said he was
disappointed by the court's decision. But he predicted that hunting
would be upheld at the other preserves.
   ``On a single refuge, the appeals court said that everything was
proper in permitting hunting. Assumedly that would apply to all
other refuges,'' Goodrich said.

   A note purportedly written by the
kidnappers of two U.N. relief workers said Wednesday the captives
were linked to an intelligence agency and would be freed only if
proven innocent of espionage.
   The Swedish foreign minister disputed the allegations in the
letter.
   The note, handwritten in Arabic and delivered to a Western news
agency in Beirut, said hostages Jan Stening of Sweden and William
Jorgensen of Norway would be released ``only after they are proven
innocent from the charges against them.''
   ``We announce to everybody that Swede Stening and Norwegian
Jorgensen are involved with the secret service of a foreign country
and this is becoming clear through investigation of them,'' it said.
   The two employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency,
which cares for Palestine refugees, were abducted by gunmen on Feb.
5 near the south Lebanese port city of Sidon.
   The relief agency blamed the abduction on Palestinians acting
individually without political motivations or links to any
organization. Palestinian leaders have denounced the kidnappings.
   The note, which did not identify the kidnappers or give a date,
carried what were said to be the thumbprints and signatures of
Stening and Jorgensen.
   A similiar note said on Saturday the kidnappers were
interrogating them but made no specific accusations against them.
   ``We remind everybody we are not aiming at causing harm to our
steadfast people. We appreciate the services of (the UN agency) and
call on them to be patient until the time comes for us to reveal
all the information,'' the note said.
   ``We tell everyone who claims he is able to release them within
a specific time or that the whereabouts of the hostages is known
that their release will only take place when they are proved
innocent of the charges against them,'' the statement said.
   Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said the information in
the letter ``is incorrect and false.''
   ``One reason for this is that Stening, with an impeccable
service record in both Sweden and UNWRA, not could have lent
himself to anything like that,'' he said. ``Secondly I think the
kidnappers need a motive that can be accepted by those who put
pressure on them to release the hostages. That's why they make this
up. This is a product of fantasy.''

<TEXT>
   The Oregon Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
a motorist arrested on a drunken driving charge must be given a
chance to call a lawyer before deciding whether to take a breath
test.
   An arrested driver has a right under the Oregon Constitution to
a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before deciding
whether to submit to a breath test, the court said in a unanimous
decision.
   The court, noting that evidence of blood-alcohol content
dissipates with time, said police aren't required to wait for a
long period of time before administering the test.
   But the opinion didn't hand down any iron-clad rules on what
will amount to a ``reasonable'' time to allow motorists to contact
attorneys.
   A footnote to the opinion said, however, ``A period of 15
minutes after the request to take the test has been made will
doubtless suffice in most cases.''
   The decision was the Supreme Court's third in seven years on the
issue of whether suspected drunken drivers have a right to legal
advice before making a decision on a breath test.
   Refusing to take a breath test carries an automatic 120-day
driver's license suspension under state law.
   In 1980, the Supreme Court said in a 4-3 ruling that arrested
drivers were entitled to consult atorneys before deciding on breath
tests.
   A divided court in 1981 overruled that decision, saying denial
of access to legal counsel didn't require supression of breath test
evidence.
   The court Wednesday overturned that decision, basing its ruling
on a provision in the state constitution giving anyone accused of a
crime a right to obtain legal counsel.
   ``The evanescent nature of the evidence the police seek (from
breath tests) may justify substantially limiting the time in which
the person may exercise his or her ... right, but it does not
justify doing away with it,'' the court said in an opinion by
Justice Michael Gillette.
   As a result, defendant Ronald Spencer's breath test findings
can't be used as evidence against him. Spencer was arrested by a
Lane County sheriff's deputy on May 4, 1985, and taken to the
county jail. His request to consult a lawyer before deciding on a
breath test was refused.
   His case was returned to the district court for trial.

   Abbas Ali Hamadi told an
acquaintance ``we have kidnapped a West German'' after a foreign
businessman was abducted in Beirut last year, according to
testimony Wednesday in Hamadi's trial.
   Hamadi is charged with the January 1987 kidnapping of Rudolf
Cordes and another West German in Beirut.
   The abductions were allegedly carried out to pressure Bonn to
free Abbas Hamadi's brother, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is being held
in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which an
American sailor died.
   Federal investigator Klaus Pruefer testified that an
acquaintance of Abbas Hamadi, Hamsa Kassim, told police the
defendant informed him that Cordes had been kidnapped.
   According to a police statement, Kassim quoted Abbas Hamadi as
saying by telephone from Beirut, ``We have kidnapped a West
German.''
   Excerpts of Kassim's statement to police were read on Wednesday.
   In one excerpt, Kassim said Hamadi told him that Mohammed Hamadi
was arrested because ``He was one of the kidnappers of the American
TWA'' jetliner.
   Kassim told police that Abbas Hamadi made that statement Jan.
14, 1987, one day after his 23-year-old brother was arrested at
Frankfurt airport carrying explosives.
   The following week, Cordes and another West German, Alfred
Schmidt, were kidnapped in Beirut.
   Last week, Schmidt testified that Abbas Hamadi was not among the
gunmen who kidnapped him from his Beirut hotel Jan. 20. He said
Abbas Hamadi was older and taller than the men who abducted him.
   Schmidt was released in September in what his kidnappers said
was a goodwill gesture. Cordes is still being held.
   Last year, West Germany rejected a U.S. request for the
extradition of Mohammed Hamadi in the TWA hijacking. West German
authorities last week charged him with murder and air piracy, the
same charges he would have faced in the United States. A trial date
has not been set.
   A third West German citizen, Ralph Rudolf Schray, was kidnapped
in Beirut three weeks ago in an apparent attempt to increase
pressure on West Germany to release the Hamadi brothers.
   No one has claimed responsibility for that kidnapping.

<HEAD>Babbitt Rethinking Campaign After Finishing Sixth</HEAD>

   Bruce Babbitt says he has appropriated
Hamlet's dilemma: ``To be or not to be.''
   The former Arizona governor was talking Wednesday about the
possibility of ending his two-year, long-shot presidential bid. He
said he would give his answer on Thursday, but fellow Democratic
candidate Jesse Jackson was already angling for his support if he
should drop out.
   Babbitt aides said privately that he was unlikely to endorse
anyone, at least for now.
   Babbitt finished sixth of the seven major candidates in the
Democratic New Hampshire primary, edging Gary Hart by less than a
thousand votes.
   At a news conference before flying to Washington, Babbitt told
reporters, ``I won't waste your time playing Hamlet for more than
24 hours, but I'm sure going to do it for 24 hours.'' He said he
would make up his mind after speaking with advisers and his family.
   In the closing days of the New Hampshire campaign, Babbitt had
appealed directly to voters to keep his campaign alive.
   He talked Wednesday of the possibility of staying in the race to
try to force debate among the Democratic contenders, to make them
face up to issues such as the federal budget deficit.
   ``There will be a lot more debates,'' he said, ``and all you
need to get into those debates and keep people honest and talk
about the future is the price of a plane ticket. Even Bruce Babbitt
can raise the price of a plane ticket.''
   In an interview with CBS-TV Wednesday, Babbitt said, ``There are
some mornings, you know, I wake up in a Motel Six in some small
town that I don't even know the name of. I'm on the phone that
night to my kids _ obviously they miss me, I've been away too long.
Those are the down moments. Then you're on the phone begging for
money to meet the payroll and you say, `Why did I ever get into
this?'''
   Despite these regrets, Babbitt retained the optimism that has
driven his candidacy for two years.
   ``There are worse things than losing,'' he said. ``The worst
thing of all would be to lose having had nothing to say, not having
made a difference.''
   Babbitt said Gary Hart has urged him to stay in the race and
that Jackson has asked for his support if he quits.
   He and Jackson ``share a lot of experience'' from the 1960s,
Babbitt said, including the civil rights movement. But he said he
told Jackson his request was premature.
   ``Jesse, it's awfully early,'' Babbitt quoted himself as saying.
``I'm not ready to make any decision.''
   Jackson, who finished fourth in New Hampshire, said Wednesday,
``I hope I gain his support.''
   A Babbitt endorsement ``would obviously broaden the base of my
campaign,'' he said.
   Babbitt's New Hampshire showing was worse than his finish in the
Iowa caucuses, where he was fifth.

   Another Dukakis entered the race, actress
Holly Hunter slept through the broadcast and Steven Spielberg
wasn't talking after Wednesday's Oscar nominations were announced.
   ``Like my cousin, I'm in the running and now I'm waiting for
`Super Monday' in April,'' said Olympia Dukakis after her
supporting actress nomination for ``Moonstruck'' was announced.
   Hours earlier, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the
Democratic New Hampshire primary.
   Nominees were announced at dawn in Beverly Hills by actress
Shirley MacLaine and Robert Wise, president of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The timing was tailored for live
East Coast network coverage.
   Miss Dukakis' reaction to her nomination was captured by
``Entertainment Tonight'' TV cameras. ``Broadcast News''
writer-director James L. Brooks was dressing in a Berlin hotel when
he learned of the film's seven nominations.
   Tony Huston was awakened at his Beverly Hills home by publicist
Sheila Barr and told about his best screenplay nomination for ``The
Dead.'' His father, director John Huston, died last year while
working on the film.
   Tony Huston recalled his father's advice years ago to another
Oscar nominee who didn't know what to say to reporters. The senior
Huston said: ``Don't say _ listen.''
   Albert Brooks was in the Southern California desert writing the
screenplay for his next movie when he heard he'd been nominated in
the best supporting actor category for his role as a TV reporter in
``Broadcast News.''
   ``I'm on my way out to see the movie again to see what they are
talking about,'' Brooks said through manager Herb Nanas.
   ``Broadcast News'' writer-director Brooks was at the Berlin Film
Festival and was told of the seven nominations in a telephone call
from publicist Pat Kingsley. Brooks also was overlooked in the
director category.
   The publicist said Miss Hunter was asleep hours after her
nomination was announced.
   Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci said his nomination for
``The Last Emperor'' was ``like passing exams at school _ the
sensation of becoming an adult.''
   ``I think this is the victory of a film that only wants to be
cinema, that is not intimidated by television, that believes in the
great screen, in cinema as the cathedral of collective
imagination,'' Bertolucci said in Rome.
   Best director nominee Adrian Lyne said he still finds it tough
to believe people liked his movie ``Fatal Attraction.''
   ``I got up early, fearing and trembling, watching the live thing
on CNN,'' Lyne said. When the movie came up in category after
category, ``I was bouncing up and down with my wife and the dog.''
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Glenn Close, nominated for her role as a
vengeful, psychotic woman in ``Fatal Attraction,'' which she said
``represents the work of an extraordinary team of people.''
   Miss Close was at her New York country home when informed about
her nomination.
   Douglas, best actor nominee for ``Wall Street,'' sat in the den
of his New York apartment to watch the announcement of his first
acting nomination on television.
   ``I watched this morning and I looked at the names and
photographs of my fellow nominees and it made me not only proud for
our film `Wall Street' but it reminded me what a wonderful part
(writer-director) Oliver Stone had created,'' Douglas said.

   Thailand and Laos agreed Wednesday to a
truce and disengagement in a disputed, sparsely populated border
area where hundreds of their soldiers have been killed since
November.
   The agreement was reached after two days of talks in Bangkok
between military teams led by Thailand's army commander, Gen.
Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth, and the Laotian chief of staff, Gen.
Sisavat Keobounphan.
   ``We have agreed to end the fighting and stop the bloodshed,''
Sisavat told reporters.
   ``Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth and I have agreed that, from now
on, our supreme commands will wage no more war, end all clashes in
the air, along rivers and along the Laos-Thai border. Let that
border represent friendship and peace.''
   Chaovalit told a separate news conference the talks created ``a
basis for the establishment of improved ties. In the future, force
will not be used to settle differences. Let the Mekong River
(boundary) not only stand for friendship and peace but also signify
an important bond.''
   A joint statement said the nations ``expressed their sincere
determination to put an end to the clashes and bloodshed in the
area.'' The small, hilly area in dispute lies between Thailand's
Phitsanulok province and the Sayaboury province of Laos, about 250
miles north of Bankkok.
   Both sides claim it on the basis of a 1907 French-Thai treaty
and internationally recognized maps.
   The statement said the cease-fire would begin at 8 a.m. Friday
(8 p.m. Thursday EST) and a joint military coordinating group would
monitor the truce and disengagement.
   It said the agreement had created an atmosphere conducive to
political negotiations and both delegations would ask their
governments to begin talks on resolving the border question within
15 days after the cease-fire starts.
   Hundreds of soldiers have died in ground and artillery battles
and strikes by Thai air force F-5E jet fighter-bombers since the
military conflict began in November. Thailand also claims dozens of
Vietnamese were killed fighting on the Laotian side.
   The four-man Laotian team arrived from Vientiane on Tuesday
after Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda of Thailand accepted a
proposal of talks made by the Laotian premier, Kaysone Phomvihane.
   Air Vice Marshal Sommot Sundaravej said Thailand had suspended
air strikes since Tuesday morning because of the negotiations.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Come Away From New Hampshire With Glory But Few

   Winning the New Hampshire primary gave little
more than bragging rights to Vice President George Bush and
Democrat Michael Dukakis, as each came away with just a handful of
national convention delegates.
   Bush, who picked up 38 percent of the Republican vote in the
primary, gained 11 of New Hampshire's 23 delegates to the GOP
national convention. In all, Bush now has 61 delegates.
   Dukakis, who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in the
Tuesday primary, won nine of the state's 18 pledged delegates to
the national convention. The Massachusetts governor has 44.5
delegates.
   The lift from the early primaries and caucuses is more
psychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1,139
delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination or
the 2,082 delegates for the Democratic nomination.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas gained seven
delegates in New Hampshire Tuesday to bring his national total to
42, while Rep. Jack Kemp of New York won three delegates to raise
his total to 35.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the winner of last week's
Iowa Democratic caucuses, gained six national convention delegates
for his second-place showing in New Hampshire, and Sen. Paul Simon
of Illinois followed with three delegates. In the popular vote in
New Hampshire, Gephardt won 20 percent while Simon had 17 percent.
   Gephardt now has 39 delegates, while Simon has 33.
   Under Democratic Party rules, the national convention delegates
were awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15
percent of the vote. In effect, that disqualified Jesse Jackson,
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt and former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart from receiving any
delegates from New Hampshire.
   Jackson won 8 percent of the vote, Gore 7 percent, Babbitt 5
percent and Hart 4 percent.
   New Hampshire Republicans have a similar rule, but the threshold
is 10 percent. That meant former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, who
had 10 percent, picked up two delegates, but former television
evangelist Pat Robertson, who was within 1,100 votes of du Pont,
received no delegates because he had just 9.5 percent of the vote.
   Robertson already had eight delegates, while du Pont had none
before Tuesday's primary.
   Among the Democrats, Gore already had 10.55 delegates, Jackson
had 9.8 and Babbitt had four.
   The delegate totals for the Republicans include results from
Michigan, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Guam. Although
Iowa and Hawaii both have held GOP caucuses, precise delegate
figures cannot be calculated until later because of the way the
selection process is structured.
   The Democratic totals include results from Iowa and New
Hampshire, as well as an Associated Press survey of Democratic
governors and Democratic National Committee members who will serve
automatically as delegates to their party's convention. Some of the
Democratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention.

<HEAD>Dying Leukemia Victim's Brother Rejects Plea For Help

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leukemia victim's long-lost brother has rejected
pleas to determine whether his bone marrow is compatible, dashing
the patient's best hope for survival.
   ``If he dies, he dies. He's about as much a brother to me as you
are,'' Randy Jeff Chapman told a reporter for The Miami News.
   Chapman, 31, ran away from home when he was 17 and lives on the
streets here, working as a test subject for medical experiments. He
refused to undergo tests that would check if he could donate marrow
to his brother, Steve Chapman, 38, of Oolitic, Ind. Chapman has
another brother and sister who have already been tested and found
incompatible.
   The older brother suffers from acute leukemia and said he will
die within two years unless a marrow transplant succeeds. He is now
receiving blood transfusions and chemotherapy at St. Vincent's
Hospital in Indianapolis.
   While his leukemia is in remission, his doctor said a marrow
transplant should be performed within four months.
   After reading an earlier News article about Steve Chapman's
efforts to locate his brother in Miami, a friend of the younger
Chapman called the newspaper and told them Chapman's whereabouts.
   A reporter found Chapman at the downtown Dade County Public
Library Tuesday.
   ``I'm not even going to consider it,'' he said of the marrow
donation request. ``If I sound cruel, well, that's the way I feel.
I'm not a very forgiving person.''
   He said testing to see if his marrow is compatible with his
brother's might interfere with a drug experiment in which he is
going to participate starting Monday at the University of Miami.
   ``That's how I make my living,'' he said.
   Contacted at his hospital room, Steve Chapman said his brother's
decision disappointed him.
   ``He must have turned into a hard person,'' he said. ``I guess
that's what living on the street does to you. I thought he would at
least try to help, but that's the way things go.''

<HEAD>Weatherman Clears Up Marijuana Mistake After Wind-Blown
Windbreaker Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GILBERT, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television weatherman had some
explaining to do after a windbreaker with a container of marijuana
in its pocket blew out of his helicopter and was recovered by some
junior high school students.
   Jerry Foster of NBC affiliate KPNX in Phoenix said he found a
canister of the drug Tuesday while filming near the Salt River
earlier in the day.
   He said he made arrangements to turn the marijuana over to
Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies, but first he had to stop by the
school to film preparations for a flag-raising ceremony, so he
stuck in it in his jacket.
   Foster, an honorary deputy, said he didn't notice the black
nylon windbreaker missing until he was already at the sheriff's
office.
   ``Apparently the jacket just blew out (of the helicopter). I
never did see it go,'' he said.
   Ironically, the jacket was found by two students from nearby
Mesquite Jr. High, which is sponsoring a ``Just Say No'' to drugs
program this week. They turned it over to Gilbert police.
   ``The Gilbert police officer wanted me to explain and I did,''
Foster said. ``He called the sheriff's department and they backed
me up.''
   Sgt. Jay Ellison said Foster reported finding a small canister
of marijuana, a .32-caliber pistol and some other items when he
landed to change film near the river.
   Foster said he placed the canister in the jacket so it wouldn't
spill.
   Gilbert Police Sgt. Steven Olsen said the marijuana would be
turned over to the county.

<HEAD>NH Results Raise Spectre Of Deadlocked Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Hampshire's primary results produced a new
flurry of speculation on Wednesday that the Democratic presidential
campaign might end without a clear winner, leading to a deadlocked
nominating convention next summer.
   But Democratic party chairman Paul Kirk predicted, ``we're going
to have a first-ballot winner'' among the current contenders.
   It was New York Mayor Ed Koch who responded to the New Hampshire
returns by saying that delegates to the Democratic convention would
draft either New York Gov. Mario Cuomo or New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley.
   ``I believe there will be a draft,'' he said. ``The strategy,
which was not a strategy to begin with but which is working
marvelously, is not to come in but to be drafteed at the
convention.''
   Bradley has consistently said he is not interested in entering
the 1988 presidential race, while Cuomo has said he is not a
candidate but has not flatly ruled out a late entry.
   The governor on Wednesday had kind words for virtually all the
seven Democratic contenders, but told reoporters it was still ``too
early'' for him to bestow his endorsement on any of them.
   ``There's a long way to go,'' he said.
   Cuomo's support has been sought avidly by several of the
Democratic hopefuls in advance of the April 19 New York primary.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis scored a decisive triumph in
the New Hampshire primary, with Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt a
distant second and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon just behind him in
third place. The outcome, which had been expected, left the field
without a clear front-runner and with a crowded roster of
candidates heading into the delegate-rich primaries and caucuses
ahead.
   But Kirk, speaking with reporters in Washington, said, ``the
players who are on the field, that's where the game's going to be
won.''
   Kirk said he had no doubt the field of candidates would begin to
shrink as the primary season runs its course.
   ``I don't believe for a minute that you'll have six candidates
running neck and neck right down to the convention. As we move down
to the final innings, you'll see signs of a final person
emerging,'' he said.
   Walter F. Mondale's 1984 campaign manager, political consultant
Robert G. Beckel, said he thought it appeared less and less likely
that any of the seven Democratic candidates would arrive at the
nominating convention with enough delegates to claim a victory on
the first ballot.
   ``I believe there will be brokering,'' he said, meaning that the
front-running candidates at convention time would need alliances
with their rivals for enough delegate support to win.
   But he said that didn't mean a draft candidate emerging.
   ``If they're going to negotiate with anybody they'll negotiate
with each other,'' he said of the current contenders.

<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorcycle and moped riders in Nebraska
will be required to wear helmets starting next year under a
controversial bill passed in the Legislature Wednesday.
   The bill, which passed on a 25-20 vote, takes effect Jan. 1,
1989. Sen. Dan Lynch, the measure's sponsor, said Gov. Kay Orr
would sign the legislation, which includes a penalty of $50 for
failure to wear a helmet.
   During the floor debate, about 70 spectators in the gallery _
many wearing motorcyle jackets and club colors _ applauded when
Sen. Ernie Chambers characterized the bill as one that ``should've
been left in the graveyard of bad bills.''
   The visitors appeared stunned and quiet after the vote.
   The bill was passed after Lynch withdrew a 14-page amendment
that would have required safety education for motorcycle riders.
   Lynch said 45 states have motorcycle laws, including 19 that
require helmets for everyone. He said Rhode Island requires a
helmet for passengers and 20 other states have so-called ``limited
requirement laws,'' usually having to do with the age of the
motorcyclist.
   Gov. Kay Orr has confirmed that she will sign the measure into
law.

<HEAD>After 17 Weeks, Westies Racketeering Case Goes to the Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury began deliberating racketeering
charges Wednesday against six men and two women accused of
belonging to the Westies, a gang of thugs that allegedly terrorized
Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood for 20 years.
   The case, which has featured graphic accounts of killings and
dismemberments, went to the jury after nearly four months of
testimony and more than a week of closing arguments.
   The panel worked for about 4{ hours before breaking off
deliberations for the night.
   A 14-count racketeering indictment charged the eight defendants
were members of a criminal enterprise that seized control of the
West Side neighborhood and held sway there for nearly two decades
through a series of killings and other violent crimes.
   Prosecutors also contended the Westies trafficked in drugs,
counterfeit money and stolen goods, engaged in loansharking and
extortion and killed people who got in their way.
   Prosecutors Mary Lee Warren and David Brodsky said the Westies
had committed a series of killings that included dismembering the
victims' bodies in order to enhance their reputation and eliminate
competitors.
   The indictment listed the names of 10 alleged co-conspirators
who had been killed before the charges were brought in March.
   The defense argued most of the evidence is based on the
uncorroborated testimony of informers who were themselves killers,
thieves and drug dealers.
   The main prosecution witness, Francis ``Mickey'' Featherstone,
said he had been ``the right-hand man'' of reputed Westies boss
James Coonan.
   Featherstone, who has admitted committing three homicides
himself, testified he helped Coonan conduct a loansharking business
and was present at a 1978 meeting when the Westies agreed to work
with the Gambino organized crime family.
   He also linked Coonan to the killing and dismemberment of a
recalcitrant loanshark customer.
   On cross-examination by Coonan's attorney, Gerald Shargel,
Featherstone acknowleged being in and out of mental hospitals in
the 1970s, lying under oath in the past and suffering psychotic
episodes.
   Shargel and other defense lawyers also denied even the existence
of an organization called the Westies.
   Even government witnesses conceded the name Westies was created
by the police and news media to describe a group of mainly
Irish-American hoodlums on Manhattan's West Side.
   In addition to Coonan, and his wife Edna, 44, both of Hazlet,
N.J. the defendants are: James ``Jimmy Mack'' McElroy, 42; William
``Indian'' Bokun, 30; John Halo, 36; Richard ``Muggsy'' Ritter, 50;
Thomas Collins, 53, and his wife, Florence, 52, all of Manhattan.
   All face a maximum penalty of 20 years each if convicted of
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, the most serious charges.

<HEAD>Additional 500,000 Tons Of Wheat Sold To USSR</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An additional 500,000 metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat has been sold to the Soviet Union, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The sale, equal to about 18.3 million bushels, was handled by
Artfer Inc., 150,000 tons; Union Equity Cooperative Exchange,
150,000 tons; and Cargill Inc., 200,000 tons.
   At recent prices averaging $2.82 per bushel, the wheat would
have a farm value of about $52 million.
   Nearly 5.7 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to the
Soviet Union under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP, for delivery in the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said an additional 1.2 million tons
of wheat are still available to the Soviet Union under current EEP
authorization.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   Sims said the subsidies, or bonuses, averaged $27.48 per ton on
the latest sales, or about 75 cents per bushel. The subsidies for
the Soviet Union have been available only for wheat.
   The sales also are part of the grain the Soviet Union is
committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term
agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9
million tons of U.S. grain. The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases include a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have
the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or
soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _
up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans, or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   In addition, 1.67 million tons of U.S. corn, 800,000 tons of
soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by
the Soviets for delivery this year.

   Leaders of white supremacist groups
gathered in 1983 to discuss poisoning the water supplies of New
York and Washington, D.C., and establishing an Aryan nation in the
place of the present U.S. government, federal prosecutors charged
Wednesday.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Snyder outlined the meeting in his
opening statement to jurors hearing the trial of 14 men, all linked
with supremacist groups, charged with conspiring to overthrow the
government or kill federal officials.
   Defense attorneys contended that the issue in the trial was
freedom of speech. One of the defendants, presenting his own
opening statement, told the jury, ``You're about to get a great
civics lesson.''
   A jury of 12 whites was selected for the trial Tuesday. Because
the trial is expected to last about three months, Judge Morris S.
Arnold seated six alternate jurors, rather than the usual two.
   According to Snyder, James Ellison, who is in prison, discussed
a poisoning scheme in 1983 at an Aryan Nations convocation in
Hayden Lake, Idaho, with Richard G. Butler and Robert Miles.
   Butler, 69, of Hayden Lake, and Miles, 63, of Cohoctah, Mich.,
are among 10 defendants charged with seditious conspiracy, which is
conspiring to overthrow the government by force.
   Butler is the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian
(Aryan Nations), while Miles is a former Ku Klux Klan official
convicted in 1973 in the bombing of empty school buses in Pontiac,
Mich.
   Ellison, whose name is on the government's list of witnesses, is
the former leader of an Arkansas-based militaristic supremacist
group named The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord.
Officials raised the group's compound in 1985 and seized weapons
and a 39-gallon drum of sodium cyanide.
   At the time of the 1983 meeting, Ellison had more than 200
pounds of sodium cyanide in his possession, Snyder said.
   At that same conclave, several supremacist leaders discussed the
idea of abolishing the U.S. government and setting up an Aryan
state, Snyder said.
   Louis Ray Beam Jr., 41, of Houston, a former Texas Klan leader
and another of the defendants, told the 1983 conference that the
time had come for war, Snyder said.
   Snyder said Beam told his audience that ``the anti-God
slithering homosexual'' dwelt in Washington, D.C., and warned, ``If
you don't help me kill them ... you're going to have to beg for
your child's life, and the answer will be `no.'''
   Miles made a speech urging the use of robberies to finance
supremacist activities, Snyder said, and six holdups during the
next 18 months netted supremacists more than $4 million.
   Ellison ``sent a paper around to be signed,'' and when it came
back signed by the leaders, Ellision said, ``All of us today
entered into a conspiracy against the government of the United
States,'' Snyder said.
   The prosecutor said no one disagreed with Ellison's statement
and ``the meeting ended with the Nazi stiff-arm hail victory
salute.''
   Butler's attorney, Everett D. Hofmeister, G. Butler, told the
jury that freedom of speech was at stake in the trial and quoted
the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes as saying
freedom of speech includes ``freedom for the thought we hate.''
   ``The whole nation is watching you,'' Hofmeister said. ``What
are the limits of freedom of speech? Even the speech we hate? It is
an aweesome responsibility that you have.''
   Beam, in his 90-minute statement, said that ``if the government
will admit that the Constitution is dead and there is no freedom of
speech, I'm guilty. But if our Constitution still exists, I'm not
guilty.''
   Beam said he was ``under the impression I could say whatever I
wanted to say in this country. In fact, at one time I fought for
that right. That's why I'm here. Some of my views are unpopular.''
   He also contended Snyder's account was a ``good story, but
that's all it is'' and he knew nothing about any such conspiracy.
   Snyder said the supremacists viewed whites as the people of God,
Jews as ``the spawn of Satan,'' and blacks as sub-human. The
government was called ZOG, for Zionist Occupation Government.
   Two defendants, William Wade and his son, Ivan Ray Wade, both of
Smithville, enlisted the aid of Ellison's group to murder a federal
judge and an FBI agent who had been involved in the prosecution of
people who harbored tax protestor Gordon Kahl, Snyder said. In
1983, Kahl, wanted in the killings of two federal marshals in North
Dakota, was killed in a shootout near Smithville at a home on land
owned by William Wade.
   The Wades wanted the CSA to take action against Judge H.
Franklin Waters, the chief judge of the Western District of
Arkansas, and FBI agent Jack Knox ``to show the people that
patriots can't be pushed around,'' Snyder said.
   A group headed out of the CSA compound on Dec. 26, 1983, to
carry out the killings, but backed out after a van in which four of
them were riding went out of control on a snowy road and collided
with a pickup truck, Snyder said.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Hope Gore Won't Dominate Super Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders, uncertain which
presidential candidate their members like but unwilling to accept
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., are hoping to prevent the Tennessean from
upstaging the other Democrats in the Super Tuesday round of
primaries in three weeks.
   Although Gore carries an 88 percent pro-AFL-CIO lifetime voting
record, unusually high for a Southern Democrat and ahead of Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt's 83 percent pro-labor record, some union
political directors say they are having trouble slating members as
Gore delegates to the Democratic national convention.
   Gore has just 85 union members running as delegates to the
convention next July in Atlanta from the eight states whose filing
deadlines have passed, compared with 255 for Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois, according to information provided by six presidential
campaigns to the AFL-CIO.
   Labor delegate totals for the the other five Democratic
candidates from all eight states were incomplete, but the figures
that were available indicated that Gephardt and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis were slating trade unionists in about equal numbers
with Simon except in the South, where Jesse Jackson appeared
strongest.
   More laborites want to be Gore delegates, but his campaign is
the only one that is actively shunning their support, according to
some union political directors.
   ``He's not going after labor at all,'' complained Rachelle
Horowitz, political director for the American Federation of
Teachers. ``The people he has running his campaign are 1976 Jimmy
Carter types. They're not slating labor people.''
   Ms. Horowitz, who openly favors Dukakis and is one of 42
automatic labor delegates to the convention as members of the
Democratic National Committee, is counting on Jackson to win
between four and six of the 20 primaries and caucuses on March 8 to
thwart Gore's Southern strategy.
   Labor leaders here are counting on Jackson's strong showing in
the South to keep Gore out of first or third place in the
post-Super Tuesday delegate counts and throw the race into the
industrial state contests in Illinois, Michigan, New York,
Pennsylvania and Ohio where unions are strongest.
   ``As a trade unionist, of course I'd rather see it decided in
the industrial states,'' said Robert A. Georgine, president of the
federation's 4-million member Building and Construction Trades
Department.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Wednesday he can still call
the 91 presidents of the federation's member unions together to
make a pre-convention endorsement if it appears any one candidate
is beginning to garner overwhelming support among union members.
   ``The essential criteria is the same, at least a two-thirds
consensus,'' he said. ``But I'm not going to force it, and I'm not
going to invent it either.''
   While acknowledging their personal favorites, most union
presidents on the federation's 36-member policymaking executive
council said none of the candidates has yet to muster that kind of
support among their members.
   William Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union, the AFL-CIO's third largest with 1 million members,
doubts there will be an endorsement.
   ``We can't change the fact that no individual has emerged,'' he
said. ``Our Iowa locals got together and endorsed Dukakis, but it
wasn't a very strong endorsement. I would bet that Jesse Jackson
got a lot of UFCW votes in Iowa.''
   The AFL-CIO's early endorsement of Walter Mondale in 1984 helped
save his campaign after he lost the New Hampshire primary that year
to Gary Hart of Colorado. But it also enabled Mondale's opponents
to tag labor as a ``special interest'' candidate and created a
backlash among many union members.
   Exit polls showed only about half the voters from union
households pulled the lever for Mondale in the general election _
far short of the two-thirds majority support that the AFL-CIO
claimed that its endorsement represented. Union leaders here are
intent on avoiding a repeat of that.
   ``We're damned if we do and damned if we don't,'' said Richard
Kilroy, president of the Transporation Communications Union and
head of a coalition of 15 rail unions. ``We may well go into a
brokered convention, and that's not a bad thing as far as we're
concerned. Obviously the best thing to do is not force a
consensus.''

<HEAD>Reagan Pork-Barrel Hit List to be Purely Symbolic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's hit list for congressional
pork-barrel spending will be released next week _ but not as the
cutback legislation he promised in his State of the Union address,
congressional sources said Wednesday.
   Instead, Reagan's list of cuts will be made in a symbolic
statement of what he would do if granted his longstanding wish for
authority to veto individual items in appropriations bills. The
cuts would have no legal effect unless Congress takes up the cause.
   Barbara Clay of the president's Office of Management and Budget
said she was not certain a decision had been made.
   But Republiocan sources on Capitol Hill said OMB Director James
C. Miller III told them this week the list would not be in the form
of rescission bills.
   ``It's going to be a package of suggestions from the
president,'' said one GOP leadership aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The new strategy could help avoid election-year clashes
with Republican lawmakers who won spending projects last year, the
aide said.
   A high-ranking OMB official said the form of the request was not
important, ``It's how much noise you make.'' The official, who
demanded annoymity, said in either case he doubted Congress would
go along.
   The change in tactics appeared to be a retreat from the
president's nationally televised address last month. The speech
included a pitch for the line-item veto, which would allow him to
reach into Congress' mammoth spending legislation and cut out items
he considered wasteful.
   Reagan cited cranberry, blueberry and crawfish research along
with other items that he would cut if given the chance.
   ``In 30 days, I will send back to you those items, as
rescissions, which if I had the authority to line them out, I would
do so,'' the president told the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   The OMB has been drafting the list, which could total $4
billion. Most of the targeted items were contained in the $600
billion catchall spending bill approved at the end of last year's
session.
   By proposing rescissions, Reagan could freeze spending on those
items for 45 days and give procedural advantages to those in
Congress supporting his effort. After the 45-day period, the
spending would be restored unless the rescission were approved.
   Any lawmaker is allowed to propose rescission legislation, but
without the president's impetus the path to passage is more
difficult.

   Richard Gephardt focused on South
Dakota Wednesday in an urgent search for a primary victory, even as
he contended second place in New Hampshire was good enough to put
him in a two-man Democratic presidential race with Michael Dukakis.
   ``I don't think there really is a true front-runner today,''
Gephardt said. ``It's a tough race now, I think, in the rest of the
country between Dukakis and Gephardt. ... I think that's really
what this race is going to boil down to.''
   Gephardt spoke as he left Manchester, N.H., for Rapid City and
Sioux Falls, S.D., to trumpet an endorsement by Democratic Sen. Tom
Daschle in a state where next Tuesday's primary does not guarantee
delegates.
   Gephardt's claim to a two-man nomination battle overlooked two
other Democratic candidates who have staked much of their hopes and
spent much of their time in the looming delegate battleground of
the South _ Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr.
   It also ignored Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, whose campaign limped
into neighboring Minnesota after back-to-back narrow losses to
Gephardt in New Hampshire and Iowa.
   Gephardt's leading rivals were campaigning in the South for much
of what is to be a three-week campaign there. His focus instead was
on a far less significant state on the primary calender, where the
Democratic primary Tuesday is a ``beauty contest'' in which voters
state a preference that does not commit convention delegates.
   Gephardt was scheduled to visit South Dakota during six of the
next seven days. He was gambling on a victory that would attract
attention and make him look like a winner heading toward March 8
when nearly one-third of the Democratic delegates are at stake.
   ``I think I can do well here,'' Gephardt said in an interview.
``In order to do that I have to get my message across and see
people.
   ``This is just the way we think the time can be best spent to
get the delegates, to get the results, we need,'' he said.
   He was also contesting Wyoming's caucuses, where 13 delegates
are at stake on March 5.
   ``We're doing a lot of South Dakota and Wyoming shuttling,''
said Ali Webb, Gephardt's press secretary.
   She called them gateway states to Super Tuesday and said they
``are very important to us.''
   Gephardt strategists said they decided not to contest three
other states holding contests during the next three weeks _ Vermont
aod Maine, where Dukakis figures to be strong, and Minnesota, where
Dukakis and Simon are campaigning.
   The congressman attended a rally with Daschle in Sioux Falls and
toured a financially troubled electronics assembly plant in Rapid
City, where he attacked unfair trade practices by Japan.
   Gephardt has purchased $40,000 worth of television commercials
in South Dakota, a significant amount in the state of just 700,000
people. Gore and Dukakis are already on the air here.
   Gephardt polltaker Ed Reilly contended that because of intensive
television coverage of the candidates whereever they are Gephardt
can campaign in South Dakota and Wyoming and still attract
attention in the process in the Southern states where so many
delegates are at stake.
   ``Time spent doing media markets in the South is an well-spent
in these states _ there will be a focus on these events,'' he said.
   Gephardt won 20 percent of the vote Tuesday in New Hampshire's
leadoff primary, behind Dukakis who finished with 37 percent.
   It was far from a victory, but Gephardt celebrated as if it were
one because he ran ahead of fellow Midwesterner Simon and the rest
of the field. Simon had predicted he would best Gephardt in New
Hampshire, and his third place finish with 18 percent put him in
danger of being unable to raise the money necessary to sustain his
indebted candidacy.
   Gephardt said Gore and Jackson ``will be tough opponents in the
South.'' But he portrayed himself as better able to take the battle
to the rest of country with his message of foreign trade sanctions
and no tax increases for low and middle-income people.
   Polls have shown Gephardt ran particularly well among
blue-collar and union voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, and he is
likely to bid for those voters in the South.
   ``Trade, energy and agriculture are strong issues in the
South,'' he said. ``Those are issues I've defined and I think we're
going to do well there.''

<HEAD>Emissions Of Lead Take Sharp Drop in 1986</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emissions of lead into the atmosphere took
another sharp drop in 1986 due to the reduction of lead in
gasoline, according to the annual air pollution report released
Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Though most of the six major pollutants showed only minor
changes from the year before, lead emissions fell 59 percent, an
even sharper drop than the 47 percent seen the year before,
according to the report.
   Another sharp decline was seen in peak quarterly concentrations
measured by the 82 instruments in EPA's lead monitoring network.
The average maximum quarterly reading fell 35 percent.
   Lead emissions peaked in 1976 at 169,000 tons, of which 146,000
tons came from the gasoline burned in cars and trucks, according to
EPA's estimates. Starting in 1975, most new cars could not use
leaded gasoline because it would disable the new exhaust pollution
equipment, and all new cars had to use lead-free gasoline in 1980.
   Emissions fell to 44,200 tons in 1984, and the following year
EPA started its two-year reduction of permissible lead
concentrations in gasoline from 1.1 gram per gallon to 0.1 gram.
That reduced emissions to 23,300 tons in 1985 and 9,500 tons in
1986.
   Some major companies have stopped selling leaded gasoline as a
smaller number of older cars each year may legally use it. Its
share of the market shrank from 31 percent in 1986 to 26 percent in
1987.
   ``I would predict a continued dramatic improvement'' in next
year's annual report, said Craig Potter, EPA's assistant
administrator for air programs.
   EPA has proposed removing the last lead from gasoline, but
action on that has been stalled by the fears of farmers that they
will ruin old but still vital farm engines that need leaded
gasoline.
   Lead is a poison, causing kidney and brain damage in high enough
concentrations. EPA believes there is new evidence it raises blood
pressure, at least in men.
   It is also the cheapest way to boost gasoline octane, and before
engine manufacturers switched to hardened valve seats in 1971-1975,
many engines relied on lead deposits to lubricate valves _ the
point that worries farmers.
   EPA said 4.5 million people, unchanged from the previous year's
report, lived in counties where the airborne lead concentration
standard is violated.
   Those violations came near smelters. The report listed these
eight cities where the standard of 1.5 micrograms per cubic meter
was exceeded for a quarter. The figures are the peak quarterly
average, in micrograms per cubic meter, near the smelter and the
peak reading in a residential area.
   Philadelphia (1.72, 0.14); St. Louis (5.70, 0.35); Minneapolis
(2.09, 0.14), Seattle (1.82, 0.26), Indianapolis (2.49, 0.14);
Birmingham, Ala. (2.30, 0.30); Gary, Ind. (1.81, 0.16) and El Paso,
Texas (1.57, 0.58).
   There were no surprises elsewhere in the report, and EPA said it
had not changed its estimate that about 100 million people live in
counties where one or more concentration standards is violated.
   Here is a rundown of the other major pollutants, with emissions
from 1985 and 1986, followed by average concentrations in EPA's
monitoring networks.
   _Carbon monoxide, from 70.9 million tons to 67.1 million tons
and from 7.19 parts per million to 7.21 parts per million in the
second-highest eight-hour average, a blip upward EPA considers no
real change at all. The standard is 9.0 ppm. Carbon monoxide can
worsen heart problems since it displaces oxygen in the blood.
   _Sulfur dioxide, from 23.8 million tons to 23.4 million tons and
from 88.5 micrograms per cubic meter to 86.4 micrograms averaged
over the year. The annual standard is 80 micrograms. Sulfur dioxide
causes breathing difficulties and can turn into acid rain. EPA has
revised upward slightly its estimates of emissions over the last
nine years.
   _Volatile organic compounds like unburned gasoline that form
ozone, from 22.4 million tons to 21.5 million tons. Ozone
concentrations fell from 0.127 ppm to 0.123 ppm, measured as the
second-highest one-hour reading.
   _Nitrogen dioxide, which also causes breathing problems, helps
form ozone and can be transformed into acid rain, from 21.7 million
tons to 21.3 million tons and from 0.0251 ppm to 0.0248 ppm,
measured as an annual average. The standard calls for 0.053 ppm.
   _Smoke, dust and soot, what EPA calls ``total suspended
particulates,'' from 7.7 million tons to 7.5 million tons and from
48.5 micrograms per cubic meter to 48.4 micrograms. This is the
last year total suspended particulates will be listed as a
pollutant. EPA is switching to counting as a pollutant only the
fine particles that penetrate the lung.

   The Marine officer kidnapped in Lebanon is
one of at least 15 Americans on U.N. duty assigned to serve in a
land so dangerous for U.S. citizens that the State Department
declared it off-limits in 1987.
   The Pentagon says American officers chosen for the duty are
under U.N. command and it has no control over where they serve.
   Gunmen stopped the car of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, 43, on a
south Lebanon road Wednesday and abducted him. Sources in Lebanon
said he was returning from talks with officials of a moderate
Shiite Moslem militia near the port city of Tyre.
   Twenty-four other foreigners, including eight Americans and two
Scandinavian U.N. officials abducted earlier this month, also are
missing, most believed to be hostages of Shiite extremists.
   Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, has been held longest. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The United Nations said Higgins is one of 17 Americans in the
76-person truce observer group attached to the U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, or UNIFIL. The Pentagon put the number of Americans at
15 or 16, and neither could account for the discrepancy.
   Not all observers are on duty at a given time. Timur Goksel,
spokesman for UNIFIL in Lebanon, said only six Americans actually
were in the country.
   One U.N. official said some governments have understandings
about where their citizens serve peacekeeping or observer duty, but
the United States apparently did not in the case of Lebanon. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States is not involved in UNIFIL, the peacekeeping
organization to which Higgins' group is attached, but it has 36
officers on observer duty in various posts with the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization, a 299-member force known as UNTSO
commanded by Gen. Martin Vadset of Norway.
   Higgins is the senior American in UNTSO. He had been on U.N.
duty in the Middle East since June 1987 and assumed command of the
observer group in Lebanon in mid-January, said Mario Zamorano, a
spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   UNTSO was established in 1948 to monitor a truce the Security
Council ordered between Israel and Arab nations, and was the first
U.N. peacekeeping organization in the Middle East. Its observers
are not armed.
   Now serving with the organization are officers from the United
States, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile,
Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the Soviet Union.

   A bus plunged off a roadside cliff and down a
steep ravine in the high Andes, killing 15 passengers and injuring
four, police said Tuesday.
   The crash occurred Monday afternoon near the town of Pallasca in
Ancash state, about 300 miles northeast of Lima, police said. The
bus had started from Lima and only had 15 miles more to go before
reaching its destination, the town of Conchucos, police said.
   It was not known how many people were aboard the privately owned
bus.
   Police were investigating the cause of the accident.
   Heavy rains usually weaken Peru's mainly dirt and gravel
mountain roads this time of year, causing more accidents.

   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., still trying to
steer his party to a candidate who could unseat Democratic Sen.
Daniel P. Moynihan, suggested Wednesday that if Rep. Jack Kemp were
to quit the GOP presidential race, he should run for New York
senator.
   But Kemp spokeswoman Mary Brunette said Kemp has ``absolutely no
intention of quitting the presidential race.''
   ``We are on the move and I think it's kind of absurd for Sen.
D'Amato to make that suggestion, although we appreciate his
support,'' Ms. Brunette added.
   D'Amato's suggestion _ first made late Tuesday on WCBS radio in
New York _ came after Kemp scored a respectable third place in the
New Hampshire priamry, behind Vice President George Bush and Sen.
Bob Dole.
   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and ex-television evangelist
Pat Robertson trailed.
   ``I wouldn't be presumptuous to urge Jack to drop out of his
presidential race,'' D'Amato said in an interview Wednesday. ``I
think he owes it to his party, to himself, to those who support
him, to compete for the presidency as long as he feels he has a
chance to win.
   ``But if he chooses to withdraw, now or even after Super
Tuesday, he can make an outstanding candidate and I think a winning
candidate for the U.S. Senate.''
   D'Amato said he had not discussed the idea with Kemp, and that
it had only just occurred to him.
   Moynihan spokesman Matt James, asked about D'Amato's suggestion,
replied: ``You've got our poll results.''
   He was referring to a survey by Moynihan's campaign taken the
first week of February, showing that if Kemp were to challenge
Moynihan, the incumbent would be favored by 60 percent of the
voters statewide while Kemp would be the choice of 24 percent.
   Eight hundred voters were questioned statewide, James said.

<HEAD>House OKs Malpractice Suits by Active-Duty Military Personnel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Wednesday to allow medical
malpractice lawsuits against the federal government on behalf of
active-duty military personnel who suffer injury or death because
of negligent care at military hospitals.
   The Reagan administration opposes the bill, sponsored by Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., on the ground that it would restrict a
longstanding Supreme Court doctrine that the government is not
liable for service-related injuries to members of the armed forces.
   The House approved the bill on a 312-61 roll call after voice
votes approving a $300,000 ceiling on the government's liability
and rejecting a proposal to make the bill's provisions retroactive
to Jan. 1, 1986. The bill now goes to the Senate.
   A virtually identical bill passed the House by a 317-90 vote in
1985 but the Senate never acted on it.
   The House-passed bill Wednesday would cover permanent military
hospitals but would exclude treatment at field hospitals or
hospital ships and claims stemming from combat activities or
foreign jurisdictions.
   The measure also would prohibit claims for mental or emotional
disabilities unless they resulted from a physical injury.
   Frank is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
administrative law and governmental relations, which had heard
numerous witnesses testify about medical malpractice involving
active-duty military personnel at military hospitals.
   Active-duty servicemen represent about one-third of those
treated at military hospitals and are the only patients who cannot
sue for medical malpractice.
   The federal government generally is immune from being sued
unless it gives its consent. Under a 1946 federal law, however, the
government can be sued for acts of negligence by its employees
while on official duty, but the same law protects the government
from legal claims stemming from wartime military combat operations.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1950 that the law bars active-duty
military personnel from suing the federal government for damages
arising from government action or inaction in other situations.
This ruling does not prohibit military dependents or retirees from
suing the government for medical malpractice.

   A woman accused of killing a mental health
caseworker and taking three people hostage at a hospital's
psychiatric emergency room complained about mistreatment by
doctors, police said.
   At an arraignment Wednesday where she was charged with homicide
and reckless endangerment, Edith Anderson, 31, asked why she was
being charged rather than her doctors.
   Officers Peter Drummond and Robert White, who talked with the
woman during the siege, said she claimed doctors gave her too much
medicine.
   ``She kept saying things like, `Martin Luther King is not dead,'
and that she felt she had not been treated right by doctors at St.
Francis,'' said White, a former high school classmate of Ms.
Anderson.
   ``It appears as though she has a mental history,'' said police
Chief Ralph Pampena.
   Meanwhile, the staff of St. Francis Medical Center planned a
memorial service for Monday for caseworker Linda Rosen, 27, who was
shot in the back Tuesday night as she tried to flee. Miss Rosen had
worked at the hospital since May 1986.
   ``This is a nightmare. It's the kind of thing psychiatric
emergency room (workers) always worry about,'' said Shirley Freyer,
spokeswoman for St. Francis.
   According to Ms. Freyer, Ms. Anderson entered the emergency room
at 8:55 p.m. and asked a security guard where she could get
psychiatric help.
   The woman told the guard, Dan Sterzinger, she wanted to think
before registering as a patient and she sat in the waiting area.
Miss Rosen sat beside her and spoke briefly with her until Ms.
Anderson produced a gun, Ms. Freyer said.
   ``The victim turned and ran and started yelling for security
guards, and at that point the suspect began shooting,'' said police
Commander Ronald Freeman.
   Miss Rosen died where she fell, doctors determined.
   Ms. Anderson then moved to a bathroom doorway and trained her
gun on three people, whom police declined to identify, officials
said.
   ``I asked her to release one of the hostages, but she said she
was going to kill them,'' Drummond said.
   The woman wanted to speak to WPTT-TV talk show host Eddie
Edwards, who went to the hospital but never spoke with her.
   Drummond said he persuaded Ms. Anderson to release a 26-year-old
woman among her hostages, and White, keeping his identity as a
police officer secret, sat with the two remaining captives.
   ``I was really scared,'' he said. ``But the other two hostages
were very well composed for such a stressful situation. They kept
looking at the television.''
   Ms. Anderson asked for cigarettes, and White slid a pack of
across the floor toward her.
   ``When she looked down on the floor at them I rushed her,'' he
said.
   White slammed the door of the bathroom, blocking Ms. Anderson's
view of the hostages, and Drummond and other officers blockaded the
door and placed a bullet-proof shield over it. The woman then
surrendered and was led screaming in a straitjacket to a police car.

<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday disputed a published
report accusing him of approving a huge attorney's fee for Wedtech
scandal figure E. Robert Wallach after asking Wallach to lobby for
his federal judgeship.
   The San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday said then-Superior Court
Judge Eugene Lynch orally granted Wallach and his partner a $1
million fee in September 1981, while the White House was
considering Lynch for the federal bench.
   Lynch was appointed a U.S. District Court judge in January 1982.
   Wallach in 1981 was the personal attorney of Attorney General
Edwin Meese, who at the time was a White House counselor.
   Lynch said he has ``never been improperly influenced in any
decision'' during his 16 years on the bench, and he added: ``I know
of nothing that was improper or unusual about the process of my
appointment to the federal bench.''
   The fee was awarded to Wallach's firm for representing two young
sisters in a personal injury case. It was reduced to $322,000 in
1982 by another judge on the grounds that it was excessive.
   ``The article is misleading in at least one vital respect and
should be corrected,'' Lynch said in a statement.
   ``Contrary to the story's implication,'' Lynch said, ``it is a
matter of public record ... that I did not finally approve the
attorneys' fees that were the focus of the story.'' He said a
different judge ultimately set the amount.
   A spokesman for the judge refused to say whether the judge had
initially approved the $1 million to Wallach's firm, according to
The New York Times.
   Lynch, according to the Chronicle, acknowledged seeking help
from Wallach for the federal court appointment and said that
Wallach was a friend of long standing.
   Wallach strongly denied any connection between his endorsement
of Lynch for the judgeship and the payment of attorney's fees, the
Chronicle said.
   Wallach was indicted last month in New York on charges of
influence peddling for allegedly taking payments from Wedtech Corp.
to lobby Meese before he became attorney general in order to get
the company government contracts.

   President Reagan flew back to Washington on
Wednesday for the unveiling of a $1.1 trillion budget package and
the swearing-in of Anthony Kennedy as a justice of the Supreme
Court.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan would not
have any comment on the outcome of the New Hampshire presidential
primaries. The president, on his final day at his mountaintop
ranch, watched the results on television Tuesday night.
   Ending a four-night stay at his 688-acre spread in the Santa
Ynez mountains, the president, accompanied by his wife Nancy,
returned to the White House.
   High winds forced the Reagans to travel to Point Mugu Naval Air
Station by motorcade rather than helicopter for their flight aboard
Air Force One.
   Reagan, asked upon his return to Washington whether he had any
news of Lebanon kidnap victim Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
responded: ``We're still trying to get more information on that.''
   As he strode towards the White House, the president spotted a
young boy in a wheelchair among the guests invited to greet him.
   The boy, identified by a White House aide as 6-year-old Jonathan
Nutting of Sarasota Springs, Fla., held up a postcard picture of
the president.
   The president walked over to the boy, and amid much laughter and
smiles, signed the boy's postcard with his own pen.
   Reagan had remained in seclusion since he arrived at the ranch
Saturday evening following a summit with Mexican President Miguel
de la Madrid in Mazatlan, Mexico.
   In Washington, Reagan will meet with Democratic and Republican
leaders of Congress on Thursday to present them with a copy of his
new budget plan, covering the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Fitzwater said ``it is a remarkable budget that ... includes
more money for AIDS research, more money for housing and education,
but makes cuts in other areas that will allow us to meet the budget
reduction and keep the deficit on a downward path.''
   The budget is expected to seek $1 billion-plus for AIDS
research, modernization of the air traffic control system, more
money for orbiting a manned space station and a speed-up of the
``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program.
   It also is expected to include a host of measures already
rejected by Congress, such as selling off Amtrak, abolishing the
Interstate Commerce Commission and selling regional power
authorities.
   Under an agreement with Congress, defense spending will increase
by only 2 percent, to $299.5 billion.
   The agreement calls for cutting the federal budget deficit to
$136 billion, down from $148 billion of fiscal year 1987.
   The swearing-in ceremony for Kennedy will be held in the East
Room. Kennedy, a member of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
was picked for the Supreme Court after the Senate rejected Reagan's
nomination of Robert Bork and his second nominee, Judge Douglas
Ginsburg, withdrew after acknowledging he had smoked marijuana in
earlier days.
   On Friday, the president will meet with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl before leaving for Camp David to spend the weekend.

<HEAD>Robertson Again Asserts Belief That There Are Soviet Missiles In

   Republican presidential aspirant
Pat Robertson insisted again Wednesday that he believes there are
Soviet missiles in Cuba, but added he has no first-hand knowledge
of their existence.
   ``In my opinion they are there,'' Robertson told questioners at
a news conference here, as he arrived on a campaign swing through
Florida.
   But he later allowed he was ``not trying to start another Cuban
missile crisis.''
   Robertson initially brought up the topic during a New Hampshire
debate when he disagreed with Vice President George Bush over new
U.S.-Soviet intermediate-range nuclear forces pact. Robertson said
the treaty should be extended to include Cuba, which he contended
still had Soviet missiles.
   The White House issued a quick denial, and Robertson's
Republican rivals criticized his statement as inflammatory and
untrue.
   Later, Robertson aides said the candidate did mean to say
missiles with nuclear warheads.
   Wednesday, Robertson was asked if he considered his statements
irresponsible, and responded heatedly.
   ``It's not irresponsible one bit,'' he said, raising his voice.
``It's a lousy treaty.''
   He said he had cited U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, a prominent member
of the Ssenate Foreign Relations Committee, and other committee
sources in saying that there had been violations by the Soviets of
an agreement made in 1961 to keep missiles out of Cuba.
   Since he first made his comments on missiles, Robertson said he
had received more reports about nuclear missiles in Cuba. He did
not identify the sources of the reports.
   Robertson, who received 10 percent of the vote in Tuesday's New
Hampshire Primary, said he expected to do ``very well'' in Southern
states voting in the March 8 Super Tuesday primary.
   Earlier in the day, Robertson campaign in South Carolina, which
holds its priamry March 5, three days before Super Tuesday, and
called it ``the key to the nation.''
   ``There's no sense in playing games,'' Robertson told reporters.
``If I lose this one, then I'm in trouble.''
   He said he had these words for front-runners Bush and Bob Dole:
``Meet me in South Carolina and then we'll have the contest.''
   ``We're telling everybody to fasten their seat belts and get
ready,'' state Republican Party Chairman Van Hipp said. ``There's
going to be a whole lot of campaigning in South Carolina in the
next couple of weeks.''
   Both Dole and Kemp plan to visit South Carolina Thursday.

   Santa Ana winds gusting to 63 mph buffeted Southern California
on Wednesday, while snow fell in northern New Mexico.
   Colorado, meanwhile, dug out from a heavy snowstorm that dumped
as much as 11 inches of powder overnight.
   Winds of 63 mph were clocked at Ontario, Calif., while the
anemometer recorded 58 mph at Santa Ana and 55 mph at Needles. The
National Weather Service warned that the winds could churn up dust
and sand, reducing visibility to a quarter of a mile.
   Gale warnings were in effect for Washington and Southern
California coastal waters.
   Snow ended in the morning in Colorado, after dumping 11 inches
at Strontia Springs and 9 inches in Wheatridge and Colorado
Springs, but continued in parts of northern New Mexico, with an
accumulation of 3 inches at Clayton.
   Rain developed in the Gulf Coast region and extended from
central Texas across northeastern Texas and northwestern Arkansas
to northwestern Missouri. Skies were partly cloudy across most of
the nation.
   Clear skies covered Southern California and much of Nevada and
it was also sunny from the central Rockies into South Dakota and
Nebraska.
   Temperatures around the nation Wednesday afternoon ranged from 5
degrees above zero at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 78 degrees at Fort
Myers, Fla.
   The nation's low overnight was 13 degrees below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont., and Yellowstone and Jackson, Wyo.
   For Thursday, the National Weather Service predict snow from
Utah across Colorado to southwestern Kansas and the Texas
panhandle. Rain is likely over the rest of the southern plains, the
lower half of the Mississippi valley, the Tennessee and lower Ohio
valleys, the Gulf states and western portions of the Carolinas.
   Thunderstorms are forecast from southeastern Texas across
Louisiana and Mississippi to southern Alabama. Snow will be widely
scattered over northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota as well
as the northern Rockies. Light rain and mountain snow is expected
over parts of northern Oregon.
   Highs will be in the 30s or 40s across most of the nation, but
10 degrees cooler in the northern Great Lakes and northern Maine.
Much of Texas, the desert Southwest and much of California to
coastal sections of the Pacific Northwest will have highs in the
50s and 60s, with 70-degree temperatures in Los Angeles. Highs of
70 and 80 are likely in Florida and southern Texas.

   The parents of Challenger astronaut
Judith Resnik said they have reached a multimillion-dollar
settlement with the manufacturer of the shuttle's rocket booster
over their daughter's death.
   The settlement, completed Tuesday, concluded a year of
negotiations between Morton-Thiokol Inc. and Marvin and Betty
Resnik.
   Resnik placed the mount at between $2 million and $3.5 million,
the range of settlements received by other families of the
seven-member crew killed in the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger disaster.
   The shuttle exploded 73 seconds after blastoff when a joint in
its right-side booster leaked flame and ignited the shuttle's giant
fuel tank.
   The settlement leaves one claim pending against Morton-Thiokol,
from the family of Challenger co-pilot Michael J. Smith, Resnik
said.
   Morton Thiokol spokesmen did not return a telephone call for
comment Wednesday.
   ``It was commensurate with what some of the others got _ from $2
(million) to $3.5 million,'' Resnik said of the settlement. ``It's
all settled, thank God,'' he added. ``It wasn't what we wanted. It
was OK.''
   Smith's parents filed a $1.5 billion suit against the
government, Morton-Thiokol and Lawrence Mulloy, director of the
space agency's solid rocket booster program at the time of the
accident.
   A portion of the settlement will go to the Resniks' two
grandchildren, and most of the rest will be placed in educational
and scholarship funds established in Judith Resnik's memory in Ohio
and Maryland, Resnik said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men sentenced to a total of 735 years
in prison for the kidnapping and sexual molestation of two children
asked Wednesday that their convictions be overturned.
   Alex Carbarga, 23, and Luis ``Tree Frog'' Johnson, 38, were
convicted of a string of crimes that began when they snatched
2-year-old Tara Burke from a shopping center in Concord, 30 miles
east of San Francisco, in February 1982.
   It ended 10 months later when police broke into a dingy bread
van parked under a San Francisco freeway overpass and discovered
Tara huddled inside. The other child in the case, 11-year-old Mac
Lin, had fled and alerted police.
   During trial, Carbarga, who was 18 when arrested, was depicted
by his attorney as Johnson's youthful pawn and sex slave since
Carbarga's parents turned their 9-year-old son over to Johnson.
   Carbarga pleaded innocent because of insanity.
   His attorney, Alan Caplan, argued before the three-member panel
of the state Court of Appeals that Superior Court Judge Robert
Dossee allowed testimony about Carbarga's ``tragic mental
condition'' in the penalty phase of the trial, but incorrectly
prohibited it during the guilt phase.
   ``It was really the only defense and the jury didn't know it,''
he said.
   Carbarga was convicted on 93 of the 154 counts against him. Of
the convictions, 89 were felonies. Jurors found he was not legally
sane at the time of 58 crimes, and he was sentenced to 208 years on
35 offenses.
   A central issue is prosecution classification of some crimes as
taking place before a change in California law that altered
standards to determine questions such as whether a defendant knew
the difference in right and wrong, could form the required mental
intent to commit certain crimes or could appreciate their nature.
   Caplan said there was a ``two-year window'' between enactment of
one law regarding sanity determination and a state Supreme Court
ruling that the law had incorrectly stated legislative intent.
   ``There's no way in hell this boy could have formed the intent
required to commit these crimes,'' he said of Carbarga.
   Deputy Attorney General Robert Murphy said ``certain technical
problems had to be worked out at trial and have to be worked out on
appeal.''
   According to Caplan, the appeals court could take a variety of
actions. Carbarga could be tried again on the criminal offenses or
the sanity question; he could go to a mental hospital; or be
returned to Juvenile Court and sent to the California Youth
Authority.
   Johnson's attorney, George Schraer, argued for reversal of his
client's convictions saying blacks were unfairly excluded during
jury selection. Johnson is black.
   Schraer also said police acted without a search warrant when
they broke into the van.
   In addition, he said, the defense was not alowed to show
potential jurors some of the videotapes and photographs seized and
depicting Tara and Mac nude, often in sexual situations.
   By only describing the material, he argued, the defense couldn't
reliably gauge response when potential jurors said they could
consider the case fairly despite the evidence.
   Johnson, convicted of 95 felonies and five misdemeanors, is
serving a 527-year term.

<HEAD>Gelli Extradited To Face Trial In Italian Bank Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARMA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's most wanted man was escorted out of
Switzerland under heavy security Wednesday and brought to Italy,
where he is to face trial in the 1982 collapse of the nation's
biggest private bank.
   Licio Gelli, 69, was moved into a specially modified three-room
jail suite in a former monastery outside Parma, state-run RAI
reported.
   Gelli was the reputed leader of the secret P-2 Masonic lodge,
which Italian officials have linked to tax evasion, bribery and
conspiracy to topple the government.
   But under the terms of the extradition agreement with
Switzerland, Gelli can be tried only in connection with the 1982
collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.
   He fled Italy in 1981 after police raided his offices and found
a list of alleged lodge members that included Cabinet ministers,
business executives, generals and journalists. The scandal toppled
the Christian Democrat government of Premier Arnaldo Forlani.
   Gelli also has been charged in Italy in connection with the 1980
bombing of the train station in Bologna, which killed 85 people and
wounded 200.
   In December, a court in Florence convicted Gelli in absentia of
financing right-wing terrorism and sentenced him to eight years in
prison. He does not have to serve the sentence because of the
extradition arrangement.
   News reports said Italian authorities planned to begin
questioning Gelli on Friday about the bank collapse.
   Gelli surrendered to Swiss officials on Sept. 21, 1987, after
being a fugitive for more than four years.
   He escaped from Champ-Dollon prison on Aug. 10, 1983, after
serving only three days of a two-month sentence for entering
Switzerland on false papers. He also was awaiting extradition to
Italy at the time.
   Swiss police originally arrested Gelli in September 1982 when he
tried to withdraw funds from a frozen Geneva bank account linked to
a South American branch of Banco Ambrosiano.

   A former drug smuggler testified
Wednesday in the trial of reputed Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos
Lehder Rivas that he had turned down a chance to make more money by
going to work for Lehder.
   Lehder, 37, an alleged leader of Colombia's violent Medellin
cartel, is on trial on charges that he and others smuggled 3.3 tons
of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via Norman's Cay in
the Bahamas from 1978-80.
   William Freeman, 42, former brother-in-law of key prosecution
witness Ed Ward, testified he had joined Ward and others in a
marijuana-smuggling venture from 1975 until 1978.
   But in the summer of 1978, Ward announced he was going to work
for Lehder smuggling cocaine and invited partners in his marijuana
operation to join him.
   ``He didn't think we were making enough money,'' said Freeman.
``I thought he was acting very foolishly.''
   Ward's group was flown to Norman's Cay to discuss the switch,
and Lehder provided a bottle full of cocaine to the guests, Freeman
testified.
   He said he declined to participate because of the violence of
the cocaine business, the legal penalties for being caught and
concerns about the drug itself.
   Ward reportedly told Freeman that Lehder purchased protection in
the Bahamas by paying $200,000 a month, the witness said.
   ``The money was going to Mr. (Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O.)
Pindling through an attorney by the name of Nigel,'' he testified.
   In later arguments, U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle said, ``Nigel
Bowe has been identified as the principal mediator between
narcotics traffickers and Bahamian officials.''
   Earlier, an attorney for Lehder attacked the credibility of
another admitted marijuana smuggler who said he paid bribes to the
prime minister of the Bahamas.
   Prosecution witness George William ``Bill'' Baron had testified
Tuesday that he had paid some $3 million to $5 million over two
years to Pindling.
   Under cross-examination Wednesday, defense attorney Jose Quinon
asked Baron about ``all the things you made up in the courtroom
about Norman's Cay and Mr. Pindling.''
   Quinon also questioned Baron extensively about his testimony
concerning Lehder and two of his men shooting up a Norman's Cay
home after an altercation at the airport.
   Baron had testified that Lehder and his men had sprayed the home
with automatic weapons fire.
   But under questioning, Baron said he couldn't see if any of the
shots hit the house.
   ``All I can tell you is I stood in the driveway and saw them
shoot at the house,'' he said.
   He also said he didn't see any evidence of gunfire when he later
visited the house.
   Lehder is charged in this case with conspiracy, possession of
cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, is charged with conspiracy.

<BYLINE>Contra Position Unchanged for Second Round of Talks

   Negotiators for Nicaraguan rebels say the
U.S. refusal of more aid has not changed their position for the
second round of peace talks Thursday with the Sandinista government.
   Fernando Aguero, one of the seven Contra delegates, told
reporters after arriving Wednesday that the rebels still want
three-way talks including the internal Nicaraguan opposition and
they still want to discuss political matters.
   The leftist Nicaraguan government insists on sticking to the
mechanics of arranging a 30-day cease-fire that could lead to a
permanent truce. It says political changes will be discussed only
after the Contras have accepted an amnesty, laid down their arms
and resumed civilian life within the country.
   Aguero, the rebel delegate, said: ``Our position has not
changed, and it will not change. There can be no cease-fire unless
the Sandinistas first agree to democratic reforms in Nicaragua.''
   The first direct talks were held in San Jose, Costa Rica, last
month, a week before the House of Representatives voted down
President Reagan's request for another $36.2 million in Contra aid.
   The rebels and the Nicaraguan government each presented
radically different proposals in a two-day session that all said
was noted for cordiality and lack of progress. Several diplomatic
observers suggested neither side wanted to rock the boat before the
congressional vote.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Roman Catholic primate of
Nicaragua, will mediate the Guatemala City talks. He was visiting
Rome on Vatican business during the San Jose session and sent a
substitute.
   Obando y Bravo is scheduled to arrive at mid-morning and the
talks probably will begin in the afternoon at the Guatemala
archbishopric. They are scheduled to end Saturday.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, deputy foreign minister, will lead the
Nicaraguan delegation. Jaime Morales Carazo, a former Managua
banker, heads the Contra group.
   The talks are being held in line with a Central American peace
plan signed last August by by Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras,
Costa Rica and Guatemala.

   There are no medals when you come in sixth,
observed sixth-place New Hampshire finisher Bruce Babbitt on
Wednesday. Nor are there headlines or chunks of money coming in,
and by day's end it looked as if he and Republican Pete du Pont
were ready to call it quits.
   ``We have drafted a statement,'' said Babbitt. ``It still has
three conclusions to it and I have to check one of the boxes,'' he
said. But the former Arizona governor conceded ``somebody would
have to make a persuasive pitch'' to keep him in the race.
   Babbitt scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning. Du
Pont, who had not been heard from much after the New Hampshire
primary, scheduled one in the afternoon.
   ``If you write a story that indicates we're going to bow out,
you'll be OK,'' said a DuPont campaign source.
   Only the presidential candidates named Bush, Dole, Dukakis and
Gephardt didn't have to face questions about their steadfastness in
the wake of the first primary. A strong third in this contest
wasn't good enough, according to Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   ``It makes a huge difference,'' said Simon on NBC's ``Today''
show. ``First of all in media momentum _ the headlines in the
morning newspaper have his name, rather than mine. It makes a great
deal of difference in money.'' The ``he'' was Richard Gephardt who
bested Simon 20 percent to 18 percent in the Democratic contest.
The winner, of course, was Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
whose finish in his neighboring state came as no surprise.
   Simon said he has to win either the Minnesota caucus or the
South Dakota primary next Tuesday to stay in.
   ``I cannot continue to run second and third in various
primaries,'' he said. ``You have to win somewhere. And there's no
sense in fooling myself or fooling those who follow me.''
   So Simon gave himself another week. Babbitt said he was of
``divided mind'' on what to do.
   ``I will indulge myself the luxury of agonizing no more than 24
hours,'' he said, leaving New Hampshire for Washington. ``My mood
this morning is plaid. There are no medals for sixth.''
   He planned to spend the day on the telephone. ``What I'm going
to ask my frinds is, you know, `Can I or should I throw it in and
acknowledge reality?'''
   One man's reality, however, was another man's vindication.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee, who didn't campaign as
intensely as the other Democrats in New Hampshire, looked forward
to the Super Tuesday primaries next month when 1,307 Democratic
delegates will be picked in 20 states.
   ``We made a decision not to spend $1 million on two or three
delegates,'' he said. ``We're saving that for the 1,400 delegates
here in the Super Tuesday states.'' He called the results in New
Hampshire, and last week in Iowa, inconclusive.
   Jesse Jackson, who came in fourth in New Hampshire with 8
percent of the vote, said the two contests so far ``proved we could
broaden our base.''
   Among white families, he was asked by Kathleen Sullivan of ABC's
``Good Morning.''
   ``White families,'' replied Jackson. ``We've found where that
point of challenge is. It is that at the plant gate which closed on
workers without notice, as in Kenosha, Wis., where there's a
closure with too little notice, or where farmers are losing their
farms. When they do that, the lights are cut off and people look
amazingly similar in the dark.''
   And Gary Hart, last among seven Democrats with 4 percent, took
comfort in doing ``500 percent better than Iowa'' where he barely
got 1 percent.
   ``We have just begun, we are committed,'' he said.
   On the Republican side, Jack Kemp saw his third-place finish as
a victory in a ``race for conservatives'' among himself, Pat
Robertson and Pete du Pont. The other race was one ``for the
traditional, moderate wing of the party'' between Vice President
George Bush, who won New Hampshire, and Sen. Bob Dole who came in
second.
   ``Finally we've dragged Bush and Dole out of discussing their
resumes and their tax returns and where they're born and into
discussing issues,'' Kemp said.
   Du Pont returned home to Wilmington, Del., late last night and
wasn't saying much publicly about his 10 percent of the vote and
what it meant to his future as a presidential candidate. His office
said he was meeting with advisers, presumably discussing that
question.
   ``We're solvent right now and we have enough money to run the
campaign for another two weeks,'' said du Pont press secretary Fred
Stern.
   For his part, Robertson also was looking to Super Tuesday to
overcome a 9 percent showing, dead last, in New Hampshire.
   ``They're going to be playing in my backyard,'' he said. And,
addressing Bush and Dole, the Virginia-born Robertson said: ``I'm
going to beat you there convincingly.''

<TEXT>
   The Iowa Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that courts have the power to order sterilization of the mentally
retarded but declined to spell out guidelines for deciding when it
is appropriate.
   A dissenting justice said the court was walking into a legal
morass.
   In a narrowly drawn opinion, seven justices agreed that courts
can act on a request that retarded people be sterilized even though
a state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977.
   ``We conclude that our district courts possess subject matter
jurisdiction over, and accordingly may hear and determine,
applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentally
incapacitated ward, such as that involved here,'' the high court
said in an opinion written by Justice Bruce Snell.
   In his dissent, Justice K. David Harris said the court was
wandering into a subject ``shot through with searching social and
ethical questions.''
   ``In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself to
the eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendant
social and ethical issues,'' Harris wrote. ``Future litigants,
faced with unanswered questions of great social and ethical
dimensions, or with missing ingredients of a vague application
process, will continue to press us for determinations we are
singularly unfit to reach.''
   The majority rejected that reasoning.
   ``We do not believe our courts lack jurisdiction over a case
merely because the case is important or unavoidably includes a
constitutional dimension,'' the court said. ``As always, we must
remain mindful that a court cannot escape the demands of judging or
of making ... difficult appraisals.''
   The decision came in a Polk County case involving Jan and Tekla
Matejski, who are legal guardians of their 33-year-old mentally
retarded daughter, court records said.
   The couple filed an application with a lower court seeking
authorization to have their daughter sterilized, but a lawyer
appointed by the court to represent the daughter's interests argued
that there was no provision in Iowa law for sterilization.
   Polk County Judge Glenn E. Pille agreed and dismissed the
application.
   Both sides appealed.
   Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the Legislature
repealed a law providing for sterilization of people ``who are
mentally ill or retarded, syphilitic, habitual criminals, moral
degenerates, or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society.''
   While agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests, the
high court refused to set guidelines about when it would be
appropriate.
   ``We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given the
posture of the present case,'' the court said. ``The excursion
suggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisory
opinion.''
   The high court did not indicate why the parents wanted their
daughter sterilized.
   Harris wrote that the court's decision would return to haunt it.
   ``At what level of mental retardation can sterilization be
compelled?'' Harris asked. ``What board or body, if any, will
suggest statewide standards?
   ``The good news is that the majority, in its obvious and wise
recognition of its inability to do so, chooses not to address these
questions,'' Harris wrote. ``The bad news is that the majority
consigns them to Iowa's individual trial judges for ad hoc
determinations.
   ``Iowa's trial courts must now face these and, undoubtedly, a
host of other public policy decisions.''
   The leading U.S. Supreme Court case on the issue was Buck vs.
Bell in 1927, in which the court upheld a Virginia law that
provided for the sterilization of institutionalized retarded
persons. The decision set guidelines including the appointment of a
guardian, a hearing and the right of appeal.
   More than 7,500 persons were sterilized before Virginia
abandoned the program in 1972, according to state records cited by
the Washington Post in 1980. In 1981, the Virginia Legislature
enacted new guidelines for judges deciding sterilization cases.
   In other cases in recent years:
   _In 1985, the California Supreme Court struck down a law enacted
in 1980 that banned sterilization of retarded persons. The
following year, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge
authorized sterilization of a 31-year-old woman who had Down's
Syndrome. The operation was sought by her parents.
   _In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court killed a $3 million lawsuit
filed by a woman who had been sterilized at age 14. The woman had
sought damages from the North Carolina Eugenics Board, which
approved the surgery in 1974 on the grounds that the woman was
mentally retarded.
   A federal appeals court in Virginia had ordered a trial of the
suit, but a U.S. District Court jury in New Bern, N.C., a jury
rejected her claim.
   _In 1981, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that incompetent
individuals could be sterilized only if a court determined that the
operation appeared to be in the best interest of the patient and if
procedural safeguards had been followed. The ruling came in a case
involving a 19-year-old woman wit

country in any way. I think he would die first,'' said Delbert
Eagle, uncle of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   Higgins' father, William F. Higgins, was extremely ill in a
Louisville hospital Wednesday. The Pentagon said Higgins had come
home this fall on emergency leave to visit his father.
   ``It's been very trying times because we've been here at the
hospital off and on for two weeks. Then we hear this. If one
thing's bad, two is worse,'' said Harold Fisher, whose wife, Mary,
is the Marine officer's sister.
   Mary Fisher told WHAS-TV that she called her brother's wife,
Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, in Woodbridge, Va., Wednesday morning to
tell her to get him home from Lebanon as soon as possible so he
could see his father before he died. That is when she learned of
the abduction.
   Fisher said the elder Higgins is too ill to understand what
happened to his son.
   ``The man has not opened his eyes in a couple of days. There's
no way he could be able to comprehend, although he may be able to
hear,'' he said.
   The Pentagon said Higgins, 43, was on temporary detail serving
as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's Lebanon
Observer Group.
   U.N. sources said Higgins was kidnapped in the late afternoon on
the coastal highway between Lebanon's southernmost port of Tyre and
the border town of Naqoura, site of the U.N. force's headquarters.
   Higgins' family lived in Garrard County in central Kentucky when
he was born and later moved to Louisville, where he was graduated
from Southern High School in 1963. Much of his leisure time was
spent with his uncle.
   ``He fished a lot with me. He drove me from time to time. He
drove me to California once, to Florida, down south a couple of
times. We were pretty close together as he grew up,'' said Eagle,
86, a former circuit court judge.
   ``Yes, he wanted to be in the military service. He always talked
about wanting to go to the military service. He wanted to go to
West Point,'' Eagle said.
   He was appointed to West Point, but elected instead to study at
Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC scholarship. He was
commissioned a 2nd lietenant when he graducated in 1967, with a
business degree.
   He later earned masters' degrees in human resources management
at Pepperdine University in California and in political science at
Auburn in Alabama.
   Higgins served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1972, and later was a
rifle company commander in Okinawa, Japan, an instructor at the
staff non-commissioned officers academy at Quantico, Va., and a
rifle company commander at Camp Lejeune.
   In 1980, he was a distinguished graduate of the Air Force
Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base. Higgins served
in various staff positions at Marine Corps headquarters in
Washington and at the Pentagon, and graduated from the National War
College in 1985.
   A high school friend said students at Southern were surprised
when Higgins went into the Marines.
   ``You think of the Marines as being macho-type, and he really
wasn't like that. But he seems to have done all right at it,'' said
Rudy Fischer, now a lab technician at Rohm and Haas Chemical Co. in
Louisville.
   ``He was involved in a lot of social activities, played football
and was one of the top students in the class,'' Fischer said.
``Just pretty much an average guy.''
   Ralph Allen, an assistant principal at Southern High School, was
a math teacher there when Higgins attended and was also a neighbor.
   ``He was a top student and very active in school. He played on
the football team. He came from a good family and was well liked,''
Allen said.
   Eagle said Higgins was more studious than athletic but was a boy
who ``liked to hunt and fish and romp in the woods.''
   Higgins is married to Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, who works at
the Pentagon. He has a 17-year-old daughter by a previous marriage.

   American Ballet Theater star Patrick
Bissell died from an overdose of cocaine, codeine, methadone and
other drugs, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday.
   Bissell, 30, was found dead Dec. 29 in his apartment in Hoboken,
across the Hudson River from Manhattan.
   Hudson County Prosecutor Paul M. DePascale said investigators
found ``significant quantities of dangerous substances'' in
Bissell's body. Among the substances were ethanol, painkillers and
salicylate, a component of aspirin, the autopsy said.
   DePascale said he has ruled out suicide because no note was
found. He said the case was being closed because it was unlikely
investigators could trace the source of the drugs.
   The prosecutor said in December that authorities suspected a
drug overdose, but that an autospy and toxicology tests would be
needed to determine an official cause of Bissell's death.
   Bissell's family said he was having trouble handling the
pressures of the highly competitive dance world in New York City.
   Bissell, a principal performer for the theater company, had gone
to the Betty Ford Clinic in California last summer and left the
substance abuse program ``dried out'' in August, said his twin
brother, William.

   Secretary of State George Shultz sought
support Wednesday for his proposals to revive the moribund Mideast
peace process, meeting with Israeli envoy Abba Eban and members of
the Senate.
   Shultz, who leaves for Moscow late this week, will travel to the
Middle East at the end of the month to try to push Arab and Israeli
leaders toward the negotiating table.
   ``Shultz appears encouraged by the support he's gotten so far
for his proposals,'' Eban told reporters following a 30-minute
meeting with the secretary. But he added that ``the positions of
the various sides are still far apart and one should not expect the
ice to melt right away.''
   Eban said he supports Shultz's initiative ``and the high degree
of his activism. I don't think this is just a symbolic effort and
that the Americans will withdraw afterward. This is a serious
initiative.''
   Shultz is laying the groundwork for the next U.S. administration
to continue mediation efforts between Arabs and Israelis, Eban said.
   Eban is a member of the Labor Party headed by Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres, who favors the Shultz plan. His rival in the
coalition government, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has expressed
some reservations.
   Eban said he hopes Shultz can overcome Shamir's hesitancy.
   At the Capitol, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Shultz did
not outline any ``magic solution'' or precise plan for dealing with
the problems of the Middle East other than to say he would devote
himself to the search for a breakthrough.
   Cranston said Shultz did provide assurances that, contrary to
some reports, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is not opting out of
the peace process.
   The senator said Shultz, responding to a question, said the
United States has urged Israel not to use ``undue violence'' in
dealing with rebellious Palestinians but also has expressed
understanding that ``some strength is needed'' to deal with the
situation.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he believes
that it is ``high time'' Shultz visited the area in an attempt to
revitalize the peace process.
   ``What we see going on there is a tragic situation and what we
see on our newscasts every evening certainly doesn't go over very
well with the American people,'' Byrd said.
   Shultz met Tuesday night with some 25 members of the House to
present his proposals and arranged to lay out his plans for
senators Wednesday night.
   The plan he will propose in his Mideast talks has not been made
public, but it reportedly calls for Arab-Israeli negotiations to
start in April on an interim autonomy agreement for the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   It envisions that talks on the permanent fate of the territories
would begin in December.
   Several Arab leaders have rejected the interim solution included
in the Shultz proposal, while Shamir opposes the notion of
negotiating for a permanent solution. Shamir fears that such talks
would force Israel to give back the lands it captured from the
Arabs in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shultz's re-engagement in the peace process was sparked by two
months of rioting in the occupied territories in which at least 53
Palestinians have been killed.

   A union official whose cooperation was
considered crucial to saving the New York Post boycotted
labor-management negotiations Wednesday, with a deadline for
closing the paper two days away.
   Jerry Cronin, president of the 350-member drivers' union, did
not join the negotiations. Both sides had said agreement was
impossible without the cooperation of his union.
   Late in the day, the Post announced that arbitrator Thomas G.
Christensen, a labor law professor at New York University, had
denied a petition by the drivers' union to stop the paper from
closing Feb. 19.
   The union argued that the Post was required by contract to give
30 days' notice of any change in work rules, Rubenstein said.
Christensen decided that the rule did not apply if the paper was
closing.
   ``The newspaper hopes that the drivers will now work with them
in reaching an agreement,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for
the Post.
   Cronin could not be reached for comment.
   Earlier, labor lawyer Theodore W. Kheel, who is advising the
newspaper's union, had said ``there's no chance of a settlement
before Friday.''
   The talks between management and nine Post unions at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel were scheduled to continue around the clock until the 2
p.m. Friday deadline set by Post owner Rupert Murdoch, who has
demanded $24 million in union concessions over three years.
   After meeting for 35 minutes, both sides broke for lunch and
consultations. George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council, said they had discussed the concession figure and
told reporters, ``I feel optimistic. We all had smiles in there, I
think.''
   If the unions refuse to go along with the concessions, Murdoch
has said his $37 million sale of the paper to real estate developer
Peter Kalikow will collapse and the paper will close.
   Participants in the talks included Post publisher Patrick
Purcell and other Post executives, McDonald and leaders from most
of the eight unions which constitute the trades council.
   Purcell had no comment after the brief meeting.
   One union leader, Lenny Higgins of the pressmen's union, said
one goal was to extend the deadline. ``If he (Murdoch) stays with
the Friday deadline, I don't know what'll happen,'' he said.
   Under the terms of his contract with Kalikow, Murdoch has until
Monday to negotiate the union concessions.
   Murdoch opted to sell the Post after Congress passed legislation
preventing cross-ownership of a newspaper and a television station
in the same city. Murdoch also owns WNYW-TV in New York. He faces a
similar cross-ownership situation in Boston.
   Murdoch claims he has lost nearly $150 million since purchasing
the Post 11 years ago.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis headed full-speed from the
Northeast into a Southern campaign Wednesday, spending the day
after his New Hampshire triumph talking tough on military issues in
a region where he hopes to take his next big step toward the
Democratic nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor, who won a lopsided victory over six
Democratic rivals in New Hampshire on Tuesday, left New England at
dawn and was in Atlanta and campaigning while his triumph was still
fresh.
   In the next three weeks, he will be spending much time _ and
money _ in the South, where 14 states will have their primaries on
March 8, known as Super Tuesday.
   Dukakis, more liberal than many Southern Democrats, put a heavy
emphasis on the military after a speech in Atlanta, declaring he
would use force to stop a foreign aggressor in this hemisphere or
to counterattack terrorists.
   ``I'm a very tough guy when it comes to terrorism,'' he said.
   ``I don't yield on toughness to Al Gore in any shape or
manner,'' he added in a reference to the Tennessee senator who has
staked his campaign on doing well in the South.
   Dukakis said his emphasis on defense issues had nothing to do
with any Southern strategy but came simply ``because I was asked
about it.'' He also said some issues are more important to some
regions than others, adding, ``The South, for many years, has been
the location for many military installations.''
   His speech to about 500 spectators was essentially the same as
his victory speech in Manchester Tuesday night. Dukakis used the
words ``strong'' or ``strength'' 14 times in a 15-minute address.
   Former Kentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins and former New Orleans
Mayor Dutch Morial endorsed Dukakis in his Atlanta appearance.
Collins said that she and her fellow governors used to say of
Dukakis, ``Now there's something worth watching.''
   Dukakis said the idea that the South is politically different
from the rest of the nation is a false image created by the press.
   ``There's a mythology about the South as if it's some kind of
foreign country. It's nonsense,'' Dukakis said.
   In his victory speech the previous night, Dukakis said, ``I have
no Southern strategy.''
   But his aides say his campaign will focus on Texas, Florida,
North Carolina and Georgia _ the four Southern states with the most
delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   ``The bottom line is delegates; that's what we're looking for
Super Tuesday,'' said Alice Travis, Dukakis' national political
coordinator.
   Dukakis also is expected to do well in his home state, in
neighboring Rhode Island and in Washington state, all of which also
have contests on March 8.
   John Dukakis, who is running his father's Southern campaign,
said, ``Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia are places where
we started early. Those are the four largest states but we're
everywhere and moving quickly.''
   In Clearwater, Fla., Dukakis told about 600 cheering supporters:
``I don't have to tell you how important Florida is going be.''
   Dukakis has led in recent polls in Florida, which ranks second
among Super Tuesday states with 135 Democratic delegates.
   He also fired a shot across Gore's bow when told the Tennesssee
senator had accused his opponents of being alienated from the
electorate.
   ``Mr. Gore left Iowa, virtually left New Hampshire,'' Dukakis
said. ``I don't know who's alienated.''
   Dukakis made it clear Wednesday that he would continue to
contrast his positions with those of Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, who finished second to Dukakis in New Hampshire after
beating him in Iowa.
   On foreign trade, one of Gephardt's main issues, Dukakis said,
``A portion of the problem has to do with unfair trade practices.''
But he also said the federal budget deficit is the primary culprit
and he said Gephardt helped create the problem by voting for
President Reagan's 1981 tax cut.
   In one strategic uncertainty, Dukakis' aides say that between
now and Super Tuesday the Democratic field could narrow, forcing a
more direct comparison of the remaining candidates.
   During the New Hampshire campaign, Dukakis said, negative
campaigning by his oppoents ``failed miserably. When you have many
candidates in a race, trying to strike out at a number of them
doesn't work.''
   The 20 caucuses and primaries on Super Tuesday _ including 14 in
the South _ won't come to Dukakis as easily as New Hampshire, his
aides recognize.
   In New Hampshire, next door to his home state, Dukakis had
hundreds of volunteers. In the South, a paid staff of 64 in 15
offices is seeking to create a new volunteer corps.
   Florida, with its Northeastern transplants and Jewish
population, Texas with its Hispanic vote and North Carolina with
its concentration of high technology industries will be places
where Dukakis campaigns hard, said aide Travis.
   Dukakis' wife Kitty is Jewish.
   The Dukakis game plan combines an emphasis on economic growth
and opportunity with strengthening of the nation's conventional
military force.
   Politically, Dukakis is hoping that the credibility he gains
from winning New Hampshire and from hoped-for good showings in the
Minnesota caucus and South Dakota primary on Feb. 22 will make up
for any disadvantage created by his ethnic and geographic origin.
   John Dukakis said his father's Greek background and immigrant
parents ``may be an initial hurdle at times'' in the South. But he
said, ``People pronounce his name just fine. People are looking way
beyond that.''
   Boston-based political consultant Michael Goldman said Dukakis
campaign sources tell him the governor will spend between $3
million and $4 million in the South to spread his message across
such a large region. And John Dukakis said the ads would begin with
a biographical series, to introduce the candidate to voters.

   A former Methodist minister accused in a civil
lawsuit of trying to kill his wife was served with court papers as
he and a female companion tried to flee in California, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
   A process server slipped a copy of the lawsuit under the
windshield wipers of a car as Walker Railey and Lucy Papillon, a
Dallas psychologist, sped away from a northern California resort
Monday, the Dallas Times Herald said.
   The parents of Railey's wife, Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey, filed
the lawsuit Feb. 2, accusing their son-in-law of the attempted
strangulation. The suit seeks unspecified damages.
   Mrs. Railey has been in a coma since she was left for dead on
the floor of the family's garage April 22. She is in a Tyler
nursing home.
   Railey denies attacking his wife. He has said he was studying at
two libraries and came home to find his wife on the floor.
   Several lawyers told the newspaper that they believe placing the
papers under the windshield wipers would be considered a proper
service. They said they didn't know of any case with the same
circumstances, but that visibility was the key in serving a lawsuit.
   Railey, former minister of the First United Methodist Church of
Dallas, and Ms. Papillon, who reportedly told a Dallas County grand
jury that she and Railey traveled together and once discussed
marriage, were spotted at 2 p.m. Sunday at a Mendocino, Calif., inn
by process server Steve Adams of San Francisco and a Dallas Times
Herald reporter.
   The couple were drinking beer outside their $140-a-night cabin
when they spotted the process server and reporter.
   Railey and Ms. Papillon ran inside and remained there for 22
hours, the newspaper said. They did not turn on any lights and had
food delivered by room service and instructed inn employees to put
through telephone calls only from certain individuals.
   On Monday, a resort employee carried their luggage to their
rented car. Ms. Papillon walked out of the cabin, got into the car
and Railey darted from the cabin with a coat over his head.
   Railey slumped down in the front seat as the car sped out of the
driveway. Adams ran alongside the car, identified himself as a
process server and placed the papers under the windshield wipers,
the newspaper said.
   Railey told The Dallas Morning News in an interview late last
week that he was not attempting to avoid the legal papers and was
``keeping a low profile'' to avoid the press.
   But Railey and Ms. Papillon declined to answer the door at the
cabin when Adams knocked and identified himself as a process server.
   Railey has until the first Monday after the expiration of 20
days since being served to answer the charges in the suit, said
Bill Arnold, attorney for Mrs. Railey's parents.

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Senate on Wednesday granted
Gov. Evan Mecham a one-week delay of his impeachment trial set to
begin Monday.
   The action came on a voice vote. Earlier in the day, the Senate
defeated two motions for delay offered by the embattled governor's
attorney, Murray Miller.
   Arizona's chief justice, Frank Gordon, who will preside at the
impeachment trial, told the Senate a one-week delay would
ultimately save time by allowing some issues to be settled
beforehand.
   However, Sen. Majority Leader Bob Usdane said, ``There is an
ongoing fear ... that this will be the beginning of lots of motions
for continuation'' by Miller.
   Miller had asked that the trial be put off until criminal
charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan are adjudicated. He
contended that an impeachment trial would prejudice the criminal
trial jury.
   But a motion to delay the trial until 20 days after the criminal
case is resolved lost on a voice vote, and a motion to delay the
Senate proceeding a flat 90 days went down 24-5, with five
Republicans supporting the governor.
   After the one-week delay passed, Miller would not say whether he
would go to court in an effort to obtain a further delay. He told
the Senate on Tuesday that if the trial was not delayed, he would
go to state or federal court.
   Before the two earlier votes Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader
Bob Usdane, a Republican, had said, ``I think we need to expedite
the trial.''
   Minority Leader Alan Stephens, agreed, saying, ``His (Miller's)
game is delay. That's his middle name.''
   At least 72 people are considering challenging Mecham in a
recall election May 17, including a former congressman and a former
state school superintendent who lost to the Republican in 1986.
   The House impeached Mecham on Feb. 5 and accused him of
concealing the $350,000 loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and trying to
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state
official.
   Wednesday was the first day for recall election candidates to
file petition signatures aimed at getting placed on the ballot.
Mecham will automatically be put on the ballot, but all other
candidates must file 3,336 signatures of registered voters by March
18.
   By midday Wednesday, nobody had turned in any petition
signatures, but 72 had picked up packets to collect signatures.
   The most prominent names among them are those of Democrat
Carolyn Warner, who lost to Mecham in a three-way gubernatorial
race in 1986, and former Rep. John Rhodes, who planned to announce
Friday whether he would run.
   But some of the lesser knowns among the prospective candidates
also insist they have a shot at unseating Mecham.
   Dave Colosimo of Phoenix, a former teacher and musician, said,
``If I didn't think I could win, I wouldn't run.'' He has never
sought public office before and admitted his campaign thus far was
a ``one-man show.''
   Frank Vaupell, a Phoenix mortgage loan officer, acknowledged he
has no real chance of winning. Asked why he was running, he said,
``I shouldn't be. There's probably much more qualified people.''
   Republican national committeeman Jack Londen also said he will
run so voters will have a choice of a conservative candidate in
case Mecham is barred from running in the recall. If Mecham is
convicted by the Senate, lawmakers could vote to bar him from
holding any future public office.
   Londen said he would pull out if Mecham stays on the ballot.

<TEXT>
   Laos has given the United States
remains believed to be those of Americans missing from the Vietnam
War, American and Laotian reports said Thursday.
   A statement from the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane said the
mission's charge d'affaires, Harriet Isom, and military officials
received the remains at a ceremony at Vientiane airport Wednesday.
   The Laotians also handed over pieces of aircraft wreckage they
excavated in December and January, the statement said.
   It said the remains were to flown to Bangkok and then to
Honolulu for analysis at the U.S. Army's Central Identification
Laboratory.
   The turnover also was reported Wednesday by the official Laotian
radio.
   The broadcast, a text of which was obtained Thursday from a
Western embassy in Bangkok, said the remains were retrieved during
a December excavation in Savannakhet province and a January dig in
Saravane province. Both are in Laos' southern panhandle area,
between Thailand and Vietnam.
   ``At the same time, the Lao side also handed over to the U.S.
government copies of the I.D. cards of three U.S. soldiers missing
in Laos,'' the broadcast said.
   The reports did not specify how many remains were handed over.
   The broadcast said the act ``shows the sincerity of the ...
government in improving relations with the United States.''
   There are 555 Americans listed as missing in Laos from the
Vietnam War years, most of them airmen shot down during bombing
runs against Laotian and Vietnamese communist positions.
   Laos has been working to improve its relations with the United
States with an eye toward getting international aid and economic
help from the West.

   More than 600 rebels using mortars,
grenades and automatic weapons attacked an infantry base and cotton
cooperative early Wednesday in the biggest guerrilla operation
since early 1987.
   Officials said at least 18 people were killed and 14 wounded.
The battle raged in and around this provincial capital of 70,000
people 70 miles southeast of San Salvador, the capital.
   Military officers said two detachments of about 300 leftist
insurgents each took part in the coordinated attacks, which
included blowing up two bridges linking the capital and Usulutan,
El Salvador's eastern province.
   Seven members of a civilian family _ a couple and five children
aged 7 months to nine years _ were killed when a mortar shell hit
their one-room brick and adobe home in a poor neighborhood just
outside the 6th Infantry Brigade headquarters.
   Col. Inocencio Montano, brigade commander, said five soldiers
were killed in combat at advance posts outside the base perimeter
and no guerrillas penetrated the base. The attack began at 12:10
a.m. and lasted about three hours, he said.
   Montano said four of the 55 U.S. military advisers stationed in
El Salvador were at the base when the assault began, but none was
in danger.
   He said the bodies of three guerrillas were brought to the base
and two other bodies were removed by the retreating insurgents.
   Radio Venceremos, the clandestine rebel transmitter, called the
raid a success and claimed the attackers inflicted 190 casualties.
It gave no breakdown of dead and wounded.
   The coordinated attacks appeared to be the largest in scale
since the rebels hit the 4th Infantry Brigade in the northern
province of Chalatenango last March 31. That battle cost 70 lives,
including that of a U.S. military adviser, and more than 100 people
were wounded.
   One member of the military National Police was killed in the
attack on the Salvadoran Cotton Cooperative Ltd. about 5 miles west
of Usulutan.
   Lt. Jose Mejia Henriquez, commander of the 30-man detachment
stationed at the cooperative, said the assault began with mortar
and rocket-propelled grenade fire at 12:20 a.m.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who
began fighting the U.S.-backed government eight years ago, have
waged a campaign of economic sabotage that includes attacks on the
coffee, cotton and sugar industries. Those industries account for
80 percent of El Salvador's export earnings.
   Wednesday's attacks came hours before five Central American
foreign ministers met at a San Salvador hotel to discuss progress
in implementing a regional peace plan signed Aug. 7.
   Ricardo Acevedo Peralta, host minister, urged his colleagues to
ensure that their countries comply with the plan's prohibition of
external aid to insurgents.
   El Salvador's Christian Democratic government accuses
neighboring Nicaragua of backing the Salvadoran rebels.
   Guerrillas left leaflets on streets around the infantry base
calling for popular insurrection and accusing President Jose
Napoleon Duarte of ``selling national sovereignty to the United
States.''
   The attack's effect was evident well into the afternoon. Trucks
full of soldiers with M-16 assault rifles sped along dusty roads.
Helicopters and spotter planes flew overhead.
   Montano said the guerrillas retreated to the north toward San
Vicente volcano, on whose slopes insurgents camp.
   Lt. Mejia at the cotton cooperative said the attack there began
with about 15 minutes of mortar fire.
   ``Then they attacked shouting like Indians,'' he said on the
porch of the cooperative's offices. ``They shouted at us to
surrender, calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist.''
   He said he and his men held off the attackers from trenches at
the front of the cooperative, but guerrilla fighters penetrated
from the sides and rear. Seven of the unit's open-sided warehouses
were burned.
   At the Palo Seco crossing 9 miles west of Usulutan, peasants
milled around a hole 50 feet long and 20 deep where a bridge had
been the day before.
   Residents said the they heard a tremendous explosion at about
12:30 a.m. and rebels then blew down power poles on either side of
the road.
   Local officials reported skirmishes in at least three other
provinces _ San Miguel, Cabanas and Chalatenango.
   Rebel radio said the attacks in San Miguel and the northeastern
province of Morazan were part of a new operation they called
``Death to the Killers of Herbert Anaya Sanabria.''
   Anaya, coordinator of the independent Salvadoran Human Rights
Commission, was assassinated Oct. 26.

<HEAD>U.S. Plans To Hand Over Nazi Archives to W. Germany, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States plans to give to
West Germany the world's largest collection of Nazi documents, U.S.
officials said Wednesday.
   The Berlin Document Center, administered by the United States,
holds about 30 million documents from the Nazi era. They can be
viewed by scholars, government officials, prosecutors investigating
Nazi war crimes and others.
   West Germany and the United States have been discussing a West
German takeover of the archives for years.
   The two countries have agreed that the center's archives will be
given to West Germany after they are copied on microfilm, according
to officials from both sides.
   Under the plan, the originals will be handed over to the West
German federal archives, and the microfilm copies will be taken to
the United States for storage.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about
half the center's documents have already been copied onto microfilm.
   The West German government is paying for the copying of the
documents.
   West Berlin justice officials, meanwhile, said an investigation
into the possible theft of tens of thousands of documents from the
Berlin Document Center was still under way.
   A spokesman for the West Berlin Justice Department, Volker
Kaehne, denied news reports that an arrest in the case was
imminent, and said investigators could not yet determine how long
their probe would take.

   Prices shot above official levels
Wednesday as the Nicaraguan government implemented a plan to
replace its old currency with new notes.
   Prices for eggs, cooking oil and soft drinks tripled.
   At least 40 Nicarguans were arrested for currency violations and
police said several U.S. Embassy employees were caught illegally
exchanging currency.
   Commander Doris Tijerino, the city's police chief, said none of
the embassy employees were arrested.
   The program, which went into effect Monday, replaced the old
cordoba currency with new cordoba notes pegged at a higher value to
the U.S. dollar. Nicaraguans had three days to exchange their old
cordoba bills for new ones.
   The government closed the period for trading old bills
Wednesday, claiming enough new bills were in circulation.
   Commander Rene Vivas, deputy interior minister, told the
Sandinista newspaper Barricada that the government had discovered a
Contra plan to introduce large quantities of old cordobas into the
country.
   He said border customs houses were closed Monday to stop the
alleged plan.
   The cordoba is worth 1,000 times more than the old currency. The
new cordoba is worth about 10 U.S. cents.
   The Sandinista government also authorized price increases of up
to 500 percent for a list of 33 basic staples, and raised salaries
up to five times above their December levels.
   The government said it sought to curb inflation, which reached
1,500 percent in 1987.
   But prices for many basic goods suddenly jumped beyond their
official levels this week _ even at government sales booths that
ration the commodities.
   A carton of 30 eggs that went for the equivalent of 15 new
cordobas last week rose to 50 cordobas at the government booths,
and fetched 60 in the black market. Meat prices also shot up.
   A liter (about a quart) of cooking oil that sold for 3.7
cordobas in the government booths last week rose to 12 this week.
In the black market, the price per liter went from 100 to 150
cordobas.
   Thousands of people were angered with the new prices, according
to a new radio channel the government set up last weekend to
explain the reforms.
   One resident of the Villa Libertad district, in the east of
Managua, complained that a tiny corn tortilla ``smaller than a
hand'' now costs a full cordoba, double what it did before the
currency swap.
   Soft drinks that used to cost 3 cordobas now cost 15, even
though the government's fixed price was ten, he complained.
   Newspapers also raised their prices. The opposition daily La
Prensa, which formerly cost the equivalent of two new cordobas,
sold for ten Wednesday. Barricada, the government daily, sold for
five cordobas, up from one last week. Nicaraguans were only allowed
to cash in 10 million cordobas. Those arrested for currency
violations face up to six months in prison.
   Tijerino, the police chief, said ``various vehicles from the
American Embassy were surprised giving personnel (at an exchange
house) packets that supposedly contained money.''
   He said the law mandates all foreign embassy personnel change
their old currency at the Foreign Ministry.
   It was not clear whether the embassy employees were Americans.

   A man who had been fired from a
top-secret defense plant shot 12 people there, including a woman
who spurned his attention, and killed seven before surrendering,
authorities said.
   Richard Wade Farley, 39, of nearby San Jose walked from the
sprawling two-story ESL Corp. building about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday with
his hands in the air. He was quickly surrounded by three officers
and taken to the Santa Clara County Jail.
   Daryl Anderson, an ESL business analyst, said she was in her
second-floor office when the gunman came down the hall firing shots
between 2:30 and 3 p.m. She said bullets punctured her office door.
Laura Black, the woman who spurned him, was shot in the shoulder,
said Sunnyvale Public Safety Lt. Reuben Grijalva.

   After months of debate, the U.S. Energy
Department has decided not to restart the flawed and aging N
Reactor, one of four reactors supplying the U.S. nuclear arsenal
with bomb-grade plutonium.
   The N reactor has been closed since January 1987 for about $70
million worth of safety improvements prompted by the nuclear
disaster that killed 31 people at the similarly designed Soviet
nuclear plant at Chernobyl.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington announced Tuesday the reactor
at the Hanford nuclear reservation will be placed on ``cold
standby'' status, forcing about 2,600 workers to be laid off in the

   The obscure cargo airline that Eastern
Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces
questions about its safety record as the government decides whether
it is fit to carry passengers.
   Few air travelers have ever heard of Orion Air, a North Carolina
cargo carrier which serves such air freight companies as United
Parcel Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator.
   But if labor strife intensifies at Eastern, many of that
airline's customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion _
and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up
scrutiny of the airline.
   Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion, including
the leasing of 26 of Eastern's jetliners, that call on the airline
to take over much of Eastern's routes if pilots and mechanics go on
strike. Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own pilots and
ground workers, Eastern officials said.
   But the FAA has yet to approve Orion for passenger service, and
a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement
proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against
Orion because of past safety violations.

   If the trend by many taxpayers to delay filing
their federal tax returns continues to spread, the federal
government could feel the pinch _ right in the pocketbook.
   Lawrence B. Gibbs, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service,
notes that five years ago, 14 percent of all individual returns
were filed in January and 34 percent in April. But last year, only
4 percent were filed during the first month and almost 40 percent
in April.
   ``If this trend were exacerbated by tax reform (the sweeping
1986 law), it could jam the system by slowing down processing and
the issuance of refunds,'' Gibbs told a Senate Finance subcommittee
Tuesday. ``As a result, there could be a high price to pay.
   ``If we don't process returns within a 45-day period after the
return due date the government must pay interest on refunds,'' he
noted. That due date is April 15.

   There are no medals when you come in sixth,
observed sixth-place New Hampshire finisher Bruce Babbitt on
Wednesday. Nor are there headlines or chunks of money coming in,
but for the day, at least, he stayed in the race and so did the
others who failed to win or place.
   Only the presidential candidates named Bush, Dole, Dukakis and
Gephardt didn't have to face questions about their steadfastness in
the wake of the first primary. A strong third in this contest
wasn't good enough, according to Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   ``It makes a huge difference,'' said Simon on NBC's ``Today''
show. ``First of all in media momentum _ the headlines in the
morning newspaper have his name, rather than mine. It makes a great
deal of difference in money.'' The ``he'' was Richard Gephardt who
bested Simon 20 percent to 18 percent in the Democratic contest.
The winner, of course, was Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
whose finish in his neighboring state came as no surprise.

   Pierce Brosnan, who'd never been to Asia
before, started last year with a miniseries in Hong Kong and ended
it with a movie in India.
   In between, he returned to his native Ireland to do an
independent film with some friends.
   The miniseries, ``Noble House,'' starts its eight-hour,
four-part run on NBC this Sunday. It's based on the best-selling
book by James Clavell.
   The movie in India is ``The Deceivers,'' from the book by John
Masters. The Irish movie is ``Taffin.''
   In ``Noble House,'' Brosnan stars as Ian Dunross, the tai-pan,
or boss, of Hong Kong's leading trading house. It also stars
Deborah Raffin, Ben Masters, John Houseman, John Rhys-Davies and
Julia Nickson. Gary Nelson directed it on location in Hong Kong for
12 weeks and at the Dino De Laurentiis Studio in North Carolina for
another 12 weeks.
   ``Hong Kong was my first step into the Orient,'' said Brosnan.
``It's a fascinating place, sort of a condensed version of New York
City. My schedule was such that I had time to go around and see the
place. I bought an automatic camera and did some photography.
   ``What was around me was so exciting to look at and so
different. The colors and the light were magical. Having started
life as a commercial artist, I've always looked at things as though
to paint them. I used a zoom lens because the Chinese don't like
having their pictures taken.''
   As the story opens, Dunross has just taken over the family's
trading empire.
   ``He's fairly ruthless in his dealings with people,'' said
Brosnan. ``He has a remoteness to him. An isolated charm. I've
never played a character like him before. The job came at a very
opportune moment, after the whole incident of James Bond and
`Remington Steele.'''
   After NBC canceled ``Remington Steele'' a few seasons back,
Brosnan was asked to become the next James Bond. Roger Moore had
decided to step down as 007. Then, because of the publicity over
Bond, NBC put ``Remington Steele'' back on the schedule, and
Brosnan was dropped from the Bond picture.
   Did he see the offer of the role in ``Noble House'' as a peace
offering?
   ``I never thought of it as a peace offering,'' he answered. ``I
saw it as a way of putting as much distance between myself and
`Remington Steele' as possible. I'd always enjoyed doing the
series, but I knew coming back for six more episodes was hogwash.
They wanted to have their cake and eat it.
   ``The turmoil for me was the on and off anxiety of the Bond
part. It lasted an eternity. I was offered James Bond. I said yes.
`Remington Steele' was brought back. That's enough to say on the
subject. It was a shame because `Remington Steele' was never
allowed to finish with any grace.''
   As it turned out, Timothy Dalton was hired to play James Bond in
``The Living Daylights.'' Brosnan said he sees no chance that he
will ever play the role.
   His wife, Cassandra Harris, was Moore's leading lady in the Bond
movie ``For Your Eyes Only.''
   Brosnan's India movie, ``The Deceivers,'' is set in 1824 and
focuses on the Thugs who worshipped the god of destruction, Kali.
   ``I play an Englishman, a glorified accountant working for the
East India Trading Co.,'' he said. ``He discovers this cult and
disguises himself as an Indian. He goes on the road with the Thugs,
who kill people by strangulation.''
   Brosnan's only current appearances on TV are in a commercial for
Diet Coke, which was premiered during the Super Bowl coverage. It
was filmed on a speeding train in England and looks like a scene
right out of a spy thriller such as a Bond movie, or perhaps ``The
Fourth Protocol,'' in which Brosnan played a Soviet agent being
tracked down by Michael Caine.
   ``That was me walking on top of that train,'' he said. ``It was
going 40 miles an hour. If I'd fallen off that sucker I'd never
have done `The Deceivers.'''

<HEAD>Kevin Spacey Ending Run as Madman Bad Guy on `Wiseguy'</HEAD>

   Kevin Spacey, who has been wowing TV audiences
with his portrayal of brilliant, bedeviled bad guy Mel Profitt on
CBS' ``Wiseguy,'' had a tough act to follow.
   Ray Sharkey had created one of the season's best villains in
Sonny Steelgrave, a tough New Jersey-based crime boss who turned
out to be so lovable that undercover hero Vinnie Terranova (Ken
Wahl) wept when he died.
   But Steelgrave was gone, and Vinnie had to have a new
investigation.
   Enter Mel and Susan Profitt (Joan Severance), a bizarre
brother-sister act with an international crime syndicate and a
vaguely incestuous relationship.
   Mel, a manic-depressive with a genius IQ, gets his
self-destruction wish in Monday's episode. The finite role is what
appealed to Spacey.
   ``I was really attracted to be able to go and do a role for a
number of weeks, find out what it was like to do a TV series but
not be tied to one, create a character that hopefully will be
memorable and get out,'' Spacey said recently, back home in
Manhattan.
   ``You know, the crew, they're the biggest critics, they not only
were in love with the character (Sonny Steelgrave), they knew Ray,
and they hung out with Ray, and they were, like, Ray's pal, and
here was this New York actor coming in.''
   By his last day on the set, Spacey said, ``one of the crew
members came up and said, `You know, when you came on, we thought
no one would ever make us forget, uh ... What's his name?' I
thought that was a really great compliment.''
   If Spacey won over the ``Wiseguy'' crew, he also won over
audiences. Back in New York, he said, people were stopping him on
the street and quoting lines from the show to him.
   ``Wiseguy'' premiered last fall on Thursday, opposite NBC's
high-rated lineup, so it didn't get much attention. But with the
introduction of the Profitts mid-season, CBS moved it to Monday
night, where it is doing better.
   Spacey, a dedicated New York stage actor, had little screen time
before the series. He starred on Broadway in ``Hurly Burly'' and
later with Jack Lemmon in ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' a
performance that can be seen later this season on PBS. He worked
with Lemmon again in NBC's recent miniseries ``The Murder of Mary
Phagan.'' Spacey played a newspaper reporter.
   He has a movie due out in April, ``Rocket Gibraltar,'' in which
he plays Burt Lancaster's son, a standup comic. Spacey, in fact,
did standup as an impressionist in Los Angeles. His specialty is
Johnny Carson, but he also does a mean Katharine Hepburn.
   Spacey went to Vancouver to shoot ``Wiseguy.'' A number of film
projects have moved to Canada because of lower production costs.
   ``I travel with a large black Labrador named Slate,'' Spacey
said. ``My dog's traveled all over the world, and he's this
incredible, like, East Side dog. I found him as a stray in '81. And
I hate hotel life, it's too busy. So I went on the hunt and found
this great apartment, very quiet and secluded down near the largest
park in Vancouver, Stanley Park. I thought, great, no actors.
Nobody knows about it.
   ``I get in the elevator the first day I'm living there, and
Katharine Hepburn is standing in it.''
   Hepburn was shooting an NBC movie. Spacey notes casually that he
and Hepburn knew each other already.
   When he was 15, Spacey said, he saw Hepburn in a Los Angeles
production of ``A Matter of Gravity.'' He waited for her in the
parking lot with a bouquet of flowers. The gesture won him a few
precious minutes with the actress.
   After a performance of ``Long Day's Journey,'' Hepburn came
backstage to congratulate the actors. Spacey said he was too choked
up to mention their meeting of years before.
   But the next day he sent her another bouquet, with a letter. He
got a note back, he said, which, in typical Hepburn style, noted it
was the first time she had received flowers for simply attending
the theater, not performing. Since then, the two have stayed in
touch.

   SIGN LANGUAGE _ NBC's ``Hunter'' features several deaf actors as
guest stars in the March 1 episode, ``Death Signs.'' The episode is
based on a mystery novel of the same title by Minneapolis writer
Edward Hunsberger and features deaf actors Mary Vreeland, Howie
Sego, David Balachier and Solly Brandt. Director James Whitmore Jr.
had a special challenge because scenes of the deaf actors' dialogue
had to include their signing, ruling out typical film devices such
as closeups and voiceovers.

<HEAD>A Wary Look At Bond Mutual Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since the Wall Street crash last fall, many
savers and investors have been taking a closer look at bond mutual
funds as an alternative to stock funds.
   Bond prices and bond fund net asset values have generally been
rising since October as interest rates have fallen.
   In fact, most analysts agree, one reason for that trend has been
strong demand for bonds by investors large and small who have been
scared away from the stock market.
   But if bonds and bond funds are the trendy thing right now, do
they make sense as a place to put your money if you aren't
particularly interested in high current income from your savings?
Does the prospective reward match up well with the risks involved?
   The overall return bond funds will produce in the future depends
to a significant extent on such imponderables as what happens to
interest rates and the economy.
   If you think the nation is headed for a calamitous, deflationary
recession, a fund investing in Treasury bonds would seem a logical
bet.
   The bonds are backed by a guarantee from the federal government.
And should circumstances ever reach the point that the United
States defaults on its obligations, just about all other domestic
investments (with the possible exception of gold) will surely be in
terrible shape as well.
   If, on the other hand, you think a financial Armageddon isn't in
the cards, the question is more problematical. A study just
conducted by Burt Berry, a San Francisco investment adviser, may
give you some pause before investing in a high-quality bond fund.
   In his newsletter NoLoad Fund X, Berry compared the performance
of four different types of funds over the 10-year period that ended
Dec. 31.
   That would seem a good test period, in that it included a couple
of recessions, an energy crisis, a near-panic on inflation, a long
bull market for stocks and, as a finale, a market crash.
   Especially pertinent for bonds, it also contained spells of both
high and rising interest rates and low and falling interest rates.
   To represent the stock market, Berry chose the Vanguard 500
Index Trust, a mutual fund set up to track as closely as possible
the ups and downs of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock composite
index. Each $100 invested in that fund at the end of 1977 grew to
$389 a decade later, for an annual compound growth rate of 14.6
percent.
   As a gauge of the performance of high-yielding, lower-rated
bonds _ widely known as ``junk'' bonds _ he picked the Fidelity
High Income fund, which increased a $100 investment over the 10
years to $323, for an annual compound growth rate of 12.4 percent.
   From the ranks of the high-quality bond funds, the Vanguard
Fixed Income Securities Investment Grade Portfolio increased $100
to $254, which translates to annual compound growth of 9.8 percent.
   In the same span the Reserve Fund, a money market fund, turned
$100 into $258, producing annual growth of 9.9 percent.
   A comparison of the last two funds is striking. Holders of the
high-quality bond fund were not compensated for the constant risk
they faced of fluctuations in the fund's net asset value. The
return they received failed even to match what investors got from
the money fund, which normally has a constant net asset value.
   This, said Berry, ``raises the question whether bond funds,
except for high yield bond funds, merit the additional risk
compared to money funds or the stock market.''

<HEAD>Former Musician Finds Happiness Making Peanut Butter</HEAD>

   Meet Richard M. Marcus, the gourmet
peanut-butter entrepreneur who's nuts about his job.
   ``I come in here every day and think, `Thank God! This is
marvelous!' It's the most exciting thing I've ever done in my life.
Somedays, I'm just bursting,'' he says before climbing a metal
ladder and ducking his head into a 700-pound vat of dry-roasted
peanuts.
   Marcus is a former symphony conductor, piano teacher and nursery
school administrator who spent the better part of his adult life
yearning for the gooey, old-fashioned taste of the peanut butter he
remembered from childhood.
   Which is why he started grinding peanut butter in his wife's
blender 25 years ago.
   And it is why he sells a couple of million dollars worth of his
speciality peanut butter in supermarkets, gourmet shops and
health-food stores from Maryland to Connecticut.
   ``I was making it and giving it to my friends, my students, my
dentist, in little 1{-ounce jars. Listen, 1{ ounces of peanut
butter is a lot of work when you're making it by hand. Anyway,
people kept saying, `You ought to sell this,''' said the
58-year-old president of C.R. Foods Inc. during a recent interview.
   He paused to look at several one-pound jars of Crazy Richard's
Peanut Butter that line his paneled office at the Camden County
plant. Then, breaking into a rich belly laugh, he shrugged, ``Who
knew?''
   Certainly not Marcus, who studied conducting with Leonard
Bernstein and toured as the musical director of the Royal Winnipeg
Ballet before coming home to Philadelphia to teach piano to
children.
   But even as he toured the world as a musician, he kept looking
for a peanut butter made from just plain 100 percent peanuts, just
like it says today on every one of his brown-and-orange labels.
   ``The truth is it really doesn't require those additives. Peanut
butter does not have to be salted, sweetened or stabilized. What
the heck's wrong with the oil rising to the top? Just take a table
knife and stir it down. Meanwhile what you have is a purer form of
food,'' he said.
   He learned he wasn't the only person who liked his specialty
line of peanut butter made sans sugar, salt and oil.
   In 1973, he started making his peanut butter with the help of a
plant in Conshocken, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia.
   By 1979, he sold a private school which he had started in
Philadelphia and turned to making peanut butter full time, first at
a rented facility in Pennsauken and now at the plant he bought last
year in this New Jersey suburb of Philadelphia.
   In his first year, he sold 18,000 cases. Now, he says he's
selling more than twice that amount annually.
   ``We will sell between three-quarters of a million to 1 million
jars this year. It's very exciting, especially when you realize
this is something I started in the back of my car with 144 jars,''
he said.
   The kitchen blender has long been retired and replaced by a 1910
grinding machine that churns out about 4,000 gallons of Crazy
Richard's Peanut Butter on a good day when the line is running and
all eight of the plant's employees are on hand.
   ``This machine doesn't know how to make modern-day peanut
butter. It couldn't even if we wanted to,'' said Marcus, who
stopped eating the modern stuff in the 1940s when homogenization
was introduced to peanut butter manufacturing.
   Homogenization breaks down the fat particles and blends the fat
throughout the rest of the product. Marcus' unhomogenized peanut
butter has swirls of oil floating on top, which in his words,
defines real peanut butter.
   Marcus says the homogenizing process ``altered, once and for
all, the taste of peanut butter in America.''
   ``Sometimes I'm amazed there was no public outcry.'' he said.
``Everything was homogenized in those days. Nobody knew what it
meant, but if it didn't have it, they wouldn't buy it,'' he said.
   There are three products in his line: creamy, chunky and
chocolate-flavored peanut butter. None is homogenized, all are his
favorites.
   ``I usually have it for breakfast. If you have it for breakfast,
you don't need lunch. It really quells the appetite,'' he said
while briskly strolling past pallets piled with burlap bags of
peanuts or cardboard cases of the finished product.
   He attributes much of his success to entering the market just at
a time when the back-to-nature movement was emerging in the 1970s.
   ``Processing changes the consistency and flavor of food. Here,
you get it in the natural state,'' he said, adding that luck also
seemed to play a major role in his success.
   Crazy Richard, although a regional food product, is slowly
expanding its market. It opened its national mail-order business in
December with three small advertisments in the New Yorker magazine.
   According to Marcus, the calls are still coming in.

<TEXT>
   Cadet Julianna Klejnot is out of uniform
this day at Norwich University, and that's unprecedented in the
168-year history of the oldest private military college in the
United States.
   Instead of her standard green skirt and shirt, she is wearing
blue jeans and a pink cotton warm-up jacket. She's one of three
cadets on a work detail winterizing a widow's home off campus.
   The cadets form a Peace Corps squad that has invaded the
military college in a pilot program designed to prepare students in
their junior and senior years for the Peace Corps or other
volunteer relief agencies.
   The program, the only one of its kind in the nation, is intended
as an alternative to campus ROTC and eventually military service.
   Norwich and Peace Corps officials hope other colleges will
follow suit and that the federal government will join with the
schools and finance the training effort as it has done with ROTC
military training on 400 campuses. Other schools already have made
inquiries to Norwich.
   A bill is pending in Congress that would authorize $5 million a
year for five years to enable the Peace Corps to test the program
at other schools. Norwich went ahead on its own and added the Peace
Corps to its curriculum last September, and will foot the cost
itself.
   The Peace Corps is campaigning to double its volunteers to
10,000 by 1992 and has challenged colleges to find ways to help.
   ``Because of programs like the one in Norwich, we will be able
to reach that goal,'' said James C. Flanigan, Peace Corps press
officer in Washington.
   Lewis Greenstein, the Peace Corps liaison with universities,
called the Norwich pilot program a promising model for other
colleges and the forerunner of a federally sponsored plan of
incentives for undergraduates to consider the volunteer service
agency. Still, he acknowledged ``the irony of a military school
preparing people for the Peace Corps.''
   The impetus came from university President W. Russell Todd, a
retired general with 32 years of Army service including combat duty
in Vietnam. Todd, his son and his father are all graduates of
Norwich.
   ``The most exciting thing about it is the way people perceive
Norwich University,'' said Todd. ``They've seen us as a bunch of
Rambos. And when we've expressed our mission in terms of the Peace
Corps, we've had a very, very positive reaction from some people.''
   Norwich University consists of two campuses and two student
bodies, one military and one civilian. The Peace Corps program has
drawn students from each.
   The Military College was founded in 1819, and the murals and
plaques on its walls attest to its heroes from the Mexican War of
1847 to Vietnam.
   The civilian campus, Vermont College, eight miles away in
Montpelier, was founded in 1834 as a Methodist seminary.
   It was merged into Norwich University in 1972 to allow a wider
variety of programs and more opportunities for expansion. The
military college has an enrollment of 1,300 cadets, including 81
women, while the civilian college has 900 students.
   Todd said he had been looking for a way to give the civilian
part of the student body the sense of national service _ and when
his wife, Caroline, came back from a conference on volunteerism
last summer, she told him, ``I found what we've been looking for.''
   She had heard Loret Miller Ruppe, director of the Peace Corps,
report on a proposal by Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president
emeritus of the University of Notre Dame, that the federal
government devise an ROTC-like Peace Corps preparation program that
colleges could incorporate.
   ``So rather than wait for the federal government to devise a
program, we decided we'd experiment,'' said Todd. ``When I
discussed it with the Peace Corps, they were fascinated.''
   But what surprised Todd was that the Peace Corps was not nearly
as interested as he was in putting the program on the civilian
campus. Instead, they wanted it on the military campus because of
the cadet corps' physical and leadership training. A compromise was
struck to make it available to students on both campuses.
   Only four students are enrolled in the first class, three of
whom had been in ROTC on the military campus and one from the
civilian campus. Todd, who attributed the low enrollment to the
program's newness last fall, said the goal is 60 students two years
from now.
   The four students now enrolled are not sure whether they will go
into the Peace Corps. Students are not committed to entering once
they graduate, nor is the Peace Corps under obligation to accept
them.
   As an incentive, Norwich is offering low interest loans of up to
$5,000 to students in their senior year, then writing them off if
they complete two years service in the Peace Corps.
   Military students at Norwich must take four years of ROTC, but
service after graduation is optional. If they agree to accept a
commission for active service after graduation, they are paid $100
a month in their last two years of college. Otherwise, they receive
no monthly stipend while in school and go into the reserves upon
graduation.
   Tuition, fees and room and board run $12,500 a year at Norwich.
   Miss Klejnot, a 21-year-old junior biology major from Portland,
Maine, initially enrolled in Air Force ROTC because she wanted to
see what the military was like. But after 2{ years, she decided she
didn't want to devote her future to a regulated life in the
military.
   ``The Peace Corps option was available so I decided to see what
it was like,'' she said.
   Even though she dropped ROTC, she still has to wear her uniform
and attend three formations a day, a requirement for all cadets on
the military campus.
   The Peace Corps program was designed by Richard May, the
director and university chaplain, and a committee of faculty
members who had worked with the Peace Corps and other volunteer
agencies in Third World countries. May himself had worked with
Cambodian refugees while serving as a Navy line officer in Vietnam.
   He also went to the agencies themselves to find out why their
volunteers did or did not complete their tours. The Peace Corps has
a dropout rate of about 30 percent. May said he found that many
volunteers have little community service experience and are
frustrated once they arrive overseas.
   The Norwich program includes three hours of work in the
community once a week, classroom studies of the Third World and a
summer internship between the junior and senior years in Jamaica
working in the slums of Kingston.
   ``The whole emphasis in the military is to keep from going to
war by strength,'' said Todd. ``The other half of the equation is
to make friends and make the world a better place ... And you won't
have to go to war either.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The 7,000-member military, long a
dominant force in Haiti, would be put to work building bridges and
promoting public health under a reorganization plan drawn up by the
nation's new leader.
   The plan, a key part of the 86-page platform of President Leslie
Manigat's National Democratic Progressive Rally, also would
separate the police from the armed forces and put them under
civilian control.
   ``There is a perception the army was ... corrupted by the
Duvalier dictatorship,'' the party document says. ``But there is
another truth, also incontestable, that the army was the victim of
the Duvalier dictatorship, which humiliated, dismantled and
decapitated it.''
   ``There must be a ... rehabilitation to wipe out the image that
the army is a repressive force against the civilian population.''
   Manigat as a candidate and now president has acted as a buffer
between the army and its harshest critics. He claims he can control
the institution that has dominated politics in this impoverished
Caribbean country of 6 million people from the time Haiti won
independence from France in 1804.
   Following the end of the 19-year U.S. occupation in 1934, the
army put Dumarsais Estime in as president in 1946, took power
itself in 1950 under Col. Paul Magloire, and helped Francois ``Papa
Doc'' Duvalier win a disputed election that began a brutal 29-year
dictatorship in 1957.
   Duvalier set up the Tonton Macoutes militia, which came to be
generally regarded as street thugs, when the army and coast guard
plotted against him. He emasculated Haiti's armed forces by
shuffling, retiring and sometimes executing commanders. He based
promotions on loyalty to him, and gave away state monopolies to his
military favorites.
   When Duvalier's son and successor, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier, fled into exile in February 1986, a military-dominated
junta led by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, then the army's chief of staff,
took control and ruled by decree for two years leading up to
Manigat's election Jan. 17 and inauguration Feb. 7.
   Opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the army
will return to the barracks as Namphy, now the commander in chief,
had pledged before the election, and whether Manigat has the power
to reorganize or dismantle an entrenched military hierarchy.
   A Western diplomat who closely tracks political and military
developments here said in an interview: ``All those who made
officer between 1959 and 1971 were Duvalier appointees of very low
quality. ... The officers who graduated in 1973 (two years after
``Baby Doc'' reopened the Haitian Military Academy) ... see things
differently. They're more progressive, they're more educated,
they're more professional.
   ``But they're blocked by the system, they're blocked by the
Duvalier appointees above them _ the colonels, the generals _ who
are not leaving,'' said the diplomat, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
   The military also has been linked to drug trafficking and to the
smuggling of cars, rice, sugar and other goods.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration opened an office in
Port-au-Prince in November because cocaine smuggling was rising so
rapidly in Haiti. A DEA informant, Osvaldo Quintana, testified in
federal court in Miami, Fla., in January that the trafficking was
taking place under the protection of Haitian soldiers.
   Armed Forces of Haiti officials rarely respond to such criticism
or charges. The military is a closed, secretive organization.
   All interviews have to be cleared with Brig. Gen. Carl Michel
Nicolas, who is Namphy's successor as chief of staff. Nicolas did
not respond to a written request for an interview with The
Associated Press.
   The present-day army structure was established by U.S. Marines
in 1916 to help put down a guerrilla-style insurrection. It is the
main component of the armed forces, which also include the police,
coast guard, fire department, a presidential guard and several
other battalions and departmental commands.
   The armed forces' main role is to protect the president and
maintain security _ a difficult task given their small numbers and
inadequate equipment and training. The fire department is
notoriously slow, and residents who have been robbed have to send
their own cars to pick up police investigators.
   Military recruits, drawn from the lower middle class, are paid
the equivalent of $160 a month on a pay scale that ranges up to
$1,800 for colonels and $3,400 for Namphy, the top commander.
   Enlistment terms run for six years and the military is
considered a good career in a country where more than half the
population cannot find steady work and the annual per capita income
is about $350.
   Training is limited, and equipment consists mostly of aging
hand-me-downs from the United States _ M-1 rifles and M-14
automatic weapons, a half-dozen helicopters of which only two or
three work, a few armored personnel carriers and some cutters that
patrol the coast.
   For 7,000 men, fewer than a single U.S. Army division, there are
five generals and 24 colonels.
   While Namphy is the commander in chief, the 500-man battalion at
the Dessalines Barracks acts semi-autonomously under Col.
Jean-Claude Paul.
   On Feb. 15 in Miami, Osvaldo Quintana, the DEA informant, linked
Paul to drug trafficking. The 35-year-old Miami businessman told a
news conference that he personally arranged a 100-kilogram
(220-pound) cocaine shipment in December, 1986. Quintana said, ``We
flew (the shipment) out of his own personal ranch in Haiti.''
   Quintana's lawyer in Miami, Ellis Rubin, said he was trying to
arrange for Quintana to testify before the U.S. Senate committee
that is investigating alleged drug smuggling by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the Panamanian military strongman.
   The Dessalines battalion was involved in almost every incident
last summer when soldiers shot and killed unarmed anti-government
demonstators.
   The green-uniformed, black-booted battalion, which patrols
streets in this sprawling capital of 1 million, was noticeably
absent Nov. 29, however, when gunmen with hand grenades and
automatic weapons killed at least 34 people and forced the
cancellation of what would have been Haiti's first free, open and
independently run presidential election in 30 years.
   ``It is the only unit that is really feared here,'' the Western
diplomat said, noting that some of the Duvaliers' Tonton Macoutes
were incorporated into it. ``The men are very loyal to (Col. Paul).
He ignores the chain of command and commands them directly.''
   Nevertheless, the diplomat said he was optimistic that Manigat
might succeed in his efforts to educate and modernize the armed
forces, and reorient soldiers to accept civilian rule and
participate in national development.
   ``The young officers aspire for change and they see it coming,''
the diplomat said. ``The problem remaining is the Dessalines
Barracks. We're waiting to see what Manigat will do about that.
   ``In the next five years, we'll see a new generation of officers
with diplomas who have traveled abroad, who are of a different
mentality, who are young and cultured. They can give a new image to
the army.''
   A leading Haitian academic who has had a 30-year acquaintance
with Manigat said he is not sure that will happen.
   Speaking only on the condition that he remain anonymous, fearing
recrimination, he said: ``The army wants to leave the civilian
structures of power, not power itself. There's too much money to be
made.
   ``Manigat is no puppet. Far from it. It is an extremely
interesting battle. He makes the army believe he supports it. The
army makes him believe they support him. Each one knows the other
is lying. ...
   ``In the final analysis, Manigat is not capable of dominating
the army or manipulating power. Haiti's immediate future is going
to be as tragic as its present and its past. I fear uprisings among
the people.''

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says
the economy seems ``in equilibrium,'' apparently signaling that the

   There had been speculation that the Fed was verging on a

recession. But Greenspan's remarks in a speech Tuesday suggested he
is taking a more cautious approach.

   As lawyers for three tobacco companies and a
man suing them for his wife's cancer death do battle inside a
federal courtroom, another struggle goes on outside, this one waged
by a squad of public relations people.
   At each break in the proceedings, PR specialists for the
companies buttonhole reporters covering the trial, drop by the
courthouse press room to say hello _ and make sure no questions
need to be answered _ and happily provide transcripts of testimony
favorable to their side, with key passages highlighted.
   The $22 billion-a-year tobacco industry has never shrunk from
getting its message across, but some observers say this trial
involving Liggett Group Inc., Philip Morris Co. and Lorillard Inc.
presents an especially striking image problem.
   Lawyers for the man suing the three companies have spent 4{
years gathering an unprecedented quantity of confidential internal
corporate documents and interviewing key company officials.
   In the first two weeks of the trial, for example, jurors have
seen notes by a Liggett vice president saying that selling a safer
cigarette would increase the risk of cancer lawsuits involving
existing products.
   A memo describing a meeting of Liggett officials and consultants
says the company ``wanted to sell cigarettes so we must get over
the hurdle of linking smoking and lung cancer.''
   Last Thursday, the jury heard testimony from an assistant
research director of Liggett saying that the company blocked
publication of research on a safer cigarette and his participation
in a scientific conference.
   The trial is likely to last two to four months.
   The documents and testimony were introduced to bolster Antonio
Cipollone's contention that Liggett, Philip Morris and Lorillard
were responsible for the lung-cancer death of his wife Rose, a
40-year smoker.
   Cipollone charges in part that the companies failed to do enough
research on the health effects of smoking, to disclose adequately
what research they did or to put a safer cigarette on the market.
   Cipollone doesn't have a PR staff but his two lawyers and their
courtroom staff of three don't stint on meeting the needs of
reporters. They readily present their interpretation of the day's
evidence during courtroom breaks, and make available copies of
documents deemed newsworthy as soon as U.S. District Judge H. Lee
Sarokin enters them into evidence.
   Does the trial truly present an image problem for the industry?
   ``No, I don't think so,'' said John Scanlon, one of five PR
professionals working on behalf of the tobacco companies. They
attend court nearly every day and work out of an office rented in
downtown Newark.
   A lawyer from the prominent Kansas City firm of Shook, Hardy &
Bacon is also on hand to answer all legal questions from reporters.
Inside the courtroom, a team of nine attorneys handles the defense.
   ``Our purpose here is just to keep things as clean as possible
in terms of trying to keep the story straight,'' said Scanlon, the
52-year-old senior vice president of the international PR firm
Daniel J. Edelman Inc.
   Scanlon has made his mark in the field in recent years by
presenting litigants' positions from courthouse steps while lawyers
handle the juries inside.
   The bearded, straight-talking member of former New York City
Mayor John Lindsay's administration handled the media in highly
publicized libel trials for CBS, the Boston Globe and McClatchy
newspapers.
   ``Our role is ... to present a balanced, objective picture of
what's going on,'' said Scanlon colleague Alan Hilburg, who has his
own PR firm in Dallas and a joint venture in New York.
   ``So many people enter with an anti-cigarette bias,'' he said.
Hilburg represented Pennzoil Co. in its legal battle with energy
giant Texaco Inc. and worked on Johnson & Johnson's campaign to
recover from the devastation of the Tylenol-tampering incidents.
   Image could have an impact on Wall Street. Some analysts have
said a legal loss in the suit _ which would be the industry's first
in such a case _ could lower the value of tobacco company stocks.
   However, said analyst Neal Kaplan of Interstate Securities Corp.
in Charlotte, N.C., ``It's hard to picture the tobacco companies'
image as suffering, because I don't think they have good images.''

<HEAD>GAF Opts Out of Delaware Takeover Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL MENEZES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GAF Corp.'s decision to exempt itself from
Delaware's new anti-takeover law reflects its own acquisitive
philosophy rather than a groundswell of corporate opposition to the
statute, experts say.
   GAF said Tuesday its board of directors voted to ``opt out'' of
takeover protections included in the controversial law, making it
the first major corporation to do so since the law took effect
earlier this month.
   The company is considering a $1.2 billion buyout offer from a
group led by chairman Samuel J. Heyman, who has steered the
chemical and building materials company through two major takeover
battles as part of its acquisitive corporate strategy.
   In proposing a buyout last September, Heyman said the move would
allow GAF to pursue its takeover strategy without having to worry
about the short-term earnings pressures faced by many publicly-held
companies.
   The management-led group has offered $40 in cash and $8.50 worth
of debt securities for each of GAF's roughly 27.7 million common
shares outstanding. Heyman, who also is GAF's chief executive,
controls about 10 percent of the outstanding shares.
   GAF stock rose 50 cents to close at $47.62{ a share Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The company is based in Wayne, N.J., but is incorporated in
Delaware, as are more than half of the Fortune 500 companies.
   A key provision of the new Delaware law would bar a potential
buyer from acquiring a company for three years after the buyer
accumulated more than 15 percent of the target company's stock. The
provision would not apply if the buyer acquired a total of 85
percent of the company's shares in the same transaction that it
passed the 15 percent threshold, or if the board of directors
approved the takeover.
   The provision was aimed at ``bust-up'' deals where a hostile
buyer sells off chunks of a target company in order to help finance
the buyout, and partial offers where the buyer acquires just enough
shares to win control of the target and offers the remaining
shareholders a lesser price for their stock.
   State-chartered companies have 90 days from the law's effective
date to exempt themselves from the law. After the 90-day period, a
corporation may exempt itself only by a shareholders' vote.
   Campeau Corp. and Black & Decker Corp., which have made pending
hostile buyout offers for Delaware-incorporated companies, have
filed lawsuits challenging the new law as unconstitutional.
   In announcing the GAF board's action, Heyman criticized the law
as an example of the proliferation of state anti-takeover laws,
which he said helped entrench managements at the expense of
shareholders.
   ``This is an expression of our company's corporate governance
philosophy,'' Heyman said in a telephone interview. ``And we simply
wanted to lend support to the effort in Congress for federal
pre-emption of state anti-takeover laws.''
   GAF also released a letter from Heyman urging David S. Ruder,
chairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, to
press Congress to pre-empt anti-takeover legislation in the states.
   The GAF management group's buyout bid is unlikely to turn
hostile, but the Delaware law could impede Heyman's takeover
strategy by putting restraints on GAF attempts to acquire other
companies.
   Last year, GAF made an unsuccessful hostile bid for Borg-Warner
Corp., which eventually agreed to a buyout by a group led by the
investment firm Merrill Lynch & Co.
   In late 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful but highly profitable
attempt to take over Union Carbide Corp. GAF withdrew after Union
Carbide undertook a major defensive restructuring, but made about
$250 million in profit by selling the Carbide stock it had
accumulated.
   GAF's decision to exempt itself probably does not signal a trend
among Delaware-incorporated companies, experts said.
   Many of the thousands of major companies incorporated in
Delaware pushed for approval of the law, and are deemed unlikely to
forego its protection.

<HEAD>Burger King Emphasizes Flame-Broiling in New Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp. hopes to reignite sales growth
with an advertising campaign that invokes the memory of the
flame-broiling-versus-frying debate that engulfed the fast-food
industry in the early 1980s.
   The campaign employs the theme ``We do it like you'd do it'' and
pitches Burger King's flame-broiling process as the one which
burger-lovers prefer.
   The campaign contains some reminders of the hard-hitting ads of
1982 in which Burger King asserted that tests showed people
preferred its flame-broiled hamburgers to those from the industry
leader, McDonald's Corp.
   McDonald's objected, saying its burgers are grilled and not
fried. The exchange became known as the Burger Wars.
   McDonald's name is only mentioned once in the new Burger King
ads, which were previewed for the media Tuesday in a New York hotel
room decorated to look like a backyard complete with sod, a
barbecue pit, lawnmower and picnic tables.
   In one new ad, a kindergartener discovers that her Burger King
hamburger has ``lines'' from broiling. She likes the taste and asks
a friend why she never gets similar lines on burgers from
McDonald's. Her pal shrugs.
   In another ad, a foreign exchange student savors a broiled
Burger King hamburger, and complains to some friends that
hamburgers are usually fried in his country. When told that some
burger places fry them here too, the student registers his
disbelief with a long ``Noooooo.''
   The ads begin appearing Feb. 29, and Burger King reportedly
plans to spend about $200 million putting them on the air and in
print over the next year.
   The approach, created by the agency N.W. Ayer Inc., replaces the
``Best Food for Fast Times'' theme that had been created by J.
Walter Thompson. Ayer was selected for the Burger King account last
fall.
   Burger King officials, speaking on condition they not be
identified by name, said consumers liked the ``Best Food'' and
``This is a Burger King Town'' campaigns created by Thompson but
failed to remember the characteristic that separates Burger King
from other hamburger chains _ flame-broiling.
   Charles S. Olcott, president of the Miami-based Burger King USA,
said the company's average sales per store had stalled. Burger
King's average sales per store cracked $1 million for the first
time in 1985 but rose to only $1.02 million in the year ended May
31, 1987.
   McDonald's had average sales per store of $1.37 million in 1986,
and has about 7,400 stores nationwide compared with 4,700 for
Burger King.
   They are the leaders in the fast-food market, which the trade
magazine Advertising Age estimates at $60 billion. Hamburgers
account for roughly half of the figure.
   Another hamburger chain, Wendy's International Inc., based in
Dublin, Ohio, recently began airing new versions of an old campaign.
   Wendy's and Hardee's Food Systems Inc., based in Rocky Mount,
N.C., are fighting for third place in hamburgers, analysts say.
   The agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates, has created some new
versions of a 2{-year-old campaign for Wendy's, known as
``Hamburger A-Hamburger B.''
   The campaign spoofs consumer taste-tests as an interviewer asks
someone in each ad to choose between a fresh-looking Wendy's
Hamburger A and an unappetizing Hamburger B.
   A truck driver picks B in one ad, and beams that he can have one
``in Shakeytown and still be tasting it in Salt Lake.'' In another,
a woman trying to lose weight said she'd pick B because she
wouldn't be tempted to eat it.
   Wendy's used humor to boost sales in 1984 when its advertising
asked, ``Where's the Beef?'' Wendy's average sales per store peaked
at about $861,000 in 1984, but slipped to $767,000 in 1986,
according to spokesman Paul Raab.
   With the new ads and the installation of SuperBars that offer
all-you-can-eat Mexican or Italian food or salads in about a third
of its 3,600 domestic restaurants, Wendy's sales are picking up,
said another spokesman, Denny Lynch.
   He added the company expects ``a gradual improvement through the
year.''

<HEAD>Firestone, Bridgestone Announce Joint Tire Venture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed merger of the tire-making divisions of
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. and Tokyo-based Bridgestone Corp. would
give a Japanese company control of the world's third-largest tire
company, experts say.
   Firestone, which was fifth in worldwide tire sales in 1986,
announced the plan to merge its tire business with No. 3
Bridgestone on Tuesday.
   Based on 1986 tire sales figures _ the most recent available _
of $2.3 billion for Firestone and about $3.1 billion for
Bridgestone, the proposed Firestone Tire Co. would rank third
behind Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. of the United States and Michelin
of France.
   More important, the joint venture, with majority ownership by
Bridgestone, would give the Japanese company a share of the U.S.
original-equipment tire market, said Ed Noga, editor of the
industry trade journal Rubber & Plastics News.
   ``Bridgestone is an aggressive company that wants to grow in the
United States, and they wanted to get access to the
original-equipment market,'' Noga said in a telephone interview
from Akron, Ohio, where Firestone's tire division is based.
   Chicago-based Firestone has been successful in obtaining
original-equipment contracts, meaning it supplies tires to car and
truck manufacturers to be used on new vehicles.
   Firestone made the surprise announcement of an ``agreement in
principle'' with Bridgestone and said it would ``enter into formal
negotiations immediately to reach a final agreement.''
   Firestone stock soared $9.25 to $45 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Tuesday following the disclosure.
   The announcement came amid speculation that Firestone would sell
its tire division to the Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli SpA.
   Bridgestone would own about 75 percent of the company, and
Firestone 25 percent.
   The two companies plan to operate the joint venture, doing
business worldwide as Firestone Tire Co., as ``a relatively
autonomous business unit, subject to the direction and control of a
board of directors consisting of persons representing the owners,''
the statement said.
   Under the tentative agreement, the joint venture would be
initially financed with $750 million in equity from Bridgestone,
$250 million from Firestone and $500 million in debt.
   The agreement also calls for Firestone to transfer tire assets
and liabilities with an equity value of about $1.5 billion to the
joint venture.
   After spinning off the tire business, Firestone would still
retain its 1,500 car-care centers; Firestone Diversified Products,
which includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building
products; Firestone Synthetic Rubber and Latex Co., which
manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in
Liberia; and Firestone Car Rental Inc.
   The Firestone tire division employs 30,000 people worldwide,
said spokesman Robert Troyer. The rest of Firestone's businesses
employ 23,500, he said.
   The creation of the joint venture is expected to generate more
than $1 billion in cash for the parent Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.,
the company said.
   Once final agreement with Bridgestone is reached, Firestone
would schedule a special shareholders meeting to seek approval of
the joint venture.
   The company also would ask shareholders to approve a financial
restructuring that ``would distribute a very substantial portion of
the cash generated by the transaction'' to Firestone shareholders,
the statement said.
   The joint venture's headquarters would be located in Akron and
would be assigned the exclusive right to use Firestone's name on
tires throughout the world.
   In a related move Tuesday, Firestone's board adopted a ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors.
   The plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20
percent or more of Firestone's common stock without the approval of
the company's board of directors. The Firestone statement said the
anti-takeover plan was ``intended both to ensure that Firestone's
shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint venture with
Bridgestone and to protect the full value of its shareholders'
investment in the company.''
   Firestone is the third-largest U.S.-based tire manufacturer,
behind Goodyear and B.F. Goodrich Co.
   Bridgestone held a 2 percent share of the U.S. replacement
passenger tire market last year and had a 7 percent share of the
U.S. replacement truck tire market, according to Modern Tire
Journal, an industry publication.
   Bridgestone is in the process of moving its Bridgestone U.S.A.
Tire Inc. headquarters from Torrance, Calif., to LaVergne, Tenn.,
where it operates its sole U.S. manufacturing plant, a truck-tire
factory, said Greg Smith, publisher of Modern Tire Journal.
   Firestone put its tire division in a free-standing position last
November when the top headquarters staff relocated from Akron to
Chicago, and the company will seek shareholder approval next month
to change the name of the company to Firestone Inc.

   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, wants the Federal
Trade Commission to explain why it decided not to pursue an
in-depth review of an attempted takeover of Cincinnati-based
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce transportation
subcommittee, has scheduled a hearing on the matter for today.
   The commissioners of the FTC were scheduled to testify as was
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
antitrust subcommittee. Metzenbaum has said the takeover raises the
possibility of reduced competition in several cities, higher
prices, less consumer choice and a substantial loss of jobs.
   Luken said Tuesday that documents suggest the FTC based its
decision on state and regional impact rather than on individual
metropolitan areas.
   He said that according to an FTC memorandum, the agency's staff
recommended against seeking additional information on the proposed
merger between Federated and Campeau Corp. of Toronto on the basis
of the competitive situations in Florida and New England as a whole.
   In other cases of department store mergers, Luken said, the FTC
has used individual metropolitan areas to gauge potential
anticompetitive effects.
   ``They've used a totally false basis for denying the heart of
competition,'' he said.
   FTC spokeswoman Susan Tichnor said the agency declined comment.
   Federated operates about 650 retail stores in 36 states and had
sales exceeding $11 billion in 1987.
   Its holdings include the New York-based chains of Bloomingdale's
and Abraham and Straus, Lazarus in Cincinnati, Filene's of Boston,
Burdines of Miami, Rich's in Atlanta, Bullock's and Bullocks
Wilshire in Los Angeles, and I. Magnin in San Francisco.
   Campeau, a retailing and real estate development company, on
Tuesday sweetened its bid for Federated to $66 a share, or about
$5.85 billion in cash, but Federated rejected it _ saying Campeau
lacked adequate financing for the takeover.
   According to the FTC memo, of particular competitive concern
were Federated stores in New England and Florida that compete with
Campeau's Jordan Marsh stores.
   However, the FTC said that based on 1982 figures, Campeau held
only 15 percent of the New England department store market compared
with 7.7 percent for Federated. In Florida, each company held 16.4
percent of the market, the FTC said.
   ``Although this acquisition would combine the first- and
third-largest department store chains in the country, we do not
feel that it raises competitive concerns,'' the memo concluded.
   Campeau bought Allied Stores in December 1986, then sold several
divisions of the company. However, it retained several retailing
chains including Ann Taylor, Brooks Brothers and Jordan Marsh.
   Ohio politicians are worried that Campeau will buy Federated,
sell major portions of the company and fire or lay off large
numbers of its employees. Federated operates 63 stores in Ohio,
employing about 16,000 workers in the state.
   Federated has spurned Campeau three times. Federated rejected
Campeau's initial $47-a-share, $4.2 billion takeover offer as
inadequate.
   It later turned down an improved $61-a-share, $5.4 billion bid
as well as Tuesday's increased offer because it was not convinced
Campeau had the necessary financing.

<HEAD>Olympia & York Offers to Raise Stake in Santa Fe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An offer by Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to
increase its stake in Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. is a shrewd
move intended to put the Canadian company's imprint on any
restructuring plans, analysts say.
   The Toronto-based real estate company, which seeks to increase
its interest in Santa Fe from 10.5 percent to 19.9 percent,
launched a $245 million offer Tuesday for up to 14 million shares.
   The Olympia & York offer, which expires at midnight March 13,
hinges on payment by Santa Fe of a special dividend. The cash
portion was paid Tuesday, and the debenture payment is set for
March 1.
   The Olympia & York offer amounts to $17.50 per share. It is
challenging a plan by Henley Group Inc. of La Jolla, Calif., to
wage a proxy fight for control of Santa Fe.
   ``I think Olympia & York are trying to make sure they have a
controlling position in the company,'' said Isabel Benham, an
analyst at Printon, Kane In New York. ``I think it's a smart move.''
   Henley Group is Santa Fe's largest shareholder with 15.7
percent. It plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to Santa Fe's
proposed $4.7 billion restructuring plan, which is seen as an
effort to stop Henley's advances.
   Olympia & York supported the restructuring, and its
representatives have been nominated to two seats on the Santa Fe
board.
   Santa Fe, which has about 156.2 million shares outstanding, said
it had been informed of Olympia & York's tender offer but had no
comment, spokesman Richard Hall said.
   Norm Ritter, a spokesman for Henley Group, said company Chairman
Michael Dingman was ``pleased with the move,'' but he would not
elaborate.
   Under the Santa Fe restructuring plan, shareholders would
receive $25 in cash and $5 in subordinated debentures per share.
   Henley has said the debentures are another effort by Santa Fe to
prevent a takeover, and is challenging them in court. Ritter said a
Delaware Chancery Court has set Feb. 26 as the date for a
preliminary hearing on the issue.
   A debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and
bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not
the company issuing it makes a profit.
   Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing the effects of
the restructuring plan, said it downgraded the securities ratings
of Santa Fe and its subsidiaries, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway, and Southern Pacific Co.
   Moody's said the downgrade was based on the ``substantial
weakening in the parent's debt-protection measurements because of a
recent corporate restructuring.''
   About $1.4 billion of securities are affected.

<HEAD>J&J Announces Acquisition Of Playtex Family Products Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnson & Johnson will significantly
expand its market share in the tampon field with the acquisition of
the maker of Playtex tampons, analysts say.
   On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson said it has agreed to pay $726
million for the Playtex Holding Co. division that makes the tampons.
   The addition of Playtex Family Products would give the health
care giant more than 30 percent of the U.S. tampon market, of which
it already has about 6 percent with the O.B. brand tampon, one
analyst said.
   Johnson & Johnson, the leading manufacturer of sanitary napkins
in the United States, and Playtex said in a joint announcement that
the transaction is still subject to government approval.
   Playtex Family Products is one of three operating subsidiaries
of Stamford, Conn.-based Playtex Holdings, itself once part of BCI
Holdings Inc., the company formed by the April 1986 leveraged
buyout of Beatrice Cos.
   The Family Products Divsion also makes disposable baby nursers,
household gloves and toothbrushes. The division accounts for half
the company's sales and 70 percent of its profits, said Chairman
Joel E. Smilow.
   The other two divisions are Playtex Jhirmack Inc., maker of hair
care products, and Playtex Apparel, a leading worldwide
manufacturer of bras, girdles and pantyhose.
   Proceeds from the sale of the Family Products Division would go
towards paying off debt incurred in the December 1986 leveraged
buyout of Playtex from BCI, said Smilow, who had been chairman of
BCI's consumer products division.
   He said the Jhirmack division would likely go on the selling
block next week. The divestments would allow Playtex to concentrate
on its intimate apparel lines, Smilow said.
   The apparel division last year had operating profits of $45
million on sales of $300 million.
   Analyst Lucy Olwell of Merrill Lynch in New York estimated sales
from Playtex tampons at $125 million, or about 25 percent of the
more than $500 million domestic tampon market, and sales from the
other family products lines at about $100 million.
   Tambrands' Tampex line is the market leader with 55 percent, she
said.
   Johnson & Johnson's more than one-third of the sanitary napkin
market should give it leverage in finding shelf and distribution
space for the Playtex line, said Ms. Olwell. Its experience in
feminine hygiene products should also allow for cost savings.

<HEAD>Company Settles for $3.65 Million in Hunt Silver Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company accused along with the Hunt brothers of
cornering the silver market in 1980 agreed to pay a Peruvian
company $3.65 million in an out-of-court settlement, a Minpeco SA
attorney said.
   AML Futures is the last of six financial institutions accused by
Minpeco of participating in an illegal price manipulation scheme
that drove up silver prices that led to substantial losses for the
company, owned by the government of Peru.
   The Hunts claim they did nothing illegal when they began pouring
money into the silver market. From August 1979 to March 1980, the
price of silver rose from $9 an ounce to $50 an ounce before the
market collapsed to about $10 an ounce.
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Thursday in the trial
against the Hunts _ Nelson Bunker, William Herbert and Lamar _
before U.S. Federal District Judge Morris E. Lasker in New York
City. Opening arguments in the case are scheduled for Wednesday,
Feb. 24.
   The AML Futures settlement and those by the other institutions
add up to $64.65 million, said Mark A. Cymrot, of Cole & Corrette,
the Washington, D.C., firm that represents Minpeco.
   Minpeco, Peru's largest precious metals distributor, seeks to
recover $150 million in damages.
   In addition to AML Futures, E.F. Hutton & Co. (now part of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.), Merrill Lynch, Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., Continental Grain Co.'s ContiCommodity Services
unit and Banque Populaire Suisse have reached out-of-court
agreements with Minpeco since 1986.
   The original damage claim was for $225 million to $252 million
that Minpeco said it lost in trading losses and potential profits
because of silver market manipulations in late 1979 and early 1980
by the Hunt brothers.
   On Dec. 22, Lasker ruled that Minpeco must subtract from its
damage claim profits made when silver bullion prices skyrocketed,
and could not sue for lost potential profits. These rulings reduced
the amount of the claim to $150 million.
   The Hunts also are facing two class action suits by more than
17,000 silver futures investors, who claim that illegal market
manipulation caused them losses.

<HEAD>Chrysler Raises Prices An Average 4.6 Percent on its Mitsubishi
Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said it has raised prices on its
imported Mitsubishi Motors Corp. cars an average 4.6 percent over
comparably equipped 1987 models.
   The new prices, announced Tuesday, also were higher in most
cases than tentative prices used since the model year began in
October, said Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart.
   The increases followed a debate between Chrysler and various
Japanese automakers in which Chrysler charged the Japanese
companies may be dumping cars and trucks on the U.S. market.
   Dumping is selling foreign products here for less than in their
home market.
   Chrysler has maintained the Japanese companies probably haven't
increased prices enough to reflect the dramatic jump in the value
of the Japanese yen against the dollar in the past two years.
   The dumping debate heated up at news conferences preceding last
weekend's opening of the Chicago Auto Show, where Chrysler also
introduced a new Japanese car, the Mitsubishi-built Eagle Summit,
for its Jeep-Eagle lineup.
   Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Vice President Robert McCurry charged
that if the Japanese were dumping, so were the U.S. automakers who
sell imported Japanese cars under their own nameplates.
   Of the Big Three U.S. automakers, Chrysler is the most dependent
on Japanese imports. About 11 percent of its cars and 40 percent of
its light trucks are built by Mitsubishi in Japan.
   McCurry also said Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors
Corp. were charging less for imported Japanese cars sold under
American nameplates than were Japanese companies who made the cars.
   At the prices announced Tuesday, a base Plymouth Colt two-door
hatchback will start at $5,998, down from $6,005 for a comparable
1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of $5,899.
   At the other extreme, the base price on the sporty Chrysler
Conquest TSi coupe rose to $18,683 from $18,005 on a comparable
1987 model and up from the tentative 1988 price of $18,155, Stewart
said.
   Chris Cedergren, industry analyst with J.D. Power and Associates
in Agoura, Calif., said Japanese automakers have held down prices
on their entry-level cars and made up the difference on
higher-priced models.
   Automakers value entry-level buyers because of the chance they
will become loyal customers and buy more expensive cars from the
same company later.

<HEAD>Iacocca Announces Plan For Kenosha Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chariman Lee Iacocca says his
company will establish an estimated $20 million trust fund to help
the 5,500 autoworkers at its Kenosha plant meet housing, education
and other needs after they lose their jobs when the factory closes.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who has threatened to sue Chrysler over
the plant closing, called the announcement ``a good first step,''
but that the automaker must do more to avoid the possibility of
ending up in court.
   Leaders and members of United Autoworkers Union Local 72, which
represents 5,000 hourly workers at Kenosha, were less enthusiastic.
   About 80 union members set up a picket line outside the hotel
where Iacocca held a news conference to announce the trust fund,
the money for which would come from Chrysler's profits on all its
cars sold in Wisconsin this year.
   Iacocca said based on 1987 sales, the Chrysler-Kenosha Trust
Fund should grow to about $20 million by the end of the year. It
would be administered by a seven-member board of trustees appointed
by state and local officials and by Chrysler and its dealer
organizations.
   ``We are not interested in a charity program that is financed
only if Chrysler cars are sold,'' said Rudy Kuzel, bargaining
chairman for Local 72. ``We want jobs. He could have said I will
keep my word and keep the plant open.''
   Kuzel also said the offer of a $20 million trust fund was too
little.
   ``Our attorneys tell us the damages in this case are $1
billion,'' Kuzel said, adding that figure includes the plant's
total payroll for five years.
   But leaders of the national UAW were warmer in their reaction.
   ``Chrysler should ... be commended for showing a degree of
responsiveness in this painful situation,'' the UAW said in a
statement released in Detroit.
   Iacocca said the trust fund would be in addition to
approximately $1.3 million that the company will give governments
to repay for capital improvements such as roads. It would also be
in addition to benefits guaranteed workers in the contract between
Chrysler and the UAW and benefits negotiated by the union in a
plant closing agreement, Iacocca said.
   Iacocca stressed, however, there was no way he would change his
mind about closing the Kenosha carmaking plant, which is scheduled
to shut down this summer. Chrysler will still employ about 1,000
people in Kenosha at an engine plant.
   ``The decision to close Kenosha was a crummy call but one we had
to make. Time and the marketplace just caught up with an 86-year
old plant,'' Iacocca said.
   Iacocca also said the company's decision to close the plant did
not break any contracts with the state regarding the future of the
former American Motors Corp. facility.
   ``We are guilty as hell of being cockeyed optimists and we are
paying the price for the optimism right now,'' Iacocca said.
   Iacocca said the company had hoped to continue building cars in
Kenosha for three-to-five years but car sales were not good enough
to allow that.
   ``What we did unintentionally was to create expectations that
couldn't be fulfilled,'' Iacocca said.
   Iacocca said the decision to establish the trust fund should not
be viewed as a precedent for other auto plant closings.
   He said Kenosha was a unique situation because of the impact the
closing will have on a relatively small city. Kenosha's population
is about 75,000.
   Iacocca also said Thompson's threats to file a lawsuit against
the nation's third largest automaker were not a factor in setting
up the trust fund.
   Iacocca said he, Thompson and House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., would meet in Washington on Thursday.
He said he hoped an agreement would be reached eventually that
would avoid the need for the state and Chrysler to meet in the
courtroom.

<HEAD>Premier Says Government May Expand Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting Premier Li Peng said Wednesday the
government may expand its subsidies of major commodities to cut the
inflation rate, which hit 7.5 percent last year.
   In a speech marking the Lunar New Year, Li told a crowd of about
6,000 at the Great Hall of the People that the rapid rise in
prices, especially for food, was China's most pressing economic
problem, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Xinhua said Li admonished governments at all levels to make
price stability a priority and said the State Council, China's
cabinet, is considering ways of expanding the subsidy program.
   ``However, we should not follow the road as we did in the past
where prices were rigidly controlled by administrative means,'' Li
added.
   Li did not specify which price subsidies would be increased or
by how much, or whether price supports would be introduced for
non-subsidized items.
   Any such move would be a dramatic step away from the
government's goal of gradually ending price controls and letting
market forces take over.
   Subsidies for non-staple foods, including vegetables, have been
gradually lifted in the past few years and the government has
reduced the proportion of grain and other staples sold at
subsidized prices.
   The subsidies are believed to be a major contributor to the
government deficit, which rose 14 percent in 1987 to 8 billion
yuan, or $2.1 billion.

<HEAD>EEC Predicts Slow Growth, But No Recession in 1988-89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic growth in the 12-nation
European Economic Community will drop below 2 percent this year and
in 1989 as a result of the stock market crisis last fall, a report
released Thursday said.
   But the report by the EEC executive Commission predicted there
would be no economic recession.
   The Commission said that the turmoil on the world's financial
markets late last year has ``increased the uncertainties in the
world economy'' and upset earlier economic predictions for a 2.5
percent average growth in the Common Market.
   EEC economists said this level of growth is too low to bring
about a reduction in the rate of unemployment, which currently
stands at 11.5 percent.
   Peter Schmidhuber, the EEC commissioner for economic affairs,
told a news conference the analysis was based on the assumption the
U.S. dollar will stay stable at 1.60 German marks and 125 yen
through the next two years.
   Changes on the financial markets ``would have profound
implications'' for the European economies and could offset any
national efforts to stimulate growth, Schmidhuber said.
   The Commission said the slow growth will be caused largely by a
decline in the growth of domestic demand and sluggish industrial
investments.
   Exports, the Commission said, will remain flat in 1988, while
imports will increase by about 7 percent. Inflation, although up
against 1987, will remain between 3 percent and 5 percent.
   According to the report, virtually all EEC countries will
experience a decline in economic growth compared with 1987.
   The report said the EEC should contribute to economic growth of
its member states by stimulating cooperation in research and
development, investing in large infrastructure products and
improving the regulatory climate.

<HEAD>Former Broker Pleads Guilty; Nationwide Hunt Is On For Another</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former broker has pleaded guilty to charges he
defrauded his employer of more than $1 million in a scheme
involving illegal trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Meanwhile, another defendant charged with making bogus trades
while disguised in a wig remains missing.
   Daniel Dewey, 39, a former bond futures trader at the Chicago
Board of Trade is now the subject of a nationwide manhunt after a
fugitive warrant was issued, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ruben Castillo
said.
   Dewey was among 10 brokers, traders and other people named in
indictments last week by U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas. The men were
accused of four separate schemes at the Board of Trade and Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Jeffrey Donnelly, 28, of Chicago, a former trader in Standard &
Poor's 500 stock index-futures contracts, pleaded guilty Tuesday to
two counts of commodities fraud.
   The plea agreement states that he defrauded his former employee,
CRT Services Inc., by diverting money from profitable S&P futures
trades to four accounts between January 1984 and July 1986.
   Under the agreement, the government reserves the right to grant
Donnelly certain immunity from prosecution in return for his
testimony, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Pearl.
   U.S. District Judge James Alesia set April 7 for sentencing.
Donnelly faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1
million fine.
   Authorities charged that Donnelly split the profits with four
other people after diverting the money. Pearl said the four agreed
to pay income taxes on the money, and Donnelly received his share,
or 35 percent of the profits, in cash.
   Dewey was indicted in Chicago on charges he conspired with three
others to use a wig, phony credentials and other paraphernalia to
enter restricted areas at the Board of Trade to make certain trades.
   The indictment says Dewey placed orders to buy or sell U.S.
Treasury bond futures contracts, then turned the trading cards over
to a co-defendant.
   If the position turned out to be profitable, the trades were
cleared, but if they turned out to be losers, Dewey and the others
could walk away from the loss and it could not be traced, according
to the indictment.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Fall In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction fell 1.9 percent in
January to its lowest level since the end of the last recession,
the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were being
built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units
last month.
   The January setback, which followed a 15.5 percent plunge in
December, surprised analysts who had been forecasting a modest
rebound in construction activity.
   The housing sector is being watched closely at present since it
is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a
new recession.
   While the majority of economists believe the country will be
able to escape a downturn in this presidential election year, some
forecasters dispute this outlook, in part because of concern about
the record collapse of stock prices last October.
   The January annual starts level was the slowest pace since a
rate of 1.30 million units in December 1982, just as the last
recession was ending. The January pace was almost 24 percent below
the rate at the beginning of 1987.
   The weakness last month came from a 2.9 percent decline in
construction of single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate
of 1.01 million units.
   This drop offset a 0.8 percent increase in construction of
multi-family housing, wich edged up to an annual rate of 366,000
units, still 35 percent below the level of a year ago. This sector
has been in a slump because of the impact of the 1986 tax law,
which removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real
estate.
   In other ominous news, permits, considered a good sign of future
activity, fell an even sharper 8.2 percent in January to an annual
rate of 1.25 million units, the lowest level for permits since
January 1985. Permits had fallen 7.4 percent in December.
   The January weakness in construction starts came from two
sectors of the country. Starts fell 21.8 percent in the Midwest to
an annual rate of 223,000 units and dropped 17.1 percent in the
South to 469,000 units.
   These declines were partially offset by a 27.6 percent increase
in starts in the Northeast, where homes were being built at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 291,000 units, and a 21.2
percent increase in the West, where starts rose to a rate of

<HEAD>EEC Investigates Alleged Dumping By Japanese TV Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Commission said Wednesday
it was investigating allegations that seven Japanese photocopier
manufacturers were ``dumping'' their products, or selling them for
less than they do in their home market.
   The Commission also said it began an inquiry into whether South
Korean companies were dumping small color television sets in the
European market.
   The Commission said the Japanese companies _ Canon, Konishiroku,
Matsushita, Minolta, Ricoh, Sharp and Toshiba _ were accused of
making photocopiers in Europe using mainly components from Japan to
get around a 20 percent anti-dumping duty on photocopier imports
from Japan.
   The EEC decided a year ago to impose the duties, affecting the
$1 billion photocopier market. EEC companies account for only 15
percent of the market.
   The Commission said that the latest complaint alleged that the
Japanese companies had started or increased production of
photocopiers in Europe when an initial anti-dumping inquiry started.
   The complaint also charged that the value of the Japanese
components in the photocopiers exceeded by 50 percent the value of
all the other components used to make the machines.
   In the case involving South Korea, a group of European consumer
electronics companies had complained that Korean imports were
increasing by more than 100 percent a year and that prices of the
television sets were considerably lower than those charged by EEC
manufacturers.
   The prices undercut EEC producers by as much as 38 percent,
forcing EEC manufacturers to cut prices, according to the industry
complaint.
   EEC producers were alleged to have lost 6 percent of the EEC
market as a result of the Korean dumping at a time when consumption
rose by 11 percent, the domestic industry claimed.

<HEAD>Government Worried At Trend Toward Even Later Filings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the trend by many taxpayers to delay filing
their federal tax returns continues to spread, the federal
government could feel the pinch _ right in the pocketbook.
   Lawrence B. Gibbs, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service,
notes that five years ago, 14 percent of all individual returns
were filed in January and 34 percent in April. But last year, only
4 percent were filed during the first month and almost 40 percent
in April.
   ``If this trend were exacerbated by tax reform (the sweeping
1986 law), it could jam the system by slowing down processing and
the issuance of refunds,'' Gibbs told a Senate Finance subcommittee
Tuesday. ``As a result, there could be a high price to pay.
   ``If we don't process returns within a 45-day period after the
return due date the government must pay interest on refunds,'' he
noted. That due date is April 15.
   The IRS is not ready to push the panic button, even though 9.7
percent fewer returns have been filed this year than during the
same period in 1987. Just a week ago, that gap was 17.5 percent.
   ``It does not appear that there is an easy solution to reversing
the trend'' toward late filing, Gibbs said. He cited surveys
finding that the chief reasons for later filing include simply
procrastinating and failure to receive some information necessary
to prepare a return.
   The IRS is not sure how the new tax law, with its lower rates,
reduced deductions and higher personal exemptions, will affect the
late-filing trend. Some returns are simpler under the new law;
others are more complicated.
   The backlog of unprocessed returns at the IRS was down to 11.5
million last week, compared with 12.9 million at this time last
year. The number of couples and individuals receiving refunds, 1.7
million, also dropped, from 1.9 million. The average refund was up
13 percent, to $743.
   By the end of the tax-filing season, the IRS expects that about
80 percent of the 107 million returns will qualify for refunds.
   But no one can say with a great degree of certainty, because of
the new tax law and the fact that most workers filed new
tax-withholding forms with their employers last year.
   Gibbs said the IRS is watching closely to determine whether a
significant number of Americans may have had too little tax
withheld from paychecks last year an, thus, would owe the
government when they file. ``Pockets of underwithholding among
certain groups of taxpayers, such as high-income taxpayers, working
couples and young wage earners, could exist,'' he said.
   Because of confusion about the new law and a complex W-4
withholding form, the IRS has agreed to waive underpayment
penalties if too little was withheld from 1987 wages. That amnesty
does not apply for 1988 earnings.
   Despite more personnel, more equipment and a desire to see that
taxpayers get all the information and forms they need, ``We are
concerned that the complexity of the law and the volume of changes
will provide us ample opportunities to make mistakes,'' said Robert
LeBaube, director of taxpayer services.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Finance subcommittee,
offered some rare words of praise for the IRS.
   Pryor, after studying reports that found IRS employees in the
past sometephone questions from taxpayers, decided to test the
improvements that the IRS has been bragging about. Last week, he
said, he assigned eight members of his staff to call IRS
``assistors'' around the nation with some questions.
   ``Not one staff member who discussed a particular problem ...
encountered anyone on the other end of the line except a very
courteous, friendly IRS employee who almost went overboard to
help,'' Pryor said.
   His staff is still checking the answers to the questions. But
one thing is sure, Pryor said: It often took several tries to ring
an IRS number and not get a busy signal.

<HEAD>Industrial Output Up, Housing Starts Down in January</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with January industrial output
figures. Uppicks 4th graf pvs: They have...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industrial output rose 0.2 percent, while housing
construction dropped by 1.9 percent in January, the governemnt
reported today.
   The Federal Reserve said production at American factories, mines
and utilities increased for the fourth consecutive month _ despite
a sharp drop in the production of autos _ following gains of 0.4
percent in both November and December.
   Those gains helped push the production level up by 6 percent in
the past 12 months, providing further evidence of the strength in
the manufacturing sector.
   The weaker dollar has been a major benefit to U.S. industry,
making American products competitive once more on overseas markets
and boosting exports to record levels.
   Earlier, the Commerce Department said January's seasonally
adjusted annual rate of housing construction stood at 1.38 million
units a month, the lowest level since the end of the last recession.
   Some analysts had expected a small rebound in the building of
new homes and apartments, following December's 15.5 percent plunge
in December.
   They have been keeping a close eye on the housing sector, since
it is often one of the first sectors to turn down at the start of a
new recession.
   But the jury is still out on that question.
   On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks
that the economy appears to be balanced riled the bond market, but
Wall Street ignored him and gave the Dow Jones industrial average
its best showing in more than a month.
   Greenspan's comments in a Washington speech Tuesday were
interpreted by bond traders as a signal that the nation's central
bank won't move quickly to push interest rates down to stimulate
the economy, as had been widely expected. He spoke against a
background of government statistics that suggested the economy
isn't slowing down, despite the warning signs given by the stock
crash four months ago. On Friday, for example, the government
reported that the nation's trade deficit shrank in December and
inflation increased.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, the most closely watched issue, fell
about $10 per $1,000 in face value after Greenspan spoke, though
the price recovered somewhat later. The bond's yield, which moves
inversely to price and can be a sensitive indicator of interest
rates, rose to 8.46 percent from 8.43 percent late Friday.
   On Wall Street, investors largely overlooked Greenspan's remarks
and the bond market's reaction, buying stocks in a late-afternoon
rally that baffled strategists because signs of higher interest
rates usually depress stock prices.
   The Dow Jones average rose 22.71 points to 2,005.97, its first
finish above 2,000 since Jan. 8, when computerized selling and a
presidential panel's report on the October stock crash sent the
index down 140.58 points to 1,911.31.
   The value of all U.S. stocks rose $16.9 billion Tuesday,
according to the Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index.
   In other economic news Tuesday, a national real estate trade
group said sales of existing homes steadied in 1987 at close to 4
million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the stock market
collapse.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes and condominiums totaled 3.885 million units
last year, down 0.3 percent from the 1986 level of 3.897 million
units. Sales in both years were the fastest pace of this decade.

<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   B.F. Goodrich Co. today announced plans to
sell its vacant 27-building downtown complex to Covington Capital
Corp., a group of New York developers.
   Terms were not disclosed. However, Goodrich's treasurer, Robert
McMillan, described the price as nominal.
   Most of the buildings involved in the sale have been vacant
since fall, when Goodrich shut down several manufacturing
operations.
   The former B.F. Goodrich corporate headquarters, now occupied by
the Uniroyal Goodrich group, and the Goodrich adhesives plant are
not included in the sale.
   The property up for sale encompasses the site of Goodrich's
original factory building, Goodrich officials said. The company
opened in 1870.
   At its peak of operation, the manufacturing and office complex
consisted of 90 buildings and 28,000 workers.
   Production lines gradually were shut down or moved out of town.
Goodrich now is based in Bath Township, an Akron suburb.

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. today boosted to $61 a share its
tender offer for Federated Department Store Inc. and promised to
sweeten the offer again to $66 a share if Federated agrees to be
acquired by midnight Sunday.
   The move came a day after the giant retailer's board rejected
Campeau's separate proposal to pay $66 a share, or about $5.85
billion, for Federated in a definitive merger agreement.
   Federated's board, meeting in New York on Tuesday, instead
approved a financial restructuring that could include the sale of
most assets other than the company's department stores.
   Campeau sweetened its tender offer to $61 a share, or about $5.4
billion, from the $47 a share, roughly $4.2 billion, it initially
offered on Jan. 25. Federated rejected the initial tender offer as
inadequate.
   Federated stock fell $2.87{ to $60.87{ a share in early New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Federated also has rejected Campeau's alternative offer for a
definitive merger agreement twice, including the latest $66
proposal and Campeau's initial $61 a share offer, because it was
not convinced Campeau had the necessary financing.
   But Campeau spokeswoman Joele Frank said in New York today that
``financing for a $66 bid is absolutely solid.''
   On Tuesday, Campeau said Youngstown, Ohio, developer Edward J.
DeBartolo agreed to increase his previously announced $400 million
loan to $480 million to help support the buyout. Toronto's
Reichmann family, through its Olympia & York Enterprises Ltd., has
agreed to buy a $260 million interest in Campeau Corp., Campeau
spokesmen said.
   Campeau said the Bank of Montreal and Banque Paribas of France
had agreed to provide $200 million each in equity and to coax
another $100 million in equity from other banks.
   The developer reiterated today that First Boston Corp. said in a
letter it is ``highly confident'' it could provide up to $1 billion
in bridge financing.
   Campeau said in a statement that it will increase its tender
offer to $66 a share if Federated ``enters into a definitive
agreement'' to be acquired by midnight Sunday.
   The tender offer is conditioned upon ``certain recently enacted
anti-takeover legislation being invalidated'' or not applicable to
the offer, Campeau said in a statement.
   The developer is challenging a new anti-takeover law in Delaware
as unconstitutional. While Federated is based in Cincinnati, it is
incorporated in Delaware.
   Federated said Tuesday its bankers and financial advisers
studied the latest bid and decided that Campeau did not have the
financing for such a transaction and that ``its ability to arrange
financing continued to be questionable.''
   Federated said its investment bankers believed the company's
shareholders could be hurt if Federated entered into an agreement
with Campeau and the transaction couldn't be completed at the
specified price.
   The Federated board of directors then authorized negotiations
with other unspecified parties that have shown an interest in
buying Federated or some of the company's assets.
   The company said in a statement: ``The board also considered a
restructuring plan, which would involve sales of most of
Federated's non-department store assets, the possible issuance of
preferred stock, and either an extraordinary dividend or the
repurchase of more than 50 percent of Federated's outstanding stock.
   ``The board requested that management proceed intensively with
the further development of such a plan, and authorized management
to negotiate the terms of such preferred stock and to obtain prompt
bids for all of Federated's non-department store assets.''
   Federated's directors said a shareholders' rights plan adopted
by the board last month would take effect Thursday. The plan, known
as a ``poison pill'' defense, is designed to discourage an unwanted
takeover by making such a move more expensive.
   The company, which operates about 650 stores in 36 states and
had sales exceeding $11 billion in 1987, said Nov. 28 it had 88.5
million shares outstanding.
   Federated said it spent the weekend negotiating with numerous
parties, including Campeau, which bought Allied Stores Corp. in
December 1986.
   Among those believed to be interested is the takeover specialist
firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co., based in New York.
   Last week, in a letter to Henry Kravis, Campeau Chairman Robert
Campeau warned that any agreement between Kohlberg, Kravis and
Federated would be challenged in court.
   After the Allied purchase, Campeau sold several Allied divisions
but retained several retailing chains, including Ann Taylor, Brooks
Brothers and Jordan Marsh.
   Federated's holdings include the New York-based Bloomingdale's
and Abraham and Straus, Filene's of Boston, Burdines of Miami,
Rich's in Atlanta, Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles,
I. Magnin in San Francisco and Lazarus in Ohio.

   The former girlfriend of a Midwest Stock Exchange

   Tatum and Ramonia Patton, 24, of Chicago, had quarreled in the

   She apologized and offered no resistance as she was taken into

   When police arrived, the woman was sobbing and saying, ``I shot

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans were mixed on a lack of foreign demand and improved
growing conditions for the South American crop, analysts said.
   Wheat prices retreated despite the Soviet Union's bid Tuesday
for 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, and despite the Agriculture
Department's announcement Tuesday afternoon that it had sold less
wheat than expected in last Friday's weekly auction.
   The Agriculture Department recently targeted the Soviet Union
for sales of 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat, but the market
has been disappointed at the Soviets' slowness in buying the grain,
said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago for Research Department Inc.
   ``They're really taking their sweet time about it and waiting
for prices to drop down,'' Karlin said.
   Corn prices declined on prospects for increased farmer selling,
he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2} cents to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.27{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to { cent lower with March at $1.97} a bushel; oats were { cent to
2\ cents lower with March at $1.89{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent
lower to 2\ cents higher with March at $6.22 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures led the declines in reaction to Tuesday's monthly
USDA cattle-on-feed report showing a larger number of cattle being
fattened for slaughter than the market had expected, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .45 cent to .87 cent lower with February at
71.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .97 cent lower
with March at 82.40 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent to .60 cent
lower with February at 47.00 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .40 cent to .80 cent lower with February at 55.00 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Tuesday.

   The stock of Societe Generale de
Belgique, for whose control Italian Financier Carlo De Benedetti
has been fighting for a month, set a new record on Brussels stock
exchange Wednesday, on the third day of the Italian's public bid.
   The holding company's stock price made closed at a record high
of 5,000 Belgian francs, or $143, up 140 francs, or $4 from
Tuesday's close, and 1,000 francs, or $28.5, above the price
offered by De Benedetti in his public bid for 15 percent of Societe
Generale.
   Trading volume in Societe Generale was higher than on Tuesday,
with a total 294,000 shares changing hands.
   Meanwhile, the French Dumenil-Leble group announced it had sold
its stake in Societe Generale to Cerus, a company controlled by De
Benedetti, exercising its option to buy approximately two million
shares and 700,000 warrants of Societe Generale.
   The 1.4 billion French-franc move _ worth $242 million _ gives
De Benedetti exclusive control over the stake of 18.6 percent in
Societe Generale shares which Cerus and Dumenil-Leble have shared
up to this point.
   Societe Generale's voting share capital totals 28.2 million
shares while the exercise of all warrants would raise that figure
to 30.9 million shares.
   De Benedetti's bid for 15 percent of Societe Generale was made
at 4,000, or $114, a share.

   British Airways PLC said Wednesday its pre-tax
profit fell 5.4 percent in its fiscal third quarter from the same
period a year ago.
   Britain's largest airline said the profit for the three months
ended Dec. 31 fell to 35 million pounds, or $61 million, from 37
million pounds, or $64 million, in the same period a year earlier.
   Earnings per American Depositary Share totaled 59 cents, based

74 cents, based on an exhange rate of $1.47 per pound, in the
year-earlier quarter, company said.
   The company declined to provide specific reasons for these
profit declines.
   Quarterly sales rose 10 percent to 881 million pounds, or $1.5
billion, from 801 million pounds, or $1.4 billion.
   The company said the results exclude those of British Caledonian
Group PLC, which British Airways acquired for 250 million pounds.
   For the nine-month period ended Dec. 31, British Airways said it
earned 174 million pounds, or 24.2 pence a share, compared with 173
million pounds, or 24 pence, a share.
   Earnings per American Depositary Share in the nine months
totaled $4.43, compared with $3.53 in the same period of 1986, the
airline said.
   Sales over the period gained 12 percent to 2.8 billion pounds
from 2.5 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The company said those results were affected by a 10 percent
increase in operating costs over that period; costs for new
aircraft and a 20 percent increase in expenditures for fuel.

<TEXT>
   The obscure cargo airline that Eastern
Airlines is counting on to keep it aloft in case of a strike faces
questions about its safety record as the government decides whether
it is fit to carry passengers.
   Few air travelers have ever heard of Orion Air, a North Carolina
cargo carrier which serves such air freight companies as United
Parcel Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator.
   But if labor strife intensifies at Eastern, many of that
airline's customers may find themselves with tickets to fly Orion _
and the prospect has caused federal safety officials to step up
scrutiny of the airline.
   Recently Eastern entered into an agreement with Orion, including
the leasing of 26 of Eastern's jetliners, that call on the airline
to take over much of Eastern's routes if pilots and mechanics go on
strike. Orion would fly the Eastern planes with its own pilots and
ground workers, Eastern officials said.
   But the FAA has yet to approve Orion for passenger service, and
a senior agency official said Tuesday that an enforcement
proceeding is under way that likely will include fines against
Orion because of past safety violations.
   An FAA inspection report on Orion shows ``a large number of
serious safety infractions,'' said Anthony Broderick, the FAA's
associate administrator for aviation standards.
   Broderick said the airline's management has taken actions ``to
permit Orion to safely operate its cargo business'' and training
and maintenance procedures ``are being corrected to prevent similar
occurrences in the future.''
   At congressional hearings Tuesday, James L. Heffernan, an Orion
vice president, said problems cited by the FAA have been corrected.
   Heffernan called Orion's safety record excellent and maintained
that much of the FAA's concerns stemmed from a ``misunderstanding''
by FAA inspectors about Orion's method of record keeping.
   ``Orion Air responded to each of the FAA's proposed findings
last summer and are still in the process of resolving these issues.
Obviously, if any of the issues compromised air safety, the FAA
would not have allowed Orion Air to continue to operate,''
Heffernan continued.
   But Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairman of the House
government operations and transportation subcommittee, called Orion
``an airline in near-shambles'' and raised questions about its
fitness to fly passengers.
   In an interview, Steven Kolski, a vice president of Eastern,
said Eastern executives believe Orion's past safety problems have
been resolved. He expressed confidence that the airline's fitness
will be assured before the FAA allows it to engage in
passenger-carrying flights.
   ``We got a report that said they (Orion) are a hell of a lot
better today than they were a year ago and that most, if not all,
of their problems were behind them and they were in good shape,''
said Kolski.
   Kolski said Eastern is relying on the agreement with Orion to
keep Eastern's service going if its 10,000 mechanics go on strike
and its 4,000 pilots refuse to cross the picket lines.
   But FAA officials were not as certain that all of Orion's safety
shortcomings are behind it. The FAA cited ``systemic difficulties''
with the airline's training program, record keeping and use of
operational handbooks that are not yet corrected.
   And the agency disclosed it was seeking civil penalties against
Orion for past violations, although no amounts were cited.
   ``Once the systemic problems have all been corrected, the FAA
will turn its attention toward developing an appropriate
enforcement package, including a proposed fine'' for past
violations, Broderick said.
   Orion's problems stem from safety violations found in early 1987
_ violations that attracted little public attention because Orion's
55 jets were carrying only cargo.
   Among the findings by FAA inspectors were a shortage of required
training records; inadequate auditing of maintenance facilites;
poor documentation on the qualifications of ``check pilots'' who
decide on the performance of line pilots; incomplete flight
operations manuals, instances of pilots failing to go through
required refresher training; and training programs that did not
meet federal standards.
   In a related development Tuesday, the FAA made public a report
on improvements Eastern Airlines has made in its own maintenance
program since the airline was fined a record $9.5 million two years
ago.
   The FAA said that Eastern has made ``substantial progress'' to
correct past deficiencies, but that some concerns remain about the
airline's deferred maintenance program and repeated problems with
certain equipment.
   Nevertheless, Eastern officials hailed the latest FAA findings
which showed that corrective actions had been taken in 52 of the 53
areas cited by the FAA two years ago.
   ``We are very pleased. This report shows that Eastern has
corrected the deficiencies,'' said Kolski.

   Prices closed higher in moderately light trading
on the London Stock Exchange Wednesday.
   There was little fresh news to affect share prices, dealers
said. Instead, sentiment turned moderately favorable following
Tuesday's release of positive British economic data, they said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index ended 13.5
points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 1,748.1.
   Volume increased to a modest 374.9 million shares from 293.6
million Tuesday.
   Dealers said share prices rose as investors took a second look
at Tuesday's figures for Britain's public sector borrowing
requirement, which is a measure of its budget deficit, and
industrial production. The reports were better than market
expectations but had failed to boost share prices on Tuesday.
   Gains in New York and Tokyo overnight and continued gains in
early trading on Wall Street also inspired confidence in London
investors, dealers said.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved a $25 million
settlement Tuesday to end a class-action lawsuit brought by former
owners of Montgomery Ward & Co. catalog stores.
   The settlement will affect 852 store owners, with the average
payment totaling $24,000.
   The owners sued 2{ years ago to challenge Montgomery Ward's
decision to stop taking catalog orders from independent store
operators.
   The agreement, reached last month shortly before the case
reached a jury, also requires Montgomery Ward, a retail chain based
in Chicago and owned by Mobil Corp., to drop countersuits to
recover nearly $2 million in debts from operators.
   ``The settlement is fair, reasonable and completely adequate
considering the hazardous litigation,'' U.S. District Judge
Clifford Scott Green said in approving the settlement Tuesday. ``It
is clear to this court that a jury could have found in favor of the
defendants.''
   He also said only about 20 former owners objected to the
settlement, and the objections centered on the distribution of the
settlement, an issue to be handled later.
   The opposition included two former store owners who testified
Tuesday.
   Thomas Imerito, of Wysox, Pa., and Frank Logue, of Montrose,
Pa., said they doubted their payments would cover their costs.
   Their attorney, Albert Slap of Philadelphia, said he will appeal.
   ``The assignment of the distribution could split the class into
warring factions, and this kind of opposition reflects on the
fairness of the settlement,'' he said.
   Harold Cohen, a Philadelphia attorney representing most of the
plaintiffs' lawyers, asked the judge to set an immediate hearing on
lawyer fees. He suggested a payment of $3.5 million plus $500,000
in expenses.
   The judge said he would decide the issue later, possibly after
agreement is reached on dividing the $25 million.

<HEAD>Forecast: 1988 Construction Contracts To Drop 4 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for release at 6:30 p.m. EST.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction contracts will drop 4 percent this
year, led by steep declines in office and other commercial building
and lesser drops in housing and public works projects, according to
a forecast released Wednesday.
   Builders will commit to $246.2 billion worth of new contracts in
all of 1988 compared with $255.2 billion last year, according to an
update of the 1988 Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook, put out by
McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co.
   In coming months, construction activity will only be slightly
affected by the stock market crash of last October, the McGraw-Hill
unit said.
   ``Since October, consumer confidence has been shaken, federal
budgetary restraint has been tightened and expectations for the
economy's growth in 1988 have been lowered,'' said George A.
Christie, chief economist at the company. ``At the same time,
however, the outlook for interest rates has brightened.''
   Accordingly, so long as a recession is avoided, this mix of
positive and negative developments will not pose a serious threat
to a credit-sensitive industry such as construction, he said.
   Christie predicted nonresidential building would drop 7 percent,
to $89.5 billion this year, led by the ``highly overbuilt office
market.''
   Office building activity should drop by 14 percent to $19.2
billion, and will have to fall even more ``if the office vacancy
rate is to shrink from its current 20-plus percent,'' he added.
   Reduced consumer spending and weaker home-building together
could mean a 12 percent drop in the retail sector, to $21.6
billion, while industrial building should pick up by 6 percent,
Christie said.
   While many would-be home buyers remain on the sidelines in the
wake of the market crash, lower interest rates will lure others
back into the market, he said.
   Even so, single family homebuilding will ease 1 percent, to
$84.9 billion, and multifamily housing will slump 4 percent, to
$26.3 billion, dragged down by a large surplus of apartments, he
added.
   The report predicted nonbuilding construction would be pulled
two ways in 1988, with environmental building increasing by 2
percent and transportation building down by 4 percent.
   As a result, total nonbuilding construction will shrink by 1
percent overall, to $45.1 billion, the forecast said.

<HEAD>Reagan's New Hearing Aid _ The `Jellybean'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company that made President Reagan's new
hearing aid is thinking of nicknaming it the Jellybean in honor of
the sweet tooth of its most famous customer.
   ``We used to say it was the size of a cashew nut, but he
(Reagan) reminded me it's also the size of a jellybean,'' Thomas A.
Powers, an executive of Siemens Hearing Instruments Inc. said
Wednesday.
   ``We may start to call it the Jellybean,'' said Powers, the
director of professional relations for Siemens. ``After all, he's
the president.''
   Reagan last week began wearing a $1,900 Siemens hearing aid
equipped with a remote-control device for screening out unwanted
noise. The publicity helped spur sales of hearing aids to the
general public.
   ``President Reagan deserves recognition for being willing to
publicly acknowledge that he wears a hearing aid,'' said Helmut
Ermann, president of the Piscataway, N.J.-based subsidiary of West
Germany's Siemens AG.
   Ermann said Reagan ``is sending a very powerful message to many
millions of people all over the world, really, whose quality of
life is adversely affected by hearing loss.''
   Reagan's new hearing aid, for which he was fitted in December,
can be switched to pick up telephone signals, preventing the
whistling sound of feedback that comes from holding the receiver
against the ear.
   Reagan dates his hearing loss to the noise of a gun going off by
his ear during his acting days in Hollywood. He wears a hearing aid
in each ear.

<HEAD>Channel Rail Tunnel Roughly on Schedule, and Within Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction of the tunnel under the English
Channel is roughly on schedule and within budget, a co-chairman of
the Anglo-French building consortium Eurotunnel said Wednesday.
   Alastair Morton, acknowledged that certain aspects of the
construction of the 31-mile rail tunnel under the English Channel
have fallen behind schedule, but said none of the delays so far led
him to believe the tunnel will not open in 1993 as planned.
   The start of tunneling on the French side was delayed when one
suppliers for the boring machine went bankrupt and the machinery
had to be finished in the United States, but he said the machine is
now in place and will resume boring shortly.
   Boring on the English side of the channel began as planned on
Dec. 1 and is progressing on schedule, he said.
   The main problem on the British side is the country's shortage
of skilled labor, Morton said. As a result, British contractors are
hiring overseas, Morton said.
   Morton said Eurotunnel has spent about 300 million pounds, or
$525 million, of the 750 million pounds it raised in a stock
offering last year.
   Eurotunnel must use up the funds raised in the offering before
it can draw on 5 billion pounds in bank loans also arranged last
year.
   Eurotunnel is ``basically within budget'' and won't draw on the
bank loans until the end of 1988, Morton said.

   Soybean futures closed sharply higher on the

   Soybean prices soared near the close as talk circulated that ABC
radio news commentator Paul Harvey had reported the discovery of a
``sudden death syndrome'' affecting soybean crops, said Jerry
Gidel, an analyst for G.H. Miller & Co.
   Harvey's Chicago office confirmed the commentator had reported
such a finding, based on a wire service report about a research

reported the story in 1986.
   The soybean complex also was supported by expectations of new

   The soybean rally spread to the neighboring grain pits, pushing
corn prices higher and bringing wheat futures off their lows of the
day, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.27{ a bushel; corn was 3{

late bid for gold of $446.25 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's late
bid of $444.15.
   Traders said the dollar moved in a narrow, technical range. The
currency jumped higher last week when the government a reported
smaller-than-expected merchandise trade deficit for December, but
traders said a lack of follow-through buying based on the trade
number continued to push the dollar lower.
   ``In general, the market has lost its luster to buy the dollar
in this environment,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris
Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Additionally, one large order to sell dollars took its toll on
the currency, said Dan Holland, an assistant vice president at
Discount Corp.
   The dollar also fell in earlier European trading, when
profit-taking pushed the currency down from its session highs.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar continued its decline against the Japanese yen, closing at
130.41 yen, down 0.09 yen from Tuesday. Later, in London, it was
quoted lower at 130.30 yen.
   In New York, the dollar closed at 130.125 yen, down from 130.385
yen on Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.7490, compared with Tuesday's $1.7440. In New York it
cost $1.75415 for one British pound, more expensive than Tuesday's
$1.74625.
   Other later dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7010 West German marks, down from 1.71045;
1.3995 Swiss francs, down from 1.4040; 5.7395 French francs, down
from 5.7805; 1,253.50 Italian lire, down from 1,258.00, and 1.2673
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2685.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7065 West German marks, down from 1.7120;
1.4030 Swiss francs, down from 1.4038; 5.7635 French francs, down
from 5.7815; 1.9190 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9200; 1,258.75
Italian lire, down from 1,260.00; and 1.2656 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2687.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $446 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $445.50. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $446, compared with Tuesday's $444.50. Hong Kong markets were
closed for the Chinese New Year.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $446 a troy
ounce, up from $445 on Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market, where the metal
traded at a late bid price of $6.42 a troy ounce, compared with
Tuesday's $6.39. On the Comex, silver closed at $6.430 a troy
ounce, up from $6.355 on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Soar The Limit In Technical Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices soared the limit allowed for daily trading
Wednesday in a technically inspired rally that lifted the market
out of several weeks in the doldrums.
   On other markets, soybean futures surged while grains were
mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; precious metals
advanced slightly; energy futures were mostly lower; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   Cotton prices for delivery in March, May and July all advanced
the 2 cents a pound daily limit on the New York Cotton Exchange in
buying that accelerated sharply when the May contract reached 63.20
cents a pound, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for the
investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The rally marked the largest daily movement for those contracts
_ all of which are based on the 1987 crop _ since Jan. 26, when the
price on all three contracts fell nearly 2 cents a pound.
   Simon attributed most of the buying to technical, rather than
fundamental factors.
   Judy Ganes, an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said rumors of Soviet purchases of U.S. cotton may also have
contributed to the rally.
   ``That's it as far as fundamentals,'' she said. ``The market's
just been quiet for a while and today it began to pick up.''
   The contract for March delivery settled at 63.70 cents a pound.
   Soybean prices soared near the close on the Chicago Board of
Trade as talk circulated that ABC radio news commentator Paul
Harvey had reported the discovery of a ``sudden death syndrome''
affecting soybean crops, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst for G.H.
Miller & Co.
   Harvey's Chicago office confirmed the commentator had reported
such a finding, based on a wire service report about a research
project at the University of Illinois. The Associated Press
reported the story in 1986.
   The soybean complex also was supported by expectations of new
foreign purchases of soybean meal and soybean oil, said Joel
Karlin, an analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   The soybean rally spread to the neighboring grain pits, pushing
corn prices higher and bringing wheat futures off their lows of the
day, analysts said.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 32 cents lower with March at $3.27} a
bushel; corn was 3{ cents to 4} cents higher with March at $2.01} a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $1.91} a
bushel; soybeans were 11\ cents to 13\ cents higher with March at
$6.33{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after declining sharply earlier in the day in reaction to
the Agriculture Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report.
   The report showed larger numbers of cattle being fattened for
slaughter than the market had anticipated. That sent futures prices
lower in early trading, but steady cash prices for livestock
limited the losses, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .68 cent higher with February
at 71.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .85 cent
higher with March at 83.85 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with February at 47.17 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were unchanged to .28 cent lower with February at
55.70 cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures advanced slightly on the Commodity
Exchange in New York, but analysts said the move did not indicate a
change in the recent downward trend for gold and silver prices.
   ``The dollar appears to be holding steady, the balance of trade
figure is showing improvement and that is leading to a rather weak
investment demand outlook for gold,'' said Stephen W. Platt, metals
analyst in Chicago for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.80 higher with April at $449.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 7.8 cents higher with March at $6.45
a troy ounce.
   Energy futures finished mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after starting out higher in reaction to weekly American
Petroleum Institute figures showing sharp drawdowns in gasoline and
distillate stocks.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 4
cents higher with March at $16.61 a barrel; heating oil was .39
cent to .79 cent lower with March at 45.58 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent lower to .38 cent higher with March at 46.66
cents a gallon.
   Stock index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.25 points lower at 259.85. The
underlying spot index was off .61 point at 259.21.

<TEXT>
   When foreign corporations and investors look at
the United States these days, they see a big ``For Sale'' sign.
   The weak dollar, relatively cheap U.S. stock prices and fears of
trade protectionism have escalated the already heady pace of
foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies.
   While some U.S. businesses and politicians are worried about the
impact of the invasion, many corporations are jumping to hook up
with cash-rich foreign suitors.
   ``We're finding there's a lot of interest out there,'' said Ian
P. Dunn, a managing partner in New York with the British investment
banker Samuel Montagu Inc. ``We're working on a number of deals at
the moment.''
   At the same time, hostile foreign takeovers are expected to be a
minority. Aside from several high-profile hostile battles already
waged this year, foreign buyers mainly are expected to be
business-oriented suitors interested in long-term benefits rather
than quick profits.
   Recent weeks have witnessed a mini-wave of foreign buyouts. In
one of the biggest, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. and Tokyo-based
Bridgestone Corp. announced a joint venture by which Bridgestone
would acquire 75 percent of Firestone's global tire business, the
world's fifth-largest, for $1 billion.
   A flurry of smaller deals also have surfaced, including:
   _Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s acquisition of Union Bank of Los Angeles
for $750 million from Britain's Standard Chartered PLC.
   _British publisher Pearson PLC's $283 million purchase of the
textbook publisher Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.
   _The $36 million buyout of Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a
corporate image consultant, by WPP Group PLC, the British marketing
firm that last year acquired advertising giant J. Walter Thompson
Co. for $566 million.
   Still being contested are two of the year's biggest proposals:
BAT Industries PLC's hostile $4.2 billion offer for Farmers Group
Inc. and Toronto-based Campeau Corp.'s hostile $5.4 billion bid for
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   The 1988 buying spree had been expected following the rise of
foreign buyouts in recent years. Foreign buyers _ chiefly the
British and Japanese _ spent an estimated $41.9 billion in
acquiring 326 U.S. companies in 1987, according to Mergers and
Acquisitions magazine, compared with $25.2 billion in 358 deals
during 1986 and just $2.2 billion for 116 takeovers in 1983.
   British buyers alone accounted for about $30 billion in U.S.
acquisitions last year, such as British Petroleum Co.'s $7.8
billion buyout of Standard Oil Co., while the Japanese took in
about $6 billion worth of purchases, including Sony Corp.'s $2
billion acquisition of CBS Inc.'s records business.
   The speedup in foreign buyouts coincided with the sharp decline
in the dollar's value that has increased foreign buying power in
the United States over the past two years. The Japanese yen's value
has risen by about 100 percent against the dollar since early 1985,
and the British pound by 64 percent in that time.
   Furthermore, although U.S. stock prices have rebounded somewhat
from their lows following October's market crash, they generally
remain well below their peaks of last summer, keeping the market
prices of many American businesses at cut-rate levels.
   That presents a unique opportunity for foreign businesses to
make long-desired strategic expansions into the United States.
Bridgestone, for example, would become a major U.S. competitor for
the first time through its Firestone venture.
   Such considerations also make it likely that hostile deals will
be the exception rather than the rule.
   ``What the Japanese would like to establish over here is a
significant presence, a more efficient operation,'' said Shuehei
Sato, head of U.S. merchant banking for Japan's Sanwa Bank. ``In
order to achieve that, it's necessary to have a good team of
managers, a good working relationship with workers or labor
unions.''
   ``That could only be achieved, in the Japanese manager's mind at
least, by having friendly negotiations,'' he said.
   But along with those welcoming new foreign investment are
critics warning against a tidal wave of foreign ownership, ranging
from members of Congress to Lee Iacocca, the entrepreneurial
chairman of Chrysler Corp.
   Critics say foreign takeovers could cause the same problems they
attribute to the domestic takeover wave of the 1980s, including
lost jobs, a weakened industrial base and lost tax revenue.
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who already has proposed legislation
to restrict domestic hostile takeovers, has asked the General
Accounting Office to examine the impact of foreign buyouts and the
benefits that foreign corporations might enjoy in pursuing U.S.
companies.
   Dorgan and others have said the laws of some countries such as
Switzerland gave foreigners legal veils of secrecy and other unfair
advantages in their attempts to buy U.S. companies.
   ``We're going to try to analyze what the threat is and what we
might want to do in response to it,'' Dorgan said in a telephone
interview.

   The stock market posted some scattered losses
Wednesday, running into some resistance after the rally of the past
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 110.25 points over
the past five sessions, slipped 4.98 to 2,000.99.
   Declines slightly outnumbered advances among New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 746 up, 774 down and 478 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 176.83 million shares, against 135.38
million in the previous session.
   Analysts said optimism about the economic outlook had gradually
been increasing lately, but traders still seemed reluctant to chase
after rallies after they have run for a few days.
   On Tuesday Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, described economic activity as stable if not especially
``buoyant.''
   There was some disappointment in the financial world over
Greenspan's remarks implying that the Fed had no plans for any
further relaxation of its credit policy.
   But brokers said that message also meant that policymakers saw
no great cause for concern about an impending recession.
   The Fed's report Wednesday morning that industrial production
rose 0.2 percent in January was in line with advance estimates on
Wall Street.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak lost { to 42{;
Philip Morris 1{ to 89[; International Business Machines 1 to 112},
and American Telephone & Telegraph [ to 29\. An exception was Ford
Motor, up { at 44{.
   Firestone Tire & Rubber dropped 3 to 42 after jumping 9\ points
on Tuesday, when the company agreed to form a joint venture with
Bridgestone Corp. of Japan that would take over Firestone's tire
business.
   Cooper Tire climbed 2[ to 34|.
   Pillsbury fell 2| to 31~. The company said analysts' estimates
of its earnings for the fiscal year ending in May were too high.
   Navistar International led the active list, up [ at 4{. The
company reported sharply higher quarterly earnings from continuing
operations.
   Lomas & Nettleton Financial fell 1[ to 16|. The company said it
would take a charge of about $93 million in the current quarter in
connection with moves to cease its homebuilding operations and
restructure its mortgage banking division.
   Allegis rose ~ to 72. The company said it began its tender offer
for as many as 35.5 million of its common shares for $80 apiece.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $1.58 billion, or 0.06
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .24 to 145.72.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 202.43 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell .50 to 298.59,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down .62 at 259.21.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.54 to 355.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 279.09, up .16.

   General Motors Corp. has recalled nearly 322,000
Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Cadillac cars for reasons including
potential fires in some models, the automaker said Wednesday.
   GM recalled 132,000 1987 Buick, Pontiac and Oldsmobile
subcompact cars with 2.0-liter engines because a fuel line may
crack or separate, leaking fuel and leading to a possible engine
fire.
   The fuel lines on the 1987 Buick Skyhawk, Pontiac Grand Am,
Pontiac Sunbird and Oldsmobile Firenza models are being replaced at
dealerships, GM said.
   GM said it recalled about 179,000 1986 and 1985 Buick Somerset
and Buick Skylark models for replacement of headlight switches that
may overheat and make the lights turn on and off by themselves.
   Dealers are replacing power window switches on about 5,500
Cadillac Eldorado convertibles because of potential shorts and
ensuing door fires caused by water dripping onto the switches when
the driver's-side door is open, GM said.
   On about 5,300 1988 Cadillac Brougham models, dealers are
inspecting and replacing rear-seat shoulder belt systems because
the belts may not meet federal standards and may not lock properly
in a crash, GM said.

<HEAD>Nogales Quits Univision as New Owners Take Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luis Nogales stepped down Tuesday as
president of Univision Inc. after control of the nation's leading
Spanish-language television network was transferred to a group led
by Hallmark Cards Inc.
   The 45-year-old Nogales joined Univision in December 1986 as
head of its news operation and became president last September.
   Nogales, a former chairman and chief executive of United Press
International, said the new owners had asked him to stay on in the
job but he declined.
   ``It was not an offer I found attractive at this point in my
career,'' Nogales said, adding that he was bothered by a variety of
factors including the ``reporting structure.''
   Named to replace Nogales on an interim basis was Univision's
longtime sales executive William Stiles, said spokeswoman Emma
Carrasco.
   Stiles will work closely with Danny Villanueva and Joaquin
Blaya, heads of the company's stations in Los Angeles and Miami,
she said.
   Hallmark, based in Kansas City, Mo., and First Chicago Venture
Capital of Chicago agreed last November to aquire the network for
an undisclosed price.
   Previously, Hallmark and First Chicago bought five major
Spanish-language television stations from Univision for $301
million. The stations are located in Los Angeles and Fresno,
Calif., San Antonio, Texas, Miami and New York.
   Nogales will remain with Univision's parent, Univisa S.A., a
diversified entertainment concern with cable television, record,
video and other operations.
   Nogales said he will spend some time exploring a number of new
businesses for Univisa before it is determined what he will head.

<HEAD>Bell Group Reports $350 Million Loss From October Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian investor Robert Holmes a
Court said his conglomerate Bell Group lost 500 million Australian
dollars, or about $350 million, as a result of the October stock
market crash.
   The loss announced Monday was the largest corporate loss in
Australian history, according to newspapers.
   Holmes a Court was considered the richest man in Australia until
the Oct. 19 world crash that started on Wall Street. The company's
flagship firm, Bell Group Ltd., said revaluing of investments
caused the losses, which also were spread across Holmes a Court's
Bell Resources Ltd. and J.N. Taylor holdings.
   A Bell Group spokesman said the losses reflected a ``clearing of
the decks'' and the adoption of one-time writedowns.
   Holmes a Court has a 30 percent holding in Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. Ltd., one of Australia's largest companies. BHP
shares dropped sharply during the stock collapse.
   All of Holmes a Court's investments in publicly traded
companies, except for investments in his associated companies, were
written down to market values as of last Dec. 31, the spokesman
said.
   The Bell companies also reported unspecified losses from selling
investments, and said they have sold more investments since Dec. 31.
   Holmes a Court said he wanted to emphasize that the writedowns
represented unrealized non-cash losses, and didn't necessarily
reflect permanent drops in the value of the investments.
   The statement said the companies were considering a
restructuring ``to reflect new conditions and objectives.''

<HEAD>ITT Sets Earnings Records For Quarter And Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp.'s fourth-quarter profit quadrupled as
the company set earnings records for both the quarter and the year,
the 68-year-old multinational conglomerate said Tuesday.
   ITT said its profit of $447 million, or $3.01 per share,
contrasted with a profit of $102 million, or 66 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue in the quarter rose 9.3 percent to $5.2
billion from $4.7 billion a year earlier.
   The quarterly results included a gain of $252.8 million from the
sale of ITT's 24 percent interest in Britain's STC PLC, the company
said.
   For all of 1987, ITT said its profit more than doubled to $1.02
billion, or $6.76 a share, from $494 million, or $3.23 a share, in
1986. Revenue in 1987 rose 12 percent to $19.5 billion from $17.4
billion in 1986.
   ITT is a diversified company that owns Sheraton Hotels,
insurance companies, basic manufacturing, defense contracting and
forest products. It has a 37 percent interest in French-based
Alcatel NV, a major telecommunications equipment manufacturing
company.
   ``All of our core businesses performed better in 1987 than in
1986, with the exception of our Defense Technology segment, where
remedial actions are under way,'' Rand Araskog, the chairman and
chief executive, said in a news release.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices stagnated or fell marginally
Wednesday in light trading, reflecting fresh uncertainty over the
outlook for interest rates and the economy's direction.
   The Treasury's 30-year issue lost about $2 per $1,000 in face
amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and is considered
a sign of interest rate trends, rose to 8.48 percent from 8.46
percent late Tuesday.
   Bond prices generally had been rising and interest rates falling
this year up until last Friday, when economic statistics suggested
the economy isn't slowing down significantly despite the stock
market crash in October.
   Signs of a slowdown or impending recession often rally the bond
market because they imply the Federal Reserve will ease credit
conditions. But Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan obscured the Fed's
intentions on Tuesday, when he said important features of the
economy seem stable. Bond prices fell as a result.
   On the other hand, fresh economic evidence reported Wednesday
suggested recession remains a possibility. The Commerce Department
said housing construction fell in January to the lowest level since
the end of the last recession, and the Fed said industrial
production grew only marginally.
   ``I think the whole range of numbers have gone from imminent
recession to that of a more balanced approach, so we don't know
where we're going,'' said William Veronda, director of fixed-income
investments at Financial Programs Inc. in Denver. ``It's really
painted a mixed bag.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities fell 1-32 point
and long-term issues fell about 3-16 point, the financial
information service Telerate Inc. said.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.09 to 113.05. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.40
to 1,182.63.
   In corporate transactions, industrials were largely unchanged
and utilities fell [ point in light trading.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.24 to 282.10.
   Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, general obligations fell about
\ point and dollar bonds were unchanged, municipal traders said.
Business was light.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 5.73
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 4 points to 5.98 percent and year bills were
unchanged at 6.29 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6| percent, down from 7 percent late Tuesday.

   ``Our whole trial team believes that justice has been done,'' he
said.
   The defendants _ former Beech-Nut president Neils L. Hoyvald and
a former vice president, John F. Lavery _ faced hundreds of
violations of federal food and drug laws, and conspiracy and mail
fraud charges.
   Lavery was convicted of all 448 counts in the indictment, Roche
said.
   Hoyvald was found guilty on 351 counts, all violations of
federal food and drug law, Roche said.
   The jury couldn't agree on the remaining counts regarding
Hoyvald, he said.
   The company, which also was named in the November 1986
indictments, pleaded guilty last year.
   The indictment charged that Beech-Nut shipped adulterated and
misbranded juice made from phony concentrate throughout the United
States and overseas from 1978 to 1983.
   The juice, labeled as 100 percent apple juice for babies, was
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no
apple juice, the prosecution charged. It was bottled at a Beech-Nut
plant in Canajoharie in western New York state.
   There has been no evidence that the juice caused any health
problems, the prosecution said.
   ``This case was tried not in terms of being a health hazard,''
Roche said Wednesday. ``It was tried as a fraud case. It was our
view that the evidence in this case demonstrated a massive
defrauding of Beech-Nut's consumers by Beech-Nut.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas C. Platt did not fix a specific
date for sentencing, but it should be within six to eight weeks,
Roche said.
   Roche said both Hoyvald and Lavery ``face substantial prison
terms and substantial fines.''
   Conspiracy is punishable by five years in prison and@or a
$10,000 fine; mail fraud is punishable by five years and@or $1,000;
food and drug law violations are punishable by three years and@or
$10,000, Roche said.
   The two men were allowed to remain free on bail until
sentencing, the prosecutor said.
   During closing arguments last Monday, Roche said that evidence
presented at the three-month trial never showed Hoyvald and Lavery
``worrying about selling fake apple juice to babies,'' but they
were instead concerned about ``bad publicity and profits.''
   ``This is not the way we expect corporate executives in this
country to operate,'' he said.
   Hoyvald's attorney, Brendan Sullivan Jr., argued that the
government had ``fallen short by an enormous margin'' of proving
his client's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
   Sullivan charged that two key prosecution witnesses who work for
Beech-Nut had lied when they testified that they had repeatedly
warned executives that the concentrate was phony.
   Steven Kimelman, Lavery's attorney, said his client was ``a man
who had nothing to gain by committing a crime.'' Lavery was in
charge of manufacturing at the Canajoharie plant.
   The jury began deliberations last Tuesday. It was not told that
on Nov. 13, three days before the trial began, Beech-Nut pleaded
guilty to 215 counts of violating federal food and drug charges and
agreed to pay a $2 million fine.
   In May Beech-Nut, a subsidiary of Nestle Inc. that is based in
Fort Washington, Pa., settled a class action suit that was filed in
federal court in Philadelphia in response to the New York City
indictment.
   In that case, Beech-Nut agreed to set up a $5 million cash fund
for consumers and to provide $2.5 million in Beech-Nut and
affiliated products to retailers.
   Also on the team prosecuting Hoyvald and Lavery were two
attorneys from the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Consumer
Litigation: John R. Fleder, director of that office and Kenneth L.
Jost, a trial attorney.

   President Reagan's fiscal 1989 budget cites
``few signs of serious damage'' to the economy from last year's
stock market plunge in outlining programs to reduce the budget
deficit to $129.5 billion, budget documents showed Wednesday.
   Reagan's spending outline _ to be formally submitted on Thursday
_ will propose record spending of $1.09 trillion in the fiscal year
that begins next Oct. 1, against $964.7 billion in receipts,
according to a portion of the document obtained by The Associated
Press.
   ``If the policies proposed in this budget are adhered to, the
deficit will decline steadily in future years,'' Reagan said in the
budget report to Congress.
   The spending proposal, likely to produce the least contentious
budget debate of the Reagan presidency because it adheres to a
budget pact struck last year with Congress, proposes a $20.7
billion reduction from last year's spending shortfall of $150.2
billion.
   The Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law calls for a budget deficit
of no more than $136 billion in fiscal 1989, which begins next Oct.
1.
   However, many private economists contend that the deficit will
be higher next year, even with the steps expected to be outlined in
the new budget _ including the smallest defense spending increase
ever sought by Reagan.
   The new budget report concedes that the new Reagan spending plan
``assumes a declining rate of inflation and falling interest
rates'' for both 1988 and 1989.
   The budget document calls last October's stock market collapse
``startling'' and cites ``many predictions that the economy would
soon suffer a downturn or even a return of the Great Depression.''
   ``Although it is too soon to determine what the final effects
will be, the initial fears now seem greatly exaggerated,'' the
budget report states.
   ``Despite the sharp reversal in stock prices, the economy has
shown few signs of serious damage,'' it adds.
   The new Reagan budget assumes that the economy will grow in 1988
by 2.4 percent and by 3.5 percent in 1989. However, the budget
report states that a percentage point lower growth _ even with no
change in other economic data _ could drive up the deficit by an
additional $6.3 billion in 1988 and $18 billion in 1989.
   Reagan's new budget document projects that the deficit in the
current fiscal year, fiscal 1988, will total $146.7 billion _ with
$1.055 trillion in spending and $909.2 billion in receipts.
   It projects that the deficit, after declining to $129.5 billion
in 1989, will ease to $104.2 billion in 1990, to $79.3 billion in
1991 and to $51.1 billion in 1992.
   The Reagan budget cited expected improvements in exports,
leading to ``a welcome resurgence of the nation's industrial
sector,'' as the main source of economic strength in the coming
years.
   The eighth, and for practical purposes, final Reagan budget
takes note of the fact that Reagan's initial budget plan, submitted
in 1981, ``was expected to achieve a balanced budget by 1985.''
   ``Instead, the budget has been in deficit. Reducing the deficit
is one of the nation's central economic policy concerns.''
   A key reason why the budget still isn't balanced, Reagan's new
budget report suggests, is the drain on the economy of the deep
1981-82 recession as well as the fact that Congress has ``been
unwilling to approve'' domestic spending cuts he proposed.
   Many of these proposed Reagan reductions were expected to be
included in the $1.1 trillion fiscal blueprint being unveiled
Thursday, including proposals for transferring government functions
including parks management and perhaps Amtrak railroad service to
private industry.
   But the plan also was being crafted to comply with the spending
agreement reached last fall in the budget ``summit'' between Reagan
and congressional leaders.
   Since the budget summit agreement spells out overall spending
and tax levels, including allocations for the military, domestic
programs and foreign aid, this year's battles were expected to
focus on the details rather than the thrust of the budget
priorities.
   The pact should help smooth the budget's path through Congress,
since the balance between domestic and military spending totals is
annually one of the most difficult.
   In addition, Democratic leaders have pledged to speed the
process and avoid packing all spending into a single, massive bill
as they did in a $600 billion measure last year.
   When Reagan pledged in his State of the Union address never
again to sign such legislation, ``he was preaching to a choir
already converted,'' House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.,
said this week.
   In addition to the requirements of the budget agreement, the
administration is proposing about $14 billion in sales of
government assets and ``privatization'' initiatives to drop the
deficit to $129.5 billion.
   The fiscal 1987 deficit was $150.4 billion, and red ink this
year is expected to drop to $146.7 billion, according to
administration estimates.
   The administration's estimates, which are more optimistic than
those of the Congressional Budget Office, would normally provoke
widespread charges of ``cooking the books'' for the
Democratic-controlled Congress. However, the revised Gramm-Rudman
law requires that administration estimates be used in determining
whether the budget meets its goals.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said Wednesday he was concerned about Congress using too
rosy a set of figures. But, he added, ``unduly pessimistic
assumptions could produce unnecessary battles over additional
spending cuts or tax increases that, in this election year, might
achieve nothing.''

Healthy</HEAD>

   A former Liggett & Myers president ignored
the issue of smoking and health until the 1964 Surgeon General's
report, and asserted that smoking posed no hazard because it never
harmed him, according to evidence released Wednesday.
   Milton E. Harrington said in testimony read for the jury that
company officials ``didn't even discuss a position about smoking
and health as far as the corporation was concerned.''
   Previous testimony in the trial, in which Liggett and two other
cigarette makers are being sued over a smoker's lung-cancer death,
revealed that Liggett had a 25-year research program, starting in
1954, to develop a less carcinogenic cigarette that was never
marketed.
   Harrington, under questioning by plaintiff's attorney Marc Z.
Edell, said the 1964 report ``was a concern to us as it was to
other people in the industry.''
   But Harrington said, ``I didn't think anything about smoking and
health other than smoking was not harmful to you in any way.''
   Edell asked the basis for that opinion, and Harrington replied:
``It didn't ever harm me.''
   Edell pressed him for the facts he considered, and Harrington
said it was ``just my belief.''
   Once the Surgeon General's report came out, Harrington said he
didn't look further into the validity of its findings because ``it
wouldn't do any good anyway.''
   He said he read it as executive vice president, shortly before
becoming president.
   Edell asked Harrington about the adequacy of federally mandated
warnings on cigarette packs required in 1966.
   ``We didn't care to warn the public about anything. We just had
to put that warning on. It wasn't because we liked to. It was just
something we had to do. We weren't interested in warning the public
about something,'' Harrington replied.
   Harrington, who has since died, was 76 when the testimony was
taken by attorneys for Antonio Cipollone, 64, of Lakehurst, N.J.,
who is suing Liggett Group Inc., Philip Morris Co. and Lorillard
Inc. for the death of his wife Rose. Liggett Group is the parent
company of Liggett & Myers.
   It was read in court Wednesday by Edell and an actor playing the
role of Harrington. The executive was a former semi-professional
baseball player who joined the company in 1934 and rose through the
ranks until becoming president and chief operating officer in 1964.
He retired in 1972.
   Responding to Harrington's statements, Liggett spokesman Alan
Hilburg said the witness was ``nearly 80 years old when he gave
that testimony.''
   ``It wasn't unusual for people's memories to fade over that
period of time,'' Hilburg said. He said he did not know when
Harrington died.
   Cipollone charges that the three tobacco companies, makers of
the brands Mrs. Cipollone smoked, neglected to do enough research
on cigarettes, didn't reveal adequately what they did find and
failed to put safer cigarettes on the market.
   One reason for not marketing the safer cigarette, Edell argues,
was because to do so would weaken the companies' defense against
lawsuits over their existing products.
   Referring to a 1968 memorandum from Liggett's researcher to
Harrington on a meeting of tobacco company scientific directors,
Edell asked what Harrington did with similar memos after reading
them.
   ``I read that and probably referred it to our legal
department,'' the former executive replied.
   ``Why?'' asked Edell.
   ``Because I thought they should know about it,'' Harrington
replied.
   ``Why?'' Edell pursued
   ``That was just our policy. They were the people that I was
holding responsible.''
   The purpose of the conference detailed in the memo was to
``discuss the scientific aspects of the problems facing the tobacco
industry with specific emphasis on tobacco and health,'' the
document said.

<HEAD>Allegis Says Court Grants Request For Stay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Allegis Corp. said Wednesday that a California
court has granted its request to order a halt to union plans to
block the company's restructuring.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers filed a lawsuit in January in California Superior Court,
contending that Allegis' plan to sell its non-airline subsidiaries
and distribute the proceeds to shareholders was illegal.
   The union contended that the restructuring would create a higher
debt load for Allegis' core business, Chicago-based United Airlines.
   In a statement Wednesday, Allegis said the California court held
that California was an inappropriate place to resolve the question
and ordered a stay of all proceedings.
   ``It was not the headquarters of the company or where any of the
transactions took place,'' said Nancy Hobor, a spokeswoman for
Allegis.
   The Allegis statement said the court's ruling does not prevent
the union from refiling the action ``in an appropriate forum.''
   Ms. Hobor said she did not know if the union has any such plans.
   The union's headquarters in Washington, D.C., was closed
Wednesday night, and a spokesman there could not be reached for
comment.
   The restructuring of Allegis, which involves the sale of its
Hertz rental car company and Westin and Hilton International hotel
subsidiaries, will push its debt-to-equity ratio from about 55
percent to 80 percent, company spokesman Matt Gonring said in
January.
   He said then that the restructuring would mean selling off
equity, but ``it's not that we're incurring new debt.''
   The company promised its 58 million shareholders it would give
them a $50 dividend to distribute proceeds from the sales or would
buy the equivalent amount of shareholders' stock, which would have
tax advantages.
   In January, Gonring said the lawsuit was filed in San Francisco
County because that is where the largest proportion of United's
21,000 employees in the machinists union are based.
