<HEAD>Gandhi Shuffles Cabinet; Inducts New Ministers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi inducted 13
people into his Council of Ministers on Sunday and reshuffled the
portfolios of existing ministers.
   The reshuffle is the 12th since Gandhi was sworn into office in
January 1985 and comes one week before Parliament's annual budget
session is due to start.
   Gandhi told reporters the council's expansion was meant to give
more representation to various regions of the country and social
groups.
   ``Since the last reshuffle, a lot of people had dropped out of
the Cabinet and this had upset the balance. In this reshuffle we
have tried to restore the balance,'' the United News of India news
agency quoted him as saying.
   However, no Cabinet minister was named to head the External
Affairs Ministry. Gandhi himself handles the portfolio, aided by a
junior minister.
   Gandhi denied that the changes were a prelude to early elections
to Parliament. ``A snap poll is definitely out,'' UNI quoted him as
saying.
   There are now 63 ministers in the council with 15 holding
Cabinet rank, excluding Gandhi.
   Three of the new ministers were inducted at Cabinet rank. These
include Bindeshwari Dubey and Motilal Vora, who resigned as chief
ministers of two Indian states Saturday.
   Dubey, who quit as chief minister of eastern Bihar state, was
named as Law and Justice Minister while Vora, who resigned from
central Madhya Pradesh state, was given the Health and Family
Welfare portfolio.
   The third, Dinesh Singh, re-entered the Cabinet after 15 years
as the Water Resources Minister.
   Cabinet Communications Minister Arjun Singh was named Madhya
Pradesh Chief Minister on Saturday. Gandhi dropped Agriculture
Minister G. S. Dhillon from the Cabinet Sunday and also relieved a
junior minister, Ram Dulari Sinha. Mrs. Sinha has been asked to
become governor of southern Kerala state, a largely ceremonial post.
   The other inductions included four junior ministers and six
deputy ministers.
   The other changes were mainly exchanges of portfolios between
existing Cabinet ministers and junior ministers.

   Arthur Mizener, who revived interest in F. Scott
Fitzgerald with the acclaimed first biography of the Jazz Age
novelist, died Thursday at age 80.
   ``The Far Side of Paradise,'' Mizener's best-selling biography
of Fitzgerald, was published in 1951 by Houghton Mifflin, a decade
after a heart attack ended Fitzgerald's downward spiraling career.
   Fitzgerald, now considered one of the great American novelists
of the 20th Century, wrote ``This Side of Paradise,'' ``The Great
Gatsby,'' ``Tender Is the Night'' and ``The Last Tycoon,'' as well
as numerous short stories.
   Mizener, who died in a Bristol, R.I., nursing home, taught
English at Cornell University from 1951 until his retirement in
1975. He wrote scores of essays and book reviews.
   He graduated from Princeton University in 1930, received his
master's degree from Harvard in 1932 and earned a doctorate from
Princeton in 1934.

   Virgil Hawkins, a black man who waged a
28-year battle to practice law in Florida and helped break the
color barrier at the University of Florida Law School, died
Thursday at age 81.
   In 1949, at age 41, he applied to the all-white law school in
Gainesville and was rejected. He challenged the segregated school
system and in 1956 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he should be
admitted.
   But the Florida Supreme Court invoked states' rights to deny him
admission and the state adopted rigid entrance requirements that
made it impossible for Hawkins to enroll.
   In 1976 the Florida Bar urged the state Supreme Court to allow
Hawkins to take the bar exam even though he had attended an
unaccredited law school in Massachusetts 20 years earlier. The bar
said he deserved special consideration because of ill treatment in
1949.
   The Florida Supreme Court waived a requirement that he take the
exam.
   Hawkins opened a practice in Leesburg, but in 1984 the Florida
Supreme Court censured Hawkins and placed him on probation for two
years for errors he made in his first cases. Hawkins, facing two
more complaints, resigned from the bar in 1985.

   Nora Astorga, Nicaragua's U.N. ambassador who
gained fame during the Sandinista revolution for luring a general

the Nicaraguan government. She was 39.
   In Managua in 1978, Ms. Astorga lured Gen. Reynaldo Perez Vega,
deputy commander of the National Guard, to her bedroom, where
guerrillas cut his throat.
   Perez Vega had held the post in the regime of President
Anastasio Somoza, who was ousted by the leftist Sandinistas in 1979.
   In 1984, the United States rejected her as the proposed
ambassador to the United States. She held the rank of deputy
foreign minister at the time.
   She was appointed U.N. ambassador in 1986. Before the
revolution, she earned a law degree at Catholic University in
Managua and worked for an engineering firm there.

   In his youth, the Liverpool Orchestra, paid him 22 cents a night
plus 9 cents for tackling the cor anglais solo in Rossini's
``William Tell Overture.''
   Edward Elgar's 1934 Soliloquy for Oboe and Strings, one of his

   Frederick Loewe, who created the
unforgettable tunes for Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics in such Broadway
hits as ``Camelot,'' ``My Fair Lady,'' ``Brigadoon'' and ``Gigi,''
died Sunday at age 86.
   ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' ``On the Street Where You
Live,'' ``I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face'' and ``If Ever I
Should Leave You'' were among the classic songs produced by the
18-year partnership.
   Lerner and Loewe's collaboration began with a one-night flop in
Detroit in 1942. They parted bitterly after ``Camelot,'' their last
Broadway hit, in 1960.
   In between came ``Brigadoon'' in 1947 and ``My Fair Lady'' in
1956.
   Lerner and Loewe reunited in 1973 for the Broadway production of
``Gigi,'' and remained friends.
   Loewe retired in 1974. Lerner died in 1986.

   A cruise ship passenger fell overboard
and drowned as the ship steamed toward Long Beach Harbor, the Coast
Guard reported Saturday. Foul play was not suspected, authorities
said.
   The identity of the 27-year-old woman, whose body was recovered
by a Coast Guard cutter, was withheld until relatives could be
contacted, Petty Officer Don Roberts said.
   The woman fell overboard about 3 a.m. when the ship was 30 miles
southwest of San Diego, Roberts said. The Long Beach-based cutter
Point Stuart, along with a Coast Guard helicopter and jet,
immediately began a search.
   After four searches, the Point Stuart recovered the woman's body
at 12:30 p.m., Roberts said.
   The body was taken to San Diego for autopsy. There was no
evidence of foul play, Roberts said. He had no further details.
   The Star Dancer, which docked in Long Beach Saturday, was
carrying about 900 passengers and was completing a cruise along the
Mexican coast, Roberts said.
   He added it wasn't immediately known which port the ship had
sailed from or how long it had been at sea. The Star Dancer
regularly makes cruise runs between Long Beach and Mexico.
   The Star Dancer is owned by Admiral Cruises of Miami, Roberts
said. Officials for Admiral Cruises were unavailable Saturday night.

   A former Methodist minister accused in a civil
suit of trying to choke his wife to death says he is innocent and
has avoided his California apartment to dodge reporters, not court
officials.
   ``My response to the allegations in the suit are the same they
have been all along: I'm not guilty of anything and don't have
anything to fear on that point,'' Walker Railey said in an
interview in the Dallas Morning News.
   ``I regret the lawsuit because it puts all the family _ the
Nicolai family and me _ under an even added amount of pressure,''
Railey said in his first interview since he moved to San Francisco
in November. Stories based on the interview were published in the
newpaper's Saturday and Sunday editions.
   After Billie Joe Nicolai, Railey's mother-in-law, filed the
lawsuit Feb. 2, Railey began living in hotels and with friends
instead of in his apartment.
   Railey, former senior minister of the First United Methodist
Church in downtown Dallas, said he has stayed away from the
apartment because news reporters and photographers have staked it
out.
   ``I'm keeping a low profile because people are sitting out in
front of my flat and I resent that,'' Railey said. ``I know the
press is doing its job and I'm just trying to live my life. At this
point, there seems to be difficulty in making both of those things
work.''
   The constant attention and news reports have made him weary and
resentful, he said.
   ``I'm in a situation where my silence makes people wonder and,
when I talk, the way it's used (in the media) also makes people
wonder,'' Railey said, describing his position as being ``between
the devil and the deep blue sea.''
   Railey has said he found his wife, Margaret ``Peggy'' Railey,
near death the night of April 21 in their garage. Mrs. Railey has
been comatose since the attack and is in a Tyler nursing home.
   The lawsuit by Mrs. Nicolai, Peggy Railey's mother, seeks
unspecified damages.
   Court officers have been unable to locate Railey to serve him
formal notification of the civil suit, but Railey denied ``trying
to dodge the papers.''
   He declined to review a copy of the lawsuit offered by the
Morning News and said he wanted to first discuss it with his Dallas
attorney, Doug Mulder.
   Railey declined to give an account of the night his wife was
attacked, and he also declined to talk about his relationship with
psychologist Lucy Papillon, who told a grand jury in July that she
had been having an affair with Railey. Late last year and Railey
signed a one-year lease on a San Francisco flat.
   Before his wife was attacked last April, the prominent minister
reported to police that he was receiving death threats that he
blamed on his strong pro-civil-rights stance. Police later
concluded that the threatening notes were typed on a church
typewriter. The morning that police were planning to question
Railey about the attack on his wife, he took an overdose of
sleeping pills but later recovered.
   Railey has since resigned his church position.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has a solid
lead in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, while Vice President
George Bush and Sen. Bob Dole are locked in a tie on the Republican
side, according to two polls released Saturday.
   The latest ABC News-Washington Post poll, completed Friday
night, put Dukakis at 40 percent with Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois each with 16 percent.
   The poll was based on interviews with 375 likely Democratic
primary voters and 373 likely Republican primary voters over the
three days ending Friday. The survey of Republicans found that Bush
and Dole were tied for the lead in the Republican race at 29
percent. New York Rep. Jack Kemp, Pat Robertson and former Delaware
Gov. Pete du Pont were tied for third with 12 percent.
   The remaining candidates in the race had single-digit support in
the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus five
percentage points for the Democrats and six percentage points for
the Republican sample.
   Meanwhile, the Sunday Boston Globe said its poll of 789 New
Hampshire voters also showed Dukakis with a comfortable lead and
Bush and Dole with almost even support.
   The random telephone survey was conducted Thursday, Friday and
Saturday before the Democratic debate at St. Anselm College. A
significant number of voters said they were still undecided and
nearly a third of those in each party said they might change their
mind.
   Thirty-nine percent of the 387 Democratic voters favored
Dukakis; Gephardt had 14 percent and Simon 13 percent.
   Dole was favored by 32 percent of the 402 likely Republican
voters, and Bush had 28 percent. Ten percent of the voters were
undecided. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.

   Presidential candidates plunged Saturday
into the final weekend of campaigning before New Hampshire's
do-or-die primary, with Democrats staging a spirited debate and
Republican Sen. Bob Dole encountering hecklers from opposition
camps.
   Dole, locked in a tight race in New Hampshire with Vice
President Geroge Bush, was campaigning at a shopping mall in
Bedford when he found himself surrounded by chanting supporters of
Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp.
   The scene quickly became a shouting contest with sign-waving
supporters from the three campaigns vying for attention. The
shouting cointinued in the parking lot after Dole's motorcade
departed.
   The Democratic debaters engaged in a little shouting of their
own, with Jesse Jackson acting as peacemaker and urging his rivals
to stick to the issues and stop playing ``how bruised I am.''
   The debate heated up quickly with Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen.
Paul Simon continuing their running dispute over Simon commercials
that attack Gephardt. Then Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Gephardt had a
run-in over remarks Gephardt's campaign manager made about Gore.
   New Hampshire Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis attacked
Gephardt for accepting money from political action committees and
also for supporting an oil import fee.
   At times it was hard to distinguished who was shouting at whom.
   ``What's your energy policy,'' former front-runner Gary Hart
asked the Massachusetts governor.
   ``This is a budget issue,'' chimed in former Gov. Bruce Babbitt
of Arizona.
   ``Can I finish my answer?'' asked Dukakis.
   The nationally televised one-hour debate, sponsored by the
League of Women Voters, took place at St. Anselm College in
Goffstown.
   The League was sponsoring a Republican debate at the college on
Sunday.
   Meanwhile, two polls showed Bush and Dole locked in a tie for
the lead in New Hampshire's Republican primary, with Dukakis
enjoying a solid advantage among Democrats.
   An ABC-Washington Post poll gave Bush and Dole each 29 percent.
Kemp, Pat Robertson and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont were tied
for third with 12 percent. Dukakis had 40 percent with Gephardt and
Simon each at 16 percent.
   The poll was based on interviews with 375 likely Democratic
primary voters and 373 likely Republican primary voters over three
days ending Friday. It had a margin of error of plus or minus five
percentage points for the Democrats and six percentage points for
the Republican sample.
   The Sunday Boston Globe said its poll of 789 New Hampshire
voters surveyed Thursday, Friday and Saturday showed 39 percent of
the Democrats for Dukakis, with 14 percent for Gephardt and 13
percent for Simon.
   Dole was favored by 32 percent of the likely Republican voters,
and Bush had 28 percent. Ten percent were undecided. The poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   At his first campaign stop of the day, Gephardt, the winner in
Iowa last Monday, warned his rivals _ particularly Simon _ that
negative campaigning now could hurt the party's chance to win the
presidency.
   ``We're not going to win this if we're brawling in the mud,''
said Gephardt, who has been the target of Simon commercials
focusing on the Missouri congressman's votes in favor of the B-1
bomber and nuclear power.
   Kemp of New York, whose candidacy hinges on the support of New
Hampshire Republican voters on Tuesday, unveiled a new television
commercial attacking Dole for not being effective enough in the
fight to get congressional approval of aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras.
   Kemp spokesman John Buckley described Dole as ``relatively
passive on the issue'' of Contra aid.
   When the congressman was asked if his candidacy could survive a
finish behind Robertson on Tuesday, he replied: ``He's not going to
beat me in New Hampshire.''
   Dog sled races in Laconia drew Kemp, Bush and Dukakis, while du
Pont went rummaging for votes at the Bedford town dump.
   Noticing campaign workers for Dole and Bush passing out
literature at the dump, which attracts 400 to 500 people on a
Saturday, du Pont said, ``Here's a real candidate.''
   Dukakis, at an appearance in Dover, shrugged off criticism in a
Gephardt television commercial that called him ``one of the biggest
tax raisers in Massachusetts history.''
   ``I've cut taxes five times in the last four years,'' Dukakis
said, adding that he did not want to see the Democrats letting
themselves ``disintegrate into the kind of backyard squabbling that
Bush and Dole have been involved in.''
   Robertson toured shopping malls on the seacoast, shaking hands
and telling people, ``I need some help on Tuesday.''
   The former evangelist told reporters, ``It's a horserace all the
way, and I think we might see some surprises come Tuesday night.
But the momentum is on my side right now and that's the good way to
be at this stage.''
   Bush appeared at a high school in Wolfeboro with Gov. John H.
Sununu and Hall of Fame baseball player Ted Williams and was on the
offensive against Dole.
   ``I think Bob is making some statements that are pretty
extravagant,'' said the vice president. ``Bob Dole says when Ronald
Reagan wants something done he calls Bob Dole. But when he wanted
somebody to be the vice presidnt of the United States, he called
me.''
   In addition to his campaigning, Robertson was the candidate
featured this weekend in the televised interviews by David Frost,
part of the series called, ``The Next President.''
   Asked about Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, the former television
evangelist said, ``I wouldn't have hesitated to kill him. He's a
madman and he was a terrorist.''
   Dole picked up the endorsement of former defense secretary
Donald Rumsfeld who dreamed of being one of the GOP candidates but
eventually decided against entering the race.
   Also appearing with Dole at Jaffrey was former Secretary of
State Alexander M. Haig Jr., who dropped out of the race on Friday
and endorsed the Kansan.
   Addressing a rally at Conant High School, Dole said, ``Some
people say Bob Dole is pretty tough. You better hope I'm tough.
We're talking about our future. We're talking about our children's
future. We're talking about our grandchildren.''
   It was clear that Dole's victory in Iowa coupled with Bush's
embarrassing third-place finish had blown away the big edge the
vice president once held in New Hampshire surveys.
   New Hampshire could be a last stand for Kemp and du Pont, as
well as for two Democrats, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and
former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado.
   Kemp said he was confident he'd finish ahead of Robertson in the
primary. Asked if he also had to beat Bush or Dole, he replied,
``No, I've got to be competitive. I've got to be up in the pack
among the leaders. And that's what our goal is.''
   ``You have to do well, you have to start beating somebody,''
conceded du Pont, who finished fifth in Iowa and is running the
same in New Hampshire surveys.
   The new Kemp ad took swipes at both Dole and Bush on the Contra
aid issue.
   The commercial said that in the recent House vote that rejected
President Reagan's request for more money for the Contras, eight
Bush supporters were among those who voted against the money. The
ad also quoted Dole as telling the Boston Globe ``he wasn't
concerned about (Nicaraguan president Daniel) Ortega or his army.
Is that leadership?''
   When reporters asked how Kemp could attack Dole, when the
senator had voted for Contra aid, Buckley said, ``Sure he's voted
in the right place. But this guy has run for the last year on
leadership. ... Bob Dole has been relatively passive on this
issue.''

<HEAD>Dole Campaign Continues Business With Owen's Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential contender Sen.
Bob Dole has continued to spend thousands of dollars with a travel
agency owned by the daughter and son-in-law of a former Dole
political aide, a newspaper report said Sunday.
   Dole cut political ties with Dave Owen, his former chief
fund-raiser and a former Kansas lieutenant governor, after
questions were raised last month about Owen's business dealings.
   But according to Federal Election Commission records, the
campaign of Dole, R-Kan., paid more than $80,000 in the last
quarter of 1987 to International Tours of Alexandria, Va., the
Kansas City Star reported.
   A Dole spokesman said the campaign decided it would be unfair to
stop buying travel services from International Tours, which is
owned by Owen's daughter, Deborah, and his son-in-law, Kent Wells.
   ``It seemed remarkably unfair to make Debbie suffer more than
she already has on a personal level,'' said Scott Morgan, the
campaign's chief counsel.
   ``The agency has been providing services from the start,''
Morgan said. He said Campaign America, Dole's political action
committee, had used International Tours and it ``seemed a natural
continuation'' to use the travel agency in Dole's presidential bid.
   Morgan said the campaign gets no price breaks on travel
services, and said nothing was wrong with the relationship. A
Federal Election Commission spokesman generally agreed.
   ``As long as they're paying the going rate, there's no
problem,'' said Fred Eiland, the Federal Election Commission's
chief spokesman. Eiland said such special treatment by a company
could violate campaign finance laws against corporate contributions
or individual contributions exceeding $1,000.

   Protesters fought police and detonated
homemade bombs Saturday as opposition parties renewed their drive
to oust President Hussain Muhammad Ershad. One person was killed
and at least 34 injured.
   A general strike that continued Sunday shut down most shops and
businesses in Dhaka and other major cities.
   Since the major opposition parties launched their anti-Ershad
campaign last Nov. 10, there have been 24 days of general strikes.
   There were no reports of violence Sunday morning.
   Saturday's violence, in which nine people were arrested, comes
on the heels of bloody street battles during local elections last
Wednesday.
   The government on Saturday raised its official death toll from
the election-day melees to 101. Most of the deaths occurred in
clashes among supporters of rival opponents for seats on more than
4,370 village councils.
   Unofficial death counts in Bangladesh newspapers put the figure
at 135. Hundreds were injured.
   Sheik Hasina, leader of the opposition Awami League, said
Saturday she had reports of more than 350 deaths in the Wednesday
rampages.
   In addition, confrontations between protesters throwing bricks
and bombs and police firing rifles and tear gas have killed 25
people by the government's count, 100 by Hasina's count, since Nov.
10.
   On Saturday, like last Wednesday, much of the damage was done by
homemade bombs, which are being used increasingly by political
protesters here.
   One person was killed and at least 14 injured by a bomb thrown
at a state-run bus in Mirpur, a northern suburb of Dhaka, witnesses
and hospital officials said.
   Rahul Amina, a student who accompanied one of the bus victims to
a hospital, said some injured passengers fled the scene for fear of
being asked by police to be witnesses.
   Another bomb injured 10 people in central Dhaka.
   Ten other injuries were reported after police wielding batons
clashed with about 100 slogan-shouting demonstrators near the
capital's central office, witnesses reported.
   Police posted outside Dhaka University accused students of
hurling homemade bombs toward shuttered shopping centers nearby. No
casualties were reported.
   Twenty-one of the country's major opposition parties began their
campaign more than three months ago to force Ershad to resign.
   Ershad, 58, a former army general, took power in Bangladesh in a
bloodless coup in 1982. He was elected to the presidency in 1986 in
an election the opposition contends was rigged.
   In an effort to appease his political opponents, Ershad
dissolved Parliament and called for fresh elections March 3. The
main opposition leaders say they will boycott the vote.

<HEAD>Health Cult Linked To Knox County Mummy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family that secretly kept a mummified body in
their home for more than eight years has been linked to a cult that
preaches use of nutrients and exorcism in place of traditional
medicine, investigators said.
   ``I think we are touching on something, a group that hasn't been
known before _ a group that is almost a secret society,'' Knox
County Sheriff Mark Shearer said in a story published in Sunday's
Chicago Tribune.
   Shearer said those involved in the cult, known as the ``Holistic
Society,'' included several suburban Chicago dentists, but he would
not identify them because of pending investigations.
   Carl Stevens, the man whose withered corpse was found in bed
last month in his rural Knoxville home, was a diabetic who was
persuaded to rely on vitamins and powdered mixes in place of his
daily insulin injections, according to investigators and family
members.
   His body was found more than eight years after he died May 12,
1979, at age 40. His brother also died at a relatively young age,
and investigators were told that his death may also be related to
unorthodox health practices.
   The Holistic Society disdains traditional health methods and
relies instead on an extreme form of ``holistic health care,'' in
which the mind and body are treated with only natural vitamins,
herbs and nutrients, Shearer said.
   Treatments are administered in a quasi-religious fashion that
involve the use of healing crystals, the exorcism of ``black souls
or Satan,'' and ``channeling'' to communicate with spirits, Shearer
said.
   There is no evidence that the health cult is violent or guilty
of anything other than encouraging bizarre health practices for the
unwary, Shearer said.
   In the weeks before his death, Stevens had cut his daily insulin
intake in half and was taking up to 20 vitamin pills a day,
according to an aunt, Frances Kennelly of Lambe, Mo.
   Stevens, who had been a member of the Knoxville High School
Board of Education, died after vomiting a ``black substance,'' his
42-year-old wife, Carole, told investigators.
   The only criminal charges in the case were lodged against Mrs.
Stevens, a former nurse, and former Aurora dentist Richard G.
Kunce, 56. Both are charged with forging the dead man's name on
legal and bank documents and with cruelty to children. The
Stevenses' teen-age son and daughter lived in the house with the
mummified corpse.
   Kunce, who is in custody, and Mrs. Stevens, who is out on bond,
have already pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to
report Stevens' death.
   In another twist to the case, investigators say they found a
``travel permit'' from the right-wing Posse Comitatus anti-tax
group in the wallet of Kunce, who moved in with the Stevens family
18 months ago as their ``spiritual leader.''
   Kunce was introduced to the Stevens family by Carl Stevens'
brother, Roger, a St. Charles lawyer who was apparently the first
family member to become involved in the health cult, Shearer said.
   Investigators and family members said Roger persuaded his
brother to use the vitamins and powdered mixes in place of his
daily insulin injections, and said Carl even began selling the
substances from his office.
   Roger Stevens died at age 43 in 1985 at a Chicago hospital. His
death was attributed to gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hepatic
cirrhosis. But a nurse who cared for him told investigators, ``I
think it was his diet that killed him,'' according to the Tribune.

   A man who threatened to blow himself up
in a bar with dynamite he'd strapped to his body was taken into
custody by police early Sunday after four hours of negotiations.
Authorities later found no explosives.
   John James Allgood, 33, of Arlington walked out of the Plaza
Lounge shirtless, following police instructions, and surrendered to
authorities at about 12:10 a.m., said Arlington police spokesman
Dee Anderson.
   ``The officers did not find any explosives. They did find a hoax
device. People in the bar had seen something so we knew Allgood had
something,'' Anderson said.
   Bartender Ina Silloway said the man came into the bar shortly
after 8 p.m. and walked around for a few minutes before ordering a
12-pack of beer to go. When she returned with the beer, she said,
he handed her a Valentine's greeting card.
   ``It said something to the effect of, `This is no joke. I have
six sticks of dynamite strapped to me. If you look at me, I will
show you,'' Ms. Silloway said.
   ``At that point I looked up and he showed me,'' she said, adding
that the man told her he planned to ``commit police suicide.''
   Police say Allgood, who was alone inside the bar, threatened to
harm no one but himself.
   Police cordoned off the area, but because other nearby
businesses were closed Saturday night there was no need for any
evacuation, said officer Ken Burton.
   Charges were pending against Allgood, Anderson said, but he
would not specify what they involve.

<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon said in the Sunday
Times that Sen. Edward Kennedy should run for president this year
and his character would be his greatest asset.
   In the first of a series of articles on the elections, Nixon
predicted if there is an economic recession this year, ``any one of
the Democrats will win. If there is not a recession, the Democrats
cannot win without a charismatic candidate such as Kennedy or (New
York Gov. Mario) Cuomo.''
   Drafting Kennedy ``would bring the still potent magic of the
Kennedy name to a party that had been demoralized by six months of
fruitless campaigning,'' Nixon wrote. ``Kennedy's eloquence could
bring the party together.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat ``will turn 57 in eight days,'' Nixon
wrote. ``If he is ever going to run for President, a 1988 draft
would be his best shot.''
   Kennedy, who was born Feb. 22, 1932, is ``the least discussed
but most logical candidate for a draft. ... His greatest strength
would be the character issue, both its negative side and especially
its positive side,'' the Republican former president wrote.
   ``No one will ever forget Chappaquiddick,'' he wrote, referring
to a July 1969 auto accident in which he was the driver and a woman
passenger was killed. ``The question is whether people have
forgiven him for it,'' he wrote. ``If the media hound Kennedy over
that tragic accident 19 years agothey might well help him rather
than hurt him _ and also land themselves in the political
doghouse.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities Saturday expelled to
Sweden two Estonian activists who were trying to organize an
independant Estonian party, a human rights group and the Swedish
national news agency TT reported.
   The two men, Buddhists with shaven heads, arrived on an Soviet
Aeroflot flight and were greeted by a crowd of about 15 Estonian
exiles.
   The Stockholm-based Baltic Helsinki Group quoted Eke-Part Nomm
as saying he and Vello Vaartnou had been told by the Soviet
authorities to leave the country or face imprisonment.
   Mr. Nomm, 22, said they were pressured into leaving probably
because he had read an appeal to form an Estonian Independence
Party at a meeting in Tartu Feb. 2, the human rights group reported.
   Numm and Vaartnou, 36, belong to a group of 16 Estonians who
work for the formation of a National Independence Party, TT
reported.
   The expulsions came shortly before the 70th anniversary of
Estonia's pre-Soviet independence day on Feb. 24, which is expected
to lead to celebrations and demonstrations. Similar activities are
planned in Lithuania, whose independence day falls on Feb. 16.
   The Soviet Union annexed the three independent Baltic states
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940 in a secret pact with Nazi
Germany.

   Arthur Mizener, author of the acclaimed first
biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald, has died at the age of 80.
   Mizener died of congestive heart failure Thursday at the
Bristol, R.I., nursing home where he had lived.
   ``The Far Side of Paradise,'' Mizener's best-selling biography
of Fitzgerald, was published in 1951 by Houghton Mifflin, a decade
after a heart attack ended the downward spiraling career of the
chronicler of the Jazz Age of the 1920s.
   The biography was credited with reviving interest in Fitzgerald,
now considered one of the great American novelists of the 20th
Century.
   Fitzgerald wrote ``This Side of Paradise,'' ``The Great
Gatsby,'' ``Tender Is the Night'' and ``The Last Tycoon,'' as well
as numerous short stories.
   Mizener taught English at Cornell University from 1951 until his
retirement in 1975. He wrote scores of essays and book reviews for
many publications.
   Born in Erie, Pa., he graduated from Princeton University in
1930, received his master's degree from Harvard University in 1932
and returned to Princeton, where he received his doctorate in 1934.
   A memorial service is to be held at noon on Feb. 27 at the
United Congregational Church in Little Compton.
   He is survived by a daughter, Rosemary Colt of Little Compton,
R.I.; a sister, Virginia Jarecki of Erie and three grandchildren.

   Three men were killed Sunday when a bomb
exploded in their car in the southern port city of Limassol, police
said.
   A Palestine Liberation Organization official in Nicosia said the
victims were members of Yasser Arafat's Fatah group, the main PLO
guerrilla faction.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the
victims as Mohammed Sultan; Mohammed Buheis, also known as Abu
Hassan Kassem; and Marwan Kayyali.
   He said Kayyali was a member of the PLO's military council.
   Police, however, identified one of the victims as an Arab named
Ghazi Ali Hazem and said the other two victims' bodies were burned
beyond recognition. They said they believed the other victims also
were Arabs.
   There was no explanation for the discrepency in identifications.
   The police said they did not believe the blast was related to
the Cyprus presidential elections Sunday, and they said it didn't
disrupt voting.
   A sizeable number of Arabs, mainly Lebanese and Palestinians,
live in Limassol, which has a population of 121,000.
   Police said the bomb went off shortly before noon as the driver
tried to start the car, which was outside an apartment building.
   In Athens, PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif accused Israel of
being behind the slayings.
   ``Israel started this open war after losing the secret war
concerning the ship,'' he said, referring to PLO plans to sail a
group of Palestinian deportees back to Israel from Greece.
   The trip has been delayed several times, and the PLO has accused
Israel of waging a ``secret war'' against the PLO to prevent the
ship's sailing.

   Four men tried to hijack a
Tanzania Airways jet to London but were overpowered Sunday after
the pilot duped them into thinking he had flown them out of the
country, sources said.
   Capt. Dominic Ngandile was stabbed in the neck and hand and his
co-pilot, Christopher Mnika, suffered cuts on his hands when the
hijackers slashed at them after realizing they had been tricked,
said airline and security sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity. They said the injuries were not serious.
   None of the passengers on board the Boeing 737 was injured.
   Officials said there were 70 passengers, including the
hijackers, and a crew of six.
   The sources said the hijacking occurred Saturday night aboard a
Tanzania Airways' flight between Dar es Salaam, the capital, and
Kilimanjaro, the northern town near the Kenya border.
   Passengers said at 9:17 p.m., about midway through the 50-minute
flight, four men forced their way into the cockpit and threatened
the captain and co-pilot with knives.
   Airline sources said the men demanded to be flown to London,
with a stop in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, so the plane
could be refueled.
   Ngandile told the hijackers that the plane did not have enough
fuel to reach Addis Ababa and suggested he refuel instead at a
small airport at Ludwar, Kenya, the sources said.
   The hijackers agreed.
   Instead of heading for Kenya, Ngandile flew the plane in a wide
arc and headed back to Dar es Salaam airport. He also managed to
send a secret distress signal to the control tower at Dar es Salaam.
   Airport officials turned off the terminal lights and some of the
runway lights to give the appearance that the plane was landing at
a small airport.
   The jet landed at about 10:30 p.m. Security forces called to the
airport stormed the plane and took the men into custody.
   The four hijackers were described as residents of the
semi-autonomous island of Zanzibar. They were believed to be
between the ages of 16 and 20.

   Opportunity came knocking for undercover
police officers who raided a house looking for drug dealers and
ended up arresting their customers as they came to the door.
   The police street-crime unit had arrested four suspected drug
dealers Friday and were searching their house when the first
customer knocked on the door, said Lt. Rafael Garcia.
   Over the next few hours, the impromptu sting operation resulted
in 18 unexpected drug arrests, police said.
   Garcia said the undercover cops intended only to arrest the
dealers, but when the first would-be buyers knocked ``we decided to
do a reverse sting operation.''
   Seized from the house were about 80 bags of heroin, an
unspecified amount of cocaine, $2,900 in cash, a loaded .38-caliber
revolver and assorted drug paraphernalia, police said.

<HEAD>Judge Says Building Owners Have Right To Name Of Legendary Saloon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of the building that housed
Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, a legendary honky-tonk frequented in its
heyday by country music celebrities, also own the right to the
tavern's name, a judge has ruled.
   Chancellor Robert S. Brandt ruled Friday that Howard Dodson, son
of the late club owner Hattie L. ``Tootsie'' Bess, lost his right
to use the name when he closed the tavern in 1985 and did not renew
the trade name registration his mother had filed 10 years earlier.
   Dodson had filed suit in 1986 charging that the building's
owners, Mollye Ashe and her brother, Abe Stein, were illegally
using the name of the tavern which his mother had operated there
for 25 years.
   ``What I want is my mother's name back,'' Dodson said when he
filed the suit in Chancery Court.
   But Brandt said Ms. Ashe and her brother did not invade Dodson's
rights by registering the name ``World Famous Tootsie's Orchid
Lounge'' with the secretary of state's office in July 1985, four
months after Dodson closed the club.
   Ms. Ashe and Stein have leased the building to others, who have
continued to operate the tavern since August 1985.
   Tootsie's was located across the alley from the backstage door
of the Ryman Auditorium where the Grand Ole Opry was performed from
1943 to 1974. Parts of the movie ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' were
filmed there, depicting the life of country music star Loretta Lynn.
   ``Mrs. Bess was famous for her hospitality and generosity, and
her tavern became a well-known refuge for aspiring entertainers,
musicians and songwriters, many of whom went on to achieve fame and
fortune,'' Brandt wrote.
   But when the Opry moved to the Opryland theme park complex in
the suburbs, country stars dropped in less often and business in
general dropped off.
   Mrs. Bess died in 1978.
   Her son's decision to close the bar ``received considerable
coverage in both the local and national news media. From all
indications, Tootsie's was closed for good,'' Brandt wrote.

<HEAD>Jewelry from Radium Dials Hot Item, Dangerous for Wearers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fad for jewelry made from the dials of old
watches may pose a danger to unsuspecting wearers: Many of the old
watches used radium to make them glow in the dark, and the
radioactivity can cause cancer, health officials say.
   ``We're finding more and more of this stuff,'' said Dr. Jose
Lopez, supervisor at the Arlington regional office of the Texas
Bureau of Radiation Control. ``People suddenly think it's cool to
have necklaces, earrings, bola tie clasps and other things made
with old watches.''
   But the radium on some old watch dials can cause cancer, either
on the skin or internally if the substance is inadvertently inhaled
or swallowed.
   ``Like calcium, radium powder seeks the bone,'' he said.
   ``Radium jewelry definitely poses an increased risk of cancer,''
Lopez said.
   Radium was used in watches to make the hands and numbers glow,
he said. Watch makers have since developed other ways to cause
fluorescence.
   When the watches were intact, with glass covering the dial, they
were relatively harmless because the glass acted as a shield.
   But the risk has increased since the watches have been
dismantled to make jewelry, and the risk is even greater to
jewelers and other people who work with the timepieces than it is
to buyers, he said.
   Three workshops in the Dallas area that were found to be
handling the watches all registered some radioactive contamination,
he said.
   Workers were getting the radium on their fingers and clothes,
Lopez said.
   ``We found several places in the work areas that were hot'' with
contamination, he said.
   ``We're sure there are other places out there,'' he said.
   The work is illegal as well as hazardous, Lopez said. People who
handle radioactive materials must have a state license and to get
one, an applicant must take stringent precautions against
contamination.
   The radiation control bureau did not issue citations but told
companies to remedy the contamination, Lopez said.
   Officials at the Texas Department of Health regional office in
Arlington offered free testing of jewelry for radiation and free
disposal of contaminated pieces, Lopez said.

<HEAD>Report: Nuclear Submarine Was Close To Disaster</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nuclear accident was averted with minutes to
spare aboard a British submarine in Scotland last month, the
Observer newspaper reported Sunday. The Ministry of Defense denied
there had been a crisis.
   No public announcement had been made earlier about the incident.
   On Sunday, a ministry spokesman who wouldn't be identified said:
``There was no emergency. There was no possibility of anybody, crew
or general public, being subjected to any radiation problems. There
was a minor electrical malfunction but no radioactive material was
released.''
   The spokesman said the weekly was incorrect in claiming a
nuclear accident was averted by minutes.
   The Observer said that, on Jan. 26, at the nuclear submarine
base at Faslane near Glasgow, a fault developed in the primary
cooling system of the nuclear reactor power plant on HMS
Resolution, the oldest of Britain's four operational nuclear
submarines, commissioned in 1967.
   The fault led to heat building up in the reactor's core,
threatening a meltdown, and potential disaster was only averted
when two of the crew ran to start up a diesel generator to provide
alternative power for the cooler, the report said.
   It said there was only between 1{ and 7 minutes for the crew to
take action and one of the two crewmen had to be scrubbed down for
24 hours afterward because he was exposed to radiation.
   A meltdown could have released radioactivity contaminating 2,000
square miles with ``devastating consequences'' for the 13,000
people living within a five-mile radius of the base, the report
said.

   There are a few electric saws and automated lathes and sanders
at the wooden handle mill to hint that the Industrial Revolution
once visited. And a home computer used in the office is proof the
Computer Age stopped by.
   Of course, making wooden handles for tools and farm implements
is a business that hasn't changed much since Ed Willhite started
the company in 1934. The only difference now is how fast a handle
can be made with the help of machines, he said.
   Willhite made some of the electric equipment used in the mill
and other machinery was bought through the years as the company
expanded.
   ``This is just a baby company compared to some of the others,''
Willhite said.
   But co-owner Bob Bradley, who bought the company from the
Willhite's in 1981, is proud of this mill, the only company of its
kind in Oklahoma.
   ``We don't try to compete with the others. We just make our
product and do what we can,'' Bradley said.
   The 90-year-old Willhite has been retired since 1961. He turned
the business over to his two oldest sons, who ran it for more than
20 years before selling it to Bradley and Joe Myers. The two had 20
years with the company between them when they took it over.
   Bradley said business is fair at the mill, with 15 employees
working on the three-acre operation producing an average of 5,000
handles a day that range from a 10-inch machinist handle to a
60-inch pitch fork handle.
   But business isn't as good as it was in 1975 when Bradley joined
a 35-man crew that produced as much as 10,000 handles a day. He
blames that on a depressed state economy that has forced most
businesses to cut back.
   The mill now operates on a temporary three-day work week in the
slow winter season, but it won't be long before business picks back
up and the company is flooded with orders, Bradley said.
   ``Right now we're trying to stockpile our supply so we can meet
the demand in the spring when it comes,'' he said.
   Bradley said the company sells to lumber yards, hardware stores
and other handle companies. State prisons also buy from the mill
for their farming projects.
   Willhite said he thinks the mill has manufactured and sold
enough handles over the years to ``make a rick 8-foot high from
here to Tulsa,'' a stretch of some 60 miles.
   Willhite started the company in 1934 ``with a shave horse and a
knife,'' making about a dozen handles a day. In 1942, they moved
west to the remote wooded area it's nestled in now.
   ``We couldn't get any good white hickory out of Arkansas,'' he
said.
   These days, the Western Handle Co. gets an ample supply of
hickory, ash, and red and white oak from Tennessee, and some from
Ohio, Willhite said.
   Myers said the Western Handle Co. really still is in the
Willhite family because he's married to Willhite's granddaughter
and calls him grandpa. And many of the employees are related or
have the Willhite name, he said.
   ``You're the one who started this thing,'' Myers told Willhite.
``Sometimes we've got to get him in here to straighten things out.''
   ``I may have started it, but I can't take all the credit,''
Willhite said. ``I'm not the one who finished it.''

<HEAD>Authorities Observe 20th Anniversary of Tet Offensive</HEAD>

   Vietnam's communist leaders observed a
minute of silence at a ceremony in the former South Vietnam capital
of Saigon to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tet Offensive, a
report seen Sunday said.
   Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh and Prime Minister Pham
Hung attended the ceremony Friday in Ho Chi Minh City, which Saigon
was renamed after the 1975 communist victory, the official Vietnam
News Agency said.
   It said Vo Tran Chi, the secretary of the city's party
committee, told participants that the 1968 offensive against U.S.
and South Vietnamese forces ``had created the necessary
prerequisites for the entire party, army and people to advance in
the following years to total victory.''
   ``The participants observed a minute of silence in memory of
those compatriots and combatants who had fought heroically and laid
down their lives in the fierce battles 20 years ago,'' the report
said.
   An exhibition of photographs and relics of the offensive has
been opened to mark the anniversary, the report added.
   The communists took enormous casualties in launching the Tet, or
lunar new year, offensive beginning on Jan. 30, 1968, striking at
more than 100 cities and towns across South Vietnam.
   U.S. and South Vietnamese forces turned them back, but the
offensive convinced some Americans that the war was unwinnable and
fueled the antiwar movement. The U.S. military withdrew in 1973.
   The North Vietnamese won the war with a lightning invasion of
the south in April 1975.

<HEAD>Debate Over Social Security Reform Remains Major Issue in Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Hampshire primary could be the last
hurrah for several presidential candidates who have suggested
radical changes in Social Security ranging from letting young
workers opt out of the system to taxing all of affluent retirees'
benefits.
   But even if the candidates who stumped for those ideas are gone,
Social Security will remain a hot issue in this presidential race,
just as it was in 1984 and in the last three congressional
elections.
   The likelihood is that it will also be a provocative topic in
1992 and every four years after that for the foreseeable future.
Too many Americans have too much at stake in Social Security for it
to be otherwise.
   ``This issue may be with us for the rest of our lives,'' said
Paul Maslin, pollster for Democratic candidate Paul Simon.
   In the Iowa caucuses, the candidates most closely associated
with calls for changes in Social Security, Republican Pete du Pont
and Democrat Bruce Babbitt, took a shellacking.
   Republican Pat Robertson, who like du Pont favors privatizing
some of Social Security, finished a strong second, but it was his
stand on moral issues, not pensions, that galvanized his Iowa
supporters.
   Du Pont, who contends the system will crash in the next century
under the weight of the retired baby boomers unless they are
allowed to save their own retirement funds, finished a distant
fifth.
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, the Republicans' most vigorous
defender of the status quo in Social Security, was fourth, but
hoping to move up in New Hampshire with his unbridled attacks on
Sen. Bob Dole and Vice President George Bush for supporting a
freeze on Social Security in 1985.
   Dole, on the other hand, is telling voters everywhere he goes
about his role on the National Commission on Social Security Reform
in 1983, when the Kansas senator helped hammer out a last-minute
compromise that put Social Security back in the black.
   ``You don't have to worry about it being broke. You don't have
to worry about getting your checks. And there I made a
difference,'' says Dole, who never fails to add that Kemp voted
against the Social Security rescue plan. The New York congressman
says he did so because of its increase in payroll taxes.
   Kemp also argued that it was the improved economy and reduced
unemployment that revived Social Security's fortunes.
   Kemp's hard-hitting ad campaign against Dole and Bush on Social
Security has rekindled memories of the way Claude Pepper hammered
Reagan and other Republicans for backing deep Social Security cuts
in 1981.
   Du Pont has accused Kemp of repeatedly misrepresenting his plan
to allow workers to set up tax-free savings accounts if they
relinquish future Social Security benefit rights. Du Pont says
Kemp's attacks ``remind me of the demagoguery practices by the
Democratic Party in the 1982 elections.''
   Some Republicans, including Dole, have said it was the
Democrats' pounding on senior citizens' fear of Social Security
cuts or freezes that cost the GOP control of the Senate in 1986.
   On the Democrats' side, Babbitt has called for ``a universal
needs test to discipline government programs,'' including Social
Security, and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax on
all their benefits instead of half.
   Gary Hart also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits.
   The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguard
Social Security and its COLA's.
   ``We're going to keep it away from the Republican budget knives
forever,'' promises Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   Social Security's trust funds, which started 1988 with $67
billion, are expected to swell to $104 billion by the start of 1989
and to top $400 billion by 1994 and $1 trillion before the end of
the decade.
   Ultimately, Social Security's trust fund is expected to peak at
$12 trillion _ $2.5 trillion in today's dollars _ around 2020, then
be drawn down to nothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers'
retirement.
   Du Pont and Robertson have argued that even before the trust
funds are depleted, there will be nothing in there but government
IOU's. To pay off those IOU's _ actually, interest-bearing Treasury
bonds _ du Pont says, ``we face a big tax increase.''
   When du Pont asked 80 people at a debate in Manchester, N.H.,
how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65,
three people raised their hands.
   More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubious
about their personal prospects for Social Security.
   But that sentiment has not translated into support for
politicians such as du Pont and Babbitt who suggest overhauling or
even tinkering with Social Security.
   Maslin, the Simon pollster, said, ``The elites have attempted to
move the debate in a direction the voters don't want to move yet.''
Young voters don't expect to get Social Security themselves, Maslin
said, but they do expect it to be there for their parents.
   ``For all of the provocation, the voters are still on the side
of protection,'' said Maslin. ``They understand that if the
government does not provide those benefits, they are going to have
to pay for their parents' retirement or health problems.''

<TEXT>
   The University of Rhode Island's
traditional Thursday night fraternity parties have succumbed to the
complaints of professors who teach Friday morning classes.
   The Interfraternity Council voted last week to stop holding the
beer blasts after professors complained that too many students were
sleeping in class or skipping it entirely the next day.
   ``We feel that the fraternity system has a commitment to
education, and Thursday night parties seemed to hinder us in
attaining that goal,'' said Eric Andreozzi of Phi Gamma Delta,
president of the council.
   In addition, Thursday night parties dated from a time when most
URI students were Rhode Island residents who headed home on Friday,
but more students these days are likely to live on campus,
Andreozzi said.

<HEAD>Panama's Fiscal Problems Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama, skating on the edge of a fiscal
disaster, was awaiting word from private bankers this week on
whether they will accept a bailout scheme that could keep the
country out of default.
   Ricaurte Vasquez, Panama's planning minister, met in New York
late last week with a committee representing 150 commercial bank
creditors in a new effort to keep the country afloat by delaying
loan interest payments.
   Panama owes the private banks $200 million in interest this
year, with the bulk of it scheduled to come due in mid-March. But
the country's dollar reserves are virtually depleted and it is
unlikely it can meet its commitments.
   Vasquez first met with the creditor committee in December and
asked that $100 million of the interest due this year be added to
the principal for future payment. The bankers were said to have
shown little interest in that plan.
   It was not known if Vasquez offered the bankers a new bailout
plan last week, but he said recently that his government might have
to dismiss as many as 15,000 public employees next month to reduce
its cash flow.
   One out of every four Panamanian workers is employed by the
government, many owing their jobs to loyalty to the Democratic
Revolutionary Party, which has close ties to the country's de facto
leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``Much of what little popularity Noriega still retains comes
from the public sector,'' said a Western diplomat. ``If the
government is forced to make layoffs in that sector, it obviously
won't help Noriega's image.''
   Noriega has been under pressure to resign since last summer from
a broad but loose coalition known as the National Civic Crusade. It
counts more than 200 civic, business, professional, labor and other
groups as members.
   The opposition's charges of corruption against Noriega were
given added weight earlier this month when he was indicted by
federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., on charges of drug
smuggling, money laundering and racketeering.
   The general, who dominates the counry's civilian government as
head of Panama's Defense Forces, sent his army into the streets
last year to quell demonstrations by the Civic Crusade, and the
opposition has increasingly turned to what one official called
``economic warfare.''
   The tactics, which have added to the government's fiscal woes,
include removal of deposits from state banks and the avoidance or
late payment of utility fees and taxes. The Civic Crusade also has
called several nationwide strikes, but none has been particularly
successful.
   ``The Crusade's activities are an annoyance, I'm sure,'' said
the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But that's a
really small part of Panama's problem.''
   The problem, which Noriega inherited, comes from a huge public
debt rolled up by a predecessor, Gen. Omar Torrijos, who came to
power in a 1968 coup and began an ambitious program of building
schools, health clinics, roads and other public facilities.
   The World Bank put Panama's total foreign debt at $4.8 billion
at the end of 1986, the latest year for which figures are
available. The U.S. Commerce Department says the government
declared itself in ``informal, indefinite default'' to all
governmental lenders last year, meaning it made no interest or
principal payments.
   The United States halted all aid to Panama's government last
year, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also
cut off lending programs pending compliance by Panama with an IMF
demand for a restructuring of its social security programs.
   Diplomats and private economists say the government has been
loathe to make the reforms for fear of losing further popular
support, particularly among the lower and middle classes who
benefit most from the programs.
   The government's fiscal crisis appears to have had little effect
on the private economy, particularly among the more than 120
foreign banks that maintain offices here and make Panama one of the
Western Hemisphere's largest banking centers.
   ``The banking sector could face problems if the crisis deepens
because it is highly dependent on a sense of confidence and
stability,'' the diplomat said. ``But so far there have been no
failures, nobody has pulled out and deposits remain relatively
stable.''

<TEXT>
   The military said Sunday it sent
4,000 troops to protect voters in the southern island province of
Sulu, the last area to vote in the Philippines' violence-marred
regional elections.
   The island's 214,000 voters are to choose three governors, 18
mayors and 126 members of town councils Monday in the final stage
of balloting that began four weeks ago.
   About 50 Moslem bandits Friday attacked the southern island town
of Maimbun, about 600 miles south of Manila, said Col. Romeo
Abendan, head of the Philippine Constabulary of Sulu.
   He said four people were killed, three of them members of the
Moslem rebel Moro National Liberation Front.
   On Saturday, bandits attacked Kulasi village just outside
Maimbung, but no casualties were reported, he said. In nearby Luuk,
rival political groups traded fire with automatic weapons, but
there were no reported fatalities, he said.
   Col. Anthony Elias said 4,000 marine and army troops have joined
constabulary and special forces to prevent violence during voting
in the largely Moslem province and Moro stronghold.
   ``We expect some disturbance after the voting, which is normal,
especially when trends begin to show,'' Elias told reporters.
   Most Filipinos voted Jan. 18 in an election that President
Corazon Aquino said restored full democracy nearly two years after
the ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos. But voting was postponed
in 11 of the 73 provinces because of fears of violence from
communist rebels and regional warlords.
   In Manila, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Saturday that his
department was studying proposals to assist the military against
the 24,000-member communist New People's Army.
   Ramos did not specify what measures were under review, but he
previously has called for restoring the death penalty for rebels.
   Ramos also has proposed an unspecified ``package of legal
weapons'' to enable the military to crush the 19-year insurgency.
Such calls have led to speculation that the government was
considering a limited state of emergency in some provinces.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters Friday she would await
recommendations from Ramos before deciding whether to impose
emergency measures.
   Human rights groups have denounced such proposals. Marcos
imposed martial law from 1972 to 1981 and said it was to prevent a
communist takeover. The move helped fuel opposition to the
administration that culminated in the February 1986 uprising that
toppled Marcos.

<TEXT>
   The recent spate of skittish economic
indicators is raising concerns that the next president will take
office without the tools to combat a recession, even if an
election-year downturn can be avoided.
   That's because the federal budget deficit has grown so huge that
the historical remedies for jolting an economy out of a recession _
lower taxes and more federal spending _ simply will not be
available to the next president, a growing number of analysts
suggest.
   In fact, if anything, the next occupant of the Oval Office will
be under extreme pressure to press for higher taxes to reduce the
budget deficit _ a tactic that would become all but impossible
during an actual recession.
   In 1981, when the last recession began, the federal budget
deficit stood at $78 billion. By 1987, with the recovery from that
recession entering its sixth year, the shortfall was $148 billion
after soaring to a record $221 billion in 1986.
   The bloated budget deficits of the 1980s will make it that much
harder for Ronald Reagan's successor to cope with a recession, say
analysts troubled by recent reports showing a faltering economy and
by last week's Congressional Budget Office report that the deficit
may hit $176 billion next year.
   Economists and political leaders are coming down with a good
case of the jitters.
   ``The ability of the new president to use the discretionary
parts of the budget, particularly large tax cuts, just aren't
there,'' said David Jones, senior economist for Aubrey G. Lanston
and Co.
   And William Dunkelberg, business school dean at Temple
University, suggests: ``The chicken is coming home to roost. On
Oct. 19 (the stock market plunge) he came looking for a place to
roost but he didn't do it. He was just observed to be a very large
chicken.''
   So far, the focus has been on whether the nation will avoid an
election-year recession that could spell disaster for Republican
candidates.
   But, even if recession is escaped this year, many analysts see
one lurking just around the corner _ perhaps in 1989. That would
present Reagan's successor with painful policy choices from his
very first day.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, passed in 1985 and
revised last year, the budget deficit is supposed to be trimmed to
$136 billion next year. Congress and the White House, in a rare
show of cooperation, cut a deal in the aftermath of the stock crash
spelling out broad outlines of a package to do just that.
   White House budget Director James C. Miller III says that the
fiscal 1989 budget that the president submits to Congress next week
will hit that $136 billion target on the nose, even though ``it
will be close.''
   But the CBO has cast serious doubt on that projection with its
report last week that the federal deficit in fiscal 1989, which
begins next Oct. 1, would miss the Gramm-Rudman target by $40
billion even under terms of the White House-Congress budget
compromise.
   If a recession hits, all bets are off. Both the White House and
the CBO projections assume that growth will slow in 1988, not be
negative. (A recession is usually defined as a decline in the gross
national product for two consecutive quarters, after adjustments
for inflation.)
   Deficits usually expand in recessions because tax revenues are
off at the same time demand for government benefits rises.
   Nobel laureate Paul A. Samuelson, an economics professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggests that if the nation
gets lucky and a recession doesn't arrive by 1989, it could present
a rare chance to get the government's fiscal house in order.
   ``It can be done in the early years of the next president,''
Samuelson said.
   But Samuelson and many other economists say major reductions in
the deficit likely will require new taxes _ a course Reagan has
steadfastly resisted throughout his term.
   Of all the presidential candidates, only Democrat Bruce Babbit
advocates higher taxes to reduce the deficit even though all 13 _
six Republicans and seven Democrats _ give reducing the deficit a
top priority.
   Economic consultant Pat Choate of TRW says that regardless of
whom is elected, barring a recession, ``the next president will
raise taxes.''
   The case for a tax increase ``is now much stronger than it was
in 1984,'' when Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale
braved much political derision to advocate one, says Harvard
economist Lawrence Summers.
   Still, Murray Weidenbaum, economics professor at Washington
University in St. Louis and Reagan's first chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers, argues: ``Given the softness of the economy,
it would be hard to find a worse time to talk about a significant
tax increase.''
   Either way _ a painful recession or a major tax increase _ the
economic policy options facing the next president will be limited
and difficult.
   ``The question is: who would want to win control of the White
House or the Congress this time? Maybe that's why nobody is
running,'' jokes Temple's Dunkelberg.

   Esther Ruth Langford says she struggles
daily to pay her bills, and she counts on the $161 royalty check
she gets each month from Exxon Co. USA to help stretch her Social
Security income.
   But Exxon officials claim Mrs. Langford, a widow, owes the
Houston-based company $37,000, because oil pumped from her property
and sold in the late '70s and early '80s was overpriced.
   ``There's no way in the world I could pay that,'' Mrs. Langford
said last week. ``I'd have to sell everything I've got. And I don't
know if that would do it or not.''
   Mrs. Langford is one of 2,300 defendants named in an Exxon
federal class-action lawsuit. The list of defendants includes a
millionaire or two and other oil companies. It also includes the
Salvation Army and school districts.
   Exxon is suing because a federal court decided in 1983 that the
company had overcharged customers for oil pumped from the
defendants' land. The court ordered Exxon to refund $895.5 million,
and now Exxon wants the royalty owners to help with the restitution.
   The defendants argue that they should not have to pay for
Exxon's errors.
   ``They got their fingers caught in the till and now they want
the people in Hawkins to pay it back,'' said Gerald Langford, Mrs.
Langford's stepson. He is being asked for $49,000.
   Many defendants live in this pine-forested community of about
1,300. They are original landowners, their heirs, or beneficiaries
who receive royalties _ a portion of proceeds from the sale of oil
and gas pumped from their property.
   The Hawkins Field lies about 4,400 feet below ground. It was
discovered in 1940; in 1975, landowners and heirs agreed to let
Exxon pump the field as a unit, believing they could increase its
production and extend its life.
   Oil from the Hawkins Field Unit should have been priced
according to federal regulations implemented during the Carter
administration, but the federal government charged Exxon did not
follow the regulations.
   Exxon claimed the overpricing was the result of interpretations
of complicated federal pricing guidelines.
   As Exxon appealed the restitution order, and lost, the sum
swelled to $2.1 billion because of interest. Exxon, in a statement
distributed by spokesman Les Rogers, said that since owners'
payments were based on the disallowed higher prices, they should
expect to help pay the refund.
   Exxon said it warned royalty owners that its prices were being
challenged and they might have to pay back some money they
received, and said the court permitted it to seek repayment. The
company settled with about 1,500 defendants, but time was running
out so the suit was filed, Rogers said.
   ``None of the interest owners told us not to pay them at that
higher rate. No one told us to pay them the lower rate,'' said
Rogers.
   ``I had nothing to do with it,'' said Mrs. Langford, 62. ``They
didn't consult me when they priced the oil. They did that
themselves.'' She said Exxon sent her a letter asking her to
settle, but ``I didn't get that kind of income.''
   Royalty owners receive about one-eighth of the proceeds from the
sale of oil and gas pumped from their property.
   Exxon is seeking $104,000 from the Hawkins School District,
which has elementary, middle and high schools, said Superintendent
Wendell McGuire.
   ``Any time you take $100,000 from a program, it's going to
affect it,'' McGuire said. He's not sure where the district's $4.2
million budget would be cut if forced to pay, but expects the
elementary school would lose a planned computer lab.
   Some defendants are heirs and are being asked to pay back money
spent by their parents.
   Gerald Langford inherited his interest from his father. ``They
sent me a notice that I owed them $49,000. I only had it (the
royalty ownership) for three years,'' he said.
   Hubert Smith, 82, settled. The settlement includes an agreement
not to discuss figures. ``I don't think I should have owed it but
it seemed as if I was going to have to pay, so I got it off my
mind,'' Smith said. ``I got them down to an agreeable sum.''
   Smith said he paid with royalty money he had saved and invested.
   George Bramblett Jr., a Dallas attorney, represents Jarvis
Christian College, a predominantly black college in Hawkins; the
Meredith Foundation, a philanthropic organization; and several

   Exxon wants the foundation to repay $4 million, he said.
   ``Our first line of defense is that Exxon has no right under the

``They set the price on the oil and gas and if they made the
mistake it's their problem.''
   Hundreds of royalty owners have chosen to wait for the outcome
of the suit, which does not yet have a trial date.
   ``I can't afford an attorney,'' Mrs. Langford said.

   It looks like an ordinary set of false teeth,
but it's mounted in something that looks like a machine-shop drill
press.
   ``It doesn't look like an artificial mouth, but it works like
one,'' said Dr. William Douglas, who directs the Artificial
Resynthesis Technology study at the University of Minnesota.
   Scientists are using a pair of the bulky machines, the only ones
of their kind, to test dental products and conduct other kinds of
research.
   Douglas and his colleagues can duplicate the rigors of a year of
chewing in a single day. That, he says, offers hope for vast
improvement in the quality of dental fillings and crowns and in
scientists' ability to understand the forces of chewing and
digestion.
   Without the new technology, Douglas explains, manufacturers must
test and prove the durability of their wares in the mouths of real
subjects. Years of grinding and chomping must go by before
researchers can judge a product's merit.
   ``If you put this together, you have an investigative tool,''
said Douglas, 50, who left a research post in Wales to do research
at the university.
   ``If you have an obedient artificial mouth which is believable,
you have something to enable you to approach many tough problems
that otherwise would be very difficult to do.''
   The mouth began taking shape when Douglas joined the dental
research staff at Minnesota in 1978. His endowed chair is partly
funded by 3M Co., based in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood. 3M is
a leading manufacturer of fillings, crowns and other dental
products.
   Douglas soon learned of a company, MTS Systems Corp., in
suburban Eden Prairie that builds test equipment with the precision
and sophistication he needed to replicate mouth dynamics in the
laboratory.
   Along with colleagues Ralph DeLong and R.L. Sakaguchi, Douglas
adapted MTS equipment to build the mechanical mouths.
   The next step was artificial saliva. A researcher at State
University of New York at Buffalo has learned how to make it, and
he sends Douglas and company quantities to use with the mouth. Jets
shoot the saliva and other lubricants between test teeth the way
ducts do in real life.
   Along with the mouth, the dental researchers have developed
computer imaging technology that maps precisely where and how teeth
wear out.
   ``It's a very painstaking procedure right now, where you're
marking on teeth ... and measuring them,'' said Walter Poxon,
international professional services manager for 3M. ``This computer
imaging is the state of the art in dental materials research. It
really does give you an accurate picture of what's happening.''
   Douglas has other, more ambitious dreams for his mouth. Now, it
chews only in the sense that it simulates the wear-and-tear of
chewing. He wants it to masticate fully _ to grind, break down and
even swallow food.
   The next step: development of artificial tongues and cheeks.
Douglas is poring over scientific papers for background while he
prepares applications for National Institute of Health grants to
finance more work in that direction.
   ``I want to figure out how this thing can give a good simulation
of what happens in the human mouth. For that you need a tongue and
cheek mechanism,'' Douglas said. ``It's very tough. It's a very
difficult thing to do.''
   Douglas sees a complete artificial mouth as a research tool for
food-product development, a field in which tenderness, texture and
``mouth feel'' possess tremendous importance. The artificial mouth
would be able to quantify precisely the oral effort Product X would
demand of the consumer.
   ``You have an instrument that can figure out just how much
mastication has to go into that beef,'' he said.

   Some youth gangs are taking a
corporate approach to selling drugs, complete with accounting and
marketing divisions and bonuses for top salesmen, according to
Michigan State University researchers.
   ``This is a street version of Wall Street. It's straight out of
any graduate school of business,'' said Carl Taylor, an adjunct
professor of criminal justice and one of five researchers in a
five-year study on gangs.
   He cited as an example Richard ``White Boy Rick'' Wershe Jr.,
who recently was sentenced to life in prison for selling cocaine in
Detroit.
   ``Kids are still talking (about) his trappings and how he was
rolling. In the halls of Denby High School, he's a legend,'' Taylor
said last week.
   Taylor and his associates studied gangs in three cities,
including two ``corporate'' bands of hoods in Detroit, where the
study was focused.
   The researchers interviewed gang members on street corners and
in nightclubs, aided by a researcher who was a former gang member.
   They found that in the corporate gangs some members would be
assigned to marketing, checking out neighborhoods to assess
potential sales and what competition, if any, existed.
   They would report back to gang leaders who would decide whether
to enter that market.
   Other members were assigned to do the actual selling. If they
did well, they could be promoted to distributor and put in control
of larger amounts of drugs. Distributors also were responsible for
keeping books.
   Like companies in search of excellence, gang leaders would
reward top salesmen with bonuses such as cars, trips, money and
clothing.
   ``With the new corporate entity, they will do anything to
further and protect their goals,'' Taylor said. ``It's the `in'
thing to be a White Boy Rick or Young Boys Incorporated. That role
model has replaced Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and pro athletes. The
ramifications are so deep it's scary.''
   Detroit police say Taylor's thesis has some merit, but that
corporate gangs are not that widespread.
   ``More and more of these operations are operating like
businesses,'' said narcotics inspector Warren Harris. ``These
things are planned for and these things are well-arranged. It's
almost as if they've had professional guidance.''
   He said older adults are usually the top leaders of drug
organizations and the number of youths running such operations has
declined since the days of Young Boys Inc., a notorious Detroit
drug ring that operated in the 1970s. And, he said, the
organizations do not always evolve from gangs.
   Harris speculated that young criminals' ability to structure a
drug business may come from watching how the legal system operates
or taking advice from attorneys and other professionals.
   As efficient as corporate gangs might appear, there is no
dominant drug distributor in the Detroit area, police say.
   Detroit's problems are shared nationwide and extend from the
inner cities to wealthy suburbs, Taylor said, adding that the
greatest threats to corporate gangs are crackdowns, capitalism, and
relatively inexpensive crack cocaine.
   Big activity by a corporate gang often prompts big interest from
the government, including the Internal Revenue Service, Taylor
said, and the combined forces of the government can bring down a
gang.
   But crack can bring about the breakdown first. The drug, far
cheaper than powder cocaine, has inspired many young entrepreneurs
to split off from their corporate gangs and head out on their own.
   ``It's their version of the American dream,'' Taylor said.

   Employees walked off the job at 7 a.m. and said they would stay
out until midnight to protest the unexpected suspension of
negotiations on a new contract.
   Labor leaders representing ground crews and pilots told Italian
newspapers they will stage periodic strikes at Italian airports
until Feb. 29. Strikers want to force Alitalia, the national flag
carrier, to meet their demands for shorter hours and higher pay.
   Travelers in Italy may face other transportation problems near

<HEAD>Insider's Critique: Failure To Curb Leaks Helped Spawn Iran-Contra
Errors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Justice Department official says the
Reagan administration might have avoided its Iran-Contra mistakes
if it had the political nerve to stand by its plan to curb leaks
with widespread polygraph tests and expanded censorship.
   ``The administration paid a real price'' for backing off
President Reagan's anti-leak order in 1984, said Assistant Attorney
General Richard K. Willard, architect of the plan known as National
Security Decision Directive 84.
   ``That price showed up most clearly in Iran-Contra: people were
so afraid of leaks from official channels that they bypassed those
safeguards. They adopted all these other approaches that resulted
in inadequate consideration and scrutiny,'' Willard said in an
interview before he leaves government this week for private
practice.
   Presidential and congressional investigations said the fear of
leaks was a prime motive for White House aides to rely on shadowy
businessmen to carry out Iran and Contra policies while keeping key
Reagan Cabinet members in the dark.
   Willard believes if these people had been consulted they would
have prevented the mistakes.
   Although Willard became a symbol of government secrecy during
the anti-leak fight, the 39-year-old lawyer operated quite openly
during seven years at the Justice Department _ whether he was
devising changes in intelligence policy or planning drug tests for
federal employees.
   Looking back, he said the administration's biggest victories _
such as raising public concern about drugs and adding new drug
agents and drug tests _ show the importance of altering public
opinion before changing government policy.
   And its biggest disappointments, including on-and-off support
for Contra rebels in Nicaragua, reveal the folly of trying to sneak
new policies through the Washington political thicket, Willard said.
   Willard, who served at Justice longer than any other Reagan
appointee, now heads its civil division. But he started as
intelligence policy counsel to Attorney General William French
Smith, who named him to head the inter-agency team that drafted the
anti-leak order.
   That order would have subjected the hundreds of thousands of
federal employees who see classified papers to possible firing if
they refused to take polygraph tests in leak investigations. Other
thousands with access to the deepest secrets would have to let the
government censor their speeches and writings for life.
   The order enraged editorial writers, many members of Congress,
authors and publishers, public employee unions, civil liberties
groups, and _ privately _ even some of Willard's colleagues at
Justice.
   Willard became the directive's only public defender and was, as
he put it, ``castigated daily in the columns of The New York Times
and The Washington Post'' for most of a year. The pressure forced
Reagan to replace the order with a small polygraph test program in
the Pentagon.
   ``The administration showed a lack of political nerve to deal
with this problem, because they were afraid to take on the press,''
which paid more attention than the order deserved, Willard said.
   ``This administration has had its greatest problems where we
just try to change public policy without changing the overall
climate of ideas in the country,'' Willard said. ``You have real
problems given the balance of power in Washington between the
president and Congress and entrenched interest groups.
   ``No one thought then that the leak order would solve all the
problems or even most of them; it was part of an effort to get a
better climate of ideas about leaks.'' Willard said. ``But people
like Bill Casey (then CIA director) and others who should have had
an equally strong interest did not think it was important to defend
and deal with the public.''
   Willard said President Jimmy Carter had the same problem with
his failed military mission to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran.
``People who could have helped make the project a success were not
brought into it because of the fear of leaks.
   ``I feel the same way about Central America,'' Willard said.
``It was a mistake early in this administration to do so much
covert action without developing public support.''
   Among administration successes, Willard said, ``the whole drug
issue, not just drug testing but the broader change of attitudes
about drugs in this country, is a remarkable turnabout since the
Carter administration'' when some localities dropped criminal
penalties for minor drug use.
   And he cited his own 3-year-old effort to reduce soaring damage
awards in liability cases. ``Our strategy was to emphasize the need
for reform across the board, rather than say, `We need this federal
statute and all our problems will be solved'.''
   Federal revisions still have not passed, but, after many
speeches and sending reports to every state legislator, ``in 1986
and 1987, 47 of the 50 states adopted one or more of our
recommendations to limit liability,'' he said.
   Willard said if he had one thing to do over ``I would have tried
to get the senior national security and intelligence people to
undertake more of a personal commitment to the leak policy before
committing so much of my own effort and reputation.''
   After that battle, Attorney General Smith's deputy, Edward
Schmults volunteered to a newsman that ``Willard won't be nominated
to head the civil division or any post requiring Senate
confirmation so long as Smith and I are here.'' He wasn't nominated
until Edwin Meese became attorney general.

   Judges used broad discretion granted under the
newly enacted Bail Reform Act of 1984 to jail a sharply higher
percentage of people awaiting trial for federal crimes, the
government said Sunday.
   The chances of being jailed while awaiting trial for people
accused of serious narcotics violations were 20 percent higher
after the law took effect than previously, said the study by the
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   After the bail reforms took effect in November 1984, the
probability of being jailed was 63 percent higher for people
accused of causing injuries. It was 23 percent higher for those who
had used firearms and 17 percent higher for those classified as
dangerous during pre-trial interviews.
   Overall, 29 percent of the defendants awaiting trial on federal
criminal charges were incarcerated until they appeared in court.
This was an increase from 24 percent who were held during the same
period in 1983.
   The study was based on information collected during a six-month
period in 1985.
   The act permits federal courts to deny bail altogether if the
government proves that no conditions of release will reasonably
assure either the safety of the community or the appearance of the
defendant at trial.
   The report suggests that pre-trial detention is being used as an
alternative to holding people under high bail.

   William Paley, the 86-year-old founder and
chairman of CBS, was in satisfactory condition at a Manhattan
hospital Sunday following gall bladder surgery earlier in the week.
   Paley had the operation Thursday and was in the intensive care
unit of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, according to an
administrator, Debbie Green. She said she could provide no further
information about his condition.
   Paley bought a fledgling radio network in 1928 and turned it
into the Columbia Broadcasting System, which he controlled for more
than half a century.
   In April 1983, he turned the reins of CBS Inc. over to Thomas H.
Wyman.
   But when CBS's biggest stockholder, Loew's Corp., became unhappy
with Wyman's policies, Paley teamed with Loew's chairman Lawrence
Tisch in 1986 to retake control, with Paley as chairman and Tisch
as president and chief executive officer.

   Williams, who played high school football at nearby Chaneyville

   Richard Branson, head of a multimillion-dollar
entertainment empire, has accepted an offer to become a director of
Intourist, the Soviet state-run tourist organization, a newspaper
reports.
   The invitation came after Branson, 36, one of Britain's richest
men, visited the Soviet Union last month to sign a deal to run a
hotel in the Black Sea resort of Yalta and another under
construction near the Turkish border, The Observer said Sunday.
   The weekly said Branson accepted because of his regard for
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``He is making a tremendous
effort to improve things in the Soviet Union and it is important
that we give him a chance,'' Branson was quoted as saying.
   The report said Branson hopes to sell condoms and records in the
Soviet Union, as well as have his pop artists perform there.
   The multimillionaire, who has a penchant for daring stunts such
as balloon and powerboat crossings of the Atlantic, runs a huge
video, record and satellite TV business as well as Virgin Atlantic
Airlines.

   Three-time U.S. surfing champion Donald
Takayama is trying to make a splash in the marinade business.
   ``The rage now is peanut butter, avocado and banana sandwiches
with my chunky pineapple marinade,'' Takayama said last week.
   Takayama, 44, left his native Hawaii a quarter-century ago for
the mainland and went on to become surf champ in 1972, 1973 and
1974.
   The Surfer's Choice teriyaki and chunky pineapple marinade are
currently available at five supermarkets, and other stores have
also expressed interest, said Takayama, who also runs a surfboard
business.
   When asked if success would infringe on his daily surfing, he
said, ``No way. I just tell them I'm in a board meeting.''

   Security forces Sunday dispersed
more than 400 demonstrators who gathered in a downtown square to
demand human rights.
   Five people were arrested after police broke up the protest,
which began after an official observance of the 43rd anniversary of
the Allied bombing of Dresden.
   Church leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late
Sunday the five detainees were released after questioning. There
were no reports of injuries.
   The protesters unfurled banners demanding more human rights and
called on the communist East German government to allow freedom of
travel to the West. Many shouted ``The Wall Must Go!'' and ``We
want freedom!''
   It was the first time a demonstration of that size had taken
place in the city, protesters said.
   Communist authorities in 1961 erected a heavily fortified wall
between East Germany and West Germany. The barrier also divides
Berlin.
   As the protesters prepared to leave the Dresden square, police
moved in and dragged away the five activists and detained them
briefly in the nearby Palace of Culture. Police blocked an attempt
by other demonstrators to storm the building.
   The square then was cleared by at least 100 uniformed and
plainclothes police.
   On Saturday afternoon, several protesters raised banners
demanding more freedom during a ceremony marking the Allied bombing
of Dresden on Feb. 13, 1945.
   The banners were quickly ripped down and confiscated by security
forces.
   Witnesses said one man was arrested for carrying a banner that
read, ``Freedom for Those Who Think Differently.''
   More than 100 people were arrested in East Berlin last month for
attempting to demonstrate at a state-sanctioned rally honoring the
founders of the German Communist Party.
   East German authorities have since expelled more than 60 of the
East Berlin dissidents, including several prominent East German
artists.
   Four protesters were arrested last week during a visit to East
Berlin by West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. They have since been
released, officials in West Berlin said Saturday.

   A supermarket found a novel way to
help celebrate this city's centennial _ a 100-second, mad dash
through the aisles for free groceries and other items.
   Seven runners, each representing a city resident who is at least
100 years old, racked up $975.51 worth of items Saturday, according
to store manager Paco Preciado. Most of the competitors were the
centenarians' grandchildren, he said.
   About 50 regular shoppers cheered and Preciado kept a close eye
on the stopwatch as the racers made individual dashes through the
aisles.
   ``When it got down to 10 seconds, it was like pandemonium for
the person shopping,'' Preciado said.
   One woman managed to cram $289 worth of goods in her cart.
   ``She was running a lot of meat, a lot of soaps, high-figure
items,'' he said.
   Other favorites were ice cream and frozen foods.
   The centenarians, wearing special T-shirts, watched the
goings-on, Preciado said.
   ``They looked like they were enjoying themselves,'' he said.
``When you're 100 years old, you don't jump up and down.''

   Instead of calling the witness to the stand, Judge
Robert Fullerton asked him to ``please step over to the telephone
speaker.''
   Fullerton, who wore no judicial robes, was conducting an
experiment in trying a case by conference telephone call.
   When plaintiff Dennis Ginther testified in Denver, he was
cross-examined by defense attorney Michael Soileau in Metairie,
La., a New Orleans suburb.
   ``I like to think in Colorado we're always trying advanced
techniques,'' said Fullerton, a District Court judge. Defense
attorneys had sent exhibits to the court in advance, he said, and
attorneys in both cities were sent copies.
   The case involving a Louisiana firm did not close as scheduled
last month, and defense attorneys and defendants returned to
Louisiana. So Fullerton scheduled the court session by telephone.
   That saved the defendants and attorneys a second trip to Denver,
which would have cost $1,500 in air fare alone, Soileau said.
   ``I don't know what the cost of the phone call will be, but it
will be substantially less,'' said Fullerton.
   Ginther, who is based here, is seeking $13,525 in appraisal
services he said he performed for Financial Management Services of
Metairie in 1985, plus interest and attorneys' fees. The Louisiana
company claimed Ginther was paid according to the contract's terms.
   Fullerton heard the telephone testimony Friday, but did not
issue a ruling.
   The judge admitted that the experiment has limitations. He can't
tell during questioning if a defendant is being counseled by
attorneys on the other end. And a jury trial would be difficult to
conduct by phone.
   But his clerk, Ginny Dondelinger, said there's one advantage.
   ``Attorneys talk less on the telephone than when they can act
out in court,'' she said.

   Firecrackers, dragon floats and even a banner
reminding illegal aliens they can still seek amnesty were part of
the celebration as thousands began ringing in the Chinese New Year
over the weekend.
   People jammed the streets of Chinatown on Saturday for a
multiethnic celebration of the Chinese lunar year 4686, the year of
the dragon, although the year actually begins Wednesday.
   A parade featuring beauty queens, floats, firecrackers and
hundreds of people in colorful costumes wound through the streets.
   Mixed with the traditional Chinese new year sounds of cymbals
and gongs were musical notes from Scottish bagpipes and rhythms
produced by Aztec drums.
   ``It's just a cultural shock,'' said Dan Olson of Escondido, who
attended the parade for the first time. ``It's really interesting
to see the different nationalities represented here.
   During the parade, a small plane flew overhead trailing a banner
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that proclaimed,
``Apply for Amnesty by May 4.''
   Dragons of all sizes, and appearing in nearly every color,
pranced through the streets.
   About 30 people from the First Testament Church gathered on the
sidewalk to protest the appearance of the dragons, arguing they
were satanic symbols.
   ``Many people are being deceived,'' said Jeannie Lin. ``With the
year of the dragon, Satan is trying to snatch the glory of God. To
them it might just be a celebration, a parade, but actually the
dragon is of Satan.''
   Most people ignored the protesters.
   The activities also continued into the evening with exhibits of
martial arts, traditional entertainment and crafts.

   As part of an unusual Valentine's Day
project, about 350 students at two high schools have agreed to give
up or not start smoking or dipping snuff.
   The American Heart Association and the Texas Association of
Student Councils organized the project, called ``Save a Sweet
Heart,'' to make students aware of how cigarettes can affect their
hearts.
   About 250 students at West Brook Senior High and 96 at the

   The students themselves worked on promoting the day and
gathering pledges. The program is similar to the annual Great
American Smokeout that takes place in the fall.

   Security agents Sunday stopped retired Gen.
Ruben D. Paredes, the former commander of Panama's Defense Forces
and a leading government critic, from leaving the country.
   Paredes, a vocal critic of the country's de facto leader, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, was halted at Panama City's international
airport. He was trying to board a commercial flight to Miami, where
he planned to hire legal counsel for his son, Ameth.
   Ameth Paredes was indicted on drug trafficking charges along
with Noriega and 14 others by a federal grand jury in Miami on Feb.
4. Paredes has accused Noriega of involvement in the death of
another son, Ruben Jr., who was found dead in Medellin, Colombia,
in 1986. Noriega has denied any wrongdoing.
   Another opposition figure, Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, also
was forbidden from leaving Saturday when he tried to leave from the
airport on a Central American business trip.
   Gonzalez is a leader of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition
of business, civic, professional, labor and other groups that has
been seeking Noriega's ouster since last June.
   Gonzalez has been charged with sedition by the government, but
said he was carrying a court order allowing him to leave the
country temporarily. Security agents said the document was not in
order.
   Security forces Sunday also expelled an American newsman, Larry
Lamotte, a correspondent for the Cable News Network, for allegedly
filing ``unobjective news reports'' from Panama.
   Lamotte said an agent came to his hotel room Saturday night and
told him to pack his bags. He was put on the first available flight
to Miami. He was the second CNN correspondent tossed out of the
country in recent months.
   Paredes, who preceded Noriega as head of Panama's military
forces in 1982 and 1983, said he was told he could not leave the
country because of a pending libel charge against him by the
government.

   Tickets were on sale here for three
Bruce Springsteen concerts later this month. And then they weren't.
   All 34,000 were sold out in just over two hours Saturday.
   ``I'm just glad it's over,'' said spokesman Ed Lavoie of the
Worcester Centrum. ``It's been a rough week. Maybe now I can
sleep.''
   Lines formed quickly outside the Centrum and at Ticketmaster
outlets for the 2 p.m. sale after noon release of the time by
Springsteen's promoter, Tea Party Concerts.
   The tickets went only to those who received wrist bands a week
ago to keep them from camping out overnight after the dates were
announced.
   The Feb. 25, 28 and 29 dates are the only ones Springsteen plans
in New England, and they kick off his Tunnel of Love concert tour.
   The waiting throngs did not complain despite a blustery wind in
freezing temperatures.
   ``We were supposed to go skiing in Waterville Valley today, but
my friend called and said we're doing something else,'' said Ernie
Galipeau of Waltham. ``Here we are.''

   Former world champion boxer
Carlos Monzon was charged Sunday with killing his estranged lover
during an early morning fight in which she fell to her death from
an apartment balcony, police said.
   Monzon, world middleweight champion from 1970 until his
retirement in 1977, suffered two broken ribs and a broken clavicle
during the fight and was hospitalized in this beach resort 250
miles south of Buenos Aires, Interzonal Hospital authorities said.
   Police said Alicia Muniz, Monzon's longtime companion, was
pronounced dead at the scene of the fight, which awakened
neighbors. The incident occurred at an apartment where Muniz, a
part-time actress from Uruguay, was staying with television actor
Adrian Martel, police said.
   Monzon and Muniz had one child, Maximiliano, 7, who was asleep
in Martel's apartment during the fight, police said.
   Police said the estranged couple argued loudly at about 6:45
a.m., exchanged blows and that Ms. Muniz fell from the second story
balcony to the street below.
   Since his retirement from the ring, Monzon, 45, has appeared in
two Argentine movies, modeled professionally and has been involved
in real estate.

   Thousands of people weary of the cold, snowy
Minnesota winter put on shorts, kicked off their shoes and went
barefoot at the beach ... inside the Metrodome.
   Barefoot children built sand castles in more than 400 tons of
sand that was dumped on the stadium's floor Saturday as part of
Beach Break, billed as ``Minnesota's midwinter beach party.''
   ``We couldn't get to Orlando this year, so this is our
second-best bet,'' said Alan Frailich of New Hope, who was with his
wife, Yvonne, and their three children. ``We deserve it.''
   Of course, it didn't matter that the grass was artificial turf,
that the palm trees were plastic and that the ocean view was only a
painted backdrop.
   It didn't matter because high temperatures over the past week
were mostly in single digits with overnight lows below zero, and
several inches of snow cover the ground in most places around the
metropolitan area.
   The dome took on a carnival atmosphere, complete with Ferris
wheel, merry-go-round, 75-foot high-diving platform, music stage,
volleyball courts, reggae bands and simulated windsurfing in front
of a powerful fan.
   Among the people wearing shorts were Jan and Bob Riese of
Fridley, who took photos they intend to send to friends in Florida.
   ``It's not quite as good as being there, but it's a lot
cheaper,'' she said. ``We're having a ball.''

   A restaurant employee at a five-star
hotel poured fuel alcohol into a hot stove Sunday and triggered an
explosion that left six people dead, police said.
   The victims died of asphyxiation after they were trapped on the
31st floor of the Hotel International in the Zurich suburb of
Oerlikon, police spokesman Heinrich Laetsch told reporters.
   Thirty people were in the restaurant when fire broke out, he
said.
   It was not immediately known whether the dead were patrons or
employees of the restaurant.
   Police said the flames were fed by the synthetic carpeting in
the restaurant. Rescuers feared at first the swimming pool located
on the top floor of the 32-floor high-rise might collapse.
   One fireman was hospitalized with respiratory complaints.
   Witnesses said fire alarms at the hotel, owned by the Swiss
national airline Swissair, sounded only after a delay.
   An elevator reserved for the fire department failed to work, so
equipment had to be carried up the stairs, local fire official Paul
Berner said.
   The restaurant, popular for its panoramic view, had no automatic
sprinkler system, duty manager Anton Stadelmann said.
   About 180 people escaped safely from the hotel, including the
employee apparently reponsible for the fire. Police said he was in
a state of shock and could not immediately be questioned.
   About 100 firemen using gas masks mobilized for the blaze, one
of Switzerland's most serious in recent years.
   Firefighters needed two hours to bring the blaze under control.
The victims were found under the smoking rubble of the restaurant.
   Zurich authorities launched an investigation. Officials
estimated the damage at hundreds of thousands of dollars.

<HEAD>Court Records: Eldest Ray Brother Suffers From AIDS-Related
Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eldest of three hemophiliac brothers
banned from attending elementary schools in a Florida county
because they carry the AIDS virus has now developed AIDS-related
complex, court records show.
   Ricky Ray, 11, has begun to show some symptoms of the disease,
but he does not have a severe or life-threatening illness stemming
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, his doctor said.
   ``Ricky's ARC is stable, and he is showing no signs of
progression,'' said Dr. Jerry Barbosa, a specialist in pediatric
hematology and oncology at All Children's Hospital in St.
Petersburg. ``He should be able to continue performing daily
activities.
   ``He never posed a threat (of spreading the AIDS virus) in the
past, and he doesn't pose a threat to anyone in the present,'' said
Barbosa.
   Ricky is taking the anti-AIDS drug AZT, and Barbosa said the boy
is ``full of energy. His lymph nodes are no longer swollen.''
   Ricky's two brothers, 10-year-old Robert and 8-year-old Randy,
remain in good health, Barbosa said.
   Gail Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta, said a diagnosis of ARC does not automatically
mean a patient will develop AIDS, a fatal disease that destroys the
body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to infections
and cancer.
   ARC is a condition caused by the AIDS virus and has a specific
set of symptoms, Barbosa said. Those symptoms are often less severe
than the symptoms of AIDS.
   The AIDS virus is spread most often through sexual contact,
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products and from pregnant women to their offspring. Doctors
believe the Ray brothers were injected with tainted plasma-based
medication they received to clot their blood.
   School officials in Sarasota County, where the boys attend
school, said Friday they expected some mild reaction from parents
once the news of Ricky's condition spreads.
   ``Every time there is a story about the Rays or AIDS in general,
there is some response from parents,'' said Lee Coose, principal of
Gocio Elementary School, where the Ray boys attend. ``But that
reaction has always been minor.''
   The boys' medical records are on public file as part of a
lawsuit filed against the DeSoto County School Board by their
parents, Louise and Clifford Ray. Barbosa filed the results of the
Ray boys' Feb. 2 physical examinations in federal court Friday.
   The Ray brothers were banned from regular classes in DeSoto
County in August 1986 after they tested positive for AIDS
antibodies. A federal judged ordered their return to the classroom.
   On the fifth day they returned, a fire destroyed their home.
Authorities ruled the fire was deliberately set, but no arrests
were made.
   The Rays moved to Sarasota with the boys and their 6-year-old
sister Candy, who is not infected.

   Classical clarinettist Richard Stoltzman played
``The Ebony Concerto'' with Woody Herman's Thundering Herd at
Carnegie Hall in a tribute concert to the band's late leader.
   Saturday night's concert sounded the way Igor Stravinsky
undoubtedly meant it to sound when he composed it for Herman and
his band in 1946.
   Herman always said that, in rehearsals with Stravinsky above
Manhattan's Paramount Theater, and in the premiere at Carnegie
Hall, he and the band didn't really do justice to ``The Ebony
Concerto.''
   Herman had planned this Carnegie Hall concert, with Stoltzman,
not himself, playing in ``The Ebony Concerto.''
   Woody Herman's Thundering Herd now is led by Frank Tiberi, who
joined the band in 1969, primarily playing tenor saxophone and
bassoon. Tiberi, 59, called it ``a life-sentence membership.''
   Tiberi said that while Herman was sick he had said that his band
should continue _ ``and I'm going to continue with Woody's pattern
and his sound.''
   The 15-piece band isn't afraid to step into the classics, like
Faure's ``Pavanne'' or a flagwaving big-band arrangement of Copland
``Fanfare for the Common Man,'' played as the finale.
   Tiberi, two other tenor players and a baritone saxophonist
blended well on ``Four Brothers.'' The microphones weren't kind to
the band's playing of ``It Don't Mean a Thing if it Ain't Got That
Swing'' and ``Woodchopper's Ball.''
   Stoltzman also played a a medley arranged by band alumnus John
Otto which began with a solo ``Amazing Grace.'' Stoltzman played
that with exquisite, round tone and tenderness.
   After ``America the Beautiful,'' Stoltzman ended the medley
playing loose, inventive improvisations while the band came alive
and stomp-marched through ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
   Stoltzman also soloed on a Bernstein medley called ``Songs from
the West Side.''

   President Reagan went horseback
riding Sunday at his mountaintop ranch, relaxing after a weekend
summit in Mexico with President Miguel de la Madrid.
   After breakfast with his wife Nancy, Reagan saddled up for a
ride along the trails of his 688-acre spread in the Santa Ynez
mountains. Skies were clear and temperatures were warm, in the 70s.
   The Reagans, who left Washington on Friday, will remain at the
ranch until Wednesday when they return to the White House on the
eve of the unveiling of the budget proposal being sent to Congress
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   As Reagan relaxed, White House chief of staff Howard Baker flew
back to Washington, leaving deputy chief of staff Kenneth
Duberstein, national security adviser Colin Powell and
communications director Thomas Griscom as the senior officials with
Reagan.
   Powell and Griscom are to return to Washington on Tuesday, a day
ahead of the president. The staff members stay at a Santa Barbara
hotel, about 25 miles from Reagan's ranch.
   Reagan arrived here Saturday evening after spending about four
hours at a summit with de la Madrid at the Pacific coast resort of
Mazatlan.
   The annual meeting _ the sixth and final summit of the two
outgoing presidents _ was marked by de la Madrid's bluntly worded
defense of Mexico's campaign to curb the production and trafficking
of illegal drugs.
   De la Madrid said Mexico's efforts were not appreciated, and
that the United States must do more to curb the demand for drugs,
which is at the source of the problem.
   Reagan replied, ``The people in the United States are now
turning away from drugs,'' a step he said should ``curb the demand
that fuels the trafficking.''
   As Reagan flew to his ranch Saturday evening, senior
administration officials who accompanied him departed on their own,
flying back to Washington or other sites. Secretary of State George
P. Shultz, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter had
joined Reagan at the meeting.

   Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson called Sunday for shifting Social Security to a privately
based system over a 40-year period.
   He also accused Rep. Jack Kemp _ without naming him _ of
``demagoguing'' on Social Security.
   Interviewed on the CBS show ``Face the Nation,'' the former
television evangelist said, ``I am absolutely committed to
preserving the benefits of our elderly citizens. ... I don't want
to cut Social Security.''
   But Robertson said that for younger workers between ages 20 and
40 ``there isn't going to be any money. Social Security is going to
be broke by the year 2015.''
   To replace it, Robertson said he would allow people to ``take a
little bit of their Social Security and put it into an actuarially
sound, interest baring account, tax-free, like an IRA so that over
a period of time they can build up gradually so they own their
retirement.''
   Asked directly if he planned eventually to do away with the
current, government-based system, Robertson replied, ``Over 40
years, moving into a private system.''
   Would that require a reduction of benefits, he was asked.
   ``You don't ever reduce benefits,'' said Robertson.
   ``I've got one of my opponents right now in the Republican Party
who's demagoguing all four of us on Social Security,'' he said.
``I'm not going to be demagogue.''
   Robertson refused to identify the candidate but it was an
apparent reference to Kemp who has criticized the others in
advertising and debates on the Social Security issue.
   In contrast to Robertson, Kemp insists the system is sound.
   
   Robertson talked to a congregation at the Faith Christian Center
in Bedford, N.H., about his life and his campaign, both of which he
said had been guided by God's messages.
   He suggested to the congregation that he might win here _
contrary to the polls that show Vice President George Bush and
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole fighting for the lead in Tuesday's
primary.
   ``I want to have the satisfaction of seeing the television
anchormen's faces when they have to report that pat robertson won
New Hampshire,'' the former television evangelist said.
   Church ushers ordered reporters not to take tape recorders or
pen and paper into the service, checking them at the door to enfoce
the rule.
   Later in the day, he was asked on CBS News' ``Face the Nation''
if he would finish ahead of Bush, as he did in Iowa.
   ``Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing for the country?'' he said.
   In a two-page ad in the New Hamsphire section of the Boston
Globe, Robertson compared himself to John F. Kennedy, who faced
challenges in 1960 because he was a Roman Catholic.
   ``In 1960, the opposition said this candidate wasn't fit to be
president. Why? Because of his religion,'' said the ad under
Kennedy's picture.
   ``In 1988, the opoosition is saying the same thing about this
man,'' the ad said under Robertson's picture on the facing page,
adding Robertson ``faces the same kind of prejudice.''
   Robertson was asked about a recent interview in which he said
American blacks didn't understand what was happening in South
Africa.
   ``I think that apartheid is absolutely repugnant,'' said
Robertson, adding that advocates of economic sanctions against
South Africa ``are grandstanding, all they are doing is playing
American politics with foreign policy. ... They are grandstanding
to get votes in this country.''
   Robertson also said the Reagan administration hadn't gone far
enough to get the South African government to change its policies.
   ``He didn't try it as successfully as I think it could be
done,'' said Robertson. ``He (Reagan) called it constructive
engagement, I think we can go farther than that.
   But Robertson did not say what he would do differently.

   The meeting between President Reagan and
President Miguel de la Madrid showed that despite differences on
foreign policy, trade and narcotics trafficking, U.S.-Mexican
relations are improving.
   The new atmosphere is due in large part to what one U.S.
official called the ``excellent personal working relationship''
between the two leaders, who have met six times over the past five
years.
   ``On the basis of personal friendship ... we have reviewed
matters of interest ... overcoming delicate matters,'' de la Madrid
said in welcoming Reagan to this Pacific coastal resort Saturday.
   The two chief executives, accompanied by high-ranking officials
of their administrations, met for four hours Saturday to discuss
issues of common concern, including trade, narcotics trafficking
and Central American policy.
   It was the last officially scheduled meeting between the two
presidents. De la Madrid ends his six-year term on Nov. 30, and
Reagan leaves his post in January.
   Unlike some of his predecessors, de la Madrid has avoided open
confrontations with the U.S. government over foreign policy.
Instead, he tends to stress the positive.
   De la Madrid has been a tempering influence among Latin American
leaders under domestic pressure to declare moratoriums on their
enormous foreign debts, much of which is owed to American banks.
   In turn, the U.S. government has been instrumental in getting
U.S. banks to agree to refinance portions of Mexico's enormous
foreign debt of $105 billion, and to lend this country the money it
badly needs for development.
   Mexico has drawn praise from the United States for drastically
lowering its trade barriers and the United States has responded by
opening up the U.S. market to Mexican textiles, leather goods and
other products.
   De la Madrid has strongly pushed the market-opening moves as a
way to help modernize the sickly Mexican economy and pull it out of
its lengthy economic crisis.
   A perennial source of irritation had been the U.S. attitude that
Mexico was not doing its best in the fight against illegal drug
trafficking because of official corruption.
   But the Mexicans now have practically forced the United States
to admit that there is corruption on both sides of the Rio Grande
and that the drug fight must be a joint effort.
   Mexico is a large producer of marijuana and heroin for the U.S.
market and a relay point for South American cocaine.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz stressed the importance of
the anti-narcotics campaign, saying Colombia was an example of a
situation where drug traffickers can become a powerful and
disruptive factor in a society.
   Colombia's attorney general was assassinated recently by drug
dealers, responsible for the deaths of numerous judges and other
government officials.
   High-ranking Mexican officials have privately expressed the fear
that Mexico could become another Colombia.
   But Shultz and Attorney General Edwin Meese avoided any
references to official Mexican corruption, a charge often made in
the past by U.S. officials at lower levels.
   Mexico is waiting for the U.S. Congress to ratify the new Mutual
Legal Assistance Pact that would enable police agencies in both
countries to exchange information to track down drug criminals on
both sides of the border.
   Problems remain between the countries, but it is an indication
of the new relationship that the two neighbors can talk about them
without sounding like a debate.
   Reagan openly spoke of his support for the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, who are funded by the United States. That is a sore topic
for Mexico, which backs a political, not a military, solution to
the conflict in Nicaragua.
   De la Madrid also urged the United States to eliminate any
further barriers to exports from Mexico and said U.S. immigration
laws must take into account the rights of Mexican migrant workers.
   ``In the past five years, we have demonstrated that we can
cooperate to achieve creative, mutually beneficial solutions,''
Reagan told de la Madrid. ``This is a valuable legacy that we leave
to our successors.''

   Iran said Sunday its forces fired on U.S.
Navy helicopters flying ahead of a convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti
ships in the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon said it had no evidence
that the attack happened.
   An Iranian naval commander, speaking in an interview reported by
state-run Tehran radio, said the incident occurred Friday evening.
The attack would have happened about the same time an Iraqi
warplane fired two cruise missiles at Iran's Sirri island that came
within eight miles of the convoy.
   The commander, whose name was not given, said U.S.
reconnaissance helicopters were fired upon as they operated over
the islands of Sirri and neighboring Abu Musa and the oil platforms
of Salman and Nasr.
   Navy pool reporters who were with the convoy that night said
U.S. helicopters were aloft about the time that Iran said it fired
on the aircraft, and that the sound of anti-aircraft guns was
detected from Sirri after the Iraqi missile exploded there.
   But they also said that the exchanges happened within a span of
about 20 minutes and it was unclear whether the Iranians were
firing at the U.S. helicopters or in reaction to the Iraqi raid.
   The Iranian naval commander said Iranian troops fired warning
shots and issued radio warnings to the helicopters, then opened
direct fire after the warnings went unheeded, driving the U.S.
helicopters away.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Air Force Maj. Randall Morger, said Sunday
that U.S. officials had heard the reports, but ``at this point in
time we just have no reports to indicate that anything like that
occurred.''
   The convoy completed its journey Sunday when it arrived in
international waters off Kuwait, the U.S. Central Command in
Tampa., Fla., said in a statement.
   The convoy, escorted by the cruiser USS Chandler and the frigate
Reuben James, formed Thursday in the Gulf of Oman. The Navy began
escorting 11 U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July to protect them
from Iran, which considers Kuwait an ally of Iraq.
   It was the Chandler crew that reported that Iraqi missiles came
within eight miles of it on Friday.Although the convoy apparently
was not the intended target, the Chandler fired flares to warn the
Soviet-built Badger bomber to change course, after which one of the
projectiles passed close to the American ships, officers said.
   The disclosure that Iraq had used C-601 missiles, the air-fired
version of the Silkworms that Iran deploys on the ground, has led
gulf shipping executives to believe that that was the same type of
missile that struck the Danish supertanker Kate Maersk the night
before.
   The tanker was towed Sunday to a port outside the gulf. A Danish
seaman was killed in the attack and three others were wounded.
   During their 7-year-old gulf war, Iraq has attacked Iranian oil
tankers while Iran has retaliated by attacking neutral ships in the
gulf.

   A Tanzania Airways pilot tricked
four hijackers into believing he had flown them to Kenya, then
landed his plane at a Tanzanian airport where troops overpowered
and arrested the young men Sunday.
   Capt. Dominic Ngandile also managed to send a secret distress
signal to the Dar es Salaam airport, which turned off its terminal
and runway lights, making it look like a small Kenyan airport,
authorities said.
   After landing, the pilot stalled the assailants, telling them
they would have to wait until daylight to refuel the plane. Just
before dawn army troops stormed the plane and arrested the
hijackers.
   The hijackers stabbed Ngandile in the neck and hands after they
realized they had been tricked. His co-pilot, Christopher Mnika,
suffered cuts on his hands. The injuries were not serious, said
airline and security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Among the 70 passengers on the Saturday night flight were two
senior government officials _ Home Affairs Minister Muhidin Kimario
and Hamad Rashid Mohamed, deputy minister for finance, economic
affairs and planning. None of the passengers was hurt.
   Officials said the four hijackers arrested Sunday made no
political statements or claimed any affiliations and that their
only demand was to be flown to London.
   The Boeing 737 carried a crew of six on the internal flight
between Dar es Salaam, the capital, and Kilimanjaro, a northern
town near the Kenya border and the site of Mount Kilimanjaro,
Africa's highest mountain.
   Shihata, the government-owned news agency, said the four
hijackers were from Zanzibar, the semi-autonomous Indian Ocean
island nation that with the mainland forms the Republic of
Tanzania. It said they were aged between 17 and 20.
   ``The hijackers carried two toy guns, a knife and a fake
grenade,'' Shihata reported.
   The hijacking occurred at 9:17 p.m. Saturday, midway in the
50-minute flight.
   ``After takeoff, three youths stormed into the cockpit and
announced that the flight had been hijacked and that they were
going to London via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Egypt,''
government-owned Radio Tanzania reported.
   Ngandile told the hijackers that the plane did not have enough
fuel to reach Addis Ababa and suggested he refuel instead at a
small airport at Ludwar, Kenya, the sources said.
   The hijackers agreed.
   Instead of heading for Kenya, Ngandile flew the plane in a wide
arc and headed back to Dar es Salaam. After he sent the secret
distress signal, airport officials turned off some airport lights.
   The Boeing 737 landed about 10:30 p.m. and taxied to the old Dar
es Salaam terminal.
   After a wait of several hours, army troops stormed the plane and
arrested the hijackers.
   In 1984, four men claiming to be members of a group called the
People's Democratic Movement of Tanzania hijacked a Tanzania
Airways jet on an internal flight from Mwanza, a Lake Victoria
trading center in western Tanzania, to Dar es Salaam.
   The hijackers demanded the resignation of then President Julius
Nyerere, blaming his socialist policies for Tanzania's deplorable
economic condition.
   They forced the pilot to fly the plane to London, where the four
men surrendered peacefully. The Tanzanians were tried and convicted
and sentenced to prison terms in the United Kingdom.
   Nyerere retired from the presidency in 1985 but still holds the
most powerful political position in the East Africa country as
leader of the ruling party.

   This little town of 260 people will have a
community lunch complete with birthday cake, children's games and a
lengthy bingo session on Monday, Washington's Birthday.
   ``It's a big deal,'' said Winnie Davey, of the George Exxon
service station. ``The whole community is involved.''
   George, near the Columbia River in central Washington, was
apparently named after the first president, although some have
disputed that.
   Some assert the town was actually named after a dog belonging to
one of the founders.
   ``You shouldn't believe everything you hear,'' said Ms. Davey,
which may be a sad commentary on the birthday of a man who could
not tell a lie.
   But there is no doubt the town has taken much of its identity
from George Washington. Many of the streets are named after types
of cherries, including Royal Anne, Montmorency and Bing, said Ms.
Davey.
   Businesses have names like the Martha Inn, the Colonial Market
and the Cherry Tree.
   A highlight of Monday's activities at the community center will
be a large birthday cake created by Glenda Jenkins.
   The cake is in the shape of a mountain with George Washington's
face on it, said Ms. Jenkins, president of the organizing group
known as the Georgettes.
   ``The theme is George Washington's head on Mount Rushmore,'' she
said.
   The 18-square foot cake will be enough to feed 1,000 people, Ms.
Jenkins said.
   George actually throws a bigger celebration _ including a parade
_ during the Fourth of July, because the weather is better, said
Carol Michael, another organizer.
   At the Martha Inn restaurant, they'll be serving a noon special
of ham and cherry pie for $4.25 on Monday, said manager Carl
Keppner.
   The Exxon station will also have a special on pre-packaged
cherry pies, selling them two for 89 cents, said Ms. Davey.
   But it will just be business as usual at George Washington
Machinery.
   ``It's not a real big deal that I know of,'' said JoAnn
Lewandowski, a co-owner. ``I'm just going to work.''

   The street party named Carnival delighted
parade-goers Sunday but caused trouble for florists delivering
Valentine's Day bouquets.
   ``It hinders delivery and we can't make full service,'' said
Ronnie Scheinuk, vice president and general manager of a company
started by his grandfather. ``We're right on a parade route.''
   Three of the 11 parades scheduled Sunday in New Orleans and its
suburbs roll down St. Charles Avenue, right past the store.
Scheinuk said his shop would close several hours before the third,
a nighttime spectacular put on by the Krewe of Bacchus.
   ``It gets so crowded and hectic that our people would not be
able to get home,'' he said. ``We have to think of them.''
   Sunday's deliveries weren't as hard as those on Valentine's Day
1973, he said. That day, the sweethearts' holiday coincided with
Fat Tuesday.
   Scheinuk said a delivery crew of 10 was on the street at 6:30
a.m. Sunday and was finished by 11:30, a half-hour before the first
parade rolled in front of his store.
   However, there were compensations for being on a major parade
route. ``We've had tremendous walk-in business,'' Scheinuk said.

   Sequin- and feather-clad
Brazilians turned out in grand style Sunday in the second day of
Carnival revelries that featured the first of the top ``samba
school'' parades.
   In Rio de Janeiro, temperatures soared into the high eighties.
The skies were sunny, a marked contrast to weeks of almost constant
rain that left at least 205 dead and 13,000 homeless.
   Revelers sunbathed on packed beaches and summoned forces for yet
another all-night pre-Lenten blowout.
   Spirits appeared high, undaunted by the recent tragic flooding,
the 16 percent monthly inflation and the country's $113 billion
foreign debt.
   Sunday's festivities featured the ``samba schools,'' made up of
dancers from neighborhood organizations who compete for dancing
prizes.
   The dancers, mostly from poorer areas, don skimpy rhinestone
bikinis and elaborate feather headdresses and often dance for 16
hours at a stretch.
   Each year the ``schools'' spend millions of dollars on
extravagant floats and sumptuous costumes.
   This year many of the dances, performed before a crowd of
90,000, will poke fun at foreign debt worries, government
corruption and poverty and racism in Carnival's version of
street-side democracy.
   The current champion Mangueira planned to dance to the theme
``100 Years Since Slavery: Reality Or Illusion?'' Slavery was
abolished 100 years ago but racism still exists in Brazil.
   The Padre Miguel school said it would to poke fun at economic
worries and political chaos with the theme ``Kisses, Kisses, Bye
Bye Brazil.''
   The first eight schools were to samba from 8:30 p.m. Sunday
until about 10:00 a.m. Monday, with the second group parading
during the same hours from Monday to Tuesday.
   Tickets for the event went for as much as $1,000 a piece.
   Carnival revelers with less to spend were satisfied with the
all-night parties in exclusive nightclubs or out under the stars.
   One of these was the ``Great Gay Ball,'' where men dressed as
women frolicked to samba rhythms.
   Other open-air parties took place along sprawling beach-front
Atlantic Avenue and through ritzy Ipanema, where thumping samba
drums beat out rhythms as revelers in sequined costumes, tinsel
wigs, masks and outrageous outfits danced the hours away.
   Veja, the nation's largest circulation newsmagazine, reported
that for the first time in recent memory hotels and charter flights
were not full.
   AIDS and crime were blamed.
   Brazil is second only to the United States in the number of AIDS
cases, with an estimated 5,000. As of Jan. 4, the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta had received reports of 50,265 Americans
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome; 28,149 had died.
   Brazil averages 16 murders a day and 2,500 muggings and 1,300
rapes throughout the year. The United State government recently
threatened to class Brazil with El Salvador and Beirut for tourists
because of its crime problem.
   Despite the bad image, police said in the first two days of
Carnival festivities there were no festival-related deaths.
   Health officials have also distributed tens of thousands of
pamphlets warning against AIDS in three languages.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact.

<HEAD>Simon Shifts His Fire From Gephardt To Dukakis</HEAD>

   Sen. Paul Simon on Sunday turned his
fire away from Rep. Richard Gephardt and trained it on Gov. Michael
Dukakis, generally seen as the frontrunner in New Hampshire's
primary on Tuesday.
   Television ads that began airing Sunday show Simon describing
himself as a candidate with compassion for people and Dukakis as a
bureaucrat.
   ``Mike Dukakis has accused me of being an old-fashioned
Democrat,'' Simon says in the commercial. ``I plead guilty.
   ``It's not enough to have ambition, the fire in the belly to be
president. You should also have vision and substance and conviction
and the fire in the heart for working men and women and the less
fortunate,'' he said.
   Dukakis is expected to win the primary, with Simon and Gephardt
fighting it out for second place.
   ``I think it is increasingly clear that Paul Simon is now ahead
of Dick Gephardt,'' the Illinois senator told reporters while
campaigning in Manchester. ``It is clear from the momentum, the
phone calling we're making in New Hampshire.''
   Simon said polls have always underestimated his strength. ``It
was true four years ago when I ran for U.S. Senate. Not a single
published poll showed me a winner. It was true for Iowa last week.''
   Simon finished second, behind Gephardt and ahead of Dukakis, in
the Iowa caucuses last Monday. He needs a strong showing in the New
Hampshire primary to stay in tne race and to put him in a better
position to raise funds for his campaign which is a half million
dollars in debt.
   Simon said that making Dukakis the focus of his new ads had
nothing to do with Gephardt's criticism of his television campaign
against the Missouri congressman. In the earlier advertising blitz,
Simon had accused Gephardt of coming up with campaign themes that
ran counter to his voting record.
   After the news conference, Simon campaigned in the streets and
one of his stops was the Dukakis campaign headquarters, where he
greeted workers.
   He also made a stop at a florist's to buy Valentine's Day roses
for his wife, Jeanne, who was accompanying him.
   Earlier, at the Temple Israel, he telephoned Elena Keis-Kuna, a
Soviet refusenik who has been on a hunger strike for 12 days in
Leningrad.
   ``I just want to wish you the very best,'' Simon told Mrs.
Keis-Kuna, who has been trying to get visas to Israel for herself,
her husband and her son. ``We are grateful to you for your
courage.''

<HEAD>Cartoonist Aims This Week's Barbs At Albert Gore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Junior's
quest for the Democratic presidential nomination comes under the
scrutiny of ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau this week.
   Beginning with Monday's strip, Trudeau takes a week-long look at
Gore's childhood, his Tennessee political career and his bid for
the White House.
   Gore told the Tennessean, Nashville's morning newspaper, that he
was a big Trudeau fan.
   ``He's such a great artist and satirist,'' Gore said. ``I think
it's a lot of fun to be in the strip.''
   In the strip, Gore is called ``Albert, prince of the Tennessee
Valley.''
   Another presidential candidate, Vice President George Bush, has
been savaged by Trudeau in an off-again, on-again series. In the
strips, Bush is usually invisible.
   ``I don't think he sets out to be flattering,'' Gore said of
Trudeau. ``He tries to give people a good laugh and make them think
at the same time.''
   Gore reviewed the series before Saturday night's presidential
candidate debate in Manchester, N.H.
   ``I think I like the frame best when I'm saying what a thrill to
sit on the lap of Richard Nixon,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poll: Bush Retains Texas Lead, But Belief He Can Win Nomination
Waning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush retained strong
support in Texas but the perception he could win the Republican
presidential nomination has plummeted since the Iowa caucuses,
according to poll results published in the Houston Chronicle on
Sunday.
   The poll's aim was to gauge changing voter sentiments following
the Iowa caucuses.
   On the Democratic side, the newspaper reported that Richard
Gephardt surged to the front of the Democratic pack but pollsters
warned the Democratic race in Texas remained volatile.
   Of the 244 Republican voters who said they would probably vote
in the March 8 Texas primary, 51 percent said they felt Bush had
the best chance of winning the Republican presidential nomination.
In October's poll, 72 percent of likely voters said they believed
Bush had the best chance.
   In October, 8 percent of likely voters said Dole was the most
likely Republican nominee. That figure rose to 28 percent in the
most recent poll.
   Of the 304 Democrats who said they were likely to vote March 8,
27 percent said they would vote for Gephardt if the vote were now,
compared to 8 percent in October.
   The poll, also conducted for the Dallas Morning News, was from
surveys done Wednesday and Thursday. For the poll, interviewers
contacted 690 of 1,017 registered Texas voters first questioned in
October. According to the newspaper, the margin of error for the
poll was plus or minus 6 percent.

<HEAD>New Jersey County Clerks Worried About Overcrowded Ballots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey election officials hope
more presidential hopefuls will drop out before the state's
primary, or they will be forced to rent voting machines to
accommodate crowded ballots.
   Although it is likely that some candidates will fall before the
state's primary June 7, ``New Jersey clerks can't afford to sit
around and wait,'' said Atlantic County Clerk Lori Mooney.
   Monmouth County Clerk Jane Clayton is not so sure that the
presidential slate will get any smaller.
   ``It's so easy for them to get matching federal funds today that
they're just not as encouraged to drop out,'' she said.
   Fitting the entire slate of those seeking the Republican and
Democratic presidential nominations on the ballot _ plus
congressional, senate and convention delegate candidates _ will be
nearly impossible, most county clerks say.
   Many county clerks in New Jersey already have arranged to rent
machines from other states to give each party a machine of its own
at every polling site, Ms. Clayton said.
   ``That places on unconscionable burden on taxpayers,'' she said.

<HEAD>Three Democrats and Two Republicans Tied in Maryland Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maryland's Republican presidential primary
has become a tight two-man race between Vice President George Bush
and Sen. Bob Dole, while the Democratic contest is a three-way
virtual dead heat, according to a poll by the Baltimore Sun.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who was far behind in a
January survey of Marylanders, has surged into contention after his
victory Monday in the Iowa caucuses. He now holds a slim lead over
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Jesse L. Jackson.
   The Sun Poll published in Sunday's editions gave Gephardt a lead
of only 2 percentage points _ 22 percent to 20 percent over
Dukakis. Jackson was supported by 19 percent of those in The Sun's
sample.
   The three Democrats fell within the margin of sampling error for
the poll, meaning none was the clear leader. The margin is plus or
minus 3.6 percent.
   ``Iowa solidified my conviction that Gephardt has viability,''
said William Newman, a 61-year-old insurance broker from Rockville.
Newman said he liked Gephardt's honesty and his call for open
markets overseas for U.S. goods, but he admitted to a deep
skepticism about all the candidates, including his favorite.
   Dole had 39 percent to Bush's 37 percent among the 753
registered Republicans surveyed, within the poll's margin of error.
The leaders are neck and neck in the Republican race, but they are
far ahead of the other contenders, including Pat Robertson, who ran
second in Iowa. Robertson was favored by 7 percent of those
responding to the Sun Poll.
   Trailing the leaders in the Republican primary, Rep. Jack F.
Kemp of New York had 3 percent; former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont
had 2 percent; and Alexander M. Haig Jr., who withdrew from the
race Friday, had 1 percent.
   The remaining 11 percent were undecided, supported no one or
favored a candidate not on the ballot.
   In the Democratic race, former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 9
percent; Illinois Sen. Paul Simon had 8 percent; Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. had 4 percent; former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, 2
percent; and Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., 1 percent. Of the respondents,
15 percent said they were undecided, supported no one or favored a
candidate not listed on the ballot.
   KPC Research of Charlotte, N.C., interviewed 768 registered
Democrats and 753 registered Republicans statewide by telephone for
the Sun Poll.

<HEAD>Gephardt Says Claims He Supported Reaganomics `Balderdash'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Richard Gephardt on Sunday dismissed
as ``balderdash'' rivals' charges he was a supporter of President
Reagan's tax and economics program.
   Two days before the New Hampshire primary, the Missouri
congressmen paused for a Valentine's Day lobster-and-chowder lunch
with his wife Jane at a bayside seafood house, then greeted
hundreds of shoppers at a nearby mall.
   But as he met lunchtime diners he was confronted by one man's
question about his changes of position, and he defended himself
anew against similar charges as he spoke to reporters.
   Paul Simon's charged in the Democrats' televised debate Saturday
night that Gephardt had changed positions to suit the electorate he
next faced _ talking against ``Reaganomics'' in Iowa and in favor
of it in this traditionally anti-tax state.
   ``That's just balderdash,'' he said. ``I have been the leader
against Reaganomics in the House,'' he said.
   Gephardt defended his vote for Reagan's 1981 tax-cut bill as
cast only after the Democrats' alternative was defeated _ and
saying he differed with his rivals on the need for lowering taxes
on middle-income people.
   ``Once we lost, the question was clear _ were we for a tax cut
for the middle class, or were we not,'' Gephardt said.
   ``When we get to the South and the general election, we can't be
the party of higher taxes on the middle class,'' Gephardt said.
   Gephardt focused mainly on taxes and lashed back at Simon,
saying: ``Senator Simon's record is clear _ he's resisted every
measure to reduce the taxes on individual American families that's
come along.''
   Gephardt, who edged Simon in last week's Iowa caucuses, is
locked in what could be a political death-struggle with Simon for
second place behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in New
Hampshire's Tuesday primary. Heavily in debt, Gephardt's campaign
badly needs to finish no lower than second.
   He has been under attack from Simon's television commercials and
from the public comments of most of his rivals _ who say Gephardt
has flip-flopped on issues.
   Speaking to reporters, Gephardt maintained anew that Simon's
aids and rhetoric ``falsely accused me.''
   Gephardt denounced Simon's lonely vote against the 1986 tax
overhaul bill reflected ``total ignorance of what the bill was
about.'' Gephardt also sought to lump Dukakis with Simon on taxes,
saying, ``He doesn't want to tell you what he's for on taxes.''
   As he worked his way through the 300 or so people at Newick's
Lobster House overlooking Great Bay, Gephardt ran into a questioner
who wanted to know why he had changed his position to oppose the MX
missile.
   ``I watched the debate last night _ I thought they'd kind of
nailed him on that,'' said the man, Jack Overall of Los Angeles,
Calif., who said he came to visit friends in New Hampshire this
week to watch the presidential campaigners.
   Overall said Gephardt stopped and told him he'd changed
positions in an effort to reach a bipartisan position in the
Congress that would be supportive of arms control negotiations.
   ``I accept that,'' Overall said.
   Gephardt's appearance didn't create much of a stir, except for
the disorder caused by the news media crush, at the restaurant. It
is a traditional stop for New Hampshire presidential campaigners.
   ``It's a little slow _ we're ususally full for lunch,'' said
waitress Susan Miltner. ``We're not making any money either.''

   New Jersey election officials are
hoping, for strictly nonpartisan reasons, that some of the 12
remaining presidential candidates will drop out before the state's
June primary.
   Many voting machines have room for only eight candidates on a
line, and as of Sunday, five Republicans and seven Democrats were
seeking their parties' presidential nomination.
   Things looked up on Friday, when former Secretary of State
Alexander M. Haig Jr. dropped out of the GOP race. And other
candidates may drop out after Tuesday's New Hampshire primary or
after March 8, when voters will choose candidates in 20 states in
the South and elsewhere.
   However, with the Garden State primary scheduled for June 7,
``New Jersey clerks can't afford to sit around and wait,'' said
Atlantic County Clerk Lori Mooney.
   When one machine is used at a polling site, a lever is used to
set it for one party or the other, depending on the voter's
registration. But many county clerks have already arranged to rent
machines from other states to give each party its own machine.
   In addition to the presidential candidates, New Jersey officials
must find space on their ballots for candidates in congressional
primaries, the Democratic nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and
candidates for delegates to the two major parties' national
conventions.
   Fewer presidential candidates would make life easier for
elections officials, but Monmouth County Clerk Jane Clayton said
she's not so sure that the slate will get smaller.
   ``It's so easy for them to get matching federal funds today that
they're just not as encouraged to drop out,'' she said.
   ``We've been through this problem since 1976, and it's getting
worse every four years,'' said Union County Clerk Walter G. Halpin.
   Many other states do not have to worry about overcrowded ballots
because their local and state elections are held later in the year
or even in non-presidential years.
   ``That really eases the pressure on our ballot,'' said Ron
Michaelson, director of the Ohio State Board of Elections.
   In California, ballots were crowded in 1984 with long lists of
delegates for the Democratic National Convention. This year, voters
will vote directly for presidential candidates, and the number of
delegates will be allocated in proportion to the popular vote.
   ``We have only 10 columns on our machines,'' Ms. Clayton said.
``There's no way I could make up a ballot for both parties to go
into one machine.''
   Even Atlantic County, which has new computerized voting
machines, may be forced to look as far as Louisiana or Tennessee to
rent additional equipment.
   ``Ordinarily, we can play with our ballot across the whole
spectrum, while other machines are usually confined by rows or
columns,'' Ms. Mooney said. ``But we have burned the midnight oil
trying to compose the current ballot in a way that fits.''
   Additional voting machines may cost as much as $700 each in
rental, transportation and storage fees, she said.
   Halpin said he warned the secretary of state's office last
summer about the voting machine problem.
   It will cost Union County $378,000 to rent extra voting
machines, he estimated, ``and I would have extra costs involved _
more tabulating, more paper, more sample ballots.''
   Clerks in several New Jersey counties are not worried about the
upcoming primary, however, because they use voting machines that
take computer cards.
   ``Each voter gets a ballot card that they slide into the
machine,'' said Sussex County Clerk Helen ``Honey'' Ackerman.
``They use a stylus in the confines of the voting booth to punch
out various numbers that denote the candidates.''
   The director of the state election division, Christine St. John,
has warned county clerks to make preliminary arrangements to rent
extra machines.
   But after Tuesday's primary and the many ``Super Tuesday''
contests held March 8, ``I think you'll see some candidates drop
out,'' she said.
   ``There's usually a lot of nervousness among county clerks at
this point. It will phase out.''

   Military police detained two soldiers Sunday
after allegations that troops using a bulldozer buried alive four
Arabs after an anti-Israeli protest earlier this month, the army
said.
   Further detentions are expected in the case, said an army
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the detainees
are being questioned, but that no charges have been filed. He
declined to give further details.
   In Gaza City, army officials said three Arabs were injured when
a firebomb they were preparing exploded. They refused to provide
further details. Gaza residents reported hearing a loud explosion
at about 7 p.m.
   It was the second such incident in two days. On Saturday, two
Gaza City residents were injured while preparing a homemade bomb.
   In the Golan Heights, hundreds of Druse pelted police with
stones and sang patriotic songs to protest Israel's annexation of
the area six years ago. Some demonstrators chanted ``with blood and
fire we will liberate the Golan.''
   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, Israel television
said. The report said more than two dozen Druse were arrested, 32
injured by rubber bullets and scores overcome by tear gas. Five
police officers were hurt after being struck by stones and several
others also were overcome by the gas, the report said.
   Elsewhere, scattered Palestinian protests were reported Sunday
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories captured from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. In Gaza, assailants torched
an Israeli bus, and in Jerusalem nine cars were set ablaze.
   The two soldiers were detained after news reports said troops
used a a bulldozer to bury alive four Arabs Feb. 5 in the West Bank
village of Kfar Salem after violent anti-Israeli protests there.
   An army official confirmed that soldiers ``misbehaved'' during
an incident at the village, but refused further comment until the
investigation is completed.
   An Israeli reporter who visited Kfar Salem on Sunday quoted
residents as saying about 20 soldiers grabbed four men in their
early 20s, ordered them to remove roadblocks, then beat them and
forced them to lie on the ground.
   A bulldozer pulled up and covered the men with dirt, said the
reporter of the daily Yediot Ahronot, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted villagers as saying the men
were unconscious when they were dug out. The Yediot reporter said
three of the men were treated and released from a Jericho hospital
while the fourth was hospitalized for eight days.
   The Jerusalem Post quoted one of the men, Abdel Latif Shtiya, as
saying his shoes remained buried in the dirt.
   The army said it was checking reports of a similar incident near
the Shati refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. But a spokesman said he
had no further details Sunday.
   The army said a woman from the West Bank refugee camp of Arrub
who died during anti-Israeli protests Feb. 6 was killed by bullets
fired from a Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifle. The army said
Israeli soldiers don't carry such weapons.
   Hundreds of Druse youths, demonstrating to mark the sixth
anniversary of Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, threw
stones at police in the village of Majdal Shams.
   About 1,000 riot police were deployed in Druse villages to quell
the protests.
   Army radio said several youths were hurt after police moved in
despite pleas from local leaders for security forces to stay clear.
   ``People started to sing nationalistic songs and to show
identification with our country, Syria, and against the
occupation,'' Kansh Abu Sallah, a village leader, told the radio.
``Then the police began to interfere, so it started to roll until
it led to tear gas.''
   Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 war
and officially annexed the territory on Feb. 14, 1982. The Druse,
members of a mystical sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam,
have marked each anniversary with demonstrations.
   A general strike continued Sunday throughout the Gaza Strip,
where an Israeli civilian bus was burned by Palestinian youths. In
Jerusalem, police spokesman Rafi Levy said nine cars were set
ablaze in the Jewish French Hill neighborhood of the city.
   In the Shufat refugee camp in Jerusalem, about 60 rock-hurling
Arabs staged demonstrations. Police fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse the crowd.
   According to the United Nations, 54 Arabs have died in the
disturbances that began Dec. 8.

   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., plans to work
Presidents' Day as he continues a tradition of reading George
Washington's farewell address, but his colleagues and most of the
country will be observing the holiday.
   Presidents' Day, which celebrates Washington's birthday on Feb.
22 and Abraham Lincoln's birthday on Feb. 12, is a national holiday
with most federal, state and local offices closed.
   There will be no regular mail pickup or delivery, except for
express mail and special delivery service. The nation's stock and
commodity markets and many banks and businesses also will be closed.
   Congress has been on an extended, two-week vacation in
observance of the holiday. The next session of Congress officially
begins at noon Monday when Sanford reads the address.
   Other senators have been asked to attend the reading, but in
what has become another tradition, the speech is annually made to
an empty chamber.

<HEAD>Black Activist Virgil Hawkins Dies After Long Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEESBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black activist Virgil Hawkins, who waged a
28-year battle to practice law in Florida and helped break the
color barrier at the University of Florida Law School, died after a
lengthy illness. He was 81.
   Hawkins had been in poor health for several months. He died
Thursday at Munroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala after suffering
acute kidney failure, his wife, Ida, said Saturday.
   Hawkins, who was born in Okahumpka, near Leesburg, taught school
and was a principal in Lake County schools in the 1940s after
graduating from Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach.
   In 1949, at the age of 41, he applied for admission to the
all-white law school at the University of Florida in Gainesville
and was rejected because he was black.
   Hawkins challenged the state's segregated school system and in
1956 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he should be admitted to the
school.
   But the Florida Supreme Court invoked states' rights to deny him
admission and the state's Board of Control then adopted rigid
entrance requirements that made it impossible for Hawkins to enroll
even if he won court approval.
   In 1976 the Florida Bar urged the state Supreme Court to allow
Hawkins to take the state bar examination even though he had
attended an unaccredited law school in Massachusetts 20 years
earlier. The Bar said he should be given special consideration
because of his ill treatment while trying to enter law school in
1949.
   In November 1976, the Florida Supreme Court ruled 7-0 that
Hawkins should be allowed to practice law and waived a requirement
that he first take the bar exam.
   After a 28-year fight, Hawkins opened his law practice in a tiny
office off Main Street in downtown Leesburg.
   But at the age of 77 he found himself before the state Supreme
Court again in November 1983 because of complaints about his legal
competence and allegations that he misappropriated $15,000
entrusted to him by a client.
   In January 1984, the Florida Supreme Court censured Hawkins and
placed him on probation for two years because of errors he made in
his first cases.
   Hawkins, facing two additional complaints, was allowed to resign
from the Florida Bar in April 1985.

<TEXT>
   Three PLO members were killed Sunday
when a bomb ripped through the car they were driving to lunch,
authorities said.
   The wife of one of the three men saw the blast as she stood on a
nearby balcony, cradling a baby, said state-run Cyprus radio.
   Police in this southern port city said the bomb went off around
noon, killing the three instantly and destroying the automobile.
   The official Cyprus News Agency said it received an anonymous
phone call from a man who said the killing was carried out by the
Group of Martyrs of Lt. Col. Rassem el-Ghoul. Officials said they
had never heard of the group.
   The caller, speaking in broken English, accused the slain
Palestinians of having been involved in the fatal shooting of
el-Ghoul, a top commando in Force 17.
   Force 17 is the elite security apparatus of Fatah, PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's guerrilla faction. PLO officials had said the three
killed in the blast were officers in Fatah. There was no immediate
PLO comment on the claim of responsibility.
   El-Ghoul, the Force 17 area commander in Sidon, southern
Lebanon, was kidnapped in August last year. His body was found two
days later, but the motive for the slaying was never established.
   An Associated Press photographer who visited the scene of the
blast said the car's roof was blown off, the vehicle was wrecked
and two of the bodies were blown 60 feet from the car.
   In Athens, Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman Bassam
Abu Sharif, accused Israel of being behind the slayings.
   Sharif linked the deaths to Israeli attempts to stop a ship
filled with 133 Palestinian deportees from sailing from Greece to
Israel.
   ``Israel started this open war after losing the secret war
concerning the ship,'' he said. The PLO has accused Israel of
waging a ``secret war'' to prevent the voyage. It now says the
vessel will sail on Monday.
   There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials.
   In a later news conference, Abu Sharif backed off from his
earlier claim that the attack was linked to Israeli frustration
over failing to stop the boat. But he called it ``clear proof''
that the Israelis ``continue their terrorism not only against our
population in the West Bank and Gaza, but also elsewhere.''
   He was referring to more than two months of violence that has
rocked the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The director of the PLO office in Nicosia, Samir Abu Ghazale,
identified the victims as Mohammed Sultan; Mohammed Buheis, also
known as Abu Hassan Kassem; and Marwan Kayyali.
   Kayyali was also a member of the PLO's military council. Sultan
was in his early 40s, the other two in their late 20s.
   Ghazale said Sultan had Lebanese nationality, Buheis traveled
under another name with a North Yemeni passport and Kayyali had a
Moroccan passport. He did not have details of the men's precise
functions in the PLO.
   Police said they did not believe that the blast was not
connected with presidential elections being held in the Greek
Cypriot sector of this Mediterranean island on Sunday.
   Police said the explosion did not disrupt the voting in
Limassol, the island's second largest city with a population of
121,000.
   Ghazale said the three were on their way to lunch when the bomb
exploded. Eyewitnesses gave a similar account.
   That differed from the original police account, which said the
car apparently was parked at the time of the blast. The
discrepancies could not immediately be reconciled.
   A sizable number of Arabs, mainly Lebanese and Palestinians,
live in Limassol.
   The PLO is an umbrella organization for eight guerrilla factions
who are the Palestinians' military arm. The main group is Arafat's
Fatah, which has an estimated 8,000 guerrillas, most of them in
Lebanon.

<HEAD>Chancellor Says He May Resign Over Waldheim Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said
Sunday he would consider resigning if the controversy over
President Kurt Waldheim's World War II conduct continues to hamper
Vranitzky's leadership.
   About 5,000 people, including actor Klaus Maria Brandauer,
gathered in central Vienna outside the landmark St. Stephen's
Cathedral to call for Waldheim's ouster.
   About half of them marched to the Hofburg Palace, which
accommodates the president's office, and chanted, ``Waldheim must
go!''
   In an hour-long television interview, Vranitzky, who heads a
coalition government, launched a sharp attack on Waldheim, whose
duties as head of state are mostly ceremonial.
   The president ``did not deal exactly with the truth'' during the
investigation into his activities as a soldier in the Nazi army,
Vranitzky said. He stopped short, however, of urging Waldheim to
step down.
   Veteran political observers did not recall a similar public
confrontation between a chancellor and a president since the second
Austrian republic was established after World War II.
   The Vienna government appointed a historians' commission to
investigate Waldheim's wartime record last year after the U.S.
government put the former U.N. secretary general on a ``watchlist''
of undesirable aliens. U.S. officials said Waldheim was a
lieutenant in a German unit that sent thousands of Jews to Nazi
death camps.
   The historians released their report Monday.
   The 202-page document established Waldheim's ``close proximity''
to wartime atrocities in the Balkans and seriously questioned his
integrity as a German army officer.
   The tabloid Kurier published on Sunday an interview in which
Waldheim said he has no plans to resign because he enjoys the
support of a ``great'' and ``silent'' majority.
   ``I feel the group who makes the demand that I should resign is
relatively small compared to those who want me to stay in office,''
the president was quoted as saying.
   In a comment published in early Monday editions of the Kurier,
Waldheim was quoted as saying he continues to be ``interested in a
constructive relationship with the federal chancellor.''
   But Vranitzky, when asked how Austria could emerge from a
situation in which the country faces a bad image abroad and
division at home, said: ``We must try to get out of this situation
by not satisfying ourselves with allowing the president not to face
up to these things.''
   Vranitzky said it was not enough for the president to give
newspaper interviews because ``interviews don't replace the
question-and-answer game in a democracy.''
   He warned that if his expectations about the president's conduct
are not fulfilled and if a high percentage of his time continues to
be absorbed by the Waldheim affair, ``then the question arises if I
can ... carry on this (government post).''
   The Socialists are the senior partner in the coalition with the
conservative Austrian People's Party, which backed Waldheim when he
won his six-year term in 1986.
   Heinrich Keller, a chief Socialist secretary, reported Saturday
that for the first time a majority of party members now want
Waldheim to resign.
   Also on Saturday, Vranitzky told Austrian radio that mere
non-involvement in war crimes did not qualify one to be Austria's
president.
   Vranitzky continued his criticism Sunday by seriously
questioning Waldheim's ability to perform his duties.
   ``The federal president must be an integration figure, not a
disintegration figure,'' he said.
   Vranitzky also criticized Waldheim and his advisers for trying
to portray the attacks on the president as something orchestrated
by Jews and foreigners.
   On Friday, former Foreign Minister Karl Gruber stirred outrage
by claiming that members of the commission were Waldheim's enemies
because they were either socialists or Jews.
   Meanwhile, the Swiss military historian who led the historians'
commission said Sunday he sensed that the Austrian president felt a
``certain moral culpability'' for war crimes committed while he
served in the German army.
   Hans Rudolf Kurz, in an interview on Swiss radio, said he asked
Waldheim why two biographies do not mention his wartime past.
   Waldheim replied, ``I did much more important things,'' Kurz
said.
   ``But the better response would have been: `I was hesitant to
talk about it.','' he said in the French-language interview. ``I am
not saying he is guilty of war crimes. But he feels a certain moral
culpability. It disturbs him.''

<HEAD>Kemp Accuses Dole Of Having Secret Tax-Increase Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY MITMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp on Sunday said he was convinced
that Republican presidential rival Bob Dole ``has a secret plan to
raise taxes,'' using a blue-ribbon study commission as the vehicle.
Dole said it wasn't true.
   Kemp, whose third place showing in polls has been threatened by
Pat Robertson, insisted he will beat the former TV evangelist in
Tuesday's primary because ``the people of New Hampshire want a
conservative who can reach out beyond just one segment of the
population and win.
   ``Electability is going to be an issue,'' he said.
   With the campaign heating up over the weekend, Kemp raised the
tax issue that is dear to the hearts of Granite State voters who
often hear candidates take a no-increase pledge.
   The New York congressman said having a bipartisan, blue-ribbon
commission recommend how to balance the budget was first suggested
by Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York but the idea went
nowhere until Dole _ the Senate Republican leader _ ``slipped it
into'' recent legislation.
   ``I am convinced that Senator Dole has a secret plan to raise
taxes on the American people,'' Kemp said. ``That would totally
frustrate the Republican message that we are the low-tax party.''
   Kemp said Dole ``is going to allow the commission to do a study,
endorse it, and say, `Hey, this is not my tax increase. This is the
commission's tax increase.' That's what he did on the Social
Security Commission.''
   Dole, speaking on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
said he doesn't want ``our six (Republican members of the
commission) going in there with any thought of raising taxes ...
   ``We just had tax reform. We took a lot of things away from a
lot of people. My view is we ought to give the American people a
rest from increased taxes.''
   Dole said he already has chosen one commission member, Sen. Pete
Domenici.
   Asked why he waited until two days before New Hampshire's
primary to raise the issue, Kemp said the campaign is only now
turning to issues.
   Speaking at a school later, Kemp said he would ask former U.N.
Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick to be his secretary of state if he is
elected president.

<HEAD>More Cold, Wind And Snow Across Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front sent temperatures plunging across the Plains on
Sunday and generated strong wind that whipped up blinding snow,
causing traffic accidents and closing highways.
   Temperatures had been very mild Saturday with readings in the
50s, 60s and 70s across the central and southern Plains. But the
cold front dropped temperatures into the single digits and teens
across the northern Plains. And the high wind produced wind chills
colder than 20 degrees below zero.
   Blizzard warnings were posted across extreme eastern North
Dakota, northeastern South Dakota and northwestern Minnesota while
snow fell with northerly wind blowing at 30 to 45 mph. In western
South Dakota, Rapid City reported wind gusting to above 55 mph.
   Wind-blown snow reduced visibility to zero at times in
northwestern and western Minnesota.
   ``We've got all kinds of accidents. ... It's a mess,'' said
Renard Fritz, Minnesota State Patrol dispatcher in Detroit Lakes.
``I've got all my troopers available out in the area. We're
swamped.''
   The patrol closed Interstate 94 and Minnesota 210 at Fergus
Falls and U.S. 10 from Detroit lakes to Moorhead, Fritz said.
Earlier, Minnesota 200 at Ada was closed.
   North Dakota authorities blocked off I-94 at Fargo for a time
and no travel was advised for all of I-29 during the afternoon.
   Blustery wind also blew across much of Nebraska into Kansas and
the Texas Panhandle, hitting 60 mph at Sidney, Neb.; and 59 mph at
Scottsbluff, Neb., Goodland, Kan., and Akron, Colo.
   When the wind shifted to the northwest in downtown Kansas City
the temperature dropped 13 degrees within an hour from 47 degrees
to 34.
   Showers were reported across western Missouri, but when the cold
air struck the region the rain changed to snow across eastern and
parts of central Kansas.
   Wind gusting to 25 to 40 mph east of Laramie, Wyo., producing
blowing snow that reduced visibility to less then 500 feet at times.
   Elsewhere, snow showers were scattered across upstate New York
near Lake Ontario.
   Showers were scattered across western parts of Washington state,
where Quillayute totaled 1.40 inches of rain in 24 hours. A snow
advisory was issued for the Washington Cascades and Olympia
Mountains where up to 8 inches of snow was expected overnight.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms developed across eastern Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., to 78 at Fort Myers, Fla. The low for
the day was 9 degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered snow was forecast from Michigan and much
of Illinois and Indiana into the northern half of New England.
Freezing rain or snow was forecast to change to rain from northern
New York state across southern Vermont into the southern half of
Maine. Showers were forecast from the Ohio Valley and southern New
England through the mid-Atlantic states, the Tennessee Valley and
the Carolinas into the central Gulf Coast and northern Florida.
Scattered thunderstorms were forecast across the central Gulf Coast
into Georgia and northern Florida. Scattered showers were forecast
across the Pacific Northwest with snow showers across northwestern
Montana.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were predicted from the eastern
Dakotas across the upper half of the Mississippi Valley and the
upper Great Lakes into western parts of the lower Ohio Valley; in
the 50s and 60s from Oregon and the central Pacific Coast through
the southern Rockies, the High Plains of Colorado, the southern
Plains and Texas, the central Gulf of Mexico coast, the central and
southern Appalachians into Virginia and the Carolinas; in the 70s
from southern California into the desert Southwest and across much
of Florida; and in the 30s or 40s across much of the rest of the
nation.

<BYLINE>Seventeen Killed Clashes Between Troops and Rebels In Sri Lanka
^By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian troops killed 12 Tamil rebels
in eastern Sri Lanka Sunday, residents said. Military officials
said the unconfirmed report came hours after five soldiers died
when a land mine exploded.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
blast occurred in eastern Batticaloa district, where Indian troops
have conducted search operations since Thursday.
   Batticaloa residents, contacted by telephone, said the slayings
of Tamils were ``in reprisal'' for the land mine explosion.
   The residents, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they heard two blasts near Eravur village, nine miles north of
Batticaloa, followed by gunfire.
   A spokeswoman at the Indian High Commission, or embassy, said
she had no reports of any casualties in the area, about 140 miles
northeast of the Sri Lanka capital of Colombo.
   More than 15,000 of the 42,000 Indian soldiers in Sri Lanka are
involved in operations against the Tamil insurgents in Batticaloa
district.
   India, where 60 million Tamils live, sent troops to Sri Lanka
under a peace accord aimed at ending the four-year guerrilla war
waged by Tamil rebels for a separate homeland.
   The rebels briefly accepted the July 29 accord but broke the
truce last fall. More than 370 Indian soldiers and 1,100 rebels
have been killed in fighting since then.
   The mainly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. They claim they are discriminated against by the
Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and
control the government and the army.

<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cereal factory worker David Rouch
says he's suffered years of gossip, malicious pranks and the cold
shoulder because of a local newspaper's report of what turned out
to be a unjustified arrest.
   He sued the police departments that took him into custody and
settled out of court for $4,000 plus attorney fees. But he also
contends the Battle Creek Enquirer should pay.
   Rouch is seeking $1 million in a suit that has triggered a major
upheaval in Michigan libel law.
   He presented his side of the case to a jury last week and the
newspaper gives its side this week.
   The case has given Michigan a new standard for determining when
private citizens can sue over news reports on items of public
interest, because the state Supreme Court decided that Rouch's case
should be heard by a jury.
   The court ruled that the fact that the newspaper didn't print
false information knowingly or with reckless disregard for the
truth was not enough to clear it of liability.
   The state's highest court said the right to report on official
proceedings doesn't extend to arrests that fail to result in formal
charges, and that the decision of whether damages are owed should
be based on evidence of negligence, rather than malice, which is
more difficult to prove.
   The Enquirer is refraining from out-of-court comment on the
case. But a year ago, after the state Supreme Court acted,
newspaper attorney Alice Neff Lucan suggested all Michigan
newspapers could have a more difficult time monitoring police
activities.
   ``The power of arrest is the most serious power the government
has over us,'' she said. ``If we are not able to cover that, it
raises all kinds of ugly specters about what the police can do
without it appearing in the newspapers.''
   Rouch's attorney, John Jereck, rejects that reasoning. He
maintains that the newspaper could have reported on the attack of a
sleeping baby sitter without printing the name of the man taken
into custody.
   He also faults the newspaper for failing to follow up and write
about the dropping of preliminary charges against Rouch and the
arrest of a second suspect. The charges cited at the time of his
arrest were never brought formally because the case was dropped
before Rouch was arraigned.
   ``They don't practice what they preach,'' Jereck said. ``Isn't
the public interested in knowing when the police make a bad arrest?
That wasn't reported.''
   Because of the appeals and high court deliberations, more than
eight years have passed since the newspaper published what seemed
to be a routine, six-paragraph account of the arrest of a man
suspected of raping a teen-ager who was caring for his ex-wife's
children.
   Rouch was booked, fingerprinted, read his rights. He got out of
jail on a personal recognizance bond and was told when to show up
for arraignment.
   But the prosecutor's office opted not to press charges, and
because his name was in the newspaper, Rouch contends he's been
branded a rapist.
   Now the jury must determine whether the newspaper story was
false and whether it was published without reasonable care.
   Rouch's attorney tried to convince the jury that the story
falsely accused him of raping a 17-year-old baby sitter.
   The newspaper, in presenting its side, will try to convince the
jury that the 1979 article didn't accuse Rouch of committing a
crime, but merely reported accurately an arrest as reported by
police.
   Witnesses testifying in Rouch's behalf said they had presumed
him guilty because they saw his name in print.
   One woman told the jury she refused to let her daughter join
friends at the Rouch home. ``I connected him with the rape of a
teen-age girl,'' Sonya Weiss testified.
   A former classmate testified he was startled to see Rouch
walking the streets and said he had assumed he was behind bars.
   That classmate never saw the story, printed nearly a year after
the arrest, saying Rouch had been cleared and another man arrested
in the case. That article was published after a Rouch's attorney
threatened legal action.
   ``They thought I was a rapist,'' Rouch testified, adding that he
lost sleep and became more reclusive.
   ``I more or less just stayed home,'' he testified. ``I thought
it was best for the children. I drank more for a while than I
normally did.''
   A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Washington and Lee
University professor Clark Mollenhoff, criticized the newsgathering
practices of the newspaper's police beat reporter. He said the
newspaper should have waited two or three days before printing the
story.
   The newspaper will have its own expert witnesses this week:
Louisiana State University Professor William Giles and former
University of Missouri at Columbia journalism school dean Roy
Fisher.

   A high school teacher in suburban Chicago
has devised a computer service that produces a teen-ager's 10 most
compatible classmates when they punch in answers to 33 questions.
   But Sandra Pryz says she does not guarantee fireworks and
candlelight.
   ``It's just an icebreaker, an excuse to talk to someone. They're
at an age when they're not sure of themselves,'' said Pryz, who
teaches at Willowbrook High School in Villa Park and lives in
nearby Elmhurst.
   Thousands of questionnaires are processed each year, she added,
especially at this time of year.
   ``We kind of go crazy right around Valentine's Day,'' she said.
   The matchups produce some interesting reactions, according to
students.
   ``My No. 1 was like a nerd,'' said Kristin Liszkowski, a senior
at Willowbrook.
   ``He's a real brain, and I'm more the average `Joe Schmo.' I
would never go for him, but it made me feel good that I was matched
up with interesting kinds of people,'' she said.
   Julie Synovic, senior class president at Zion-Benton High
School, said she didn't know her top match and was not particularly
interested once she found out more about him.
   ``But it was a good topic of conversation,'' she said, ``Like,
`You're on my list _ oh, wow, we must have something in common.'''
   Pryz and her partner, Dan Burgess, started Computer Daze five
years ago as a way for schools to raise money. They charge 60 cents
per list. Schools charge students about $2 for the rankings and
keep the profit, Pryz said.
   The forms students fill out include questions like: What is the
worst thing a teacher can do? What would you do if you found $100?
What absolutely turns you off? And how do you feel when a teacher
criticizes you in class?
   The questions have no double meaning, Pryz said. ``Some kids
have asked us to put in `What will and won't you do on the first
date? First base? Second base?' But we won't do that.''
   Pryz said computer dating has none of the stigma in high schools
that it sometimes has with adults.
   ``The kids scream and shriek when they open the letters,'' said
Pryz.
   She offers the service on a nationwide basis, too, she said.
   ``It's a big thing for a few weeks,'' said Synovic, who has
participated in the computer matching program for the last four
years.
   ``We joke about it,'' said Wayne Harrison, a junior at
Zion-Benton. ``I never do anything with my list. I don't even know
my No. 1 girl, but the whole thing does give you something to talk
about during lunch.''

<HEAD>New Hampshire May Decide Who Goes South</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 2 grafs after 11th graf pvs, bgng: Gephardt's
campaign, with Gore campaign saying Gephardt campaign manager
apologized</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What happens in New Hampshire may decide who
among the Democratic presidential candidates get to go South with
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr., while Pat Robertson is looking
forward to the first Republican contest in the South no matter what
happens Tuesday.
   Analysts say that Robertson, who in Iowa pushed up between
front-runners Bob Dole and George Bush, will be on his friendliest
turf when the presidential season moves into its Southern phase. In
New Hampshire, polls put him in a dead heat for third place with
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.
   Contests are scheduled in Wyoming, South Dakota and a handful of
other states in the three weeks after Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary.
   The next main event is the Super Tuesday primary across most of
the South and in several other states on March 8, but the South
Carolina primary three days before that could emerge as a crucial
GOP test.
   ``There's tremendous potential for Robertson to be a spoiler
here,'' said Earl Black, political scientist at the University of
South Carolina. ``He's putting a lot of money and organizational
effort into South Carolina. He's thrown down the gauntlet, and I
think he's in position to back that up.''
   On the Democratic side, the presidential race in the South will
be shaped by New Hampshire's results.
   Iowa winner Richard Gephardt hopes that a second-place finish
behind local favorite Michael Dukakis, governor of neighboring
Massachusetts, will propel the Missouri congressman into a strong
position to face the South's native son, Gore of Tennessee.
   A Gephardt finish behind Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and
Dukakis, however, could leave the field still muddled as it turns
South _ a page right out of Gore's script.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart and former Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt have been polling at the bottom of the Democratic pack in
New Hampshire, and are hoping Tuesday for surprising finishes to
keep their faltering campaigns alive long enough for Super Tuesday.
   Already, there are signs of bad blood between the rival
campaigns of Gephardt and Gore, who is competing in New Hampshire
but has reserved most of his money for the Southern campaign. Both
Democrats have designs on the white, moderate-to-conservative
Democratic vote in the South.
   Gephardt's campaign manager William Carrick used harsh language
to the Washington Post last week about Gore. He said: ``I can't
wait. It's blood lust. Let me at him. I hate him. I hate all of
them.''
   The Gore campaign said Sunday that Carrick ``formally apologized
today...for profane, personal attacks and comments critical of Gore
and and Gore's campaign.'' The apologies were made to both Gore
himself and campaign manager Fred Martin, said Arlie Schardt, press
secretary for the Gore campaign.
   ``Both Gore and Martin accepted the apology and agreed with
Carrick that the matter was over,'' Schardt said in a statement.
   Martin said the campaign remains convinced the influence of Iowa
and New Hampshire will be diminished this year by Gore's chosen
battleground, the South.
   South Carolina Republicans, dominated by loyalists to Bush, set
up their primary on Saturday March 5 in hopes it would give the
vice president a boost in case he needed it before the Super
Tuesday primaries in the rest of the South.
   But now Robertson, a former TV evangelist who lives in West
Virginia, has targeted South Carolina as his next best chance and
predicted he will win it outright.
   Robertson's strong Iowa second-place finish behind Dole, handing
Bush a humiliating third place, was explained in part by
Robertson's strong organization among fundamentalist and
charismatic Christian voters and the traditionally low turnout of
caucus contests. In South Carolina he has a primary rather than a
caucus, but one with a history of low turnout and a Bible-belt
location favorable to his message.
   ``Using those evangelical churches and his high-tech methods to
get his people out, and rolling the church buses on Saturday, he
can find a lot of voters,'' Black said.
   Elsewhere in the South, Republicans say Robertson may
demonstrate a strength not detected in the polls.
   ``Robertson will probably come in second in Georgia _ if he
doesn't come in first,'' said Bob Bell, former Georgia GOP state
chairman.
   ``This is the Bible Belt,'' he said. ``I think really there is
something happening.''
   Bush is credited with a Southern organization far superior to
that of Dole, and polls show him far and away the Southern leader.
But a loss in New Hampshire to the Senate majority leader from
Kansas could leave Bush struggling to hang on to both his
organization and his poll lead.
   ``Bush has to look ahead,'' said Norm Ornstein, political
analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ``He has
crafted what may be a Maginot Line: `If we do badly in Iowa, we've
got New Hampshire. If we do badly there, we've got South Carolina
...' If Pat Robertson takes away a victory from him in South
Carolina, that's it.''
   Bush's southern co-ordinator Lanny Griffith, however, insists
that Bush can remain strong in the South even with another setback .
   ``Frankly, we don't have any bad states in the South,'' Griffith
said. ``We lead in every state. We lead in every demographic group,
among conservatives and independents. There is no region (of the
South) or demographic group where we don't lead.''
   Dole is at an organizational disadvantage in the South but has
had his wife, Elizabeth, a native of North Carolina, working the
region for him. Her home state is considered a key strength for
Dole in the South.
   Dole's Southern spokesman, Clark Reid, claimed ``a groundswell
of support'' following Iowa. ``You have to take into account we
haven't done any paid media (ads) yet in the South,'' Reid said.

<HEAD>Soviets Visiting Utah In Preparation For INF Verification Team</HEAD>

   Soviet technicians will visit Utah this week
to review living arrangements for inspectors who will be stationed
here to verify compliance with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces
Treaty, an official said.
   At the same time, a three-member U.S. contingent will travel to
the Soviet Union to conduct a similar tour, Sen. Orrin Hatch said
Saturday. The visit of the Soviet technicians is scheduled for
Wednesday and Thursday.
   Up to 30 Soviet inspectors may establish a compound near the
Hercules Bacchus West plant in western Salt Lake County under terms
of the INF pact, which bans production of intermediate-range
missiles.
   The treaty was signed in December by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev but still faces ratification by the Senate.
   The Soviet inspectors will monitor the Hercules plant, which
developed motors for Pershing 2 missiles now banned under the
treaty.
   The American team will be stationed in the Soviet city of
Votkinsk where SS-20 nuclear weapons were made, said Dave Porter,
an aide to Hatch. Votkinsk, about 600 miles east of Moscow near the
Ural Mountains, has been closed to foreign visitors.
   The two countries' advance teams will meet in Moscow a week
after the tours to discuss housing, travel restrictions and other
arrangements for the inspectors, said Hatch, R-Utah.
   The inspection teams could be settled in each nation within 60
days of Senate ratification of the treaty.
   State Department officials will accompany the Soviet technicians
on a tour of the area within 31 miles of the Hercules plant. Soviet
inspectors later could be allowed to travel within that zone.
   Porter said this week's tours are the first of many such
meetings planned before the inspection teams arrive.
   The treaty spells out few details of living arrangements,
leaving them to the two host countries.
   Hatch, who has said he believes ``virtually all'' of the Soviet
inspectors in Utah will be spies, has asked for a secret study of
security precautions for as many as 63 government contractors
located within a 31-mile radius of the Hercules plant.
   The senator also has called for restrictions on the inspectors
to reduce the possibility of espionage. Any limitations imposed
would be reciprocal, he said.

   Nine women competed for the title of Miss
Garlic, but a 73-year-old woman who said she downs the stuff
morning, noon and night walked off with the crown.
   ``I don't think I'd be able to live without garlic,'' said
Eileen Knarr, who was named Miss Garlic at a weekend festival
dedicated to the lily family's most aromatic relative. ``I have it
for breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' she said.
   The judges compared notes Saturday on the contestants while the
festival's first Miss Garlic, Helen Lewin, sang ``Me And My
Garlic'' to the tune of ``Me And My Shadow.''
   After an accordion fanfare, Mrs. Knarr was named the winner and
received the crown and sash from Patricia Gorrasi, the defending
queen who said she sat out this year's pageant because because some
of her family members sniffed at the title.
   ``My children said I was a source of embarrassment to them,''
she said.
   An estimated 400 people attended the fourth annual event, which
left a distinct odor wafting throughout a restaurant in Covington,
across the Ohio River from Cincinnati.
   The participants lined up for garlic-peeling contests, wore
headbands made of garlic cloves, and downed dishes spiced with 160
pounds of garlic imported from Gilroy, Calif., which calls itself
``The Garlic Capital of the World.''
   ``What do I like most about it? I like the flavor a lot,'' said
Marlene Steele of Covington, who won the cooking competition with
her version of garlic-stuffed mushrooms.
   Her recipe is heavy on the garlic, light on the mushrooms.
   ``I make them a lot. I take them to people's houses,'' she said.
``They either eat them or they don't eat them _ I eat them then.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis called
Sunday for a 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons and a ban on
nuclear warhead testing and weapons in space, coupled with a
strengthening of the nation's conventional forces.
   ``If the next president is required to use force, it will almost
certainly be conventional forces and not nuclear,'' he said.
   The Democratic presidential hopeful, in what was billed as a
major foreign policy speech, said ``the next president isn't going
to be giving blank checks to the Pentagon or to anybody else. If he
did, the checks would bounce.''
   ``But we can have the forces we need at a price we can afford if
we are willing to make some tough choices and if we invest our
limited resources wisely,'' he said.
   Dukakis said he would seek ``to get a dollar's worth of security
for every dollar we spend.''
   In the speech, the Massachusetts governor said he would not
hesitate to use military force to defend vital interests.
   ``There is no room in this hemisphere for military bases from
which the Soviet Union or any other power for that matter might
project military force against ourselves, our allies or our
friends,'' Dukakis said. ``And if Nicaragua or any other government
in Central or South America seeks to overthrow or subvert its
neighbors, we have the right and the responsibility to stop them.''
   But Dukakis repeated his opposition to aid to Contra rebels
fighting the Nicaraguan Sandinista government. And he pledged to
abide by the War Powers Act, which places limits on presidential
use of military force.
   He also said he would observe the treaty of the Organization of
American States and the rulings of the World Court. President
Reagan has violated all three, Dukakis said.
   Dukakis accused the Reagan administration of bumbling and
incompetence in addition to violation of international law.
   ``There's nothing strong about wandering around the Persian Gulf
without a minesweeper,'' Dukakis said, a reference to the Navy's
failure to send a minesweeping vessel to that region when Reagan
first ordered escorts of oil tankers.
   ``There's nothing strong about selling arms to terrorists,''
Dukakis said. He said that as president he would never make
concessions to terrorists although he said he would talk to them,
if the situation warranted.
   And Dukakis said that in his administration, ``Authority in the
executive branch will come, not from an admiral or a lieutenant
colonel, but from the commander in chief.''
   Dukakis avoided comment on a new commercial by rival Paul Simon,
which cites a recent editorial in the Lawrence (Mass.)
Eagle-Tribune. The editorial says if elected, the governor would
lead a bureaucracy, not the people.
   Questioned outside the Derry, N.H., Knights of Columbus Hall,
Dukakis said he had not seen the advertisement.
   ``I'm not watching much television,'' he said.

   Front-runner Michael Dukakis became the
focus of attacks from his Democratic rivals Sunday as the
Republican hopefuls traded barbs in one last debate in the
increasingly bitter campaign for the New Hampshire primary.
   Less than 48 hours before the first votes will be cast in the
first primary, GOP candidate Pat Robertson called for the gradual
abolition of Social Security. Opponent Jack Kemp said the former
television evangelist has ``some off-the-wall ideas.''
   George Bush and Bob Dole, running neck-and-neck for Tuesday's
primary, tossed charges back and forth in the hour-long League of
Women Voters debate on Sunday night.
   ``You were for it before you read it. I waited to read it first.
That's the difference,'' Dole said about the new arms control
treaty with the Soviets.
   ``I was for it when the president proposed it,'' Bush retorted.
   Later in the debate, Kemp blew up at Bush when the vice
president used the 1960s phrase, ``Give peace a chance.''
   ``You should be embarrassed to use `Give peace a chance','' Kemp
said. ``We're the party of peace through strength.''
   Kemp also went after Dole.
   ``I am convinced that Senator Dole has a secret plan to raise
taxes on the American people,'' Kemp said in Bedford, N.H., before
the debate. ``That would totally frustrate the Republican message
that we are the low-tax party.''
   On the Democratic side, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois switched to
attacking Dukakis, the clear front-runner in the Democratic field.
Simon dropped his controversial focus on Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, with whom he is battling for the No. 2 spot.
   ``I think it is increasingly clear that Paul Simon is now ahead
of Dick Gephardt,'' Simon told a Manchester news conference.
``There is a difference, and a clear alternative to Mike Dukakis.''
   Simon is emphasizing a new ad aimed at the Massachusetts
governor:
   ``In endorsing Paul Simon for president, the Lawrence
Eagle-Tribune of Massachusetts said `President Dukakis would head a
bureaucracy. President Simon would head a nation of people,''' the
ad said.
   Simon denied that the ad change had anything to do with
Gephardt's harsh criticism of the commercials.
   For his part, Gephardt has a television ad calling Dukakis ``one
of the biggest tax raisers in Massachusetts history.'' The Missouri
congressman rejected suggestions he embraced Reaganomics in 1981 as
``balderdash,'' saying the question was ``were we for the tax cut
for the middle class or we were not?''
   Dukakis rejected the suggestion in Simon's ad.
   ``We didn't have dozens and dozens of UAW members (United Auto
Workers) up here working their heads off and dozens and dozens of
firefighters working their heads off for me yesterday because they
don't think I'm for working men and women,'' Dukakis said in
Manchester.
   Early in the debate, Bush said the differences among the
Republicans were not what they seem.
   ``We're going to be together after this...So it doesn't have the
deep decisions that you might think from the agony of the moment or
the ad of the moment or from the charge and countercharge,'' Bush
said.
   But he and Dole continued their charges about leadership outside
the debate format.
   ``I don't think he has made any decisions in the last seven
years,'' the Kansas senator said of Bush in a CBS News interview
broadcast Sunday.
   Dole said he is pleased with his progress in New Hampshire _
where Bush once had a big lead: ``I have come a long way in the
last 30 days.''
   For his part, Bush defended his campaign's ads that say Dole has
``straddled'' making decisions on several major issues.
   ``The man is running on leadership,'' Bush told reporters in
Nashua. ``I think it is fair to look at the results.''
   Robertson, who ran second in the Iowa caucuses, still grabbed
the attention as he said he might do even better in New Hampshire.
   ``I want to have the satisfaction of seeing the television
anchormen's faces when they have to report that Pat Robertson won
New Hampshire,'' the former television evangelist told a
congregation at the Faith Christian Center in Bedford, N.H.
   Church ushers ordered reporters not to take tape recorders or
pens and paper into the service, checking them at the door to
enfoce the rule. Robertson gave a political speech in which he
talked of how his life had been guided by God's messages, including
his race for the White House.
   Asked if he might best Bush again, Robertson said on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation'': ``Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing for the
country?''
   Robertson said ``there isn't going to be any money'' available
in Social Security in the next century when younger people retire.
Thus, he wants to gradually abolish the system, while paying
current benefits, ``over 40 years, moving it into a private
system.''
   Kemp, who is battling Robertson for conservative hearts, minds
and votes, lashed out at the former preacher.
   ``He has said some off-the-wall things about the economy, about
foreign policy,'' Kemp said on NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press.'' Asked
for specifics, Kemp said Robertson has said, ``Credit cards are the
mark of the beast and that we are going to hell in a hand basket
because of the deficit.''
   Dole said he thought Robertson would not do as well in New
Hampshire as in Iowa.
   ``He broke a lot of china in Iowa and he's working very hard in
the state of New Hampshire. Who knows?'' Dole said on ABC-TV's
``This Week with David Brinkley.''. ``I think it is a lot more
difficult for him in a state like New Hampshire.''
   Kemp and Robertson both distributed literature at churches, a
tactic Robertson used successfuly last Sunday in Iowa. Kemp workers
were in the church parking lots passing out brochures headlined,
``Jack Kemp _ The candidate for believers,'' while Robertson forces
once again handed out a ``Biblical Scoreboard.''
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart said he would not end his
born-again Democratic campaign if he does not do well in New
Hampshire, the state that gave him a miracle victory in 1984.
   ``Of course not,'' was his reply to the question on the NBC
program.
   And Hart said he is not just on an ego trip by continuing his
campaign: ``I'm not a dog in the manger. I'm not a spoiler.''
   New polls by ABC News and CBS News showed Bush and Dole knotted
at about 30 percent among Republicans. Kemp, Robertson and du Pont
were tied at about 10 percent.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis kept his big lead with around 40
percent in both surveys. Simon and Gephardt were fighting for
second. They were tied in the ABC poll, but Gephardt held a tiny
lead in the CBS survey. Others trailed.

<HEAD>Attorneys Say Noriega's Files Are `Political Dynamite'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Gen. Manuel Noriega said Sunday the
Panamian strongman has ``dynamite'' information that could
influence the U.S. presidential election, and they threatened to
use the files ``if we have to.''
   ``We were given access by General Noriega to files which contain
political dynamite _ files which could affect the upcoming
presidential election in the United States and the positions of
other nations,'' Raymond Takiff said after arriving at Miami
International Airport. He refused to elaborate.
   ``Right now, we're just going to sit tight with them (the
files). If we have to use them, we'll use them,'' said Frank
Rubino, another defense lawyer, later in response to a question.
   Takiff added, ``General Noriega told us that he has always been
a friend of the United States and is still a friend of the United
States.''
   Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges by federal
grand juries in Miami and Tampa earlier this month.
   Takiff, Rubino and fellow lawyers Neal Sonnett and Steven Kollin
conferred with their client, Panama's de facto leader, Friday.
Sonnett, the former chief of the criminal division in the Miami
U.S. attorney's office, and Kollin returned to Miami from Panama
City on Saturday. Takiff and Rubino returned Sunday.
   The defense attorneys also have ``material which portrays the
long and intricate involvement of Jose Blandon, former Panamanian
consul general in New York, with the Communist Party in both Panama
and Puerto Rico,'' Takiff said.
   Blandon was a witness before the Miami federal grand jury that
indicted Noriega, and has testified before a U.S. congressional
subcommittee about Noriega's alleged involvement in cocaine
trafficking. He also alleged that the CIA provided Noriega with
confidential information on Sens. Edward Kennedy and Jesse Helms,
which the CIA denied.
   ``He (Blandon) wants to be the next president of Panama,''
Takiff said.
   Meanwhile, Noriega's attorneys planned to meet with prosecutors
on Tuesday, but they declined to comment on the purpose of the
meeting.
   Sonnett plans to file motions this week in federal court asking
for dismissal of the indictment as being politically motivated,
Takiff said. He said he also will ask for the minutes of the grand
jury.
   Also this week, law firms in Philadephia, Washington, and New
York city are expected to be added to the defense team, Takiff said.

   Ninety-four Chinese couples tied the knot in two
mass weddings Sunday. Organizers said that while it was considered
a lucky day to marry, it was only coincidental the ceremonies
landed on Valentine's Day.
   ``This kind of wedding has special meaning. It is memorable
because it is bigger and more exciting,'' said Zhang Yongling, one
of 44 brides at the afternoon ceremony.
   The Great Wall Sheraton Hotel organized the two ceremonies,
which fall three days before Spring Festival, or Lunar New Year.
   Spring Festival is considered an auspicious time for marriage,
and Chinese traditionally schedule weddings on even-numbered days,
which are said to be lucky.
   Valentine's Day is not celebrated in China, but the master of
ceremonies mentioned the Western holiday and explained its origin
and significance to the newylweds.
   The hotel's elegant ballroom was decorated with colored
streamers and two large red hearts for the ceremonies.
   One bride wore a white wedding gown, but all the others were in
red, the Chinese color for weddings. A few wore traditional Chinese
cheongsams, a close-fitting dress.
   While friends and family threw colored confetti, the couples
bowed three times, once to Beijing Vice-Mayor He Luli, once to
their parents and once to each other.
   Mass weddings have been encouraged by the government, which has
been alarmed at the increasingly lavish weddings and receptions
that couples are throwing.
   According to Chinese reports, young urban couples in some areas
spend about $2,000 on their weddings, the equivalent of three
years' income.
   By comparison, the hotel charged about $27 per couple and $4 per
guest.
   For that amount, the hotel provided a simple cake for each
couple, snacks and soft drinks and entertainment.
   Some parents prefer the traditional wedding feast, but Ms. Zhang
said, ``My family is `80s-minded.''

<TEXT>
   A hazardous gas leaked Sunday for the third
time since late January from an International Paper Co. mill that
has continued operating during a strike, and seven people were
taken to hospitals, officials said.
   IP officials said no one was exposed outside the mill. Jay Town
Manager Charles Noonan said no evacuation outside the mill area was
necessary.
   A preliminary investigation indicated that the chlorine gas
escaped from a chemical-sampling line when a bleaching plant in the
mill shut down, IP said.
   The problem apparently resulted from the failure of a valve to
shut off automatically after a cutoff of electricity halted the
bleaching process, said Willis Lyford, a spokesman for Gov. John R.
McKernan Jr.
   The leak lasted about 10 to 15 minutes and was largely contained
within a mill building, Lyford said.
   IP spokesman Rick Ouellette said the injured workers were
``outside contractors, and not Androscoggin mill employees, who
were working on a capital project in the pulp mill.''
   He said the area was cleared within five minutes and workers
returned to the affected area within 45 minutes.
   ``It wasn't a human error'' that caused the leak, said
Ouellette. ``It was a problem in the process and that is being
investigated.''
   The commissioners of Maine's Human Services and Labor
departments toured the mill Sunday afternoon with officials from
the Department of Environmental Protection, Lyford said.
   The governor, who also sent his public safety commissioner to
the mill, ordered IP to cease its bleaching operations, in which
chlorine is used.
   McKernan called for a thorough inspection by the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration after a leak of more
than 100,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide Feb. 4. OSHA said Tuesday
that it would assign inspectors to the mill in an effort to prevent
future leaks.
   The leak of chlorine dioxide, which like chlorine is used in the
bleaching process, forced nearly 4,000 people to leave Jay and
nearby communities for several hours.
   On Jan. 28, eight workers were rushed to hospitals after a
hydrogen sulfide gas leak at the mill.
   Noonan said Jay officials are worried about potential injuries
to residents as well as mill employees.
   ``We remain very interested in what goes on at that mill,'' said
Noonan. He criticized legislators last week for doing too little to
defuse what he sees as a volatile situation in a town already tense
over an 8-month-old labor dispute at the paper mill.
   More than 1,200 members of United Paperworkers International
Union and the International Brotherhood of Firemen & Oilers at the
IP mill have been on strike since mid-June. IP has hired hundreds
of what it calls permanent replacements.
   Five workers were taken to Franklin Memorial Hospital in
Farmington, and three were admitted in stable but guarded condition
and two were released, said spokesman Kevin Flynn, who said
chlorine gas can be ``extremely toxic.''
   ``They are all conscious, alert and responsive,'' said Flynn,
adding that effects of chlorine poisoning can show up 12 to 18
hours after exposure.
   A spokeswoman at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston said
two people taken there were released Sunday afternoon.

   About 150 Valentine's Day greetings
addressed to American hostage Terry Anderson and other foreign
captives were received from the United States on Sunday by Beirut's
leftist newspaper As-Safir.
   ``We received them by mail from all over the United States. We
shall run samples in Monday's edition,'' said As-Safir's deputy
editor Mohammed Mashmoushi.
   The letters, many emblazoned with red hearts, were picked up
Sunday morning in the newspaper's mailbox at the central post
office.
   He said more than three-quarters of the messages were addressed
to Anderson, 40, the longest-held foreigner in Lebanon, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985. Anderson is the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.
   One message came from his sister, Peggy Say of Batavia, N.Y. It
said, ``Terry, we love you so much and we'll never give up the
fight for your freedom.''
   One or two messages were addressed to American hostage Thomas
Sutherland, 55, of Fort Collins, Colo., acting dean of agriculture
at the American University of Beirut. He was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   A few messages were addressed to missing Anglican Church envoy
Terry Waite, 48 who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving a west
Beirut hotel for a meeting with Anderson's and Sutherland's captors.
   The two Americans are held by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy
War, an underground group believed made up of Shiite Moslem zealots
loyal to Iran's revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   There were a few messages addressed to American professors Alann
Steen, 48, of Boston, Robert Polhill, 54, of New York City, and
Jesse Jonathan Turner, 40, of Boise, Idaho.
   They were kidnapped from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated
Beirut University College on Jan. 24, 1987.
   Twenty-four foreigners, including eight Americans, are being
held in Lebanon.
   In a videotape released by his captors on Christmas Eve,
Anderson said he had seen some of the Christmas cards his friends
and countrymen sent to him, published by As-Safir.
   In other developments, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency said
thumbprints alleged to be those of two kidnapped Scandinavian
employees provided by their captors were sent Sunday to forensic
experts for verification.
   The thumbprints were on a note left at a Western news agency in
Beirut Saturday. The note failed to identify the abductors, but it
said the two captives, Swede Jan Stening, 44, and Norwegian William
Jorgensen, 58, would be freed within a week if their current
interrogation proved their ``innocence.''
   The note carried no specific charges of which the two captives
should be innocent, however.
   In Larnaca, Cyprus, a Danish official said it was ``well known
that arms were found'' on a cargo ship that was seized Dec. 27 by
Christian militiamen in Lebanon. The three Danes, three Poles, two
Sri Lankans and a seaman from Trinidad aboard the vessel were
released Saturday.
   Ole Neustrup, Danish charge d'affaires to Syria, said the arms
were aboard the ship, which was carrying foodstuffs. Neustrup
accompanied the freed sailors from Lebanon after negotiating with
their captors, members of the right-wing Lebanese Forces militia.
   But Uwe Biel, captain of the frieghter Ingawebb, said he knew
nothing about arms aboard the ship.
   The Christian militia had accused the crew of unloading arms for
the Druse Progressive Socialist Party militia Beirut before sailing
into the Lebanese capital's harbor, press reports said. The Druse
militia is the main foe of the Christians in Lebanon's nearly
13-year-old civil war.

   A rocket booster motor being tested for
use in the Titan IV space launch vehicle startled more than a
thousand residents Sunday with its sensational rumble and smoke,
authorities said.
   Officials at the San Jose Police Department and Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office logged 1,300 calls after the two-minute
demonstration firing in the mountains south of San Jose at 12:30
p.m.
   ``Most of them just heard the big noise and saw the smoke and
wanted to know what happened,'' police Officer David Aguilar said.
   A plume of fire rose about 800 feet into the air, topped off by
a spectacular smoke cloud rising several thousand feet before
dispersing, according to United Technologies Chemical System, which
is producing the seven-segment solid rocket booster motor.
   The thrust was created by propulsive gases from almost 600,000
pounds of propellant squeezed through a narrow nozzle, resulting in
a low-frequency rumble heard in varying degrees around the San Jose
area.

   Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian
students occupying a University of Massachusetts building for the
third day said Sunday a church had pledged money and restaurants
had donated hot meals.
   ``We haven't even had to leave the building to buy food,'' said
Rio Gabriel, 21, a junior from Toronto.
   The estimated 125 demonstrators have held the New Africa Hall on
the UMass campus since Friday to protest an attack on two black
students allegedly beaten by whites and other recent incidents at
the school.
   Protesters allowed reporters into a small room on the ground
floor of the hall to answer questions. The building showed no signs
of occupation, such as banners and pickets, and there were no
police officers outside.
   Protesters said they would occupy the four-story brick building
until Chancellor Joseph D. Duffey met demands including the
suspension of five white students accused of the Feb. 7 beatings.
   The third day of the takeover began with a worship service led
by the Rev. Gary Jenkins of Hartford.
   ``A lot of people here are religious and did make a commitment
to stay here until this is resolved,'' said Roscoe Robinson, 24, a
senior from Boston. ``Along with sleeping accommodations and food,
there are religious needs we have to take care of.''
   Other demonstrators left briefly for showers and breakfast at
home, Ms. Gabriel said.
   Group leaders talked with black administrators Sunday in
preparation for a meeting with the chancellor on their demands,
which were being revised to include more funds for minority
activities and increased hiring of minority faculty, she said.
   Only 41 of the 1,339 faculty members and 5 percent of the 20,000
undergraduates are black, mirroring a nationwide decline in the
number of black applicants in the last several years, according to
the school.
   Blacks at the university say an undercurrent of racism has not
abated since October 1986, when blacks and whites clashed following
the Boston Red Sox loss to the New York Mets in the final game of
the World Series. Six white students eventually pleaded no contest
to varying charges.
   Duffey has acknowledged that racism continues to be a problem at
the school. ``I think we've got a continuing problem with
harassment and abuse,'' the chancellor said.
   Duffey was trying to avoid a confrontation with protesters when
school resumes Tuesday, university spokesman James Langley said.
   ``We're being as patient as we possibly can,'' Langley said. ``I
don't think you'll see any arrests. They are being very peaceful.''
   ``This is not a mob,'' said Roberto Christian, 26, a graduate
student from Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.
   ``Hostility breeds hostility,'' Robinson said. ``We're almost in
the 1990s and racial hostility is still happening. I'm sick of it.''
   Protesters have received $575 from students and faculty members,
a pledge for $5,000 from the Convent Avenue Baptist Church of New
York City, food from Amherst restaurants, and blankets, sleeping
bags and pillows, Ms. Gabriel said.
   A spokeswoman for the Convent Avenue church, who asked that her
name not be used, confirmed that the church had offered support,
including financial aid, but declined to confirm the $5,000 figure.

   Leftist guerillas kidnapped five mayors
of President Virgilio Barco's political party and three reporters
to send a message about upcoming local elections, a Columbian radio
network said Sunday.
   One mayor who was abducted later was released, the Bogota daily
El Tiempo and other newspapers said.
   Caracol radio network said it received a telephone call at its
station in Cucuta claiming the kidnappings Friday were by the
communist National Liberation Army.
   The caller, who did not identify himself, said the rebels
planned to release all of those kidnapped and give them messages to
give to the government about the March 13 nationwide election of
mayors, Caracol said.
   All five mayors belong to Barco's Liberal Party. Barco has
pledged to fight the threat posed by leftist guerrillas in Colombia.
   Since Jan. 1 the guerrilla group has bombed the country's main
oil pipeline a dozen times, ambushed two army patrols, blown up
electricity transmission towers and attacked a town.
   On Feb. 5 the rebels set off a car bomb in front of the
Colombian headquarters of an American oil company, Occidental
Petroleum. Windows of the nine-story building were shattered and
two guards were injured.
   Kidnapped Friday afternoon were mayors Ricaute Paez, of Ocana,
Ramiro Numa Peinado, of Teorama, and Jorge Suarez, of Convencion,
Gov. Eduardo Assaf of the northeast state of Norte de Santander
said in a news release.
   All three towns are in Norte de Santander.
   Also kidnapped Friday was mayor Eduardo Solano, of Aguachica, in
the northern state of Cesar, and Mayor Daniel Palacios of Morales
in the northern state of Bolivar, the state governments said in a
statement.
   Palacios was later released, the Bolivar news release said.
   Three reporters were kidnapped in the eastern town of Cucuta on
Friday, the news media said. Two were reporters with radio stations
and one was a correspondent for the Bucaramanga newspaper
Vanguardia Liberal, radio stations and newspapers said.

   About 4,000 troops backed by
helicopters and warships stood guard Monday as voters in Sulu
province chose local officials in the final stage of the
Philippines' violence-marred regional elections.
   On the eve of the balloting, armed factions loyal to rival
mayoral candidates traded mortar and automatic weapon fire outside
the town of Maimbung, 600 miles south of Manila.
   The military said at least four people have been killed and
dozens wounded in clashes between rival factions in the largely
Moslem province since Friday.
   About 214,000 voters in the southern island province were to
elect three governors, 18 mayors and 126 members of town and
provincial councils.
   Col. Romeo Abendan, Philippine Constabulary chief in Sulu, said
the four were killed Friday when about 50 armed men attacked
Maimbung on the southern coast of Jolo island.
   On Saturday, gunmen attacked Kulasi village just outside
Maimbung, but no casualties were reported, he said. In nearby Luuk,
rival political groups traded fire with automatic weapons, but
there were no reported fatalities, he said.
   Most Filipinos voted Jan. 18 in an election that President
Corazon Aquino said restored full democracy after the February 1986
ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos. Voting was postponed in 11 of
the 73 provinces because of fears of violence from communist rebels
and regional warlords.

<HEAD>Jackson's ``Rainbow Express'' Does Whistle-Stop Tour In Cold New
Hampshire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETSY HENDERSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson took a 1930s-era train
through New Hampshire's Lakes Region Sunday to tell voters to get
the country ``back on track'' by choosing him in Tuesday's
presidential primary.
   Standing on the back of the red caboose in Plymouth, Jackson
told about 300 supporters, including 100 who came on school buses
from Concord, to stand up against what he calls ``economic
violence.''
   ``Most poor people in America are not on welfare,'' he said.
``They work every day. And when they get done working, they're
still poor.''
   ``We, the people, can win,'' he said.
   The crowd endured 20-degree temperatures and a brisk wind as
they stood in front of the station, its roof dripping with
three-and four-foot icicles.
   ``It's worth all the cold feet,'' said Holly Anathan, who came
from Boston to ride Jackson's train. She said she liked the way he
addressed the problems of lower-income people.
   Ten-year-old Elijah Proule held up a Valentine that said ``I
Love Jesse.'' He handed Jackson the Valentine and a red rose.
   Supporters then got on the ``Rainbow Express,'' which chugged
along at 10 to 15 miles per hour, to Laconia.
   A retired teacher from Nashua said, ``I like the way he says
things and he's mature.... Last night the others acted like
children,'' she said.
   Banjo player Court Dorsey went from chilly car to car singing
``It's a Rainbow Train a-coming.''
   ``We are winning together, -gether, -gether,'' Jackson sang with
Dorsey as the train passed Lake Winnipesaukee, which was covered
with ice fishing huts and snowmobile tracks.
   ``And we are freezing here together,'' Jackson added. The coal
stove in one of the three cars went out several times on the trip.
   In Laconia and Tilton, Jackson addressed crowds of between 200
and 300 people and asked them repeatedly ``Who're you going to vote
for?''
   ``Jesse,'' they responded.
   ``I've stood with you. On Tuesday I want you to stand with me,''
he said.
   Brenda Wright, who had come to Tilton from Henniker, said she
wouldn't be standing with Jackson in the primary, although she
thought he was the best candidate.
   ``I admire him greatly. He's done a lot for the underdog and it
would be a thrill to see him in the White House,'' she said. ``I
won't (vote for him), because I don't think he has a chance.''
   The train, run by the Winnipesaukee Railroad Co., cost the
campaign $1,500 to use. Its trips are normally limited to fall
foliage tours and some freight hauling.
   Daris Dixon said he had come up with a group of 31 students from
Cheyney University in Pennsylvania to canvass for Jackson.
   ``This has been a great trip. I'd do it again in a minute,'' he
said.
   A group of 10- and 11-year old girls, who shivered next to the
stove near Jackson's car, weren't so sure.
   ``We're never going to get home,'' said one.
   At the end of the line in Concord, Jackson spoke to a rally of
workers from Guilford Railway Co., who have been on strike since
Nov. 13. He has held numerous rallies throughout his campaign
supporting workers on strike.
   Kathy Ramsey, East Coast Coordinator for the Organization to
Reach Acceptable Condititions for Railway Workers, said she would
back Jackson because he ``supports workers rights over corporate
greed.''
   ``He's the only one addressing the issues at hand,'' she said.

   Laotian gunners reportedly shot down a
Thai plane that was on a reconnaissance mission over an embattled
border area, state-run Radio Thailand said Sunday.
   It was the second plane the Thais said they lost in the battle
for remote hills over which both countries have claimed sovereignty.
   The radio said the American-made OV-10, a twin-engine turboprop
used for counter-insurgency and night surveillance, was shot down
Saturday near Hill 1428, one of the most fiercely contested areas.
   The other plane, an American-made F-5E jet fighter-bomber, was
downed Feb. 4.
   Thailand has launched frequent air strikes to try to dislodge
hundreds of Laotian soldiers entrenched in the hills that lie along
the border between Thailand's northern Phitsanulok province and
Laos' Sayaboury province.
   A radio correspondent reporting from Phitsanulok quoted reports
that said the OV-10 was flying in Thai airspace when it was hit by
anti-aircraft rounds fired from Laotian territory. The two crewmen
parachuted to safety, the reports said.
   The Thai government is preparing this week to receive a Laotian
military delegation for what would be the first talks on resolving
the border dispute, the bloodiest since clashes over three border
hamlets in 1984.
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, responding to a proposal by
Laos' Premier Kaysone Phomvihane, said Friday he would welcome the
delegation in Bangkok on Tuesday. Kaysone proposed discussion of an
immediate cease-fire and separation of the military forces of the
two sides.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former employees of a steel mill shut down eight
years ago voted overwhelmingly Sunday to accept a settlement with
Navistar International Corp. that will give them $14.8 million in
benefits.
   The vote by former Wisconsin Steel Works employees was 583-75 to
approve the settlement, which provides about $67 million less than
the workers initially had sought, said attorney Judith Teeter, who
represents the 2,700 workers.
   ``These are old people. They have been fighting this case for
years and years, and they're very happy it's settled,'' Ms. Teeter
said after the vote at a local union hall.
   The vote is not binding, said attorney Leon Despres, another
workers' representative. But he called it ``highly persuasive.''
   ``The plan has to be determined by a judge,'' he said. ``But the
overwhelming vote makes his approval very likely.''
   Navistar, then known as International Harvester Co., sold the
Wisconsin Steel Works shortly before it went into bankruptcy and
was shut down in 1980.
   The ``Save Our Jobs Committee,'' representing the mill workers,
filed an $82 million lawsuit against IH, contending it sold the
mill to escape the payment of termination benefits if the plant
closed, Despres said.
   The $14.8 million figure was suggested as a compromise by U.S.
District Judge James Moran, after two months of mediation sessions,
Despres said. The settlement goes back to Moran for final approval.
   If the settlement is approved, each employee could receive an
amount ranging from $200 to $17,000, based on age and length of
employment, he said.
   Navistar offices were closed Sunday and company officials could
not be reached for comment.

   Communist guerrillas bombed the offices of
Royal Dutch Shell and five other buildings in night attacks in the
capital, police said Sunday.
   The attacks late Saturday destroyed doors and shattered windows
of the buildings, but no one was reported hurt, according to police.
   Bombs exploded outside the Shell offices, a luxury furniture
store, the warehouse of a supermarket chain, a pharmaceutical
laboratory and two shops in plush shopping malls, police said.
   Police said they arrested a young man and woman and were
questioning them about the bombing attacks.
   Police said the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement took
responsibility for the attacks in phone calls to newspapers.
   The Tupac Amaru group became active in 1984, four years after
the Maoist Shining Path, a much larger and more violent
revolutionary group, began fighting to overthrow Peru's elected
government.
   More than 10,000 people have been killed in the political
violence since the Shining Path launched its guerrilla war.

   The recent spate of skittish economic
indicators is raising concerns that the next president will take
office without the tools to combat a recession, even if an
election-year downturn can be avoided.
   That's because the federal budget deficit has grown so huge that
the historical remedies for jolting an economy out of a recession _
lower taxes and more federal spending _ simply will not be
available to the next president, a growing number of analysts
suggest.
   In fact, if anything, the next occupant of the Oval Office will
be under extreme pressure to press for higher taxes to reduce the
budget deficit _ a tactic that would become all but impossible
during an actual recession.

years.
   ``On the basis of personal friendship ... we have reviewed

   Girls should be encouraged to exercise vigorously
enough to delay their puberty, because this may help protect them
from breast cancer and other diseases later in life, a researcher
said Sunday.
   Grade school girls who play strenuous sports often have their
first menstrual period, or menarche, later than usual. Even after
adolescence starts, they may miss periods if they work out
regularly.
   Although delayed or missing menstruation is often thought to be
abnormal, some experts now say that it is natural and even
desirable, because it may protect the body from the damaging
effects of sex hormones.

and children to find a date.
   So he has become one of more than 600 farmers, agribusiness
workers or other people with rural backgrounds who look for friends
and lovers through Singles in Agriculture, a nearly 2-year-old
nonprofit group based in Wisconsin.
   ``Farm people are special people. They're busy and they don't
have time to go to things,'' Cook said in a telephone interview
Friday. ``It's hard to find someone when you're on the farm.''

<HEAD>Jaymar-Ruby Hopes Belt Loops Will Boost Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaymar-Ruby Inc., which popularized
the no-belt look for men's slacks, has decided there's a future in
belt loops.
   Tired of battling the image that it's stretchy waistbands are
only for pot-bellies, the company is readying a new advertising
campaign to tell the world that Sansabelt is an old name with new
style.
   While conventional Sansabelt _ beltless _ slacks will still be
sold, Jaymar also will be offering pants designed for belts in
1988, in a marked departure from its 29-year-old marketing strategy.
   Elbert Hand, then Jaymar-Ruby's acting president, said he got
the idea for the change while watching the Masters' golf tournament
last April. Hand, who is chief operating officer of Chicago's
Hartmarx Corp, (Jaymar's parent company) says he remembers seeing a
wide range of men wearing Sansabelt.
   ``Old guys and young guys and fat guys and skinny guys,'' Hand
said. ``And those who seemed like they cared about how they looked,
and those who didn't.''
   Hand said there is a ``stereotypical image'' of the average
Sansabelt wearer _ slightly overweight, interested in comfort,
uninterested in fashion.
   He decided it was time to wage war against that cliche.
   Hand said that while Jaymar had an impressive 20-to-25-percent
share of the men's quality ($40 and up) slacks market, it embarked
last summer on an extensive consumer survey to find out what men
liked and disliked in fashion.
   The survey indicated a lot more men than the company had ever
realized couldn't stand pants without belts, Hand said.
   ``The answers there were fairly clear,'' said Jerry McCann,
Jaymar's vice president for marketing communications. ``It's part
of `the look.' It's like a white-collar guy not wearing a tie to
work.''
   Steve McGue, who took over as Jaymar's president in October,
says pro-belt customers were found to be ``an awesome segment of
the better slacks business.''
   At the same time, it was becoming apparent that Jaymar's 1987
sales would fail to break records for the first time in 10 years,
and that 1987 profits would lag behind those of 1986.
   Sansabelt-with-a-belt was born last summer after Jaymar
executives searched their corporate soul and the idea was endorsed
by McGue when he took control.
   For five weeks now, sales people have been writing orders for
the new-style slacks with considerable success, company executives
say. The fall line will hit stores next summer.
   Because Sansabelt is a French and English amalgamation that
literally means ``with no belt,'' an obvious risk is that the new
strategy will confuse customers.
   ``I know it's a contradiction in terms,'' Hand admitted.
   But Jaymar executives predict they can retain the Sansabelt
customer who has sworn by beltless pants for decades. They also
think they can attract a more trend-conscious, perhaps younger man
who doesn't associate the brand name with ``no belt'' anyway.
   ``It's addressing a market that we've never addressed before
that's a huge market,'' McGue said.
   To spread the word about the new Sansabelt line, the company
will undertake the biggest advertising campaign of its recent
history. Ads, beginning in late August and September, will show
younger-looking models wearing both beltless and belt-style
Sansabelt slacks. The new slogan will be, ``With a belt, without a
belt _ Sansabelt fashion, it feels great.''
   Magazine ads will appear in Gentlemen's Quarterly, Sports
Illustrated, Esquire, New York Times magazine and other
publications.

<HEAD>Dallas Market Center Holds Own By Sales Pitch</HEAD>

   Sales at the Dallas Market Center softened with
the Texas economy a few years ago, but officials devised new
marketing strategies that have begun paying off for this nationally
known wholesale complex.
   The Market Center, a 150-acre complex of wholesale showrooms
contained in eight buildings, typically draws 500,000 buyers a
year. The center handles about $6.5 billion worth of wholesale
orders annually.
   Last year, the number of buyers was down, but the number of
stores represented was up.
   ``We look at two things when we're talking about the number of
buyers: quality and quantity,'' said Michael Parks, president of
the center's Hardgoods Division, which includes furniture, floor
covering, lighting, jewelry and bath-bed-linen industries.
   ``In 1987, we had the healthiest year we've had in four years
(in the Hardgoods Division). We held our own in the Southwest. Our
growth came out of the other regions of the country. We have done a
lot of marketing to those other regions.''
   Buyer attendance dropped 9.1 percent last year in the Softgoods
division, which includes men's, women's and children's apparel and
related merchandise. However, the number of stores represented, a
crucial denominator, increased 11 percent, said division president
Donna Knox.
   ``Fortunately, a number of years ago, we redefined our strategy
on attracting retailers to Dallas,'' said Lucy Crow Billingsley,
chief executive officer of the Dallas Market Center.
   ``Not only do we want to be what we've always been _ the best
specialty store market in the country _ but we also want to expand
geographically and reach much further than the 10-state area next
to us. And we've done that.''
   Independent chains and small, home-owned retailers have been the
traditional base of the Dallas Market Center's buyers. By
implementing a new retail buyer development program, complete with
travel incentives, retailers outside the Southwest and large
department-store chains have become more aware of the Dallas Market
Center.
   In the soft goods area, center workers compiled a list of
retailers that do more than $1 million in annual sales but don't
come to Dallas to buy. That list had more than 12,000 stores.
