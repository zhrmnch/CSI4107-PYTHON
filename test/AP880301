   Slot machines line the walls of
supermarkets and bars in this gaming resort, but they don't belong
in doughnut shops or laundries, officials decided.
   Clark County Commissioners voted Monday to prohibit new slot
machine licenses for machines in laundries, bakeries, doughnut
shops, fast-food restaurants, movie theaters and professional
offices.
   Existing licenses are not affected.
   Several owners of self-service laundries said they depend on
slot machine revenue to cover the high cost of doing business, with
the slots generating about 25 percent of revenues. Other laundry
owners stressed that customers need something to do to keep
occupied while their clothes spin and tumble.
   Commissioners said it is too hard to regulate the machines if
they are allowed to continue to proliferate in different businesses.

   Plainclothes police stormed a
building housing an opposition party office and its radio station
Tuesday, setting off a rock-throwing protest by foes of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's military rule.
   Carlos Ivan Zuniga, leader and presidential candidate of the
Popular Action Party in 1984, was beaten and arrested. Zuniga,
owner of Radio 10-FM, was released hours later.
   The plainclothes police and later a riot squad fired dozens of
shots into the air to disperse the crowd outside the building. The
brawl occurred as an anti-Noriega strike called by the opposition
Civic Crusade entered its second day and appeared to be picking up
support.
   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of
reprisals, said plainclothes police with shotguns and pistols
rushed into the Popular Action building on Via Espana, smashing
furniture and equipment inside the radio station.
   Radio 10-FM was under censorship orders to play only music, but
had been broadcasting news supporting the strike.
   An angry crowd gathered outside the building and started
throwing rocks at the officers. An unidentified radio station
employee was slightly injured.
   Leaders of the Civil Crusade, a coalition of 180 business,
professional, labor, student and political groups, told a news
conference Tuesday night the strike shut down 85 percent of
Panama's economic activity. They said 90 percent of industry and
construction were paralyzed.
   They conceded that transportation was down by only 10 percent,
but said retail commerce was 40 percent of normal.
   Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a Crusade leader and a strike
organizer, said ``this demonstrates the Panamanian people's
repudiation of the dictatorship of Gen. Noriega and the fervent
desire for complete democracy.''
   The government, through some of the news media it controls, has
been calling the strike ``a complete failure,'' alleging business
and transportation were functioning normally.
   The young security men at the radio station, dressed in jeans
and T-shirts, outnumbered the protesters and broke up the
demonstration after 40 minutes.
   The demonstrators were banging pots and pans in the streets and
distributing leaflets.
   At least four men were punched, kicked and beaten with rubber
truncheons during the melee as they were arrested and shoved into
police vehicles.
   Two women were among those arrested on Via Argentina, an upper
middle-class neighborhood. They were not beaten, but one was
slapped on the buttocks as she was hustled into a car.
   At first only about 15 demonstrators from the Popular Action
Party were involved at the radio station building, but the crowd
swelled to about 150 when residents came out on balconies or
sidewalks to join in beating pans. Many people bolted for cover,
however, when security agents came to screeching stops in
4-wheel-drive Toyotas.
   The agents jumped out and began shooting. Some residents
returned to balconies from time to time, shouting ``Murderers!''
and ``Cowards!''
   Zuniga, leader of Popular Action, was beaten and shoved into a
vehicle. The car was blocked by another vehicle and Zuniga, a
white-haired man of about 60, fled down the street with his torn
shirt fluttering and security men in pursuit.
   Bystanders created interference and Zuniga dived into a car that
sped away, but he was caught later.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, ousted as president last week by Noriega,
remained in hiding Tuesday. He predicted serious economic trouble.
   Delvalle's successor, Manuel Solis Palma, accused the United
States of ``lies and defamation'' about Noriega and the Panama
Defense Forces, the 17,000-member military and police organization
commanded by Noriega, the real power behind the civilian government.
   Journalists saw at least three people wounded by birdshot fired
by either the plainclothes agents or soldiers who arrived later.
One man was bleeding from the head, but did not seem to be
seriously injured.
   Calm was reported elsewhere in Panama City. By midafternoon, the
strike had drastically thinned traffic and the crowds on the
streets.
   Strike leaders said 12 Panamanian-owned banks were closed. Most
international banks opened, but did comparatively little business.
   Only one employee and five guards occupied the main area of the
large Chase Manhattan Bank branch. The scenes were similar at
Citibank and the Bank of Boston.
   Some international institutions shut down, including the Bank of
Tokyo.
   Solis Palma, Delvalle's replacement, inaugurated a new session
of the Legislative Assembly with an anti-American speech. The
assembly, which Noriega controls, dismissed Delvalle last Friday.
   ``Noriega has been the victim of the most violent and terrible
campaign of lies and defamation that any leader has ever
received,'' Solis Palma said. He accused the United States and
opponents of the government of ``the clear political intention of
bringing ill repute on the Panama Defense Forces.''
   He said the United States ``wants to asphyxiate the Panamanian
people economically.''
   Solis Palma said the United States has been ``a traditional
enemy'' of Panama. ``They send to our country destabilizing agents
who try to sow chaos in a nation that let its entrails be opened to
serve the world,'' he said in a reference to the Panama Canal.
   Panamanian officials have claimed protests at home and the
indictment of Noriega on drug charges in Florida are the work of
American conservatives who oppose the 1977 treaties under which the
canal is to be turned over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   In a videotape of Delvalle distributed by his associates, the
former president pledged to remain in Panama and continue
resistance to Noriega.
   He said the crisis would make it impossible for Panama to get
new loans from abroad and described the country as ``totally
bankrupt.''
   Delvalle predicted the lack of credit would force the government
to raise taxes, which he said ``will increase unemployment and
social unrest.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Accepts First Drug Testing Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mandatory drug testing in the workplace will
be studied for the first time by the Supreme Court in a case that
involves government workers but could have an impact on private
businesses as well.
   The justices on Monday agreed to decide whether the U.S. Customs
Service, in the interest of fighting drug smuggling, may force
those applying for or holding drug-enforcement jobs to be tested.
   The court will hear arguments in the case next fall, with a
decision on the constitutionality of the Reagan administration
program not expected until 1989.
   The court also may be called upon soon to study drug and alcohol
testing for federal railway workers. A federal appeals court in San
Francisco ruled on Feb. 11 that the railway testing program is
unconstitutional and the Reagan administration said it will appeal
that ruling to the high court.
   Allan Adler of the American Civil Liberties Union said the high
court's action on testing of government workers could influence
private employers, depending on how broad the court ruling is.
   ``The big question is whether the court is going to determine
this on a narrow, fact basis or will it attempt to articulate broad
principles'' involving workers' reasonable expecations of privacy,
he said.
   He said a narrow ruling relying on the special security needs of
the Customs Service would limit the impact in part because ``most
(private) employers have shied away from random, generalized
testing.''
   But a sweeping endorsement of testing by the court could change
that.
   The case before the justices is limited to whether public
officials violate constitutional rights by testing those who are
not suspected of using drugs.
   The outcome will affect tests conducted by federal, state or
local governments but not by industry. Under the law, governments
may not violate any rights protected by the Constitution, but
private individuals or corporations have more leeway.
   Customs Service workers in sensitive jobs must provide urine
samples in restroom stalls as a person overseeing the procedure
waits outside the stall. The tests are conducted by an independent
company hired by the service.
   Administration lawyers said the tests are needed to prevent
agents who used drugs from being bribed or blackmailed. They said
any sacrifice of personal privacy is outweighed by the need to stop
drug smuggling.
   Government lawyers said the tests are particularly important now
because the Customs Service plans to recruit some 3,000 new
employees, including many in the 18-25 age range in which use of
illegal drugs is most prevalent.
   The Customs Service adopted the test procedure under an
executive order President Reagan signed in 1986.
   The procedure is being challenged by the National Treasury
Employees Union, which said subjecting workers to the test is a
humiliating invasion of privacy.
   The union welcomed the high court's intervention.
   Union President Robert M. Tobias said the court's ruling will
clear up ``a legal and moral morass ... and, we hope, destroy
Reagan's plans for wholesale testing of the federal work force.''
   The Transportation Department, with 30,000 employees, has
adopted random testing for its workers. The program covers those in
safety-related jobs such as air traffic controllers, Federal
Aviation Administration pilots and workers with high-rated security
clearance.
   The Customs Service tests, which are not administered randomly,
were upheld by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The appeals court said the tests may be considered searches but
do not intrude unnecessarily on the privacy rights of workers.
   In other actions Monday, the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether states may bar a man from trying to
prove he fathered the child of a woman married to someone else. The
``reverse paternity'' case challenges a California law, similar to
those in many other states, that always considers the woman's
husband the father.
   _Asked the Reagan administration, in a case from Oklahoma,
whether it thinks high-stakes bingo games run by Indian tribes are
subject to state sales taxes.
   _Said it will decide whether employees of a Pentagon
intelligence agency are entitled to administrative hearings when
the government fires them as security risks.

   While Massachusetts Republicans searched for a
candidate for what many believe is a hopeless situation, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy raised $1.32 million in preparation for his
re-election bid.
   Federal Election Commission reports show the Massachusetts
Democrat has $1.01 million in his campaign account after spending
$457,640 during 1987. He raised $826,790 in the last six months of
1987 alone.
   ``We will have a strong candidate,'' promised Joe Malone,
executive director of the state Republican Party, in a recent
interview. ``As of now, discussions are still going on.''
   But it is no secret that the state's few big-name Republicans,
including party chief Raymond Shamie, have no desire to put on a
quixotic campaign against Kennedy, who is seeking his sixth term.
   One potential candidate is Thomas Carhart, a program analyst at
the Pentagon's strategic defense office who is considering a Senate
run. His family is from the Amherst area.
   Carhart said in a recent interview he would decide in several
weeks whether to run.
   Carhart, 44, is a graduate of West Point and the University of
Michigan Law School. He has been a platoon leader in Vietnam, an
analyst at the Rand Corp., the editor of a tax journal, author of a
book about Vietnam, an attorney and a leading activist against the
controversial Vietnam Memorial in Washington.
   But Carhart has little experience in politics and is a virtual
unknown in Massachusetts. Republican Party strategists are quietly
working to get a better-known candidate to run against Kennedy.
   The senator's year-end FEC report showed he received most of his
1987 campaign contributions _ $1.06 million _ from individual
contributors. The remaining $263,000 came from political action
committees.

<HEAD>Reagan May Sign Bill Providing Only Humanitarian Aid To Contras</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is indicating he would sign a
bill giving only humanitarian aid to Nicaragua's rebels if it
preserves his option of seeking military funds in the future.
   Reagan told the American Legion convention that ``preventing the
consolidation of a pro-Soviet regime on the American mainland is a
crucial test of national security.''
   On the eve of today's scheduled House Rules Committee
consideration of a humanitarian aid package, he seemed resigned to
the fact there will be no immediate vote for military aid.
   ``Some say they're willing to support some type of humanitarian
aid, but are doing everything they can do disband the freedom
fighters,'' Reagan said. ``But there's nothing humanitarian about
asking people to go up against Soviet attack helicopters armed only
with boots and bandages.''
   Reagan used the American Legion address to remind Congress of
his intentions as he prepared to leave for the summit with NATO
partners in Brussels, Belgium. He is concerned about possible
showdown votes on Contra aid, first in the Rules Committee and
later in the week on the House floor.
   The committee is weighing a $30.5 million Contra aid bill,
sponsored by Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., and other Democrats, which
would provide no military assistance.
   A rival Republican bill would be in much the same form as the
$36.2 million piece of legislation that Reagan had sought earlier
this year, except there would be no money contained in the bill for
a military escrow account.
   In an attempt to win enactment of the $36.2 million measure in
early February, Reagan told Congress he would consult with leading
lawmakers before releasing the $3.6 million in an escrow fund for
military use. The House defeated the bill by eight votes. It was
passed in the Senate, but the vote was only symbolic.
   The CIA's authority to carry out airlifts of supplies to the
rebels expired at midnight. Reagan did not mention this Monday. But
he did say that ``whatever package emerges from the Congress must
include a provision for expedited procedures that would allow us to
request official military aid to the freedom fighters should the
peace process break down.''
   Reagan said that since the $36.2 million Contra aid package was
defeated, the Sandinistas have been ambivalent about promised
reforms, causing Cardinal Obando y Bravo to suspend peace talks he
has been mediating.
   ``Unless the freedom fighters remain a viable force, the peace
process will remain what it was before _ an empty charade, dragging
endlessly and fruitlessly on while the Soviets continue the
military buildup on the American mainland,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan told his audience that if all assistance is stopped, the
rebels ``will be picked off one by one'' by the leftist Sandinista
regime in Managua.
   ``Are we going to cut them off now and leave them defenseless
against the Sandinistas? If we do, who will ever trust in the
United States again? How can we remain a world power if we gain a
reputation for pulling the plug on the people that placed their
trust in us?''

   Congress may be upset about the number of
officers in the U.S. military, but the armed forces of some of
America's closest allies are much more top-heavy, a survey has
found.
   Of 11 nations surveyed by a military journal, only two had a
lower ratio of admirals and generals to active-duty personnel than
the United States _ Austria and West Germany.
   Moreover, the No. 1 country among those surveyed _ Canada _ has
built a military force whose ratio of generals and admirals to
active-duty forces is more than three times that of the United
States.
   The survey was conducted by the monthly magazine ``Armed Forces
Journal'' and the results summarized in its March issue, published
today. The magazine said it contacted the defense ministries
directly or else turned to foreign embassies in Washington for the
information needed to make a comparison of active-duty forces.
   Austria possesses easily the leanest of the military
establishments surveyed, with just 5 generals leading an
active-duty force of 54,700, the survey found. That translates to
just 0.9 generals per 10,000 active-duty personnel, the magazine
reported.
   The next eight countries fall into a range that runs from 4
generals and admirals per 10,000 active-duty personnel to about 9
generals per 10,000. The United States is in this group with a
ratio of 4.9 generals and admirals for every 10,000 active-duty
personnel.
   The final two countries _ Britain and Canada _ are in a class by
themselves, the magazine reported. Britain has 476 generals and
admirals to lead its 320,000 men and women on active duty, or a
ratio of 14.9 per 10,000, while Canada has 141 generals and
admirals for 87,254 active-duty personnel, or a ratio of 16.2 per
10,000.
   At the other end of the scale, West Germany followed Austria
with 199 generals and admirals for its 495,000 on active duty, or a
ratio of 4.0 generals and admirals per 10,000 troops.
   The United States has slightly more than 2.1 million men and
women under arms. As of November, when the information was
compiled, Congress had authorized 1,073 slots for generals and
admirals and 1,057 of those jobs were filled.
   Either number produces the same ratio of roughly 4.9 per 10,000.
   Congress, complaining about what it calls ``grade creep,''
imposed the cap of 1,073 active-duty slots for generals and
admirals in 1981. Lawmakers have refused ever since to raise it
despite repeated Pentagon entreaties.
   Congress also ordered the Defense Department in its fiscal 1987
budget to begin reducing the number of lower-ranking officers in
the military. The Pentagon is under orders to reduce its officer
corps of colonels and captains by 6 percent by fiscal 1990 _ or
more than 18,000 job slots.
   Before the cutting began, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine
Corps had more than 308,700 officers on active duty, or roughly one
officer for every 5.9 enlisted personnel. By next September, that
number must fall to 302,620, with additional cuts to follow.

<HEAD>IRS Rules Allowed Contras To Bypass Paperwork For New Foundation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Contra rebels, looking for a tax-exempt
organization to carry out fund raising, used a legal shortcut to
take over a foundation begun by political conservatives to promote
understanding of ``governmental systems.''
   By reconstituting an existing foundation, the Contras avoided
the time nd lengthy application process generally entailed in
applying to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status.
   What now goes by the name of the Nicaraguan Resistance
Educational Foundation was originally the John Davis Lodge
Foundation for International Studies, according to IRS records.
   The Contra foundation has not filed its first tax return yet
because the changeover occurred just last fall.
   The Lodge foundation stated in its application for tax-exempt
status in 1982 that its purpose would be to ``foster, develop and
promote, among people of the world, in a nonpartisan basis, a
greater understanding and awareness of comparative governmental
systems, international policies and the relationships between
sovereign states.''
   The late John Davis Lodge was a Connecticut governor and
congressman, and ambassador to Argentina, Switzerland and Spain.
The grandson of Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, he was an
ardent anti-communist and chaired Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential
campaign in Connecticut. He died in 1985 at age 82.
   He was also a mentor to conservative political consultant Roger
Stone of Virginia. Stone set up the Lodge foundation in 1982 to
host forums and publish educational materials.
   ``It was set up as a hardline anti-communist'' organization, but
the foundation never really got off the ground and published only
one monograph by former United Nations Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick, Stone said.
   Last fall, Stone learned from his wife that the rebels needed a
foundation to collect money for their cause.
   It so happens that Ann Stone has a direct mail fund-raising
business and the Contras are one of her clients. ``She had
something to do with it,'' Roger Stone said of the idea to turn his
foundation over to the Contras.
   ``She made the argument it was consistent with the original
purposes of the foundation.''
   So last October, Stone and two business partners, Charlie Black
and Paul Manafort, whom Stone had installed as original board
members, met and voted themselves off the board. They turned the
organization over to newly elected board members Ernesto Palazio,
the Contras' Washington spokesman, and two Miami Contra officials,
Leonardo Somarriba and Mario Zeledon.
   Now the foundation is the principal conduit for funds the
Contras are raising privately. The rebels have placed increasing
emphasis on these efforts in the wake of Congress' recent rejection
of new U.S. aid.
   The Contras say the money they are raising from U.S. citizens is
for humanitarian aid only.
   Raising money for weapons is not a tax-exempt function, and
Contra backers ran afoul of that law in last year's Iran-Contra
scandal.
   The IRS permits changes in purpose and makeup of a foundation as
long as the new group is still within the guidelines of tax-exempt
purposes, said IRS spokesman Wilson Fadely.
   The Contra foundation in December received $140,000 from the
fund created in memory of the late CIA Director William J. Casey,
and Contra officials said the money was for a rehabilitation
hospital for their wounded and maimed soldiers.

   The government still prints money on paper for
all debts public and private, but the Reagan administration says it
will gladly take plastic.
   The Office of Management and Budget on Monday announced a new
progam to increase dramatically the government's use of credit
cards _ both for buying and selling.
   Not only will the government start accepting credit cards from
the public for such items as passports and payments on college
loans, but the OMB said it also hopes to develop a plan under which
government officials and purchasing agents will use cards.
   ``Eventually, the Office of Management and Budget will be able
to require that all purchases made (by the government) under $2,500
be by credit card,'' the OMB said in President Reagan's
``management'' report on the federal government.
   In fact, the report itself can be purchased by mail with VISA or
MasterCard, for $6.50. (The president's fiscal 1989 budget costs
$18).
   Budget Director James C. Miller III told a White House news
briefing he did have a few qualms about use of credit cards as an
alternative to legal tender _ for a goverment that was $150 billion
in the red last year.
   But, he added, by allowing citizens to repay their government
debts with credit cards, ``We're collecting some of this (debt)
rather than just letting it ride.''
   Under the expanded program, the government is expected to
process 130 million credit-card transactions annually by 1991, or
$6.5 billion worth, said Joseph Wright, deputy OMB director.
   ``It will make us the largest credit card user in the world,''
Wright said.
   Wright said, however, that the cards won't be accepted for tax
payments _ at least not yet. That would require seeking legislation
from Congress, something the administration isn't now prepared to
do.
   However, Wright said the subject is being explored with the
Internal Revenue Service.
   The government for some time has accepted credit cards for
specified items, including publications of the Government Printing
Office.
   More recently, the Customs Service has accepted credit cards for
duty collection at most U.S. airports and the U.S. Mint is now
accepting them for coin sales.
   The management report also said that the government is studying,
for possible future use, a system under which ``smart cards'' would
be issued by the government to people who receive Social Security
and other payments and benefits.
   ``These cards (would) have embedded on them information about
the cardholder that can be accessed electronically. Potentially
(the) cards could make available funds for food stamps, social
security payments, or grants and control their use electronically
through central computers.''
   And what's to keep the government from running up large interest
payments on its past-due credit card accounts, just like it has
with the national debt?
   ``We're not going to pay (interest) because we're not going to
let them go beyond 30 days,'' Wright said.

   R.H. Macy & Co. has proposed a $6.6 billion
merger with Federated Department Stores Inc., topping a rival $6.1
billion offer from Toronto-based Campeau Corp., Federated said late
Monday night.
   The $73.80-a-share offer from Macy's was disclosed as
Federated's board considered a $68 a share negotiated offer from
Campeau for all of Federated's 89.6 million common shares
outstanding.
   The board took no action on the Campeau bid but directed its
management, and advisers to investigate Macy's proposals, to
negotiate a definitive agreement and submit both negotiated
agreements to the board as soon as possible, the company stated.
   Officials of Federated, the nation's largest operator of
department stores including such well-known retailers as
Bloomingdale's, Filene's and Bullock's, did not know when the board
would get the proposals, according to spokeswoman Carol Sanger.
   Macy's would make a cash tender offer for approximately 80
percent of Federated's outstanding shares at $73.80 per share,
Federated said.
   The board of directors of the merged company, which would be
renamed Macy's-Federated Inc., would include significant
representation from the existing Federated board, Federated said.
   Federated operates more than 650 department stores, specialty
stores, mass merchandising stores and supermarkets in 36 states.
Annual sales exceeded $11 billion in 1987.
   Macy's, which was taken private in a $3.6 billion management
leveraged buyout in 1986, operates 100 department stores and
recently opened three specialty clothing stores. Its annual sales
were $5.21 billion in the fiscal year that ended last Aug. 1.
   Macy's offices in New York were closed when Federated announced
the proposal late Monday, and a spokesman could not be reached for
comment.
   Federated had announced earlier that its board was considering a
third-party proposal that was competitive to Campeau's offer.
   A Campeau spokeswoman declined earlier Monday to comment on the
last-minute bid, although Campeau repeatedly has stated it wanted
the opportunity to meet competing offers.

   Soviet officials are optimistic about a
strategic arms accord being reached before a summit this summer
despite President Reagan's remark last week that not enough time is
left.
   The Soviets hope major disagreements in the Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks can be settled at a March 22-23 meeting in
Washington between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and his
Soviet counterpart Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``We remain optimistic,'' said a Soviet diplomat who has been
involved in the negotiations in Geneva on long-range weapons. He
spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   ``We are near the finishing line,'' he said, and ``there is
still plenty of time'' before Shultz and Shevardnadze meet.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze ordered their aides to draft, before
that March meeting, agreements on three areas: verifying
compliance, dismantling weapons, and exchanging data on the
arsenals.
   ``These three drafts constitute the bulk of the work to be
done'' on the treaty, although several major points of disagreement
remain, the Soviet official said.
   Reagan, in an interview published last Friday by The Washington
Post, said he did not think it possible to reach an accord before
the summit, which is expected in late May or early June.
   ``We're not at this moment anticipating that it would be ready
for signature then,' Reagan told the Post. But he said the deal was
possible before he leaves office next January.
   The proposed treaty would cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 35
percent to 50 percent, setting a limit of 6,000 on the overall
number of warheads with ranges of more than 3,400 miles.
   The Soviets are balking at a U.S. demand to limit the number of
warheads on land-based missiles to 3,300 and the number of warheads
aboard so-called heavy missiles to 1,650, according to U.S.
officials.
   And the Soviets want to set a limit on numbers of sea-launched
cruise missiles, above the 6,000 warhead ceiling. U.S. officials
have objected to such a limit, in part because it would be
difficult to verify.
   The Soviet official repeated a remark by Kremlin leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev that technology exists to detect nuclear weapons
aboard naval vessels, a statement that U.S. experts question.
   ``Such things as sublimits need to be worked out at the highest
political levels,'' such as the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting in
March, the official said.
   ``The bulk of the work, the technical details, is in the three
drafts and needs to be worked out at the expert level'' before the
tough political decisions, he said.
   The official also said the Kremlin might drop its objections to
tests in space of Reagan's Star Wars missile defense system if some
limits could be negotiated beforehand.
   He said the Soviet Union would countenance some space tests as
long as both sides agreed they did not violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   The diplomat noted that Reagan and Gorbachev agreed at the
December summit in Washington to abide by the ABM treaty.
   But the joint communique issued at summit did not address
U.S.-Soviet disagreement on the extent to which the treaty
restricted space tests of weapons such as lasers and other devices
that were not in use when the ABM pact was signed.
   The Soviets are seeking a U.S. response to their proposal to set
limits on tests for various Star Wars components such as lasers,
the official said.
   U.S. negotiators have rejected such limits, saying that
compliance would be impossible to verify in space.

   Here, at a glance, is the latest on AIDS.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHAT IT IS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that destroys the body's immune system. It is incurable and
usually fatal. Death comes from infections or cancers that the body
cannot fight.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHAT CAUSES IT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and
is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, or
from an infected birthing mother to her baby.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WHO GETS IT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and intravenous
drug abusers. Health officials estimate that heterosexual contact
is responsible for 4 percent of cases and that between 1 million
and 1.5 million Americans have been exposed to the virus.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW IT'S DETECTED</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Screening for AIDS is conducted by testing blood for the
presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus. The test tells only if a
person has been exposed to the virus. A person with a positive test
has a 20 percent to 30 percent chance of developing AIDS over a
five-year period, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOW MANY HAVE IT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As of Feb. 22, AIDS had been diagnosed in 54,233 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 30,355, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to
have recovered from AIDS.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>POSSIBLE TREATMENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Numerous types of medicines against the AIDS virus are now being
studied. They are in three categories: antivirals that combat the
virus; anti-infectives that treat the opportunistic infections and
malignancies that occur with AIDS; and immune modulators that
strengthen the immune system. An antiviral, AZT (for
azidothymidine), has received Food and Drug Administration approval
and early results show it is effective in halting progress of the
AIDS virus. At least 16 other antivirals are in some stage of
development and testing.
   Scientists also are searching for a vaccine against the virus,
but this research is in early stages.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional critic of federal officials'
flying in style on taxpayer-supplied executive aircraft says he's
unhappy with an Army move to clip the wings of the Corps of
Engineers.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., expressed his displeasure Monday after
the Army told him the corps had been been stripped of day-to-day
control of three aircraft that have been called wasteful by Army
and congressional auditors.
   James Ambrose, who stepped down Friday as undersecretary of the
Army, said he ordered the executive aircraft placed in a central
pool, forcing the corps brass to compete against other Army
commanders for their use.
   ``The pooled operation, we anticipate, will yield economies,''
Ambrose told Synar's Government Operations subcommittee on
environment, energy and natural resources.
   Lt. Gen. Elvin Heiberg III, the three-star chief of engineers,
told the hearing that ``I concur with the decision made by my boss.
... We'll have to compete.''
   Last summer, the Army Audit Agency said the corps had been using
the aircraft not for emergencies such as floods but for routine and
ceremonial matters, many of them overseas trips on which leaders
were accompanied improperly by spouses.
   Ambrose said that before they can use any of the aircraft,
Heiberg and other corps leaders will have to get flight-by-flight
permission from the director of Army staff in the Pentagon.
   Synar said he was displeased because the director of staff has
been responsible for authorizing travel by corps spouses, who Army
regulations say must have an ``unquestionable official'' role in a
government-financed trip.
   ``Unless he does a better job than he has done with spouse
travel, this isn't going to be much of a safeguard,'' Synar said.
   Heiberg and other corps officials have defended their use of the
aircraft on grounds that they are more efficient than commercial
flights.
   Ambrose's action partially settled an in-Army fight between the
corps and the Army auditors, who said last year that tax dollars
could be saved by selling the planes and having corps officials use
commercial or charter flights.
   Ambrose said the Army would decide later this year whether to
sell the aircraft, including Castle I, the 14-passenger jet that
has been used to ferry key members of Congress on trips to visit
water projects around the nation.
   Before the aircraft can be sold, however, Congress will have to
repeal a law forbidding such a sale. The prohibition was quietly
enacted in December at the behest of one of those flyers, Rep. Tom
Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee
that handles corps funding.
   Bevill said he disagreed with the Army auditors and with similar
findings made over the years by the congressional General
Accounting Office.
   ``All three planes are needed,'' Bevill said. ``They do their
best work when there's floods and emergencies.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Emmett R. Cox's handling
of the 1985 vote fraud trial of three Alabama civil rights
activists has come under fire during a Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing on his nomination to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Morton Stavis, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights
in New York, told the panel Monday that Cox displayed ``an
intolerance toward and a failure to respect'' a black lawyer
involved in the trial and issued rulings that raised questions
about his sensitivity to racial issues.
   Stavis' testimony marked the second time that the vote fraud
trial has been used as the basis for opposing one of President
Reagan's judicial nominees.
   The trial, which civil rights groups charged was part of an
effort by the Reagan administration to intimidate black voters in
the South, ended in innocent verdicts for all three activists.
   It then became the focal point of a 1986 campaign by civil
rights groups against Reagan's nomination of U.S. Attorney
Jefferson B. Sessions III to a federal judgeship in south Alabama.
   Sessions, who was prosecutor at the vote fraud trial, was
rejected by the Judiciary Committee, marking the first time that
one of Reagan's judicial nominees has been voted down in committee.
   While the Sessions nomination drew opposition from a host of
civil rights groups, Stavis was the only witness Monday who
testified in opposition to Cox. The committee did not vote on the
nomination, but Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who presided at the
hearing, predicted that Cox would win Senate confirmation within a
month.
   Stavis criticized Cox's decision during the 1985 trial to bring
criminal contempt of court charges against Howard Moore, a
California lawyer who represented one of the activists. Cox had
ruled that Moore's questioning of a witness violated his order
barring defense attorneys from raising the issue of selective
prosecution.
   That contempt ruling later was reversed by the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Stavis, who represented Moore, told
the Judiciary Committee that ``there was absolutely no foundation''
for the contempt charge.
   Cox acknowledged Monday that the appeals court had ``fairly
concluded'' that he had been wrong to cite Moore for contempt.
``They educated me on the law of criminal contempt,'' he said.
   Stavis also charged that Cox had shown a lack of racial
sensivitity by refusing to delay the trial for two weeks so the
jury could be selected from a jury pool drawn from the Selma, Ala.,
area, which had a much larger percentage of blacks than did the
jury pool drawn from the Mobile, Ala., area.
   Cox declined during the hearing to respond specifically to
Stavis' testimony about the jury selection issue. But he told
reporters afterwards that racial considerations played no part in
his handling of the case.

   The Reagan administration says it won't go
forward with $105 million in retaliatory sanctions against Brazil
at this time, citing ``some progress'' in relaxing trade barriers
against U.S. computer software sales.
   The administration earlier this year announced that it would
slap the duties on a variety of Brazilian products to protest the
restrictions.
   However, since then there has been a thaw in U.S.-Brazilian
relations, both on the trade and Third World debt front.
   A new software law in Brazil, which calls for a new set of
regulations governing imports of foreign-made computer programs and
other software, helped prompt the administration decision to delay
its sanctions.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, citing ``recent
progress,'' in the dispute, said in a statement on Monday: ``The
United States will delay sanctions against Brazil pending review of
the implementing regulations for Brazil's new software law.
   ``Subsequent to that, we will review our options and consider
what actions, if any, to take.''
   The list of specific Brazilian exports to be targeted had never
been released, even though a preliminary list included
Brazilian-made shoes, aircraft, automobiles and electronics
equipment.
   The issue of access of U.S. computer software companies to
markets in Brazil ``will remain a high priority for the U.S.
government,'' Yeutter said.
   ``Recent Brazilian actions, and discussions with representatives
of the government of Brazil, demonstrate progress on this issue,''
Yeutter said. ``Some of our immediate concerns have now been met.''
   The new Brazilian law will regulate commercial sales of all
software, both domestic and foreign. It calls for new regulations
to be issued by April 19.
   ``As a result, we feel it would be inappropriate and
counterproductive to proceed with our previously announced plans to
retaliate,'' Yeutter said. ``That proposed action will be placed on
hold until we have a chance to evaluate Brazil's response on the
software regulations.''
   Adding to the atmosphere of eased relations between Brazil and
its key trading partners has been Brazil's participation in
negotiations on a loan restructuring package.
   Key portions of that pact were reached over the weekend as
Brazil, Latin America's largest debtor nation, agreed to make a
$700 million interest payment to make it current for all of 1988
and the last quarter of 1987.
   Brazil hasn't repaid any principal on its $114 billion foreign
debt since 1983. In February 1987, it decreed a moratorium on
interest payments but late last year agreed to resume them.

   A throat operation couldn't stop Katharine
Hepburn from making the upcoming TV film ``Laura Lansing Slept
Here,'' but it wasn't an easy decision.
   Hepburn said her problem became evident when she showed up for
the first script reading last fall in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   She opened her mouth and ``no voice. Total hoarse. Just a
rasp,'' she wrote in the March 5 issue of TV Guide. ``I was
thinking: Do it _ don't do it. ... If I can't talk, then there is
no movie _ that's a lot of people out of work.''
   She identified herself as her doctor's Aunt Nora when she
checked into Vancouver General Hospital, but ``everyone immediately
recognized me, and they were trying not to show it.''
   A day later, she found out the growth wasn't cancerous. It was
``just one of those growths that the human body throws out to
torment us,'' Hepburn said.

   Several months ago, Pulitzer Prize-winning
playwright and actor Jason Miller looked at his 80-year-old father
and realized theater could benefit from the energy and experience
of the elderly.
   Miller then decided to start a theater group for senior citizens
in this former coal mecca.
   ``We're talking about the vitality of senior citizens, the
intelligence, the talent that's lying dormant because there hasn't
been an opportunity to express themselves,'' he said.
   Rehearsals began last week for the group's first play, ``It's a
Sin to Tell a Lie,'' written by Miller, who played a priest in the
movie ``The Exorcist.''
   ``Senior citizens' theater should be as viable and as energetic
as children's theater, but nobody has senior citizens' theater,''
said Miller, winner of a 1973 Pulitzer Prize for ``That
Championship Season.''
   The one-act play is scheduled to open April 9 at the Scranton
Public Theater and will tour nursing homes in northeastern
Pennsylvania, offering senior citizens free admission, Miller said.

Hammer, who has been dealing with Soviet leaders since Lenin.
   The crew from Gosteleradio, the Soviet Union's government

to visit the college he funded here, the Armand Hammer United World
College of the American West.
   The crew spent a couple of hours filming at the college Monday
before heading on to New York with Hammer, who is chairman of
Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Gosteleradio requested the one-hour film be made in honor of
Hammer's birthday May 21. The documentary is slated to be broadcast
the night of May 21 on Soviet television.
   Hammer first went to the Soviet Union in the 1920s as a

   Actor Eric Roberts was put on probation for six
months by a judge who told him to ``stay out of trouble.''
   Roberts, 31, was sentenced Monday for a Dec. 3 incident in which
he went to a woman's apartment at 2:30 a.m., pounded on the door
and demanded to be let in. The woman instead called police.
   Roberts was charged with attempted assault, resisting arrest and
other lesser charges after he allegedly took a swing at one of the
officers. The major charges were dropped in January, and Roberts
agreed to plead guilty to harassment, which is punishable by up to
15 days in jail.
   Judge Bruce Allen told the actor that if he stayed out of
trouble during the next six months his record for the current
offense will be sealed.
   Roberts starred in the movies ``King of the Gypsies,'' ``The
Pope of Greenwich Village'' and ``Star 80.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the latest auction with three-month bills
dropping to the lowest level since November while rates on
six-month bills edged up.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 5.62 percent, down from 5.64
percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.86 percent, up from 5.83 percent
last week.
   The rates on three-month bills were the lowest since 5.49
percent on Nov. 30 while the six-month bills were the highest since
they averaged 6.03 percent on Feb. 16.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.78 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,857.90 and 6.12 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,703.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield

   The cat came to stay but the Capitol mice
played anyway _ around an ambassador's feet.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., has a mouse problem.
   He shares it with other members of the Democratic leadership who
occupy offices in the oldest part of the Capitol, the part that
survived after the British burned the building in 1814.
   The mice call it home but House leaders and their staffs call it
disturbing.
   So traps were set and baited with cheese.
   The mice ignored then.
   Then Foley called in reinforcements.
   He brought his cat to work, a feline with a proven reputation as
a champion mouser.
   The cat moved in with the Foleys a dozen years ago while they
were on vacation in the Caribbean.
   Since the cat had chosen them, and not they the cat, they gave
the animal an appropriate name _ ``Roger the Lodger.''
   Roger was brought in to lodge for awhile in Foley's office suite
on the first floor of the Capitol, sharing quarters not only with
the mice but with Foley's dog, Alice, who accompanies the majority
leader to work on a daily basis.
   Expectations ran high for Roger. But the results were poor.
   Roger the Lodger bagged no mice.
   The mouser's failure was underscored on Monday during a meeting
in an adjoining office used by Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the
chief deputy Democratic leader.
   Bonior was conferring over coffee with Jan Kinast, the Polish
ambassador to the United States.
   Suddenly a mouse darted out from behind a small chest.
   It ran across the carpet and disappeared under the conference
table, literally at the startled ambassador's feet.
   The House leadership is looking for a new weapon in its war
against mice.

   The Senate's sergeant at arms _ Henry Giugni _ became an instant
celebrity last week when he followed orders and arrested Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore.
   Giugni's posse had Packwood carried onto the Senate floor to
constitute a quorum so consideration could continue of a
controversial campaign financing act, then besieged by a filibuster.
   It was not the first time a senate sergeant of arms has been the
focus of attention by the Senate and the press.
   On Feb. 7, 1935, the Senate voted to fire Sergeant at Arms David
S. Barry.
   Barry's offense: The 72-year-old former journalist had written a
magazine article entitled ``Over the Hill to Demagoguery'' which he
had thought would be published after he left office.
   But the publication date was moved up and when the article
appeared it began with these words:
   ``Contrary, perhaps, to the popular belief, there are not many
crooks in Congress; that is out and out grafters, or those who are
willing to be such.
   ``There are not many senators or representatives who sell their
votes for money, and it is pretty well known who those few are.
   ``But there are many demagogues.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, who recounted the incident on
the Senate floor recently, said the article probably would have
been ignored had it been written by a journalist.
   ``But for the Senate's sergeant at arms it was an entirely
different matter,'' Dole said. ``So the Senate voted him out of
office, less than a month before his term would have ended.''

   So Congress over the decades has busily subdivided the calendar
into days, weeks, months and even years in honor of some historic
figure, event, cause, profession or industry or thing.
   It was in that spirit early last month that Rep. Robert W.
Kastenmeier, D-Wis., offered a resolution designating the week of
Oct. 30 through Nov. 5 as National Jukebox Week.
   ``As a rich chronicler of music, culture and technology, the
jukebox is without peer,'' Kastenmeier informed the House. ``It has
brought great joy and memories to generations of Americans. Its
popularity is unequaled in the eyes of young and old alike.''
   Besides, he said, the juke box is on the advent of its
centennial.
   The very first juke box, a wax cylinder Edison phonograph fitted
with a coin slot, was installed in San Francisco's Palais Royale
Saloon in 1889.
   Just the thing, the Kastenmeier resolution said, to be observed
``with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities.''
   But if juke boxes bore, perhaps doll houses are the ticket.
   Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., wants to designate the week of
October 9 as National Dollhouse Week.
   After all, Smith contended, ``about 10 percent of our population
has some involvement with dollhouse and miniature collecting.''
   The source of that statistic, he disclosed, is the Miniatures
Industry Association of America.

<HEAD>Resolution Says No Aid Cutoff Until Soviets Completely Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd is
hinting he may delay Senate consideration of the new U.S.-Soviet
nuclear arms reduction treaty if the White House ends U.S. military
aid to insurgents in Afghanistan before a complete and final Soviet
troop withdrawal.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., commented shortly before the Senate voted 77-0 on
Monday to adopt a resolution urging the White House not to cut off,
suspend or reduce military aid to the Afghan resistance ``until it
is absolutely clear that the Soviets have terminated their military
occupation.''
   The non-binding resolution also urged formation of an interim
government in Kabul acceptable to the Afghan resistance.
   Byrd said the resolution is intended to ``send a clear message''
to the administration that the Senate wants no part of any
U.S.-Soviet agreement in which U.S. aid to the Afghan resistance is
ended merely on Moscow's promise to withdraw its troops, not on
their actual removal.
   Byrd and Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and Steven Symms,
R-Idaho, took strong exception to congressional testimony last week
in which Robert A. Peck, an assistant deputy secretary of State,
said the United States would be prepared, ``if completely satisfied
with the overall agreement, to prohibit U.S. military assistance to
the Afghan resistance.''
   Peck also testified last week: ``We will continue our assistance
... until that support is no longer needed. But the question of
when to cut off aid is one that should be left to the president.''
   Symms said Peck's testimony leads many to fear a ``superpower
deal ... that will allow the Soviets to gain politically what they
could not gain on the battlefield.''
   Byrd said, ``I'd like to know what's in these agreements before
I call up the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty,''
Byrd said.
   ``I don't want the Senate kept in the dark,'' he added.
   The INF treaty, which calls for the elimination of medium-range
nuclear missiles from Europe, is under examination by the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and two other Senate panels.
   It could reach the Senate floor for action by the end of March
or early April.
   Byrd supports Senate ratification of the treaty without
reservations that would force its renegotiation. He said last week
that includes a reservation linking implementation of the pact to
complete Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.

<HEAD>International Study Shows American Students Far Behind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students in most other countries are far
better educated in science than are American students, according to
an international study that one U.S. official said emphasizes ``the
troubled state of science education in the United States.''
   In a report released Monday by the National Science Foundation,
U.S. students at three different grade levels all scored well
behind those from most other nations, with some American
14-year-olds scoring at the level of the ``scientifically
illiterate.''
   ``For a technologically advanced country, it would appear that
(in the United States) a re-examination of how science is presented
and studied is required,'' said the study, which was conducted by
the International Association for Evaluation of Educational
Achievement, an association of research centers.
   Erich Bloch, director of the National Science Foundation, said
of the study: ``These findings emphasize again the troubled state
of science education in the United States. ... America's future as
a world technological and economic leader and the quality of life
we enjoy depend on confronting the real problems in science
education with vigor, determination and a sense of urgency.''
   The study was conducted by the International Association for
Evaluation of Educational Achievement, an association of research
centers. Early findings, which compared the United States only with
Japan and England, and with partial findings from Israel and
Sweden, were reported by The Associated Press in September.
   The comparative study was based on tests administered to 204,308
students at 7,581 schools in 24 countries between 1983 and 1986.
The tests were given at three academic levels: near the end of
primary grades, at about age 10; at grades eight and nine, about
age 14; and in the final year of high school.
   Among 10-year-olds, students in Japan, Korea and Finland scored
around 15.4 out of 24 possible correct answers. U.S. students
scored just below the middle of the scale at 13.2.
   Among 14-year-olds, Hungary, Japan and the Netherlands scored at
the top, while Americans ranked third from last with a mean score
of 16.5 out of 30 possible correct answers. The lowest-scoring
quarter of this age group, the report said, ``were scientifically
illiterate'' with their test scores ``at chance level.''
   Tests for the high school seniors were given only to those
specializing in science subjects. Hong Kong, England and Singapore
scored highest, with the United States students receiving among the
lowest marks.
   In an analysis of the U.S. results, the report said: ``The
achievement of advanced science students in biology, chemistry and
physics is low. The biology results are especially low.''
   The study said that the United States, along with Australia,
Canada, Finland, Italy and Sweden, has ``many poor scoring schools
and it would seem likely that the school authorities would have
grounds for concern.''
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, responding to a
report of the study, said it supports an assessment on U.S.
education that his department released last week.
   ``Now comes this international report card showing that compared
to students in other countries, American elementary and high school
students are not just in a `dead stall,' they're doing even
worse,'' Bennett said. ``They're in reverse and going downhill.''
   The international study also compared the difference in science
achievement based on gender. In grades five and nine, boys scored
higher than girls in all countries. For grade 12, boys outperformed
girls in biology, chemistry and physics, except in Australia, Hong
Kong and Sweden, where girls had top marks in biology.

<HEAD>Owens-Illinois Acquires Most Of Brockway At $60 A Share</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Owens-Illinois Inc. has acquired virtually all
outstanding shares of Brockway Inc. stock to the tune of about $740
million and is on the verge of creating the nation's largest glass
container company, offcials say.
   Monday's move followed a decision by the government against
appealing a court decision in favor of the merger.
   Owens-Illinois spokesman Sam Allen said the company bought
12,337,630 shares of common Brockway stock, 98.7 percent of the
outstanding shares. Allen said the actual merger will likely occur
in a couple of weeks, at which time the remaining shares will be
purchased.
   Robert Lanigan, chairman of Owens-Illinois, said the merger will
make the combined operations and the glass container industry
``significantly more competitive with can, plastic and other
materials in the worldwide packaging business.''
   Susan Ticknor, spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission,
declined to specify why the agency decided against appealing a
decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals that, in effect, paving the
way for the merger.
   However, Ms. Ticknor said the FTC has scheduled administrative
hearings on potential anticompetitive effects of the merger. And
she said Owens-Illinois could be ordered to divest itself of
Brockway holdings if the agency determines that the merger violates
antitrust laws.
   The Toledo, Ohio, based Owens-Illinois proposed to buy Brockway,
of Jacksonville, Fla., last September for $60 a share.
   The merger will make the combined company the nation's largest
manufacturer of glass containers, which are used in packaging foods
and beverages. The largest producer of glass containers has been
Anchor Glass Container Corp., according to the FTC.
   Owens-Illinois officials have said the only weapon the glass
container industry has against plastics and metal packaging
producers is competitive pricing and the merger with Brockway is
designed to increase productivity and lower costs.
   The FTC had attempted in court to block the merger, saying it
might violate antitrust laws by substantially reducing competition
and creating the conditions for price discrimination.
   However, last month U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Hens Green
denied the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction on the basis
that the agency had failed to prove the deal would harm competition.
   And last Friday, the appeals court sided with Judge Green,
saying that the agency had failed to make its case.

<HEAD>Jackson Showing in Maine Seen as Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's surprise second-place finish
in the Maine Democraatic caucuses was a ``breakthrough,'' proving
conclusively that he has broadened his appeal, his backers say.
   Jackson reaped 28 percent of the vote in the Maine contest on
Sunday, on the heels of respectable showings in three other states
which, like Maine, all have voting age black populations of 1
percent or less.
   The Maine results came after he spent just $13,000 in the state
and campaigned there only two days. The well-funded winner, Michael
Dukakis, is well known to Maine voters as governor of nearby
Massachusetts, and he captured 42 percent.
   ``It shows that we can get votes in any part of the country,''
Jackson said Monday in Pembroke, N.C. ``It shows we have the
broadest base...and our campaign has the strongest appeal.''
   ``The Rainbow Coalition is coming alive,'' he added, invoking
the name he has given to his target constituency of all minority
groups and the economically oppressed.
   Political consultant Ann Lewis, an informal Jackson adviser,
called Maine ``the most significant breakthrough state for him so
far.''
   Bob Beckel, a top political strategist for Walter Mondale's 1984
presidential bid, said Jackson's performance is``a sign of a
growing movement among non-black supporters of Jackson, and for
people to try to ignore it, they're making a great mistake.''
   In Iowa and New Hampshire, Jackson finished fourth out of seven
contenders. In Minnesota he was second with 20 percent in last
week's caucuses.
   In Maine, Jackson's 28 percent contrasted to the 1 percent that
he got when he ran in 1984.
   Campaign manager Gerald Austin said he knew his candidate would
do well in Maine and the goal was to come in second. But Jackson's
margin, well above the single-digit results of the other Democrats,
was better than he had anticipated.
   He credited it to organizing by students and dedicated
volunteers _ the campaign had only two paid staff people in Maine.
   ``It was basically, totally indigenous and independent,'' he
said of the Maine organization. ``They did things on their own.''
   Jackson's core support came out of the university communities in
Orono and Portland, and striking paper workers in Jay, he said.
   He carried Portland and another of the state's largest cities,
Bangor.
   Jackson bought $10,000 worth of TV ads in the days before the
caucuses, and $2,000 on radio. The 10-second TV spots showed the
winning U.S. goal in the 1980 Olypic hockey game against the
Soviets, with an announcer saying as Jackson's picture appeared:
``Just like in the Olympics, one man can make a difference.''
   Beckel, who called Jackson ``one of the best hidden political
stories of the year,'' commented also, ``People don't want to buy
the notion that Jesse Jackson has got a message that people listen
to and that has begun to rise above his blackness ... Somebody in
this party has to to recognize that this is a significant guy in
the party.''
   Political analyst William Schneider, however, questioned whether
Jackson's white votes are really the downtrodden whom he has
targeted. He cited exit polls from Iowa and New Hampshire showing a
good portion of his votes came from upscale, well-educated
liberals, ``the radical chic.''
   But he also noted that Jackson has a strong message that appeals
to many Democrats.
   ``There is no other candidate in the race who really stands for
the old politics ... what I would call Democratic fundamentalism,''
as espoused by the late Sen. Hubert Humphrey, Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, said Schneider.
   Beckel said people ``consistently underestimate'' Jackson.
   ``He's the most charismatic candidate in the field. He's got a
message that's concise, that does not change from place to place.''
   Maine Democratic chairman Rick Barton said timing was a key for
Jackson.
   Jackson's successful appearance at the University of Maine in
Orono on Feb. 11, just after Iowa's caucuses and just before the
New Hampshire primary, was ``just the right time ... when Maine
Democrats were starting to lock in,'' he said.
   Barton said Jackson probably also picked up about 5 percentage
points from people who defected from the flagging campaigns of Paul
Simon and Hart.

   Public stations KUAT-TV in Tucson and KAET-TV in Phoenix started
providing full live coverage when the trial began Monday.
   KFYI, a Phoenix news and talk radio station, put together a
telephone network to feed continuous live coverage to stations in
Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, Sierra
Vista, Prescott Valley, Window Rock and Payson. Some of the
stations were carrying only part of the proceedings, however.
   None of Arizona's commercial television stations carried
gavel-to-gavel coverage, but many chipped in to set up pool
coverage with the public stations, in which all participants are
entitled to broadcast parts of the live proceedings or use excerpts
on later news programs.
   The pool costs could exceed $100,000, said Jim Willi of KPNX-TV

   President Reagan has issued an early St.
Patrick's Day message, saying he wanted to acknowledge ``the world
of debt we owe to the Irish people.''
   Although his message came two and a half weeks ahead of time,
Reagan on Monday took note of the March 17 commemoration, saying
the Irish people ``have created and perpetuated a unique heritage
of faith and freedom, of humor and hope, of scholarship and
sanctity and sacrifice.''
   Reagan, who is of Irish ancestry, went on to say:
   ``With faith and fearlessness, St. Patrick brought Christianity
to Ireland a millennium and a half ago. The annals reveals the
Irish people's eagerness to embrace the faith and to keep it; that
trait remains to this day, a tribute to the Apostle of Ireland and
to his flock in every generation.
   ``May America and Ireland always cherish each other and the
kinship in which we hold St. Patrick's Day.''

   It's a far cry from the Capitol, but it's
got most of the comforts of home.
   Impeached Gov. Evan Mecham still goes to work early and stays
late. But his office-in-exile is in a house he once lived in,
across an alley from a hay barn in the far reaches of this Phoenix
suburb.
   His days are filled with meetings and phone calls, he says,
leaving not much time to follow his televised impeachment trial,
which opened Monday in the state Senate.
   ``No, I didn't watch,'' Mecham said. ``I've been busy. I've got
a lot to do.''
   Mecham met with supporters and attended a meeting downtown. He
took time to hold a news conference in what used to be a sunken
living room. But he didn't hang on every vote in the Senate, which
on Monday decided the House's impeachment document was sufficient
for trial.
   ``Frankly, I haven't tracked the vote and I haven't tried to
interpret anything,'' he said.
   His paid staff of five worked on one side of the
7,000-square-foot ranch-style house while volunteers worked on the
other side to raise money for the governor's legal defense and
recall election campaign.
   Plans were being readied for a Wednesday night rally. Some 300
phone calls come in each day, spokesman Tanner Brown said.
   The house was converted into office space before Mecham was
impeached Feb. 5 and replaced by acting Gov. Rose Mofford, the
former secretary of state.
   Outside, a simple sign identifies the ``Governor Evan Mecham
Headquarters,'' and adds, ``Office Space Available. Inquire
Within.'' The building sits between a farm full of sheep, chickens
and roosters, and a Mormon church.
   Police sometimes guard the front door, and a security system is
in place. Monday's proceedings made the switchboard light up, a
receptionist said, including a series of obscene phone calls.
   Mecham said he won't venture downtown to the Senate unless it's
necessary.
   ``When my attorney tells me I should be there, I'll be there,''
he said.
   He said he was disappointed the Senate chose not to grant
requests for a delay in the trial since his new chief counsel has
been on the case less than a week, but was confident in his defense.
   ``We have no choice. We have a time to get ready by,'' he said.
   ``I feel confident we'll be able to get our case out and I think
we'll be successful,'' the governor said. ``If the decision is made
on the evidence, I expect to get 29 votes.''
   One member of the 30-member chamber is absent from the trial
because of illness. A two-thirds vote is needed to convict Mecham.
   Mecham was impeached on allegations of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from a special fund and attempting
to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat involving a
state official.
   He also has been indicted in state district court on six felony
counts involving the $350,000 loan, which amounted to about a third
of his campaign funds, and faces a criminal trial March 22. Mecham
also faces a recall election May 17.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
turned distinctly chilly toward Mikhail S. Gorbachev ahead of this
week's NATO summit here, apparently worried the Soviet leader may
be wooing the West too well.
   ``The Russian bear was easier to deal with when it looked more
like a bear than it does now,'' aides quoted Mrs. Thatcher as
telling a private meeting of NATO ambassadors on Feb. 17.
   ``The nicer the Russians get, the more dangerous they are.''
   Her remarks underlined the dilemma of the right-wing British
leader who has developed a warm personal relationship with
Gorbachev.
   She now appears in a bind over how to keep encouraging
Gorbachev's internal reforms without also encouraging sentiment for
a further erosion in nuclear weapons and military spending in
Western Europe on grounds the Soviet Union is no longer much of a
threat.
   Thatcher aides deny she has done a U-turn on the Soviet leader
she once hailed as someone ``I can do business with,'' and who gave
her a red carpet welcome on an official visit in Moscow last spring.
   But British officials acknowledge alarm over Gorbachev's
relatively benign image in the West.
   Lord Carrington, NATO secretary-general, indicated that
Gorbachev may succeed in dividing the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization by generating complacency.
   ``It is rather a curious paradox that it's much easier to hold
the alliance together when they're frightened than when they're
not,'' Carrington said in a recent British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
   ``But the fact still remains that there is an enormous military
potential on the other side of the Eastern border.''
   Polls indicate a more relaxed attitude among West Europeans to
the neighboring Communist giant under the urbane Gorbachev.
   A survey by Datagroep of The Netherlands among 6,064 people in
nine West European countries last spring indicated that nearly
two-thirds thought that public views of the Soviet Union had
recently grown warmer.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has been among Gorbachev's most outspoken
admirers in the West, appears to have helped the shift in public
opinion.
   After her Moscow visit last spring a Gallup sounding reported
that 58 percent of Britons thought the Soviet Union ``really wanted
to be friendly with the West.'' Just 33 percent thought Soviet
advances should be treated ``with the greatest suspicion.''
   Britain's Economist weekly commented: ``Could that in part be a
result of the flattering attentions the prime minister has been
happy to receive from Mr. Gorbachev?''

<HEAD>Gephardt Is Main Target In One Of Campaign's Liveliest Debates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate-a-day Democratic
presidential field was scattered across the Super Tuesday landscape
today after a forum in which Rep. Richard Gephardt was singled out
for attacks on his trade policy, tax vote and the contributions he
has taken from special interests.
   In one of the liveliest debates of the campaign, the Democrats
spelled out differences on trade, taxes and foreign debt with
bare-knuckled zest, sparing not even the moderator who was chided
by Jesse Jackson for asking ``a race-based question.''
   After the third Democratic debate in as many days, the
contenders were campaigning in states that will hold primaries or
caucuses on March 8, the most delegate-rich day in the history of
presidential politics.
   Shortly after Monday's debate ended, Gephardt flew South to meet
with former President Jimmy Carter in Georgia and receive the
endorsement of two former governors of South Carolina.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was campaigning in Virginia and Kentucky;
Jackson in Maryland and North Carolina; Gov. Michael Dukakis in
Maryland, former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart in North Carolina; and
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon in the state of Washington.
   Gephardt took heat for his acceptance of campaign contributions
from political action committees, for his vote for President
Reagan's 1981 tax cut and for his trade policy.
   When Dukakis criticized Gephardt for taking PAC contributions,
the Missouri congressman retorted that to suggest that members of
Congress would ``take direction on how to vote is an affront.''
   Then Gephardt said he was certain the Massachusetts governor
accepted contributions from people who did business with his state,
which prompted Dukakis to reply, ``I am not running around the
country beating up on the establishment.''
   Gephardt said he often got contributions from people even though
they opposed his position on individual issues.
   Jackson interjected that ``lobbyists would lose their jobs if
they gave money continuously against the interests of who they were
working for.''
   ``Do you think the Reagan-Gephardt tax bill of 1981 was fair?''
asked Gore.
   The senator from Tennessee kept repeating the question and
Gephardt kept saying, ``Are you finished?''
   Finally, Gephardt said he thought the bill was fair because it
cut taxes for middle-income families.
   When Gore asked his question once again, Gephardt snapped, ``Can
you hear, Al?''
   During an exchange on how to deal with Mexico's foreign debt,
Dukakis said the oil import fee supported by Gephardt would ruin
the Mexican economy.
   ``Are you running for president of Mexico or America?'' asked
the congressman.
   ``If I'm president of the United States, I'm going to pay
attention to that country,'' responded Dukakis.
   Twice, Hart interjected, ``Let the record show, Gov. Dukakis
didn't answer the question.''
   Simon passed up the debate, which was held on the campus of the
College of William and Mary and was sponsored by the Democratic
Leadership Council, an organization of Democratic officials who
banded together out of concern over what they saw as the party's
leftward drift and the failure of its presidential candidates to
appeal to voters in the South and West.
   One of the most dramatic exchanges took place when moderator
Judy Woodruff, chief Washington correspondent of the Public
Broadcasting Service MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, asked Gore why he
hadn't been ``nearly as vocal talking about the differences between
yourself and Rev. Jackson. Would that be because you don't want to
offend his black supporters?''
   Gore replied that ``the reason is he doesn't have a record to
talk about in public life.''
   Gore went on to say he had disagreed with Jackson on issues such
as defense spending.
   Jackson was bristling and he turned to Woodruff and said: ``That
is a race-based question. ...
   ``I am a bona fide Democrat. I have registered more Democratic
voters than anyone on this stage. I am the reason why some
Democrats are on this stage, because of that work. ... My race is
self-evident and my leadership is obvious.''

   The stock market has jumped to its highest level
since the October market meltdown.
   Analysts said there was no major economic news to account for
the burst of stock-buying on Monday that sent the widely watched
Dow Jones industrial average up by 48.41 points to 2,071.62. But
they said the market continued to be buoyed by the brisk pace of
takeover bids in recent weeks.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, seven stocks rose for every two
that fell. Investors traded 236.05 million shares on the NYSE.
   The previous highest closing since the Oct. 19 crash was
2,051.89 on Jan. 7. The Dow industrials finished February some 333
points above the close on Black Monday, when the Dow plunged a
record 508 points.

   China today declined comment on Vietnamese
charges that Chinese troops had landed on two tiny contested
islands in the South China Sea.
   Vietnam's Communist Party Daily, Nhan Dan, said Friday that
Chinese troops had landed on two coral reefs in the Spratly chain
that are claimed by Vietnam and China as well as Malaysia, the
Philippines and Taiwan.
   Vietnam calls the islands Truong Sa, and China refers to them as
the Nansha archipelago.
   China's Foreign Ministry, asked to comment on Vietnam's
allegations, said a statement it made on Feb. 22 ``has already made
clear our consistent position.'' That statement said earlier
Vietnamese claims that four Chinese warships had ``provoked and
obstructed'' operations of its cargo vessels on Jan. 31 off the
Spratly group were ``brazen charges.''
   The two nations, which have occasional armed clashes along their
tense border, also both claim the Paracel island group to the north
of the Spratlys. Large oil deposits are said to be located in the
vicinity.

   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
will continue to focus on asbestos hazards in schools even though
an agency study estimates that the problem exists in other
buildings to which the public has access.
   The agency on Monday sent to Congress a report calling for
stepped-up research, training and enforcement on the problems of
asbestos in non-school buildings, but no new regulatory
requirements.
   ``The successful implementation of the school program should
remain our first concern, and we all have much to learn from it,''
wrote EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas in his cover letter to
Congress. ``I fear a major initiative in other buildings could do
more harm that good.''
   John A. Moore, assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic
substances, said at a news conference that the agency is hampered
by limited resources.
   The report dealt with so-called ``friable'' asbestos, which will
crumble under slight pressure and throw fibers into the air. The
fibers can cause lung cancer, cancer of the lining of the chest or
abdominal cavity and asbestosis.
   Asbestos-containing material that is damaged, such as insulated
pipe wrappings and tiles, can release the fibers.
   The Service Employees International Union said EPA should be
writing regulations or seeking legislation to give those workers
the right to know what they're dealing with. The union has 150,000
of its 850,000 members in building service jobs.
   The agency's report contained new information about a
still-unreleased survey of 43 federal buildings containing friable
asbestos.
   Despite the condition of the asbestos, the average concentration
in the air of the buildings was 560 fibers per cubic yard, about
0.4 percent of the workplace concentration permitted by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   That concentration is about 10 times the typical outdoor
background level, and EPA said such a difference from background
could be the result of chance alone _ that the buildings might not
be significantly contaminated at all.
   The report also contained old and new information from a 1984
EPA survey of 231 buildings, a survey designed to be representative
of some 3.6 million buildings to which the public has access.
Elementary and secondary schools, state and local government
buildings and apartments with fewer than 10 units were excluded.
   The old information, reported in 1985, was that an estimated 20
percent of buildings contained friable asbestos. The new
information further broke down that estimate to show that 14
percent of the buildings contain damaged friable asbestos. That
category was further broken down to show that 9 percent of the
buildings had seriously damaged asbestos.
   EPA said too few buildings were sampled for the figures to be
precise.
   EPA said the 20 percent likely could be anywhere from 14 percent
to 27 percent; the 14 percent could be anywhere from 6 percent to
22 percent; and the 9 percent could be zero to 19 percent.
   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., whose pressure has helped win passage
of existing asbestos-in-schools programs, said in a statement,
``Everything in this report points toward aggressive federal
intervention except EPA's recommendations, which amount to nothing
more than sweeping this alarming problem under the rug.''
   The agency has said about 35,000 school buildings, roughly 35
percent of the total, contained friable asbestos in 1984. Under new
EPA regulations required by Congress school districts must develop
asbestos management plans, with the advice of certified experts, by
October 1988 and start carrying them out in July 1989.
   EPA said the school program will cost $3 billion, and a
comparable program for buildings to which the public has access
would cost $51 billion.

<TEXT>
   A bomb apparently detonated by
remote control exploded today near a bus carrying military
personnel, damaging the bus and nearby homes but causing no
injuries, police said.
   The blast occurred at 6:10 a.m. in Benoni, about 20 miles east
of Johannesburg. It sent shrapnel against the bus, collapsed the
ceilings of two nearby homes and shattered the windows of other
houses, police said.
   An air force spokesman, Commandant Koos Smit, said the bus was
en route to Pretoria, with 18 army, air force and medical personnel
on board.
   There was no claim of responsibility, and police made no
accusations.
   Authorities have blamed the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement for many previous bomb attacks, including a
remote-control blast that killed four policemen in Johannesburg
last year.
   By law and custom, white-led South Africa's apartheid policy
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

<TEXT>
   The penalties for violating government safety
laws has not kept up with inflation and has pulled the enforcement
teeth from many of the laws by reducing the impact of fines,
according to a coalition of consumer groups.
   Penalties for violating various health and safety laws have
remained essentially unchanged over the years, while inflation has
reduced the value of the amounts involved, the Consumer Federation
of America and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said Monday
in a report.
   ``Letting civil penalties be eroded by inflation operates as if
there were a built-in depreciation schedule in our key health and
safety statutes,'' said Michael Waldman of the group Public
Citizen's Congress Watch, in a statement released with the study.
   As one example the study cited the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970 retains its original penalties of $1,000 per
violation and $10,000 for failure to provide a safe workplace. To
keep place with inflation these would have to increase to $2,970
and $29,700, the report said.

   President Reagan says he hopes the Summer

has confidence in newly inaugurated President Roh Tae Woo.
   In responses to questions submitted by the South Korean

competition in September ``is in everyone's interests.''
   ``The prospect of North Korea, or anyone else's, attempts to
disrupt the games through violence is a danger that we and the
Soviets can agree to work against.''
   ``We hope that Moscow will use its close relations with
Pyongyang to urge moderation and to encourage the resumption of
direct North-South contacts on practical ways to reduce tension,''

   People in other countries are becoming less

   ``I have looked at a very long historical set of figures,'' said
Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director. ``And I have to
tell you that there are no precedents. Each time similar imbalances

   ``Our latest projections suggest that, on present policies and

large over the medium term,'' he said Monday to a conference
sponsored by the Overseas Development Council, a private study
group concerned with problems of the Third World.
   For some time, the growth of U.S. debt has not been matched by
the willingness of business people in other countries to lend more,
he said.
   The congressional Joint Economic Committee has predicted that
U.S. debt would reach about $400 billion at the end of last year.
It is growing at about $150 billion annually.

<HEAD>SDI Officials More Confident They Can Defeat Decoy Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon scientists say they are more
confident that they can defeat attempts to fool a missile defense
by using decoy warheads following a recent Star Wars space
experiment.
   Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, the Air Force general in charge of
the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, said Monday the
so-called Delta 181 space experiment conducted three weeks ago had
provided a ``tremendous amount of data'' that already was expanding
scientific understanding of how objects look as they travel through
space.
   That, in turn, will be crucial to devising infrared, radar,
laser radar and other types of sensors that can tell the difference
between a real nuclear warhead and a fake one traveling through
space, Abrahamson said at a Pentagon briefing.
   While months if not years of research are still ahead, ``I think
all of our evidence, so far ... is that, yes, we should be able to
find effective ways to discriminate'' between decoy and real
warheads, he said.
   The three-star general also acknowledged, however, that budget
cuts imposed by Congress this year have slowed the Star Wars
program by at least a year and possibly more. The Reagan
administration had wanted to spend $5.2 billion on research this
year, but received $3.5 billion.

   Three months of violence in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip have led to a fundamental change in the
attitude of Palestinians, particularly the young.
   The new aggressiveness and self-confidence spawned by the
uprising could bode ill for Israel's future.
   After two decades of Israeli rule viewed by most Arabs as harsh,
unjust and capricious, residents in the territories have discovered
they can to some extent move events. Their outrage, their stones
and bottles, have drawn an international response.
   ``It is a result of 20 years of humiliating measures,'' said
Sumeye Naser, a biology professor at Bir Zeit University in the
West Bank. ``Now, they all feel they have nothing to lose.''
   The effect is most evident among those born after the 1967 war,
when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza. Those young people have
never known anything but Israeli occupation. At the barricades of
stone and burning tires throughout the occupied lands the spearhead
is the teen-ager.
   Youths throw stones and taunt the soldiers, daring them to
retaliate. Other boys so young they can't possibly understand the
political implications of what they are doing boldy confront tear
gas and guns, stone cars, wave V-signs and outlawed Palestinian
flags.
   In the West Bank, in the village of Bir Zeit west of Ramallah, a
teen-ager named Ahmed loitered near the post office with a group of
friends, waiting for something to happen.
   ``I hope they come,'' he said of the Israeli army. ``I would
like to fight them. I'd be happy to sacrifice my life.'' He and
other Palestinians interviewed declined to give their full names,
saying they feared arrest for rioting or Israeli reprisals against
their families.
   But the movement is not exclusively young. Talks with scores of
Palestinians in the territories reveal an almost universal
willingness to push the confrontation to the limit.
   ``We have to depend on ourselves to liberate our own land,''
said Khaled, an elderly man hobbling on his cane at the rear of a
demonstration in the village of Kfar Naami. ``We have reached this
conclusion, and I am ready to give my life.''
   The killings, the beatings, the tear gas attacks, the broken
bones inflicted by the Israelis in an effort to stifle the uprising
have had the opposite effect, instilling a sense of defiance among
Palestinians, and in some, a desire for revenge.
   Also evident is a new feeling of self-esteem among a people
treated as second-class citizens for so long that they came to
believe they were second class. By going to the barricades, by
participating in the general strike, by demonstrating, they are
asserting a newfound aggressiveness. And they are seeing results.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz's peace mission to the
Middle East was sparked by the violence. With elections planned in
the United States and Israel this year, it is unlikely any
peacemaking efforts would have been undertaken without the direct
pressure of the mounting death toll and Israeli crackdown.
   ``They have recognized something about themselves,'' said Ron
Verber, education director of the Golda Meir Association, a group
that promotes Arab-Jewish coexistence.
   ``They look at themselves differently now,'' Verber said. ``They
see independence from Israel as something solid. They feel they can
do something about it.
   ``A year ago, this feeling didn't exist. From that point of
view, it is the point of no return. We will not be able to put
things back they way they were before. They have made a statement.''
   For years, inhabitants of the territories have looked for
leadership to the Palestine Liberation Organization, which sought
to control the struggle from the outside, limiting the locals to a
secondary role.
   The locals saw the situation as out of their hands, beyond their
control. The PLO remains a potent force in the occupied lands. But
the uprising has taught local Palestinians that they themselves can
strike directly at the Israelis. They are no longer awed by the
Israeli military might that for so long cowed them into submission.
   ``The uprising has given us a sense of pride and a lack of
fear,'' said Hammad, another West Bank villager. ``We think we can
control our future.''
   For years, the Israelis kept Palestinians under control with a
minimal force _ less than 1,000 soldiers in the West Bank, for
example. Now, although authorities refuse to reveal numbers, it is
said there are almost as many soldiers in the West Bank as were
needed to seize it in 1967.
   When the demonstrations began, they were mostly in the large
towns and cities and in the refugee camps. Now, they have spread to
the smallest villages.
   ``Nobody knows what the aftermath is going to be,'' said Munir
Naser, a professor at Bir Zeit University. ``There are darker
aspects. The people who have been beaten or buried, people who have
had their hands broken, will have psychological problems.
   ``I think they are going to wait for the first opportunity to
take revenge.''

<TEXT>
   Late-afternoon dollar purchases by speculators
pushed the U.S. currency higher in uninspired Tokyo trading today,
while stock prices rose in unusually heavy trading on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, dealers said.
   The dollar opened at 128.45 yen, up 0.33 yen from Monday's
close, following gains on overseas markets. It then edged up in
afternoon trading to close the day at 128.63 yen, up 0.51 yen. Spot
volume totaled a moderate $4.7 billion.
   Despite the large day-to-day rise in the dollar's value, traders
said there was little news that was influencing trading in the U.S.
currency.
   ``The actual range in trading during the day wasn't very great,
only about 0.2 yen,'' said a trader at a Tokyo commercial bank who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Most of the increase was due to
speculators trying to cover dollar-short positions in the late
afternoon.''
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, which ended 13 consecutive
days of gains with a decline of 42.06 points Monday, rose 193.09
points, or 0.8 percent, to finish the day at 25,435.90.
   Stocks in many sectors rose, with trading in the market's first
section an exceptionally heavy 1.6 billion shares, the highest so
far this year.
   The second-section index also rose, gaining 1.56 points to hit
an all-time high of 2,927.31.
   Dealers said stocks were spurred upward by a surge on Wall
Street on Monday that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up
48.41 points to 2,071.61, its highest level since last year's
market crash.
   But they said the market received additional impetus from
bullishness resulting from favorable Japanese economic trends.
   ``Lately, the Tokyo market has been acting more independently of
Wall Street,'' said Michio Katsumata of Nomura Securities, Japan's
largest brokerage. ``Stocks in Tokyo are being buoyed by
predictions of higher Japanese corporate profits in March. Also,
the large amount of capital in circulation is boosting the market,
resulting in an excess of buy orders over sell orders.''
   The announcement today that Japan's unemployment rate in January
rose 0.1 percent from December had little impact on the market,
traders said. January's 2.7 percent rate was down from 3.0 percent
for the same month last year.

<TEXT>
   The Winter Olympics on television and a drop in
the number of new movies contributed to a sluggish weekend at the
box office. ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' was the No. 1 film for the
seventh week.
   ``The openings weren't strong and the Olympics did very well in
the ratings, particularly on Sunday. The box office was hurt on
Sunday,'' said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., which
compiles the weekly turnstile figures.
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' which got Robin Williams an Oscar
nomination for his portrayal of a raucous Saigon disc jockey,
earned $5.2 million for a nine-week total of $78.5 million. In
second place was Roman Polanski's ``Frantic'' with $4.35 million in
ticket sales.
   It was another good week for Disney Studios, with three movies
remaining in the Top 5.
   In addition to ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Disney-Touchstone
films has the Sidney Poitier movie ``Shoot to Kill'' in third with
a $3.5 million take and ``Three Men and a Baby,'' fifth in its 13th
week of release.
   The offbeat romantic film ``Moonstruck'' was fourth with $3.3
million.
   The only other new entry in the Top 10 was ``Night in the Life
of Jimmy Reardon,'' a teen movie starring River Phoenix. It earned
$2.7 million in its first week, to place sixth.
   ``Action Jackson'' was seventh with $2.4 million, ``Broadcast
News'' was eighth with $1.349 million, ``She's Having a Baby'' was
ninth with $1.340 million and the creepy ``The Serpent and the
Rainbow'' was 10th with $1.32 million.
   Studios use the weekend box office to determine how well a movie
is doing.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release and estimated production costs. Films where costs are not
available are maked n-a.
   1. ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Disney-Touchstone, $5.23 million,

<HEAD>Survey Finds Large Increase in U.S. Students Studying Abroad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A rapidly growing number of U.S. college
students are studying abroad, especially in Great Britain,
according to a new study.
   In 1985-86, 48,483 students took courses for academic credit in
foreign schools, according to latest figures released Monday by the
Institute for International Education, the nation's largest higher
education exchange agency.
   In 1982-83, the most recent previous study, 27,145 U.S. students
studied abroad, said Edrice Howard, IIE's senior publications
editor.
   The survey was conducted by mail last year to 2,896 accredited
U.S. colleges and universities, of which 1,898 reported students
earning academic credit for study abroad.
   The study did not explain the rise in popularity of foreign
study. But administrators on U.S. college campuses said that at
least som students may be finding that study overseas is economical
compared with the more expensive U.S. schools where tuitions have
been soaring throughout the 1980s.
   At Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., a school noted for
study-abroad programs that students from some 225 U.S. colleges
participate in, president Bette Landman said she believed the
increase stemmed from ``an increasing sensitivity among students to
foreign study, not only to help their careers, but especially in
the last year or two, to the kinds of understandings we as world
citizens must bring to our lives.''
   The school is sending over 1,700 students from U.S. campuses to
study in the British Isles and Vienna this year, Landman said,
compared with about 750 students in 1980-81.
   At Northern Illinois University, where the numbers of students
in overseas programs have risen at least 10 percent in that period,
Orville Jones, assistant dean of international programs said that
as more students have traveled during their high school years, the
thought of studying overseas is no longer as strange or frightening.
   The survey found that 76.8 percent of U.S. students abroad were
studying in Western European countries.
   The most popular single country, Great Britain, attracted 29.3
percent of all students studying abroad, followed by France with
13.7 percent, Spain with 8.8 percent, Italy 7.8 percent, and West
Germany 6.1 percent.
   Latin America attracted 7 percent, with smaller percentages
studying in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa.
   Nearly 90 percent of the students were in programs sponsored by
U.S. colleges and universities, the survey found. The most popular
field of study was liberal arts, with 18.2 percent, followed by
foreign language with 16.7 percent.
   Almost two-thirds, or 63.8 percent, of U.S. students abroad were
female, according to the report.

<HEAD>Park West High: A Challenge for New Schools Chancellor</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Park West High School, where book bags have been
known to contain machetes and switchblades, is the kind of school
that prompted the city's new chancellor to declare that public
education is on trial here.
   Richard Green, the former Minneapolis school superintendent who
begins work today as head of the nation's largest school system,
soon will have an invitation to see Park West for himself.
   Senior class officers want him to speak at graduation, and their
letter asks, ``Why would a chancellor want to link himself to the
so-called `worst school in Manhattan'?''
   Their answer: ``To send a signal to the media and to the public
that Park West is a school worthy of respect.''
   The 10-year-old, fortress-like concrete structure in the section
once known as Hell's Kitchen lost most claims to respectability
five weeks ago, when a state Education Department team suspended a
routine inspection.
   The reviewers said administrators were unable to provide them
with basic records for test scores, attendance and promotions. They
also cited ``chaotic'' conditions, including the stabbing of a
student just outside the building _ the second in as many days.
   ``The school was overrun by groups of students, split along
racial lines, at battle with each other,'' said Charles Carpenter,
a department spokesman. In a gym class, students ``were just
running around with no easily identifiable teacher or sign of
organized activity.''
   Under a new, interim principal, conditions have improved.
Security has been tightened, enrollment limited, tutoring increased
and student activities added.
   Twelve teachers patrol the school's hallways at a time, and
students must display their schedule card at the door before they
are allowed to leave early. Visitors must provide identification,
sign in and sign out.
   Even so, almost a third of the 2,500 students are absent each
day, and half of those who do come are late. More than half fail at
least one subject. So many drop out that seniors account for only 7
percent of the enrollment.
   Some students stay home out of fear of gangs outside the school,
and dozens more have transferred, including the nephew of the
parents' association vice president.
   ``He was failing two classes because he was leaving early to
avoid the scene at the end of the school day,'' said Barbara
Lowe-Tabman. ``Kids say they will not wear nice clothes to school
because they'll be stolen.''
   Some teachers told a reporter for The New York Times they
believed a majority of students carry weapons. A veteran guidance
counselor said some parents encourage children to carry them for
protection.
   Although the vast majority of teachers and administrators are
white, Principal Eileen Petruzillo says she knows of only one white
student. Relations have been tense between some groups of black,
Puerto Rican, Dominican and Haitian students.
   The school's problems began to surface in December, when a group
of Hispanic bilingual education students staged a sit-in to protest
attacks.
   Asked at that time about violence, Principal Edward Morris said,
``Kids have been bringing weapons to school for years. It's almost
a habit.'' A month later, after a study by a Board of Education
team, the 66-year-old Morris requested reassignment.
   Some students feel Park West is not that bad. Eric Vasquez, a
college-bound senior, said the high schools his brothers attended
make Park West sound tame. ``It's a city high school,'' he shrugged.
   Park West's problems are not unique in a system of 936,000
students, between a third and half of whom drop out before
graduation. In the 1986-87 school year, more than 9,700 violent
incidents were reported, about 3,500 of them ``serious,'' such as
assaults and robberies.
   The state plans to resume its review of Park West. If conditions
have not improved, Carpenter said, administrators will be told that
``if they don't clean up their act, the school will be closed
down.''
   After being named chancellor in January, Green said he rejected
the idea that New York's schools are ``failed institutions,'' but
said ``public education is on trial'' here.
   He faces a system full of emerging or potential Park Wests. But
solutions, says Petruzillo, cannot be uniformly imposed from Board
of Education headquarters ``because each school is different. You
can't replicate a success in one school at another.''
   At least, she said, ``Dr. Green is coming to a city that is
ready for change. He's going to have a very interesting time.''

<HEAD>Tensions Simmer Anew At Dartmouth Over Conservative Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Dartmouth College's
Afro-American Society planned more protests this week after a black
professor came under renewed attack from a conservative student
newspaper.
   The dispute between The Dartmouth Review and music Professor
William Cole threatened to reignite tensions that shattered the Ivy
League campus after a January 1986 sledgehammer attack by Review
members on anti-apartheid shanties on the college green.
   The independent weekly's editor, Christopher Baldwin, who also
was involved in the shanty attack, faces college disciplinary
charges with three other Review members stemming from a
confrontation with Cole last week after the paper printed a cover
story questioning his competence.
   Cole had sued the newspaper for libel for a January 1983 article
that said he ``looks like a used Brillo pad'' and called his music
course ``the most outrageous'' on campus. Cole dropped the suit in
1985 and received no damages. He and the newspaper each claimed
vindication.
   A member of the Afro-American Society, sophomore Kimberly
Robinson, said Monday the newspaper's new attacks were ``obviously
racially motivated.''
   About 250 students held a rally Monday in front of the college
administration building, and Robinson said the Afro-American
Society planned to start a boycott today of Hanover businesses that
advertise in the Review.
   The group also planned a march down Dartmouth's ``Fraternity
Row'' Wednesday night and a rally with students from other area
colleges Thursday.
   Robinson said members of Afro-American Society also met twice
Monday with Dartmouth President James Freedman to detail
allegations of other recent racial incidents on campus.
   In its cover story two weeks ago, the Review revived charges
that Cole is incompetent and printed excerpts from a transcript of
one of his classes that week.
   The story also leveled criticisms at an English professor who is
white. Baldwin said both stories originated from complaints to the
newspaper by students in the classes.
   Baldwin denied the article was racially motivated and said the
Review is the victim of a ``witch hunt'' as it tries to root out
incompetence at Dartmouth.
   He said he and two Review colleagues, with a fourth as an
observer, approached Cole after his class Thursday to advise him
that he could publish an unedited response in the newspaper, but
also to seek his explanation for remarks about the Review he
allegedly made during a class.
   Baldwin said an ``altercation'' ensued. The next day, the Review
published on its cover a picture of Cole during the incident and a
story about it.
   Dartmouth spokesman Alex Huppe said Baldwin and the other three
students face college charges of disorderly conduct, harassment and
violation of the right to privacy because of the confrontation.
   ``To have four students exercise their will over the
institution, we're not going to let four students do that,'' said
Huppe. The four are scheduled to appear before a disciplinary board
next Tuesday.
   Cole could not be reached for comment. He did not return a
message left on his telephone answering machine Monday night.
   Baldwin was among a dozen students involved in a pre-dawn
sledgehammer attack on symbolic anti-apartheid shanties set up by
student protesters in January 1986. After a series of hearings and
appeals, he was sentenced to serve 180 hours of community service.
   The shanty attack sparked sit-ins and protests that continued
all semester and led to a one-day moratorium on classes for
discussions of racism.

<HEAD>National Association Drug Committee Chief Says War on Drugs
Failing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's war on drugs has
been little more than a skirmish that failed to stem the movement
of drugs across U.S. borders, says the head of a task force of
prosecutors.
   ``The federal government, despite all the talk, has failed to
stop the drug trafficking across the borders,'' State's Attorney
Richard Daley of Chicago told the National District Attorney's
Association's annual conference Monday. ``And it's increasing each
year. It's not going down.''
   Daley, head of the association's Drug Control Committee, said
Drug Enforcement Administration border patrols capture only 15
percent of the illegal drugs coming into the United States, while
marijuana and cocaine worth $130 billion a year is entering from
Latin American countries.
   Daley also said the federal government is not properly funding
local efforts to prosecute criminals as promised when the war on
drugs was declared.
   ``I don't think it's a war on drugs. I think it's only been
skirmishes,'' Daley said. ``They don't really have a national
policy. That's where it fails.''
   When the Reagan administration first attacked drug use in
America, it set aside $225 million to help local prosecutors, who
handle at least 95 percent of the drug cases in the U.S., Daley
said.
   But this year funding was cut to $70 million, although the drug
problem is getting worse and more violent, he said.
   ``The federal government should put its money where its mouth
is,'' said Daley, the son of the late Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.
``We local prosecutors are on the offensive and we need federal
help.
   ``The drug people are going to corrupt this country more and
more. And you're going to see more violence. You're just seeing the
beginning.''
   The association delegates approved four resolutions dealing with
drug enforcement, including one urging federal funding for local
anti-drug programs to be reinstated to ``adequate levels.''
   They called for combining state and federal efforts to block the
importation of illegal drugs into the United States.
   A third resolution asked the Internal Revenue Service to channel
its efforts toward helping ``prevent drug dealers from enjoying the
profits of their illegal activity.''
   The association also asked for a federal program to help fund
the construction of county and state prisons to house the increased
number of convicted drug offenders.
   Daley said the idea of educating the public to ``just say no''
has gone far enough and the concentration should be placed on
people who have said yes to drugs for years.
   ``I'm not a social worker and I'm not a teacher,'' Daley said.
``I'm a prosecutor.''

   Andrew and Sarah, the duke and duchess of
York, transformed into Andy and Fergie, the down-home celebrities,
snacking at a supermarket deli, decorating a cake and shaking hands
with screaming fans.
   The royal couple's ``walkabout'' along the edge of a crowd
outside a supermarket Monday was their closest unplanned contact
with everyday Americans during a Southern California tour that has
included much hobnobbing with Hollywood celebrities.
   ``I love them both. I think Fergie and Di are just _ American,''
said Susie Clayton, referring also to Diana, the Princess of Wales.
   Ms. Clayton, 27, visiting from Arizona, waited for two hours in
on-and-off rain that could have been imported from Britain for the
royal retinue to arrive at the Von's Pavilions market in suburban
Arcadia.
   Prince Andrew and his pregnant wife, midway through their 10-day
tour, plan to meet with British denizens of Hollywood today during
a new round of stops that includes a trip to a trendy disco.
   They have already been greeted by famous faces like Roger Moore
of James Bond fame; Joan Collins, the wicked queen of the
``Dynasty'' dynasty; and Michael York, a movie actor who lately has
appeared on ``Knots Landing.''
   York, who greeted the royal pair during their travels Monday,
said that the duke and duchess have a glamour of their own.
   ``They have a youth, glamour and pizazz and they preserve a
longstanding tradition,'' he said.
   Today, Andrew and Sarah were to take a tour of Showscan, a movie
special effects studio in suburban Culver City. Later, they planned
to meet with British Oscar winners at the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills.
   Finishing out their round of entertaining the entertainment
community, they were to attend a lunch for the British Academy of
Film and Television Arts.
   Two fashion shows were laid on to finish the royal day, one at
the Music Center, and another at the Stock Exchange disco downtown.
   The royal couple is in the United States to promote trade to
Great Britain and act as patrons of the three-month UK-LA '88
festival, a celebration of the British arts in Los Angeles.
   On Monday, apart from the supermarket, the couple visited a
technology museum and the Wilshire Bullocks department store, where
they were joined by a Hollywood entourage that included Lynn
Redgrave, George Peppard and Lloyd Bridges.
   At the supermarket, the duchess cruised the aisles and paid
particular attention to the deli section, pausing to examine sushi
and stuffed chicken breasts but tasting only one item _ a dollop of
coffee-toffee chip ice cream.
   ``She said she loved the pastry but was afraid to eat it,''
confided assistant bakery manager Barbara Huereque, who recognized
a sister calorie-counter.
   Both the duchess and duke tried their hand at decorating a cake.
Andrew produced a vague approximation of a red rose and she made a
lopsided white rose, symbol of the house of York.

   The London Stock Exchange posted gains in early
trading today, in line with rises in New York and Tokyo.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 13.3
points, or 0.75 percent, at 1782.1 by midmorning. The index opened
at 1781.1, up 12.2 points from Monday's close.
   Brokers said prices increased across the board before the
official opening, but profit-takers emerged to erase some gains.
   In contrast to the general rise, shares for retail stores were
largely unchanged because of growing caution about the prospect for
major tax cuts in the government's March 15 budget statement.
   The early trend followed sharp gains in New York on Monday,
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 48.41 to 2,071.41, and
a rise overnight in Tokyo, where the Nikkei index climbed 193.09 to
25,435.90.

<TEXT>
   Police said two IRA
guerrillas killed in a huge explosion in a border area may have
been installing explosives in a van in preparation for an attack on
an army observation post.
   The blast, which occurred Monday in the South Armagh border
area, destroyed a van and a barn about two miles outside
Crossmaglen village, badly damaged two cars and left a crater in
the ground.
   In another development, Irish and British authorities on Monday
said Libya has sent Soviet-made, anti-aircraft missiles to the
Irish Republican Army.
   Police said four armed and masked men hijacked the van and a car
shortly before the blast, which the IRA called an accident.
   Authorities speculated that IRA guerrillas were installing
explosives in the van when the explosives accidentally detonated. A
police officer, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice, said the IRA's intended target probably was an army
observation post near the border with Irish Republic.
   The mostly Roman Catholic IRA often uses explosives in its
violent campaign to drive the British out of the predominantly
Protestant province and unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic.
   The IRA issued a statement Monday saying two of its men died in
the blast, which it described as ``an unfortunate accident.'' The
group gave no details, and said names and IRA ranks of the dead men
would be released after families are notified. The British domestic
news agency Press Association said the two dead men had been named
locally as Brendan Burnes and Brendan Moley.
   Irish and British authorities said in a TV program broadcast
from London Monday that the IRA is equipped with Soviet-made SAM-7
anti-aircraft missiles.
   The surface-to-air missiles were contained in more than 100 tons
of weaponry sent by Libya to Ireland for the IRA in four shiploads
in 1985 and 1986, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.'s
``Panorama'' program.
   The program said British army helicopters operating along
Northern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic would be the most
likely targets.
   The Irish justice minister, Gerry Collins, said some of the
missiles ``may very well be'' in Northern Ireland already.
   John Hermon, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's police force, said he had ``no reason to doubt''
the SAM-7s are hidden somewhere in Ireland.
   Officials said one shipment in October was unloaded one night at
an isolated jetty near Arklow, 40 miles south of Dublin, Ireland.
   Police have uncovered some of the weapons recently in both the
Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, but no SAM-7s have been found.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community is
prepared to back a Central American plan to boost economic
development in the troubled region, West Germany's foreign minister
said.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Monday the
12-member European Community ``is prepared to take constructive
part in seeing this plan through.''
   Genscher, who was chairing the EEC session, did not say by how
much the community was prepared to raise its relatively small
amount of economic aid to Central America, but emphasized the group
was interested in helping the region achieve stability. EEC aid to
the region last year was about $96 million, community officials
said.
   The Central American states have worked out a $1.4 billion total
aid package they say is needed from foreign doners.
   Earlier, the EEC reaffirmed its support for a regional peace
plan and warned against outside interference in Central America.
   The peace plan calls for an end to outside support for
insurgencies, cease-fires, amnesties and democratic reforms.
   French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson, who heads the EEC
commission for Latin American relations, also reassured Central
American countries of the EEC's economic support without providing
specific figures.
   The EEC ministers were in Hamburg for a one-day meeting that
centered on Central American issues. They met with representatives
of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras _
the countries whose presidents signed the Arias peace plan in
August.
   They also met with representatives from Mexico, Panama,
Venezuela and Columbia, members of the Contadora group that is
trying to mediate an end to violence in the region.

<TEXT>
   A respected linguist who says he was
enticed by Yale University to leave the Soviet Union in the 1970s
says he is going broke on a school pension after being forced to
retire two years ago.
   Sebastian K. Shaumyan, a 72-year-old professor emeritus of
linguistics, said Monday he never would have emigrated had he known
he faced mandatory retirement on a $750-a-month pension 11 years
later.
   ``I lived quite well (in Moscow) and here I don't know what to
do. I am without means to live,'' he said. ``I think it's very
strange why a university professor must retire at 70. Now I do even
better work than before.''
   Shaumyan, who became an American citizen in 1980, said he is
happy with his new country, but he is considering a lawsuit against
Yale. His lawyer wants Shaumyan's pension doubled to $1,500 a month.
   ``Yale is un-American,'' Shaumyan said. ``If I knew that I would
jeopardize my work, my family, my existence, I wouldn't have left
Moscow.''
   He said Yale wooed him from established academic positions in
Moscow in 1975 without telling him he would be automatically
retired at the age of 70, as are all faculty members.
   ``They promised me a good position and prominent work,'' he
said. ``They deceived me.''
   University spokesman Walter Littell declined to comment because
of the possibility of a lawsuit.
   Shaumyan said he was paid $20,000 during 1975, his first year at
Yale, and was making nearly $55,000 by the time he retired in 1986.
   Now, he said, he has depleted his savings and is going broke,
even with the $900 he receives in monthly Social Security benefits.
Mortgage, car and student loan payments for his three children eat
up $1,100 a month, he said.
   ``He's not asking for a large sum and he's not asking to hit the
lottery here,'' said his lawyer, Mark Arons.
   Shaumyan is a specialist in mathematical linguistics. In his
1987 book, ``A Semiotic Theory of Language'' published by Indiana
University Press, he discusses how mathematics can set uniform
rules for languages, which in turn have applications for writing
new computer languages. His 11 books have been translated into at
least seven languages.

<HEAD>President Moi Uncontested, Wins Third Five-Year Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel arap Moi won a third
five-year term after no one contested his seat in Parliament and
his ruling party nominated him as the only presidential candidate.
   Moi in effect won the contest Monday after filing unopposed as a
member of Parliament for Baringo Central constituency.
   The filing was a formality since Moi was the sole presidential
candidate nominated Saturday by the ruling Kenya Africa National
Union, which he leads. By law, it is Kenya's only political party.
   Joseph Mwangovya, supervisor of elections, announced Moi's
election after the president presented his election papers during a
ceremony at the Kabarnet High School playground.
   Moi, 63, has been president of this East African nation since
1978, when as vice-president he succeeded the late Jomo Kenyatta,
the country's first leader.
   The constitution requires the president to be a member of
Parliament and for general elections to be held at least every five
years.
   Monday was the deadline for candidates to file papers for the
March 21 general election.
   The party approved 787 parliamentary candidates for the primary
election and 360 of them made it through to the general election,
which will be held by secret ballot for 188 seats.
   Besides Moi, 61 other members of the previous Parliament were
elected Monday because they have no general election opposition.

   Soviet authorities allowed 723 Jews to emigrate in
February, slightly more than in the previous month, the agency that
helps Jews resettle said today.
   A spokeswoman for the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration,
Regina Boucault, said 140 of the February emigres went to Israel.
The rest chose to travel to other countries. In January, Soviet
authorities allowed 658 Jews to emigrate, and 141 went to Israel.
   Soviet Jewish emigration reached 8,011 last year, its highest
level since 1981.

   President Roh Tae-woo appealed today
to communist North Korea to take part in the 1988 Olympic Games and
pledged not to impose any conditions on the north's participation.
   ``There is no condition. ... We will welcome you, the breathren
in the north, more than anyone else as the same countrymen and
brothers,'' Roh told an audience of 4,000 people at the Sejong
cultural center in Seoul.
   Roh made the strongest appeal in recent months to the north to
take part in the Games, speaking during celebrations of Samil Day,
a national holiday commemorating a 1919 uprising against Japanese
rule. He also appealed for national reconciliation in the south.
   ``Today, we recall our breathren ... who rose up with bare fists
against the Japanese imperialist colonial rule,'' Roh said.
   Less than one mile away, police today kicked and punched
dissidents and dragged away dozens of them after breaking up an
anti-government protest in Pagoda Park, where the 1919 uprising
took place. Prominent dissident leaders were among those detained.
   Roh hinted at his willingness to meet with North Korean leaders
by saying he was ready to deal with anybody. He repeated that the
south would seek to establish relations with North Korea's main
allies, the Soviet Union and China.
   ``I will meet with anyone, anytime and anywhere and will not
hesitate to open that road however rugged it might be,'' he said.
   The new president, formally sworn in Feb. 25, said the Olympic
Games could help speed reunification of the divided Korean
peninsula.
   North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympic Games and says
it will boycott the Games if its request is denied.
   South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have
rejected the demand, but said the north could stage five events if
it takes part in the Seoul events.
   The two nations have existed since 1948 and fought the bloody
Korean War from 1950 to 1953. The bitter rivals have clashed
repeatedly over the years.
   Roh also appealed to the South Korean opposition to work with
his government in ending decades of authoritarian rule and
introducing full democracy. ``The curtain has been raised for the
era of national self-esteem in which democracy will blossom,'' he
said.
   Roh, a former general, won the first democratic presidential
elections in 16 years last December with 36.6 percent of the vote
after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote. Roh
campaigned on the platform that he alone could ensure democracy and
stability.
   About 150 dissidents staged a demonstration today in Seoul's
Pagoda Park to denounce Roh and demand the immediate release of all
political prisoners.
   Protesters waved placards, shouted slogans and applauded
speeches as hundreds of onlookers watched.
   ``Down with the Roh government!'' and ``Release all the
political prisoners!,'' the protesters shouted.
   Scuffles began when plainclothes police tried to detain some
protesters and other dissidents protested.
   A column of about 100 police suddenly charged into the protest,
kicking and punching people to the ground and chasing others.
Police hauled away about 40 dissidents, some of whom were badly
beaten.
   Police also hit a number of press photographers covering the
demonstration.
   The Rev. Moon Ikhwan and several other prominent dissident
leaders were taken away by police. Some of those detained included
radicals released from prison Saturday as part of a government
amnesty.
   Opposition leaders rejected the amnesty as insufficient and have
demanded the release of all political prisoners. The government
says only dissidents guilty of violent crime or subversion remain
in jail.

<HEAD>Commissioners Approve $2.3 Million Contract For Construction of
Museum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   County commissioners have approved a $2.3 million
contract to construct an elevator tower and visitors center in the
former Texas Schoolbook Depository as part of an exhibit on the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   The commissioners voted 3-2 Monday to award the contract to
Thomas J. Hayman Construction Co., which will begin work on the
project as early as this week.
   ``The eyes of the world will be on this project,'' said Lindalyn
Adams, president of the Dallas County Historical Foundation, which
has worked for 11 years to get the exhibit funded. ``As sad as it
is, it is the most important historical site in Dallas.''
   The foundation plans to raise $1.5 million from private sources
for additional renovations on the sixth floor of what is now known
as the Dallas County Administration Building.
   The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald fired a
high-powered rifle at Kennedy from the sixth floor of the building
where he worked on Nov. 22, 1963.
   The elevator tower is intended to carry up to 500,000 visitors a
year to the exhibit without disrupting work at county government
offices.
   Architect Tony Callaway said construction could be completed by
November, but foundation officials say they are unlikely to
schedule the exhibit's opening on Nov. 22, the 25th anniversary of
Kennedy's assassination.
   ``We think it would be inappropriate,'' Adams said.

<HEAD>Afghan Envoy Accuses Pakistan Of Undermining Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan is trying to undermine U.N.-sponsored
Afghanistan peace talks, Afghanistan's ambassador to the Soviet
Union charged today.
   The ambassador, Mohamadulah Subhani Safi, made the comment on
the eve of a new round of negotiations, telling a news conference
that Pakistan ``doesn't want peace'' for its Afghan neighbors.
   Pakistan, which represents the Afghan guerrillas in the talks
that resume in Geneva on Wednesday, is trying to ``raise issues
that have no relevance to Pakistan,'' he charged.
   Safi complained about Pakistan's demand that any accord signed
in Geneva that would facilitate a withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan be linked to the formation of a transitional, coalition
government in Kabul.
   Without such an interim government, unending civil strife would
follow a Soviet pullout, Pakistani diplomats have argued.
   But Safi said the composition of the Afghan government cannot be
dictated by Pakistan or any outside power.
   His comments were echoed in an article in Pravda, the Soviet
Communist Party daily, which said Pakistani leaders have
``apparently forgotten their previous statements that the presence
of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan was the sole obstacle in the
way toward resolving the Afghan problem.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has pledged _ if peace talks
are successful _ to begin withdrawing an estimated 115,000 troops
from its embattled neighbor May 15 and complete the pullout in 10
months.
   Gorbachev has said the Kremlin has no intention of trying to
determine the composition of the government left behind when it
leaves the country it entered in December 1979 in support of a
Marxist regime.
   Pravda called it ``an open secret'' that the United States and
its NATO allies have a decisive influence over Pakistan and leaders
of the Afghan resistance.
   ``Their attitude to the Afghan settlement, which is now entering
its crucial stage,'' will be a touchstone for the world to judge
the real worth of their calls for a political settlement of
regional crises of every kind,'' the newspaper said.
   The United States has been ambivalent in its reaction to the
calls for an interim government. A senior American official
returning with Secretary of State George P. Shultz from Moscow
hinted last week that Washington does not back such demands.
   But the U.S. Senate, in a non-binding resolution Monday, urged
the formation of an interim government in Kabul that would be
acceptable to the Afghan resistance.
   There also has been a lack of clear signals on when Washington
would be prepared to cut off its aid to the guerrillas, which was
reported to have totaled about $700 million last year.

   Local officials pocketed or misappropriated $48
million in state funds to poverty-stricken areas over two years,
using the money to build hotels, apartments and movie houses, an
official report said.
   The State Auditing Administration said the sum represents 6
percent of the $816 million it audited, but officials said they
believe much more was embezzled during 1985 and 1986, the official
People's Daily reported Monday.
   The state allocated more than $1.62 billion to poverty-stricken
areas in the two-year period, the paper said.
   Statistics at the end of 1986 showed that 60 million people in
about 200 counties live below China's poverty line of $40 annually
plus 440 pounds of grain.
   Auditors also found more than 110 people involved in graft cases
totaling more than $91,000, it said.
   The State Council is planning to change distribution of the
funds so that the money will go directly to enterprises that can
improve the area's financial situation.
   In Yanchi county, Ningxia Autonomous Region, more than $243,000
or 42.9 percent of the county's funds for the poor, were used to
build apartments, hotels and cinemas, the paper said.
   In seven cities and counties in Hunan, officials used $132,432
to buy 22 cars and other motor vehicles.
   In Feixian county, Shandong province, officials used $4,300,
collected illegally as administrative fees for the distribution of
the help-the-poor funds, to buy motorcycles, tape recorders and
cameras, the paper said.

   Sue Hall's fourth-grade science
students are saying ``rats'' to junk food after a month of
experiments in which they compared school-food and junk-food diets
by feeding them to rodents.
   ``It seems like children sort of know what they're suppose to be
eating but you're wondering if it has any impact,'' Ms. Hall said.
``With the kids doing this, they notice the difference.''
   On Monday, a pair of rats named Sweetie and Boss Hog munched on
french fries and a candy bar while fellow rodents Rascal and Casey
dined on a Kennedy School lunch consisting of salad, asparagus and
a hamburger casserole.
   The children ``all say things about the rats on junk food like,
`Boy, are they hyper. ... Their hair isn't very shiny,''' Ms. Hall
said.
   The rodents nibbling on school lunches and sipping milk and
water gain weight steadily, are calm and have shiny fur and alert
eyes, she said.
   ``They let the children pet them,'' she said.
   But the junk food rats gain and lose weight, do not finish meals
and race around the cage when the children try to pick them up to
be weighed.
   ``The kids say, `Gosh, look what happens when you eat this,' ''
Ms. Hall said. ``It seems to increase their lesson.''
   Ms. Hall, who has taught the six-week rat lesson on nutrition
eight other times, said she watches for signs the rats are becoming
too ill and switches their diets if necessary.

   A wayward Japanese macaque monkey that
wandered through western Pennsylvania and Ohio for six months has
``gone Hollywood'' and will be the featured attraction in a new
monkey exhibit at the Pittsburgh Zoo.
   Mayor Richard Caliguiri and zoo officials launched a drive
Monday to use the monkey, named Alphie, to raise $15,000 for a new
exhibit called Monkey Business Inc.
   Alphie escaped from the zoo July 23 and made his way through
western Pennsylvania and into Ohio, where he was captured Jan. 27
in a backyard.
   His six-month odyssey created headlines. While he was on the
lam, zoo officials spelled his name Alfie. Now that he has ``gone
Hollywood,'' as they put it, they spell it Alphie.
   ``We hurriedly signed him to a long-term contract. One of the
terms was that he be given star billing at the Children's Zoo this
summer and that suitable exhibit facilities be provided for a star
of his magnitude,'' said Zoo Director Charles Wikenhauser.
   He said Alphie would live in the exhibit beginning in mid-May.

   Denouncing what it called South Africa's
``escalation of acts of terrorism'' against blacks, the U.N. Human
Rights Commission has renewed its call for mandatory sanctions
against the white-led nation.
   The 43-country panel, at its annual meeting Monday, urged that
South Africa be economically isolated.
   It said children were increasingly being targeted for repression.
   The United States, Britain and West Germany dissented in the
36-3 vote. Belgium, France, Japan and Portugal abstained.
   The resolution accuses South Africa of continuing ``gross and
cruel violations of human rights'' under apartheid.
   It calls for the immediate release of Nelson Mandela, imprisoned
leader of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement
and freedom for all political prisoners in South Africa.
   ``Massacres and daily killings of defenseless men, women and
children have become the order of the day,'' the resolution says.
   It says human rights violations have risen under a
government-imposed state of emergency that went into effect in June
1986, and urges the U.N. Security Council to impose mandatory
sanctions on South Africa.
   Separately, the commission asked all governments to immediately
cut trade, manufacturing and financial ties with South Africa and
Namibia, or South-West Africa, the territory ruled by South Africa
in defiance of U.N. resolutions.
   The vote was 32-7. The United States, Britain, Belgium, France,
West Germany, Italy and Portugal opposed the draft. Spain, Ireland,
Japan and Norway abstained.
   On Namibia, 34 delegations voted without dissent to accuse South
Africa of wide-ranging oppression there and to call anew for
Namibian independence. Nine Western countries abstained.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The government's new policy of glasnost will
suffer if theaters are barred from performing a play criticized for
its portrayal of Soviet history, eight leading theater figures said.
   The Soviet people have gotten glasnost through suffering and
``that's why any attempts to turn the process backwards ... arouse
deepest concern,'' said the three actors, three producers and two
playwrights in a letter published Monday in the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or more
openness on some issues, has led to greater artistic freedom.
Lately, Soviet artists have produced plays on subjects they would
not have touched before.
   The eight accused several critics of trying to block the staging
of Mikhail Shatrov's play ``Onward _ Onward _ Onward'' by ``pinning
political labels'' on its author.
   Earlier this month, three historians told Pravda the play
compared Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin to Josef V. Stalin _
denounced after his death as a dictator _ and portrayed Soviet
history in a negative way.
   The eight said the timing of the criticism indicated it was
aimed at dissuading theaters from booking the play.
   ``It is not by chance that in the provinces they manage to hear
this voice. We have information at the Union of Theater Workers
that this new play, devoted to Lenin, already was banned in some
towns,'' the eight wrote.
   Shatrov's new work takes the form of a debate among Bolsheviks
and their opponents as they look back on Soviet history since the
1917 revolution that brought the Communists to power.
   The historians accused Shatrov of using Lenin as a conduit for
his own ideas and treating the Bolshevik revolution as an accident.
   In their letter, the eight said Shatrov has written about Lenin
for 30 years and his plays have been well received.
   Shatrov's new play was published in January in the literary
magazine Znamya and is scheduled to be performed in Moscow this
spring.
   In the play, Shatrov makes Stalin answer for his purges in which
millions of people perished, but in one scene Lenin accepts blame
for not making certain Stalin could not gain power after Lenin's
death in 1924.
   In the closing scene, Stalin and Lenin are on stage. The desire
is expressed for Stalin to leave, but he will not.
   ``Yes, we do want Stalin to leave, not only the stage, but our
lives,'' the eight said in the letter. ``We want his methods to
vanish, his `morality,' his ways to solve disputes, in particular
in art. But unfortunately, the heritage of the past cannot be
overcome by pronouncements.''
   ``We are not going to defend the play or attack it,'' they
added. ``It hasn't been staged yet and a play without being staged
is a soul without a body. We are concerned with other things.''
   In a seven-paragraph comment on the letter, Pravda said it would
not take sides. ``Pravda's point of view is well known,'' it said.
``It has always been against anybody's monopoly for truth and
against the position `There is my opinion and there is a wrong
opinion'.''

   An American denied a first-class honors
degree from Bristol University after he was accused of cheating
petitioned Queen Elizabeth II, saying he's honest and is not
getting a fair appeal hearing.
   Francis Foecke, 30, a native of South Bend, Ind., has spent the
last 21 months trying to clear his name after writing his final
exams in mathematics and computer science at the school in the
western city of Bristol in June 1986.
   The London Times said today that he and his English wife,
Priscilla, have spent $53,100 trying to disprove allegations that
he illicitly gained access to examination papers before the
examination.
   ``I do not think I am ever going to get an objective hearing or
an objective decision from the (university's) appeal committee
because they are so close to the people who say I am guilty,'' said
Foecke.
   ``I do not think they realize what a devastating effect this has
had on my wife and me,'' he said. The couple lives in the Bristol
suburb of Clifton.
   When Foecke went to pick up his results after the final exams,
the university registrar told him he was suspected of cheating and
would not receive the degree, the highest the university offers.
   He was told his examination answers too closely mirrored the
lecturers' model answers and that he even had repeated their
mistakes in working out some of the mathematical equations.
   Foecke has maintained he worked up to 18 hours a day for more
than a year preparing for the exams and that he used the methods
taught by his lecturers.
   The Times said the university authorities did not prove Foecke
cheated but stated they believe he may have stolen a key to get
into an office where the papers were stored.
   Foecke's lawyer Guy Dorman said Monday: ``We are petitioning
(the queen) on the grounds of a breach of natural justice.''
   A legal concept enforced by the senior courts, natural justice
says any group making an official ruling, such as the university
authorities, must give a fair hearing to the person involved before
announcing its decision.
   The queen holds the post of visitor at the university. The
visitor is appointed to look after student interests among other
matters but petitions to her in this capacity are rare.
   Because she is a constitutional monarch, the queen would not
make a ruling in her own right in Foecke's case and there was no
comment on the case from Buckingham Palace.
   The petition was sent through Lord Belstead, who holds the post
of Lord President of the Privy Council and is the Cabinet member
responsible for supervising the government's legislative program.

<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Milton Caniff, creator of the
Steve Canyon and Terry and the Pirates comic strips, has begun
chemotherapy treatments for lung cancer in New York City.
   Caniff was in the mood to talk Monday in a telephone interview
from Beth Israel hospital.
   ``First thing this morning I reached for the old drawing board
but it wasn't even there,'' Caniff told the Dayton Daily News.
   Caniff, who learned about the cancer Friday, thinks it will be
at least a month before he is able to draw Steve Canyon again. He
said he doesn't know how long he will be in the hospital.
   ``This cancer thing has kind of stopped me in my tracks for a
bit, so right now I'm just taking it one day at a time,'' he said.
   Caniff said he has about 30 days worth of the Canyon strip
finished. If he's unable to work when those are gone, his
assistant, Richard Rockwell, and others will keep the storyline
running.
   Caniff, who grew up in Dayton, has been producing a daily comic
strip for 54 years and had planned to continue drawing in the
hospital.
   ``But when it came right down to it, I didn't feel like it,''
the 81-year-old artist said.
   Even so, he said, his spirits are high.
   ``I'm just naturally ornery, anyway, but when this happened, I
had to decide what I was going to do,'' he said. ``I could be an
old curmudgeon or I could make life easier for my family, friends
and the medical staff here. I decided on the latter approach.''

   A gang of bumbling burglars dressed up as
Japanese Ninja warriors has botched most of its heists so far,
managing to burn up $7,000 while trying to open safes with a
blowtorch.
   But police say the group of three or four people is getting
better with practice, and last weekend their fifth known job
resulted in about $500 in unsinged cash for the thieves.
   The gang members dress in black like the Ninja, a feudal
Japanese society of mercenary assassins, and enter buildings
through a roof or by forcing employees working odd hours to let
them in.
   ``They started out like they've been watching too many movies,''
joked Detective Rich Berendsen of the Concord Police Department. He
said in three of the burglaries, the gang's blowtorches burned up
most of the cash they were after.
   The gang's first known burglary was of Emil Vlla's restaurant in
Concord on Jan. 25. They gave up trying to break into a safe when
their drill bit broke off in the lock.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rhythm-and-blues musician Ike Turner,
former husband of pop superstar Tina Turner, surrendered Monday on
a week-old warrant that sought his arrest because he failed to
appear in court to face cocaine charges.
   Turner, 55, was charged with possession of cocaine, conspiracy
to sell cocaine and maintaining a residence for the purpose of
selling cocaine.
   He appeared before Superior Court Judge Gilbert Alston and was
released after posting $15,000 bail.
   Pre-trial motions for Turner and co-defendant Richard Lee
Griffin are set March 18. Two other co-defendants return March 18
for sentencing on conspiracy charges.
   Turner was arrested in June 1985, after he allegedly tried to
sell $16,000 worth of cocaine to an undercover officer in Hollywood.
   A trial is sheduled on another charge March 14 in Santa Monica
Superior Court on separate felony drug-trafficking charges that
include alleged transport of cocaine and possession of rock cocaine
for sale.
   Those charges stem from an August 1987, incident in which Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputies stopped Turner after the car he
was in allegedly was seen moving erratically.
   In October 1986, Turner admitted he had used cocaine every day
for at least 15 years and said he was undergoing rehabilitation.
   Turner formed the Ike and Tina Turner Revue with his wife, and
they produced hits such as ``Proud Mary'' before splitting up in
1976.
   Miss Turner went on to record the 1985 Grammy-Award winning
record and song of the year, ``What's Love Got to Do With It.'' Her
``Private Dancer'' album garnered two other Grammys.

<TEXT>
   While serving in the German army, Kurt
Waldheim forwarded a request for the mass deportation of Greek
civilians to labor camps in 1943, according to a Nazi document.
   The authenticity of the document, found in the U.S. National
Archives and made public Monday, was confirmed by U.S. Justice
Department spokesman John Russell. He said it was among the crucial
documents on which the government based its decision to place
Waldheim, now Austria's president and formerly U.N.
secretary-general, on a list barring him from entering the United
States.
   Under the Nuremberg Charter adopted at the end of the war,
deportation of civilians is both a war crime and a crime against
humanity. When the U.S. Justice Department barred Waldheim from the
United States, it said he had ``assisted or otherwise
participated'' in ``mass deportation of civilians.''
   Waldheim has repeatedly declared he is innocent of any war
crimes.
   The document is a message between German army officers in the
Balkans in World War II and indicates the information was received
by radio by Waldheim, who signed its transcription and forwarded it
on Aug. 15, 1943.
   Waldheim at that time was a lieutenant serving as deputy
operations officer of the German General Staff attached to the 11th
Italian Army in Athens.
   The communication from a German army field officer was addressed
to his headquarters and said there is ``hope of success only if all
male civilians are seized and deported'' in the area in northern
Greece where his division was operating. It also said ``cleansing
operations are deemed necessary.''
   Nazi ``cleansing operations'' often meant the destruction of
towns and deportation or execution of their inhabitants.
   The captured Nazi document was made available to The Associated
Press by the World Jewish Congress in the original German text,
with excerpts in English. Justice Department sources concurred in
the translation.
   Gerold Christian, Waldheim's spokesman, said today he had no
comment on the document.
   The document apparently has been used before, according to
Manfred Messerschmidt, a West German historian who was a member of
an international commission that investigated Waldheim's World War
II past.
   The historians' commission and a White Book published last year
by Waldheim's aides both reviewed what seems to be the same
document, Messerschmidt said.
   The commission's report, released Feb. 9, contradicts the White
Book, saying Waldheim's initials on the Aug. 15, 1943 document
indicate he must have known about persecutions of civilians in
Greece.
   The White Book says Waldheim's initials signify ``nothing but
his certifying the correctness of a copy of the message for
inclusion'' in the official war diary of his unit.
   The World Jewish Congress said Waldheim did not authorize the
deportation of the Greeks to labor camps in Germany but that he was
aware of the plan.
   It also said a deportation order later was countermanded by an
Italian commander whom the congress did not identify.
   The historians' commission appointed by the Austrian government
reported last month that Waldheim was ``in close proximity'' to
Nazi atrocities in the Balkans, knew they were going on and made no
attempt to prevent them. The report did not support allegations
made by various groups, including the World Jewish Congress, that
Waldheim was involved in war crimes.
   Waldheim, who has rejected calls for his resignation from the
presidency, said the report vindicated him.
   The Austrian government has protested that the United States did
not disclose the documents on which it based its decision to bar
Waldheim from entry. Washington responded by saying its
investigation was based on documents available to Waldheim and he
could appeal the decision. He has not done so.
   The executive director of the World Jewish Congress, Elan
Steinberg, said the document signed by Waldheim was located by
Congress researchers at the U.S. National Archives in 1986 and
turned over to the Justice Department.
   Reporters asked why the document was not made public until
Monday. Steinberg said there is now increasing interest in why
Waldheim was placed on a list barring him from the United States.
He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Ex-National Security Council Aide Told to Testify at Detroit Drug
Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Col. Oliver North and two other figures in
the Iran-Contra affair were ordered to testify at a federal trial
about an alleged scheme to smuggle marijuana and cocaine into
Michigan from South America.
   The defense lawyer who obtained the subpoenas said North might
be able to provide information about a pilot who flew supplies to
Nicaraguan rebels under contract with the CIA and also was accused
of transporting the drugs.
   North, the former National Security Council aide fired in
November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair transpired, last week was
ordered to appear March 15 before U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs
Taylor in Detroit.
   Defense attorney Ronald C. Dresnick of Miami said he wanted to
determine North's relationship with Michael B. Palmer. According to
the indictment of Dresnick's client and seven other defendants,
Palmer was aboard a DC-6 aircraft allegedly used to ship drugs into
Michigan last summer.
   Dresnick represents Frank Ivan Turek Correa of Colombia, one of
eight defendants indicted Sept. 24 on charges of conspiring to
import tons of cocaine and marijuana into Michigan between July and
Sept. 6, 1987.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Donaldson, referring to
Dresnick's claim that Palmer was a contract employee of the CIA,
said the defense was a diversion and ``a red herring.''
   Palmer was a vice president of Southern Air Transport, a
CIA-backed operation, Dresnick said. According to court documents,
Palmer contracted with the State Department to fly food and
clothing to the Contra rebels trying to topple the government of
Nicaragua.
   Palmer never was charged in the Detroit case despite his
apparent role in the alleged trafficking.
   Dresnick, in his court filing seeking North's testimony,
provided a page from North's desk calendar dated Aug. 9, 1985, with
a hand-written notation reading: ``DC-6, which is being used (for
Contra supply) runs out of New Orleans, is probably being used for
drug runs into the U.S.''
   The same calendar page also noted a ``meeting with Rob,'' who
Dresnick said he believed was Robert Owen, North's liaison with the
Contras. Both Owen and Palmer also have been subpoenaed to testify
in Detroit, although Palmer's whereabouts are unknown.
   Barry Simon, a Washington attorney representing North, refused
to say Monday night whether North had received the subpoena or to
answer any other questions.
   Witnesses who refuse to answer a subpoena can be subject to a
bench warrant for their arrest.

   After a month of preparation, it took
only 17 minutes to roll over an upside-down oil barge that had been
raised from the bottom of Guemes Channel and partially unloaded.
   A floating sheen of oil reached the shore of Shannon Point
before and during the rollover Monday in a release estimated at 300
gallons to 500 gallons of a light grade of oil. Much of it was
sopped up with absorbent materials.
   ``I'm relieved, because it eliminates an ecological time bomb,''
said Coast Guard Lt. Eldo DeLong.
   The 176-foot barge sank Jan. 31 in 130 feet of water four miles
west of Anacortes. It was raised from the bottom Sunday by two
giant derricks.
   The site is about 75 miles north of Seattle on Washington's
inner coast in an area of Dungeness crabs, salmon farms, bottom
fish and other saltwater life.
   Officials had said that 70,000 gallons of oil escaped from the
barge when it sank, and another 344,000 gallons was still on the
barge when the lifting operation began Sunday. Roughly 92,610
gallons of oil was pumped out Sunday night and Monday.
   More oil was to be pumped out of the barge until it was stable
enough to be towed to port.
   Some oil has been detected in kelp beds and in bottom-dwelling
sea cucumbers, and at least one bird has died.
   The barge, operated by Olympic Tug and Barge Co. of Seattle, was
being towed from an oil refinery at Anacortes to Seattle when it
sank.

<TEXT>
   A Zimbabwean diplomat who was expelled
from the United States for allegedly abusing his 9-year-old son
said the boy returned home today from New York accompanied by a
Zimbabwean social worker.
   Diplomat Floyd Karamba said his son, Terrence, was immediately
placed under the care of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the
semi-official Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency reported.
   ``My son arrived this morning accompanied by a Zimbabwean social
worker and is in normal condition,'' Karamba was quoted as saying.
   U.S. officials said Terrence Karamba left New York for Zimbabwe
on Sunday accompanied by a Zimbabwean social worker. He will not be
returned to his father's custody, according to reports today in the
New York Daily News, the Washington Post and the Washington Times.
   Zimbabwe has said it will place the boy in the auspices of the
courts and the state ministry of social welfare, said Robert J.
McMahon, director of the New York social services agency that cared
for the boy for the past two months.
   McMahon, head of St. Christopher-Ottile Services for Children
and Families, was also quoted today saying the Zimbabwean
government said the Karamba family will undergo counseling in hopes
of eventually reuniting Terrence with the family.
   A New York government agency had charged that Floyd Karamba had
beaten the boy, who in December was removed from his home and
placed in foster care.
   The father, who served for more than a year as a member of
Zimbabwe's delegation to the United Nations, was ordered Dec. 21 to
leave the United States because of what State Department officials
called ``clear evidence of child abuse.''
   In January, the Supreme Court refused to block the U.S.
government from sending the boy home despite arguments from the
Legal Aid Society that the boy was afraid to go home.
   McMahon said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., interceded
and persuaded the State Department that the boy should not be
returned immediately.
   The State Department had a psychiatric consultant accompany the
boy on his trip home and also engaged a law firm in Zimbabwe to
monitor his case, the Post reported.
   Karamba's wife and two other children returned to Zimbabwe in
January$

   A police officer who was shot to death
while he guarded a witness in a drug case was given a farewell by
10,000 police officers amid vows to find his killer and hopes that
his death helps the fight against drug dealers.
   The throng of officers, some from as far away as Texas and Ohio,
lined eight blocks approaching St. James Church on Monday for the
funeral of Edward Byrne, a 22-year-old rookie officer.
   ``If drug trafficking has become so bold that they can engage in
the assassination of a police officer, then our whole society is at
risk,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said at the funeral service. ``That is
why his death is so important.''
   In his homily, the Rev. Thomas DeVita said, ``Eddie's murderers
need to be pitied and also prayed for. They do not know about the
sanctity of life. They cannot really know or understand what they
have done, even though this is such a terrible sin.''
   Eight officers served as pallbearers as a bagpiper played ``When
the Battle is Over.''
   Police have been rounding up suspected crack dealers since the
murder early Friday in hopes of finding someone who will shed light
on the killing. Officer Peter O'Donnell, a police spokesman, said
that as of Monday night, 108 had been arrested in the South Jamaica
section of Queens, where the killing took place.
   Byrne was guarding the house of a man who had complained to
police about crack dealers in that neighborhood. The officer, who
had been on the force just eight months, was hit by three shotgun
blasts as he sat in a radio car.
   Others attending the funeral included Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward, Cardinal John J. O'Connor and Officer Steven
McDonald, who was paralyzed below the neck by a gunman's bullet in
1986.
   Koch had taken out a full page in The New York Times on Monday.
It bore Byrne's picture, and called upon the federal government to
take tough measures with foreign governments that allow drug
trafficking.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., echoed Koch's sentiments outside
the church.
   ``Our nation's leaders appear to be isolated from our people in
the streets who are being killed and from our youngsters who are
becoming addicts,'' said D'Amato. ``Our nation's leaders don't have
the guts to cut off aid to countries run by narcotics dealers such
as Panama.''
   In Texas, more than 2,000 people attended a memorial service
Monday for Officer Gary D. McCarthy, the third Dallas policeman
killed in six weeks.
   He was off duty and moonlighting as a part-time security guard
at a grocery store when he was gunned down Friday during an
attempted robbery. Three men have been arrested, one of them a
parolee who served less than a year of a five-year sentence for
aggravated assault on a police officer.

   Two men riding a motorbike shot and killed
a Greek industrialist today as he drove to work in the capital,
police said.
   A left-wing terrorist group that staged an almost identical
slaying of a U.S. Navy officer at the same Athens intersection in
1983 claimed responsibility for the assassination, authorities said.
   Alexandros Athanassiadis, 59, died of chest and stomach wounds
from bullets that were fired through his car's open window while it
was stopped at a red light on Kifissias Avenue, a police spokesman
said.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said the gunmen sped
away and the motorbike was found abandoned.
   Doctors at the Hygeia Hospital said Athanassiadis died during
surgery.
   ``He had multiple wounds in the chest and stomach. We tried
heart massage for 15-20 minutes, but couldn't revive him,'' Dr.
Vassilis Georgoulis said.
   Athanassiadis was chief executive officer of the Hellenic
Chemical Products and Fertilizers company.
   The terrorist organization November 17 claimed responsibility
for his killing in leaflets found in the street, the police
spokesman said.
   The typewritten leaflet said the organization killed
Athanassiadis because ``he was a classic capitalist...indifferent
to the health of the workers and the environment.''
   The leaflet claimed that Hellenic Chemical Products, which has a
plant in a western industrial suburb of Athens, was a major
contributor to pollution. It also criticized the government, saying
it had led Greece into ``economic, social and cultural crisis.''
   A government statement expressed ``deepest sorrow and
condolences'' and said the Greek ``people as a whole condemn such
terrorist actions.''
   Athanassiadis' wife, Katerina, told reporters her husband drove
the same route to work every morning from their home in the Ekali
suburb. ``He hadn't told me of anything suspicious,'' she said.
   The police spokesman said the assailants pulled up beside
Athanassiadis' car and tapped on the passenger side window. As it
opened, they started firing. The attack took place at 8:15 a.m., he
said.
   The shooting occurred at the same junction where a U.S. Navy
officer was gunned down by the same terrorist group in November
1983, the spokesman said.
   The Navy officer, Capt. George Tsantes, was attached to the U.S.
Embassy in Athens. His driver also died in the attack.
   ``It was a carbon copy of the Tsantes killing _ the same traffic
light, the same method with two men on a motorbike,'' the police
spokesman said.
   November 17 has claimed responsibility for a dozen attacks
against Americans, Greek police officers and businessmen since
1975. None of its members has been arrested.
   The left-wing group is named for the day in 1973 when troops and
tanks crushed a student rebellion against the 1967-74 military
dictatorship.
   November 17 says American bases in Greece should be closed and
that Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government has failed
to change Greek society.
   Before today, the group had staged three attacks over the past
year, none of which resulted in deaths. In April and August the
group claimed responsibility for remote-control bomb blasts against
buses carrying American military personnel, but in each case the
bomb exploded prematurely.
   The group's most recent attempt involved a failed bomb attack in
January against a U.S. Embassy staff member.

   A Civil War cannonball still capable of
exploding has been turned over to bomb squad investigators by a man
who believes as many as 25 others may have been taken as souvenirs.
   Thomas L. Combs Sr., 64, of Clements, Md., gave a rusted,
six-inch, 120-year-old cannonball to the Maryland Fire Marshal's
bomb squad Monday.
   He became concerned after hearing news reports 10 days earlier
that an identical cannonball that was given to the St. Clements
Island Museum had been found to be live, said fire marshal's
spokesman Bob Thomas.
   The bomb squad determined Combs' cannonball also was live and
took it to a bomb laboratory in Harford County, where investigators
are trying to defuse and salvage the museum's cannonball, which a
Potomac River clammer found in his net.
   Thomas said both cannonballs have a fuse and contain black
powder.
   ``If it detonates, it would send shrapnel from inside in all
directions. (It was) meant to inflict numerous casualties,'' Thomas
said.
   Combs said his cannonball had been collecting dust in a tool
shed behind his home since 1961, when he found it while deer
hunting near Chantilly, Va., Thomas said.
   Combs told officials he took the cannonball from a pyramid of
about 20 to 25 others in a heavily wooded area, and that the stack
appeared to have been left there since the Civil War, Thomas said.
   Combs noticed the pyramid of cannonballs becoming smaller during
his hunting excursions over the next 20 years, until none were
left, Thomas said.
   ``That means that at least 25 citizens might have a (live bomb)
in their house or on their property,'' Thomas said.
   Investigators suspect it was a cache of Confederate munitions,
he said.
   Thomas said the bomb squad would pick up any suspect cannonballs
for free and return them if they can be defused without damage.
   Maryland officials plan to notify state and county authorities
in Virginia about the discovery, Thomas said.

<HEAD>Former Queen Of Italy Returns After 42-Year Exile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AOSTA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Queen Maria Jose, widow of the last
king of Italy, made a brief return to the country without fanfare
today after a 42-year exile imposed by the constitution.
   The Belgium-born Maria Jose, who lives in Switzerland, crossed
the border by car this morning with her daughter, Maria Gabriella,
to attend a conference on St. Anselm in this city near Mount Blanc.
   After three hours, they drove back home.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the 81-year-old former queen
of the House of Savoy initially went unnoticed as she took a seat
in the back row of the conference hall. When officials realized who
she was, they interrupted the meeting and invited her to sit in the
front as the audience applauded, the report said.
   Maria Jose was invited to the conference last month by the St.
Anselm Academy, of which she is an honorary member. St. Anselm of
Canterbury was born in Aosta in the 11th century.
   ``I knew that she had been invited to the conference but I
really didn't think she would actually come. She took us all by
surprise,'' said Gianni Bondaz, president of the regional council.
   The former queen, who walked with a cane, wore a black pants
suit, black cap, black gloves and a bright red scarf. She spoke
only a few words to journalists, saying ``I didn't feel any special
emotions entering Italy but I am happy.
   ``This morning when we crossed the border I was much more
excited than she was,'' ANSA quoted her daughter as saying.
   She quoted Maria Jose as saying once they emerged from the Mount
Blanc tunnel in Italy, ``Oh how beautiful. The sun is out. I told
you that the Aosta Valley is beautiful.''
   The government last year lifted the constitutional ban on the
entry of the former queen, who had made a request a year earlier to
return to Italy. There have been unconfirmed media reports that she
has secretly slipped into the country in the past.
   Her husband, Umberto II, reigned for 26 days before being forced
into exile in 1946 after a referendum abolished the monarchy. He
died in exile in Geneva five years ago at the age of 78.
   The House of Savoy ruled over Piedmont for nine centuries and
its kings reigned in Italy from 1861 to 1946.

   Former boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter,
breaking a 12-year silence after finally winning his long battle
for freedom, says he was sentenced to ``a life of living death''
but is not bitter.
   ``For 20 years, I was considered a danger to society, a scourge
upon humanity. I was locked away in an iron cage for not one, but
three lifetimes,'' the former middleweight title contender said
Monday in a news conference.
   Carter was convicted in the 1966 murder of three white men in a
Paterson bar and served 19 years in prison before the indictment
was finally dismissed last week.
   But Carter, 50, dressed in a tan suede jacket, dark tie and navy
blue pants, said during the 90-minute news conference that he
harbors no bitterness over the system that jailed him.
   ``If I have learned anything in my life, it's that bitterness
consumes the vessel that contains it,'' he said.
   The 1966 verdict against Carter and John Artis was overturned,
but the two black men were again convicted in 1976.
   Carter, who was serving a life term, was freed in 1985 by U.S.
District Judge H. Lee Sarokin in Newark, N.J., who found the
conviction was tainted by racism and the witholding of information
by prosecutors.
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the judge's 1985 decision, and a
Passaic County judge last Friday signed the papers dismissing the
indictment, as requested by county prosecutors.
   Carter had remained in seclusion, declining to discuss the case
publicly. But on Monday he condemned over-zealous prosecutors, the
horrors of the state prison system, the jailing of innocent people
and racism.
   ``They sentenced me to a life of living death,'' he said. ``And
there is no other way to describe the nature of a prison. Prison
destroys everything valuable in the life of a human being.''
   Artis, paroled in 1981, is serving a six-year prison term on an
unrelated drug charge. His lawyer, Lewis Steel, issued a plea for
Artis' freedom, saying the judge who sentenced him in the drug case
improperly took the voided murder convictions into account in the
sentencing. The drug sentence is on appeal.
   Carter's cause was taken up in the 1970s by celebrities, who
championed him as a symbol of racial injustice. Bob Dylan wrote a
ballad about the case, which played repeatedly in the background
before the news conference.
   Carter refused to blame the trial's prosecutors directly for his
fate, but said ``racism is sleazy'' and referred to Sarokin's
finding that the prosecution made ``an appeal to racism rather than
reason.''
   Since being freed, he said he has worked on his case nearly
every day and his third book, ``No Holds Barred, No Bars To Hold,''
while living in southern New Jersey.
   Carter said he had difficulty understanding how he came to serve
nearly two decades in prison.
   ``One moment I'm a championship prize fighter, the next moment
and 20 years after I'm reviled as a triple murderer,'' he said.
   ``The fact that the most productive years of my life, the ages
of 29 and 50, have been stolen, the fact that I was deprived of
seeing my children grow up, wouldn't you think I would have a right
to be bitter?'' he said.
   But being bitter would give the state another victory, he
said.``That would make me an accomplice to their crime.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Police Quizzed AIDS-Afflicted Porn Star In 1981
Murder Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police recently questioned pornographic film
star John Holmes, hospitalized and gravely ill bed with AIDS, about
a 1981 mass murder for which he was tried and acquitted, a
newspaper reported today.
   The appearance of a new witness and reports Holmes may soon die
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome prompted the bedside
questioning, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   Holmes, 43, a premier male sex film star of the 1970s and early
1980s, made hundreds of sexually explicit films and thousands of
peep shows in his career.
   Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper reported a new witness has
surfaced with information about the grisly beating deaths of four
people in a house in the affluent hillside neighborhood of Laurel
Canyon.
   Mitchell Egers, one of two lawyers who successfully defended
Holmes in 1982, refused to disclose what, if anything, Holmes told
homicide detectives.
   Egers confirmed that Holmes is hospitalized with a serious
illness but would not say if he suffers from AIDS.
   However, the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying
Holmes' illness has been positively diagnosed as AIDS, the
incurable disease transmitted through sex, shared hypodermic
needles and transfers of infected blood products.
   Holmes was cleared of killing four people who were found beaten
to death in a Laurel Canyon home. Detective Tom Lange, supervisor
of the investigation, declined to discuss the case Monday except to
say it remains active.
   Prosecutors said the four were part of a theft ring for which
Holmes acted as a middleman to Los Angeles nightclub owner Adel
Nasrallah, also known as Eddie Nash. Holmes allegedly fenced stolen
property for the group to Nash, who allegedly paid for the loot
with drugs.
   Nash's business had been robbed two days before the murder.
Prosecutors alleged Holmes staged the robbery and, when discovered,
led killers to the Laurel Canyon home. Prosecutors claimed he
committed one of the murders with his own hands.
   Jurors cited a lack of corroborating evidence for their vote for
acquittal.
   Nash was sentenced in a separate case to eight years in prison
for possession of two pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $1
million. He was released after serving less than two years.
   Lange said Nash remains a suspect in the Laurel Canyon killings,
as does his one-time bodyguard, and that police have other suspects.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two classmates from Stuyvesant High School in
New York won the top awards in the 47th annual national Science
Talent Search.
   In results announced Monday night, Chetan Nayak, 16, was awarded
the top prize for a mathematical analysis of gravitation and
electromagnetic fields. He will receive a $20,000 college
scholarship.
   Janet Tseng, 17, whose project was a study of a parasitic
infection common in AIDS victims, was awarded a $15,000 scholarship
as the second-place winner.
   Both students are seniors at Stuyvesant High School in New York
City. Nayak lives in Manhattan and Ms. Tseng lives in Queens.
   The third-place winner was Benjamin S. Abella, 17, of Chicago.
His project studied genes that affect protein production in a
certain bacterium. He is a senior at the University of Chicago
Laboratory Schools High School and will receive a $15,000 college
scholarship.
   The winners were announced at a banquet that followed judging of
the projects from 40 finalists in the annual national competition
that had included 1,339 entrants. The finalists, 24 boys and 16
girls from 17 states, came to Washington last week for the final
judging.
   Under the sponsorship of Westinghouse Electric Corp., the
Science Talent Search has been conducted annually since 1942.
Former contest finalists include five Nobel Prize laureates and 27
members of the National Academy of Sciences.

   A man who spent almost two years in prison
after he confessed to a murder he didn't commit was freed four days
after another man confessed to the crime.
   Steven Ferndo, 20, of south St. Louis, said he confessed to
stabbing Charles Oxenhandler in January 1986 because he was a drug
addict and ``sick of life.''
   Ferndo was freed by St. Louis Circuit Judge Robert Dowd Jr.
after Douglas Weems of Jefferson County confessed last Thursday to
the killing.
   ``Drugs had ruined my life,'' Ferndo said of his decision to
confess. ``I was down. I was a drug addict. I gave up on life.
   ``Now I don't even remember that life. Now I just want to go up
in the world and put my life together.''
   Ferndo was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1986 after he
entered an ``Alford plea,'' which makes no attempt to counter the
evidence while offering no admission of guilt.
   The case was reopened in October after a young woman who had
been punched by Weems told authorities that Weems had killed
Oxenhandler.
   Weems, 23, was charged with second-degree murder in the killing
of Oxenhander, a radio consultant who used the stage name of Robert
Hattrick. Weems told police that a fight had broken out after
Oxenhandler made homosexual advances.
   Ferndo's mother, Janie Gillian, wept at the hearing Monday and
said, ``My baby's out ... I knew he was not a killer.''

   A convicted Mafia boss was shot dead on a
busy street in the center of city about 200 feet from police
headquarters, officials reported.
   A policewoman gave chase but the killer disappeared into the
crowd and escaped.
   The Italian news agency ANSA first reported that the assassin
wore a minskirt and high heels, but officials said the killer was a
man and that witnesses were confused by the police officer running
with her pistol in hand.
   The victim was identified as Domenico Cavo, 29, considered the
No. 2 man in the Mafia clan that controls the rackets in this city
in eastern Sicily. He was killed instantly by two bullets fired at
close range while standing in front of a coffee bar, police said.
   Cavo was sentenced to eight years in prison last April after a
mass trial of Mafia suspects. He was out on provisional liberty
while appealing the conviction.

<TEXT>
   The nation has a new postmaster general today,
the fourth in as many years.
   Anthony M. Frank, a San Francisco banker, took office as head of
the U.S. Postal Service without formal ceremony. He started his
service with a meeting of top postal executives.
   Frank takes over the troubled agency with a rate increase
pending at the same time cuts in services have been forced by
congressionally required spending reductions. The cuts include
reduced sorting time, collections and window hours.
   He brings to the job a reputation as an innovator who encourages
initiative in his managers and is willing to try new ideas.
   A decision by the independent Postal Rate Commission is expected
within a week on a rate increase proposed by the agency last year.
The complex series of rate changes would include a 25-cent first
class rate, if approved, and could take effect by mid-April.
   The service cuts are not likely to change, even with higher
rates, since the new stamp prices were proposed to cope with other
cost pressures and are not related to the budget changes imposed by
Congress.
   Frank succeeds New York businessman Preston R. Tisch, who had
held the post since Aug. 6, 1986. Tisch followed Albert V. Casey,
who held the job for only seven months. Casey replaced Paul N.
Carlin, who served for just a year from January 1985 to 1986.

   A 16-month-old girl bitten last week by a
swarm of ants has died, a hospital spokeswoman said today.
   Tiffany Cheatham died Monday night, according to Kathy Musial of
Sacred Heart Hospital here. The spokeswoman said she did not yet
know the official cause of death.
   Tiffany was rushed to the hospital Feb. 23 after a playful dog
pushed her into an ant hill near her Florida Panhandle home of
Navarre, 20 miles outside Pensacola.
   The girl's mother, Lynn Cheatham, and a neighbor had desparately
tried to remove the ants, taking off Tiffany's clothes and putting
her in a bathtub, but many of the insects were entangled in her
hair.
   ``There were ants all around all of us,'' said the neighbor,
Janet Streaker.
   The girl initially lapsed into unconsciousness, but was revived
at the scene, said Chief Don Van Derryt of the Holley-Navarre Fire
and Rescue Association.
   Ann Papadelias, another hospital spokeswoman, said she suspected
the girl was attacked by fire ants, known for painful and sometimes
deadly stings.

   Concealing marijuana, playing tag with
patrol cars and making love atop a squad car were among misconduct
allegations filed against a group of suspended policemen, town
officials have disclosed.
   Police Chief Robert Peyer and four policemen were suspended with
pay by the Police and Fire Commission last month. On Monday, town
chairman Wayne Polzin detailed the accusations against the five.
   No criminal charges have been filed. The commission has
scheduled personnel hearings March 21, and Peyer has said he would
insist on an open hearing.
   Peyer has been accused of giving information to a nightclub
owner who was under investigation by police and the Internal
Revenue Service, and of lying about selling uniform patches and
other apparel to a nightclub stripper.
   Evidence seized last year under a search warrant included a
photograph showing a woman in a town of Delavan police uniform.
   The town had originally refused to release the allegations, but
Polzin said town officials wanted to avoid a legal challenge by
news media under the state's Open Records Law.
   ``We are releasing them,'' Polzin said, ``after considering the
threats by the media about charges against the town and the
consideration we may have to pay court costs and fines.''
   The suspended patrolmen are William Mortlock, Ernest Hardwick,
Edward Rome and Jeffrey Lofy. Documents quoted by the Milwaukee
Sentinel accuse:
   _ Hardwick and Peyer of providing information to Jerry Petrone
during an investigation of Petrone's nightclub.
   _ Peyer and Hardwick of playing golf during duty hours.
   _ Peyer of failing to turn in confiscated marijuana, of failing
to investigate reports that Rome and Lofy played chase in squad
cars and failing to act on a traffic investigation of a juvenile
living at Petrone's house.
   _ Rome of having sex with a woman on a police car.
   _ Mortlock and Peyer of gaining free admission to Petrone's club
in violation of department rules that forbid accepting gratuities.
   Delavan is a town of 5,700 residents about 40 miles southwest of
Milwaukee.

<HEAD>Drug-Addicted Infants Seem To Improve On Waterbeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Waterbeds work wonders for babies born addicted
to narcotics used by their mothers, a new study indicates, but
researchers say they aren't sure why.
   Such infants have easier withdrawal, are more comfortable and
are more likely to thrive if they lie on waterbeds instead of
traditional bassinets, the study found.
   Infants going through drug withdrawal suffer many of the same
symptoms that afflict adult addicts, including irritability,
tremors, vomiting, abnormal sleeping and poor feeding.
   But a waterbed provides improved care that is ``safe,
noninvasive, inexpensive and effective,'' said the researchers,
whose findings were published in the February issue of the American
Journal of Diseases of Children.
   One of the researchers, Dr. Suzanne D. Dixon, cautioned that
this is essentially an improved nursing technique and not even a
partial solution to the problem posed by addicted infants.
   ``This study was to evaluate a simple nursing change to see if
it could make life just a little better for children who have a lot
of things stacked against them,'' said Dixon, with the pediatrics
department at the Univerity of California in San Diego.
   Waterbed use makes the early days of newborn addicts more
comfortable, helps in some traditional treatments and hopefully
gives youngsters a better chance for normal development, she said.
   She said researchers aren't sure why the waterbeds seem to help.
   More expensive oscillating waterbeds have been used successfully
with premature non-addicted babies to provide movement stimulation.
But the researchers found that newborn addicts can benefit from
non-oscillating beds that are less expensive than traditional
bassinets.
   ``Over half of the narcotic-exposed neonates required medication
to control withdrawal symptoms,'' the researchers said.
   ``Those on waterbeds required a significantly lower maximum
phenobarbital dose and had a lower incidence of hospital discharge
with medication, thereby reducing the newborn's exposure to
additional drugs.''
   When discharged from the hospital, 63 percent of the waterbed
babies had been weened from withdrawal medication, as opposed to 38
percent of infants in bassinets.
   The research was conducted on 30 infants born with an addiction
to narcotics, mostly heroin or methadone. Half were put on
waterbeds, half in bassinets.
   By the fifth day, researchers said, it was clear the waterbeds
were having an impact.
   Withdrawal symptoms such as vomiting, tremors and congestion
were less severe among the waterbed babies, the study found. They
also went to sleep more easily and had improved weight gain.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Husband To Blame For Children's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with involuntary
manslaughter says it was her husband who locked their two young
children in a sun-baked car last summer, leading to the youngsters'
deaths, her lawyer says.
   Lisa Shields, 19, of White Township, relied on her husband, John
Shields, 24, to take care of their children, Kristle, 3, and
Calvin, 1, on Aug. 22, said lawyer Thomas Johnson.
   Shields will ``testify his wife told him to watch the children
while she went inside the house because she was ill,'' Thomas said
during opening remarks Monday in the first day of Mrs. Shield's
trial.
   Prosecutors called 11 witnesses Monday and were expected to call
several more today before the defense began its case.
   The couple left a party early on Aug. 22 and drove to a
relative's farmhouse, according to an affidavit by state police.
Mrs. Shields slept in the car with the children from about 5 a.m.
to 9 a.m., and Shields went into the house, police said.
   Then Mrs. Shields went into the house and asked her husband to
take care of the children, Johnson said. Shields moved the car to a
sunnier location and rolled up the windows, police said.
   When Mrs. Shields checked the children several hours later, she
found Calvin unconscious and Kristle gasping for breath, according
to police. Calvin was pronounced dead at the scene and his sister
died the next day in Pittsburgh's Mercy Hospital. Autopsies showed
both died of high temperatures.
   Mrs. Shields also is charged with endangering the welfare of
children. Her husband faces identical charges and is scheduled to
go on trial later this month in Mifflin County.
   Each defendant won a change of venue from Indiana County after
defense attorneys argued pre-trial publicity made seating an
impartial jury impossible there. They have been jailed since their
arrests.

   Fifty-two people were arrested and at
least $85,000 worth of exotic animals and organs were seized during
an undercover investigation, according to a published report.
   The Oakland Tribune reported today that officers seized a
variety of animal parts including genitalia from tigers and sea
lions, rhinoceros horns and dried abalone.
   Several hundred male sex organs from other species were also
seized, said Chuck Monroe, a California Department of Fish and Game
patrol chief at the department's Yountville headquarters in Napa
County.
   The operation began as an investigation into illegal trafficking
in bear gall bladders, said Monroe.
   Most of the charges involve poaching and commercialization of
wildlife, both misdemeanor violations of the state Fish and Game
Code, he said.
   Munroe said the animal parts were marketed mostly to the Asian
community as aphrodisiacs and general health foods. In some cases,
he said, gall bladders from cows or pigs were sold as bear organs.

<HEAD>Curfew Imposed In Sumgait, Site Of Rioting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet government spokesman said today a curfew
was imposed in Sumgait, the city in Azerbaidzhan where rioting
broke out two days ago. He said ``some mistakes'' had been made
concerning a disputed territory that is home to tens of thousands
of Armenians.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the
situation was calm but tense in Azerbaidzhan and neighboring Soviet
Armenia, where ethnic hatred triggered demonstrations, violence and
at least two deaths in recent days.
   He suggested the unrest resulted from a ``mistake'' made 65
years ago when a territory composed largely of ethnic Armenians was
made part of neighboring Azerbaidzhan.
   ``There were certain injuries'' in Sumgait, an industrial city
where hooligans were blamed for touching off a riot Sunday,
Gerasimov said.
   At his regular briefing today, the Soviet spokesman was peppered
with questions about the unrest in the southern republics of
Armenia and Azerbaidzhan. However, he said he had few details.
   Foreign journalists have been barred from the region, and only
sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and the official media
have reached Moscow.
   Gerasimov was asked about reports that Soviet tanks are
patrolling Sumgait, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians
there and that there have been at least two deaths in the city.
   He responded that ``there is a curfew'' in Sumgait, but that he
had not heard anything about tanks being sent into the city. ``The
situation is calm there today, but it is tense,'' Gerasimov said.
   Asked if troops remained in the city today, he said, ``I don't
know, but I guess so. Presumably.''
   The violence in Sumgait, reported Monday by the official Soviet
news agency Tass, followed outbreaks 150 miles away in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the contested region in Azerbaidzhan, and mass
demonstrations in Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia.
   The demonstrators demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been
part of Azerbaidzhan since 1923, be made part of Armenia.
Three-quarters of the area's 157,000 residents are Armenian.
   Gerasimov said he did not have detailed reports from the entire
region but that what information he had indicated ``everything is
calm'' in Yerevan and surrounding areas.
   ``The events that took place caused great concern to us,'' he
said. ``We think it is not a proper way to settle the problems that
have accumulated.''
   Gerasimov acknowledged, however, that the unrest apparently
stemmed from ``some mistakes made in the national relations, and
these mistakes should be rectified.''
   Soviet authorities have pledged to reconsider the issue of
Nagorno-Karabakh's parent republic, and Gerasimov's statement
seemed to indicate the region might be turned over to Armenia. He
did not, however, say when that might occur.
   Asked if he meant to say that Nagorno-Karabakh should be made
part of Armenia, Gerasimov said: ``I meant there were some mistakes
in Nagorno-Karabakh.''
   He described the region as ``a kind of enclave'' in Azerbaidzhan
with 49 nationalities represented among the population that is
nonetheless mostly Armenian.
   ``That is why we should be very tactful in handling this
question in order not to cause differences between brothers and
nationalities. The previous policy had some mistakes in this
area,'' he said.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for
``civil maturity and restraint'' and promised the Communist Party
Central Committee would review relations among the Soviet Union's
more than 100 nationalities.
   Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet republics in the
Caucasus. It is bordered on the west by largely Christian Armenia
and Georgia and on the north by the Russian Republic.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz turned today
to King Hussein of Jordan to back the U.S. drive for Mideast peace
talks.
   ``He's a key, in my opinion,'' Shultz said. ``He has immense
standing and a person who's been here a long time. Through all of
these issues, up and down, he's a man of experience and judgment.''
   Talking to reporters on his flight from the Middle East, Shultz
hinted he was inclined to return to the region after a NATO summit
meeting in Brussels Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``Nobody has signed up to our proposal, but everybody wants us
to keep working, so we will keep working,'' Shultz said in a
departure statement in Israel.
   ``We will continue our efforts,'' he said.
   After arriving at London's Heathrow Airport, he met Hussein at a
private residence owned by the king in central London. Shultz also
was to see Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Foreign Secretary
Sir Geoffrey Howe before flying to Brussels later today.
   In Jerusalem, diplomatic sources, demanding anonymity, said
Shultz had told Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir he would
return after the NATO summit if Hussein gave at least qualified
support to the U.S. proposal.
   It calls for Israel, Jordan, and Palestinians to open
negotiations on about April 1 on self-rule of the 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza. Talks on
an overall Middle East settlement would begin by December.
   ``We are still very much in a process of working,'' Shultz said
as he left Israel.
   While in the Middle East, he met with Jordanian officials
including Crown Prince Hassan. But only the king, who went to
London for dental treatment, can give an authoritative response for
the Arab country that occupied the West Bank from 1949 to 1967.
   ``King Hussein is a very critical factor in it all,'' Shultz
said aboard his Air Force jet.
   He said he would report to President Reagan in Brussels and go
back to the Middle East after the summit if ``he wants me to.''
   Shultz acknowledged he had made little concrete progress during
four days of talks with Israeli and Arab leaders. While he said he
could see a narrowing of differences, ``I don't know if I could
describe them in a way that would be perceptible to anyone else.''
   And yet, Shultz said, ``Assuming everyone continues the attitude
they have to keep working, to keep working, we'll do it.''
   A senior Israeli official who demanded anonymity said Jordanian
officials had surprised Shultz by hardening their insistence on
holding an international conference and by abandoning previous
support for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   Shamir has opposed a U.N.-sponsored conference attended by the
five permament members of the U.N. Security Council: the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China. He has argued such
a forum would be biased against the Jewish state.
   The joint delegation was a key element of U.S.-sponsored
peacemaking efforts because it got around Israeli refusal to
talking with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, speaking to children in the
resort city of Elat, suggested that King Hussein sought a PLO role
in selecting a negotiating team.
   ``Hussein says he wants the PLO without Arafat. Let's go along
with him on this formula ... PLO, yes, Arafat, no,'' Peres said in
remarks aired on Israel's army radio.
   His remarks were initially interpreted as a change in position,
but Peres aides said there had been a ``misunderstanding.''
   Peres' spokesman Uri Savir issued a clarification, stressing
Peres is against talks with the PLO and was referring to Hussein's
position.
   Shultz, who put his personal prestige on the line during the
shuttle, found the Middle East deeply divided by distrust and a
volatile West Bank and Gaza Strip, where 76 Arabs have been killed
since rioting began Dec. 8.
   Shamir is scheduled to visit Washington in two weeks for talks
with Reagan and Shultz.
   But it could be a third key figure, chairman Yasser Arafat of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, who has been most
instrumental in upsetting Shultz's mission. One major Shultz
objective was to meet with a delegation of Palestinian Arabs in
order to get their goals in negotiations.
   But under PLO instructions, all 15 he invited to a session last
Friday in Jerusalem stayed away.
   In Amman, reporters briefed under rules that prevented them from
disclosing their sources were told Jordan no longer would put
pressure on the PLO to form a joint negotiating team. Now,
reporters were told, the Palestinians all look to the PLO as their
sole representative and Jordan did not intend to stand in their way.
   The hardened Arab stance was said to be in response to Israel's
suppression of Palestinian protests. However, a U.S. official
suggested that Jordan was more flexible in the private talks with
Shultz.
   ``I don't see any sign that Arab positions are hardening.'' But
the official added, ``We are not at the point where anybody is
saying yes or no.''

<HEAD>Heiress Among Top Bidders For Estate She Brought To Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An heiress whose lawsuit pushed a
church into bankruptcy was among four bidders for the church's
property in a recent auction.
   Elizabeth Dovydenas' $2.56 million bid for property of The Bible
Speaks church in Lenox was the third highest bid, Charles
Normandin, attorney for the court-appointed trustee managing the
church estate, said Monday.
   He said the high bid of $2.81 million came from a group called
Lenox Associates. Its lawyer, Richard Howard, declined to reveal
the partners' identities.
   Second was Kaslin Properties of New York with a bid of $2.61
million, Normandin said.
   Mrs. Dovydenas had argued in U.S. Bankruptcy Court last April
that she was duped out of a third of her chain-store fortune by the
founder and leader of the fundamentalist sect, Rev. Carl H. Stevens
Jr., while she was a parishioner from 1983 to 1986.
   The Bible Speaks campus closed last year after Mrs. Dovydenas
prevailed in her $6.6 million claim. Lawyers for the church plan to
appeal a federal judge's recent decision upholding the claim.
   Her claim is by far the largest of hundreds of creditors, who
claim they are owed more than $7 million by the church.
   Monday was the deadline for bids on the 65-acre estate with its
28 buildings. Normandin said the final round of bidding could come
at a hearing Monday at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Worcester.
   Mrs. Dovydenas had been the high bidder at a November auction of
the church headquarters, but the Bankruptcy Court rejected her $1.8
million bid as too low. The campus has been appraised at $6 million.

   Forty minority students at Hampshire
College have reached an agreement with the administration to end
their week-long takeover of a dormitory, a college spokeswoman said
today.
   The students had complained of racism at the private liberal
arts school.
   ``By the end of the day we expect the agreement to be fully
signed,'' said administration spokeswoman Melissa Stephen.
   Spokesmen for the protesters holding the Dakin House office were
out of the building and could not be reached for comment.
   College President Adele Simmons met Monday with representatives
of the blacks, Hispanics, Indians and other minorities who have
held the small brick building since Feb. 23.
   Their 16 demands included the creation of the post of dean of
multicultural affairs and for a full-time coordinator for the
minority student group.
   Simmons last week offered the students $25,000 to spend as they
please on their programs, but the negotiators rejected the offer.
   ``That's really an absurd amount for what is needed,'' protest
spokeswoman Anita Fearman said Monday.
   College spokeswoman Lee Wicks said the students evidently did
not understand the college's budget.
   ``When you see our high tuition, you think there must be lots of
extra money on campus,'' she said. ``We're ending this year on a
deficit and they're asking us to come up with bucks in March. Yes,
we want to be supportive, but in fact we don't have the money.''
   Tuition at the private liberal arts school was nearly $16,000
this year, she said. Minorities represent about 10 percent of the
school's 1,100 students.

<HEAD>`Glass Ceiling' Seen Blocking Women's Entry To Top Media Jobs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More women are working in entertainment and
the news media, but they bump into a ``glass ceiling'' that
prevents them from rising into top management jobs, experts told a
conference on Women, Men and Media.
   ``While more women are hired, that doesn't always translate
up,'' said University of Missouri journalism professor Jean Gaddy
Wilson, citing data gathered during a five-year study of women in
media.
   ``I do see that glass ceiling,'' Ms. Wilson told the conference
Monday at the University of Southern California. She described the
``glass ceiling'' as ``a transparent barrier'' that allows women to
see top echelon jobs but blocks access to them.
   Women account for 66 percent of the nation's journalism
graduates, but less than 2 percent of newspaper corporate
management, 5 percent of publishers and general managers, and 13
percent of directing editors, she said.
   ``The employment of women in news media lags behind employment
in the society overall,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``If current trends
continue, women won't attain directing editorships on par with
their level of the population until 2055.''
   Despite gains in front of the television camera, Ms. Wilson
reported similar patterns in broadcast management. She said no
networks had a woman heading their news division, and only nine of
51 network news vice presidents are women.
   Local television stations also have few women in management, Ms.
Wilson said. But she said radio stations employ women in proportion
to the workforce.
   Linda Alvarez, anchor on Los Angeles television station KNBC,
said some women in television are treated as ``shadow anchors'' to
a male co-anchor, are assigned to ``soft stories'' and are not
allowed to age.
   ``You don't see very many female Charles Kuralts on television,
or women who look like Irving R. Levine,'' said Ms. Alvarez, naming
two veteran male newscasters.
   The three-day conference, which started Sunday, was organized by
Betty Friedan, author of the best-selling ``The Feminine Mystique''
and a visiting journalism professor at USC.
   An analysis of credits on 1986-87 network entertainment series
found women employed more often as writers than as producers or
directors, said Sally Steenland of Wider Opportunities for Women.
Seventeen of the top 20 shows had women writers. half had women
producers and six had directors.
   Futurist Alvin Toffler said women have a chance to manage new
media as communication becomes diversified by cable television and
other outlets targeting ``micro markets'' within the mass audience.
   ``We're going to see two-tiered media,'' said Toffler. Mass
media will cover major events, but customized media will provide
information and entertainment to audiences defined by such
characteristics as race, sex, interest or geographic area, he said.
   The conference was co-sponsored by the Gannett Foundation, USC's
School of Journalism, the Institute for the Study of Women and Men,
Women in Film, and the Times Mirror Corp.

<HEAD>Three Italians Come Home After Release By Kurdish Captors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERGAMO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Italian engineers, including one
blinded in an eye during his abduction, came home today after they
were released by pro-Iranian Kurds following five months of
captivity.
   Former hostages Sergio Cominetti, Roberto Diotallevi and
Giuseppe Carrara boarded a commercial plane in Iraq on Monday and
flew to Amman, Jordan, where they were met by an Italian government
plane. They landed at the northern Italian airport of Orio al Serio
outside Bergamo.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that men were in good
condition on their arrival in Italy and quoted all three as
agreeing that they had been treated well in captivity and had never
feared for their lives.
   ``You could call the treatment they gave us humane,'' Carrara
was quoted as saying. ``We were allowed to talk to our captors.
Between us a climate of mutual respect was established.''
   A group calling itself the Iraqi Kurdish National Union claimed
responsibility for the kidnappings in Iraq last October, demanding
a halt to Italian aid to the Iraqi government and removal of
Italy's ships from the Persian Gulf. The kidnappers also made a
request for 2,000 gas masks.
   In announcing the release of the hostages, the Italian Foreign
Ministry on Saturday said the three were freed because of its
``intense and discreet'' efforts, but did not elaborate.
   In a telephone interview from Baghdad with the Italian daily
Corriere della Sera on Monday, Diotallevi said Cominetti did not
join the other two hostages until after they were freed.
   Cominetti was taken hostage last September and the other two in
October while they were working in Iraq on electrical engineering
projects for two Italian companies.
   Carrara said the most dramatic moment was when they were taken
hostage. Returning to their headquarters from work, they noticed
they were being followed by a taxi. ``We thought of bandits and
tried to escape,'' he said.
   Guerrillas fired several times. A splinter from one of the
bullets hit Diotallevi, injuring his right eye. During the
interview, Diotallevi added that there were no doctors to treat the
injury and that the eye since has gone blind.
   Diotallevi said he and Carrara were held ``in different
refuges'' in the mountains during their captivity.

   Iraq said today it fired 14
surface-to-surface missiles of its own design and production into
the Iranian capital in a 24-hour blitz lasting late into this
afternoon.
   Iran vowed revenge and said one Iraqi strike killed 16 people
when it struck a Tehran hospital. At least one other fatality was
reported in the Iranian capital.
   It was the worst escalation of the so-called ``war of the
cities'' that has killed thousands of civilians since 1985. Iran
and Iraq have been at war since 1980.
   Iraq said it began firing the missiles into Tehran Monday
afternoon in retaliation for two pre-dawn missile strikes on
Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   Iran initially reported its capital of 6 million people was
under attack by Iraqi warplanes. It later said missiles had struck
the city.
   One person was killed and several wounded this morning by a
missile that destroyed or damaged several houses and shops in
Tehran, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   IRNA said at least 16 civilians were killed and dozens wounded,
``including newborn babies,'' when the hospital was hit Monday
night. An unspecified number of people were buried when part of the
hospital building collapsed, the agency said.
   The Iranians did not say whether the missiles were fired from
land or air.
   Iraq's air force outnumbers Iran's 8-to-1. Iraq had never before
used surface-to-surface missiles to attack Tehran, which is 290
miles from the Iraqi border.
   Iran protested to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
and vowed revenge if the attacks did not stop.
   ``Iran's Moslem combatants will not sit quiet until they take
revenge,'' IRNA quoted a military communique as saying.
   An Iranian military communique called on residents of Baghdad to
evacuate ``and seek shelter in the four previously identified holy
cities in Iraq to protect their lives'' from retaliation.
   Iran is determined to demonstrate ``who is stronger when it
comes to demonstration of power,'' warned the communique.
   An Iraqi communique, meanwhile, today reported the firing of two
more missiles it said scored ``effective hits in Tehran and turned
their targets into rubble.'' It did not disclose the nature of the
targets.
   Another Iraqi communique said Iranian artillery gunners this
morning resumed pounding the Iraqi port city of Basra. One man was
killed and women, children and other civilians were injured, said
the communique, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency.
   Iraq began firing the missiles into Tehran in retaliation for
two pre-dawn missile strikes Monday that killed or wounded ``many
civilians'' in Baghdad, reported Iraq's news agency.
   It said five Iraqi missiles crashed in the Iranian capital
before midnight Monday, two after midnight, two at dawn, two this
morning, and three this afternoon.
   Apparently interrupted by the afternoon missile strikes, Tehran
television went off the air for few minutes today, but resumed its
newscast later from another broadcast room. No explanation was
given.
   The Iranian and Iraqi agency and television reports were
monitored in Nicosia.
   One Iraqi communique said Iraqi missiles ``poured with an
enormous destruction power on Tehran, striking with accuracy'' and
destroying ``the nests of tyrants and aggression in Tehran.''
   The Iranian news agency said relief workers were rushing
casualties to hospitals. Tehran Radio urged Iranians to take refuge
in bomb shelters.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as saying the
missiles ``had been designed by Iraqi minds and put together by
Iraqi hands'' and said: ``The Iraqi rockets will reduce the Iranian
capital to rubble.''
   The agency said President Saddam Hussein named the new Iraqi
missile ``Al Hussein,'' after the Shiite Moslem saint. It said the
projectile has a range of 400 miles.

<HEAD>Macy's Makes Surprise Bid For Federated Department Stores</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 11 grafs to update with comment from Campeau, no

<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy & Co. made a surprise bid for
Federated Department Stores Inc., challenging a competing offer by
Campeau Corp. for the nation's largest department store operator.
   The bid Monday by New York-based Macy's is valued at about $6.6
billion, topping the $6.1 billion offer from Campeau, a
Toronto-based department store and real estate company, Federated
said in a statement.
   Campeau responded today that ``their deal is simply not
competitive'' and that it was prepared to structure an offer along
the lines of the Macy's proposal.
   Campeau has been trying to buy Federated for more than a month,
but Federated's board rejected three successively richer offers. On
Friday, Campeau sweetened its offer again and Federated agreed to
stop fighting and start merger talks.
   Federated disclosed Macy's offer late Monday night from its
headquarters here after Federated's board met in New York to
consider the latest, $68-a-share offer from Campeau for all of
Federated's 89.6 million common shares outstanding.
   Macy's declined today to comment publicly today on its offer.
   Under the prposal, privately held Macy's would make a cash
tender offer for approximately 80 percent of Federated's
outstanding shares at $73.80 per share, Federated said.
   Federated shares not purchased in the tender offer would be
exchanged in a merger transaction, for a number of newly issued
shares of Macy's common stock, equal to approximately 40 percent of
the unpurchased shares.
   No value could immediately be placed on the stock portion of the
buyout offer, but the total offer would be worth about $6.6 billion
if valued at $73.80 in cash or stock for all of Federated's shares.
   ``The transaction just depends too heavily on the speculative
trading value of the shares of a new highly leveraged combined
Macy's-Federated,'' Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau said in
statement.
   ``If the Federated board prefers a two-tiered offer rather than
our all- cash $68 offer, we are prepared to structure a transaction
along those lines,'' he said.
   The Federated board took no action on the Campeau bid but
directed its management and advisers to investigate Macy's
proposals, to negotiate a definitive agreement and submit both
negotiated agreements to the board as soon as possible, Federated
said.
   Federated officials did not know when the board would get the
proposals, said spokeswoman Carol Sanger.
   The board of directors of the merged company, which would be
called Macy's-Federated Inc., would include significant
representation from the existing Federated board, Federated said.
   The Macy's proposal would be subject to execution of a
definitive merger agreement, and to approval by the boards of
directors and stockholders of both companies. Some Macy's outside
directors already have participated in the deliberations, Ms.
Sanger said.
   Macy's was taken private in a $3.6 billion leveraged buyout by
management in 1986. Its stockholders and directors include A.
Alfred Taubman, a major shopping mall developer, and Laurence A.
Tisch, the chief executive of CBS Inc. and Loews Corp.
   The company is one of the nation's biggest and best-known
retailers. Its approximately 100 stores rang up $5.21 billion in
sales during the year ended Aug. 1.
   Cincinnati-based Federated took in $11 billion last year from
its more than 650 department stores, supermarkets and other outlets
nationwide, including the Bloomingdale's, Filene's, Burdine's,
Lazarus, Bullock's and Gold Circle chains.
   Federated stock closed up $2 at $66.50 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Monday.
   In addition to the Campeau proposal, Federated's board had been
considering whether to entirely shun purchase offers in favor of a
restructuring that would keep present management in control.
   Campeau has been pressing its takeover attempt since Jan. 25. In
December 1986, the company acquired giant Allied Stores Corp.,
whose operations include the Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Brooks Brothers
and Ann Taylor retail chains.
   Some industry analysts have said they expect Federated to
continue soliciting other buyers to fend off Campeau's overtures.

   Four Libyan jet fighters landed at an
Egyptian airfield today, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported.
   The brief report, quoting a ``reliable source,'' did not name
the airfield.
   It gave little additional information except that the planes
were Soviet-made MiG-23s and that they landed at 1:09 p.m. The
report said nothing about the crews.
   A Libyan military transport plane and two military helicopters
landed during a five-month period last year, and crew members
requested and were granted political asylum.

   Republican Bob Dole, playing catch-up in the
Southern presidential primaries, attacked George Bush in public and
in new television commercials today as a vice president without
record or accomplishment and a supporter of the arms-for-hostages
deal with Iran.
   Dole's campaign began airing tough ads striking at Bush in
Florida and North Carolina, as Dole escalated criticism of the vice
president at appearances at Duke University.
   ``That's precisely what he did _ he supported the sale of arms
to Iran,'' Dole said when asked about the new television attack.
   Dole, the Senate minority leader, accused Bush of offering
``nine different answers'' on the Iran-Contra affair. ``But it's a
fact he did support it,'' Dole said.
   ``Now we're talking about credibility,'' Dole said at a news
conference. ``When somebody gives you nine different answers on the
same question, I think it's an issue.''
   Trailing Bush in the polls in most of the states voting next
week, Dole began a test-run of strong television ads in Miami and
other selected Florida cities, Dole campaign manager Bill Brock
said.
   The ads, which the Dole campaign produced but did not run during
the New Hampshire campaign, depict Bush as walking through snow but
leaving no footprints, Brock said. He said the message was that
Bush ``has held all these big jobs'' yet left no mark.
   In North Carolina, Dole began airing a different ad that
injected the Iran-Contra affair into the campaign, saying that Bush
``supported arms for hostages.''
   It also says Bush ``waffles on taxes'' and opposes legislation
limiting textile imports, a bill that Dole supports and that is
popular in the textile-producing Carolinas. Bush said in South
Carolina last week that he opposes the textile bill as
protectionist.
   Dole spoke to students on the campus of Duke University, where
his wife Elizabeth attended college. While there he lashed at Bush
for saying repeatedly that he wants to be ``the education
president.''
   ``Well he's certainly been quiet the last seven years when the
administration's been whacking billions and billions of dollars out
of the education budget,'' Dole said. ``Haven't heard one word.''
   A day earlier in Fort Lauderdale, Dole told a downtown crowd to
question Bush on his record. ``Ask him what's he done in the last
seven years,'' Dole said. ``What's he done anywhere in America or
the world to make a difference?''
   Dole, the Kansas senator and Senate minority leader, cited his
own record in Congress and raised anew his claim that Bush had
distorted Dole's stand on tax increases in television commercials
that helped Bush win the New Hampshire primary.
   Dole said voters want to elect ``someone who is not out trying
to distort somebody else's record when they don't have a record of
their own.''
   ``Bob Dole is not going to raise your taxes,'' he said. ``We
don't know what George Bush is going to do.''
   ``Tough'' was a word Dole brandished as he flew around the South
drawing comparisons with Bush in advance of the big round of
primaries across the region and elsewhere on Super Tuesday, a week
away.
   ``I have a quality that some may be lacking. I am tough,'' Dole
said in Atlanta and echoed in Mississippi and Florida. And for
anyone missing his comparison with the vice president, Dole said:
``I'm tougher.''
   Reacting to the crisis in Panama, Dole called for a full trade
embargo against that country if its military strongman Manuel
Noriega stays in power, and he urged the use of force if necessary
to protect U.S. interests there, including the Panama Canal.
   Dole said the Reagan administration has sent mixed signals on
Noriega, who is accused of drug trafficking. And Dole suggested the
United States reconsider transferring the Panama Canal to that
country if Noriega appears able to retain power.
   ``You just ought to say no to drugs, no to Noriega, and no,
maybe, to giving them the canal,'' Dole said.
   He said some U.S. officials have made conciliatory statements
about Noriega and ignored old evidence of drug involvement in the
Panamanian military.
   ``It seems to me we have one signal indicating Noriega ought to
stay or Noriega isn't such a bad guy,'' Dole said. He singled out
Daniel Murphy, former chief of staff to Vice President George Bush,
who he said described Noriega as cooperative, and cited ``other
indications they didn't know about Noriega and drugs until a few
weeks ago.''
   ``Strange thing,'' Dole said. ``We knew about it when we were
debating the Panama Canal treaty 10 years ago. In fact many of us
talked about it on the Senate floor.''
   Dole frequently mentioned his vote against the treaty,
tranferring eventual ownership of the Panama Canal to Panama, that
was narrowly ratified 10 years ago. He said that if it appears
Panama's situation will go unchanged, ``we may want to go back and
take another look at that canal.''
   `` We may not want to turn it over to Panama, if they're going
to be in this state,'' Dole said.

   Republican presidential candidate
Pat Robertson said today a transcript of 1967 Senate subcommittee
testimony supports his belief there are nuclear missiles in Cuba.
   The former religious broadcaster quoted testimony from two
people:
   _Paul Bethel, a State Department official who said Cuban
refugees had told him about seeing missiles.
   _One of the refugees, identified only as Mr. Apud, who said
members of the Cuban military had told him about missiles aimed at
Washington before he left in 1966.
   In the 1967 Judiciary subcommittee transcript, Apud said he was
told by Cuban soldiers he had known for many years that the
missiles were nicknamed ``Washington Left,'' ``Washington Right''
and ``Washington Central.''
   The transcript also showed that Bethel said in response to
questioning by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., that numerous refugees
had told him they had seen missiles left in Cuba after the Cuban
Missile Crisis and new ones put in in 1964.
   Bethel testified he could not say for sure that intermediate or
intercontinental ballistic missiles were in Cuba, but that the
State Department also couldn't be certain they weren't there.
   ``This is documented evidence,'' Robertson said today at a
breakfast attended by about 600 supporters.
   He first brought the subject up in a debate in New Hampshire
last month, contending there are missiles in Cuba aimed at the
United States.
   The Reagan administration immediately denied it.
   At a news conference on Monday, Robertson produced a Cuban
refugee who he said had seen the weapons. The Cuban, who spoke
through an interpreter and identified himself only as E. Rodriguez,
said he had seen missile sites, but did not know whether the
weapons had nuclear warheads.

<HEAD>First Day of Expressway Reconstruction Not So Bad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first morning of reconstruction on the city's
major highway link to the south passed without major traffic jams,
police said today.
   ``So far, so good,'' state police Sgt. Dolores Enright said of
the traffic on the Dan Ryan Expressway, one of the nation's busiest
highways.
   Most commuters apparently heeded warnings about potential
traffic problems and took other routes or public transportation.
   The project will widen the Dan Ryan from four lanes each way to
five.
   During 6{ months of construction on southbound lanes this year,
all traffic will share four lanes. The northbound lanes will be out
of commission next year during the project's second phase.
   Some motorists had planned novel ways to cope with massive
traffic jams they had expected.
   Julie Coenen said bought tape-recorded ``talking books,'' such
as James Michener's ``Texas,'' to listen to while she sits in
traffic.
   ``I think it's going to be like a huge, huge parking lot,'' says
Ms. Coenen, who lives in northwest suburban Elk Grove Village and
uses the Dan Ryan Expressway to commute to her job as a health
educator at Michael Reese Medical Center on the city's South Side.
   ``I have visions of people taking folding chairs and tables and
playing cards.''
   ``I think it's going to be a real bad nightmare,'' says Norma
Hill, 35, a hospital secretary who commutes from her home in south
suburban Evergreen Park to her job in south Chicago.
   The Dan Ryan Expressway, an 11-mile stretch of concrete and
asphalt, is the main link between Chicago and points south. Traffic
from at least six other expressways feeds the Dan Ryan just south
of downtown Chicago.
   State officials say the $210 million rebuilding job will be the
largest highway project in Illinois history.
   ``The road is simply wearing out from old age and the pounding
it has taken from traffic, particularly trucks,'' says Dick
Adorjan, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Transportation.
   The state plans to close all four southbound lanes from March 13
to October 31, rerouting southbound traffic onto two of the four
northbound lanes. The process will be reversed in the spring of
1989.
   The work began today with the closing of several lanes on each
side of the freeway for a week to build traffic crossovers and
patch the northbound side.
   As the project began, a psychiatrist recommended deep breaths,
exercise or conversation as tension easers for stalled commuters.
   ``Drivers who are mentally prepared to face these difficulties
can reduce the stress,'' says Dr. Richard Glass, associate
psychiatry professor and director of adult outpatient services at
the University of Chicago Medical Center.
   He said drivers could also use their stall time to learn a
foreign language from taped lessons or dictate letters into a tape
recorder.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier to Deport Some Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, making it easier to deport
some aliens, today blocked further hearings for a California man
seeking to avoid return to his native Ghana.
   The court ruled 8-0 that immigration officials, having decided
an alien should be deported, generally are under no duty to
reconsider the case when the alien says he has new evidence to
support a bid for asylum.
   The decision is a defeat for Dr. Assibi L. Abudu, a native and
citizen of Ghana who graduated from the University of Southern
California medical school and married a U.S. citizen.
   Immigration officials moved to deport him in 1981 after he was
convicted in California of illegally attempting to obtain the
narcotic drug demerol by fraud. He was given a one-year suspended
prison sentence and was placed on probation for three years.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service found him deportable
and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that decision.
   Abudu sought to reopen his case in 1985 and seek asylum in the
United States from the military dictatorship of Flight Lieutenant
Jerry Rawlings, who regained power in Ghana in a Dec. 31, 1981,
military coup.
   Abudu said he had new evidence that his life might be in danger
if he was forced to return to Ghana based on a 1984 visit to him by
Abukari Alhassan, secretary of housing and construction in the
Rawlings regime.
   Abudu said he believed Alhassan was trying to lure him back to
Ghana so officials there could torture him to extract information
about opponents of the Rawlings regime.
   Abudu said his brother escaped capture by the regime and fled
into hiding and also said his lifelong friend, Lt. Col. Joshua
Hamidu, is regarded as the number one enemy of the Rawlings
government.
   The Board of Immigration Appeals refused to reopen Abudu's case,
noting that Abudu did not initially seek asylum when he contested
his deportation.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 ordered the
board to reconsider granting Abudu asylum.
   The Supreme Court today agreed with the Reagan administration
that the appeals court should have deferred to the decision of the
immigration board.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said aliens
seeking to reopen their deportation cases have the difficult task
of proving that immigration officials abused their discretion in
refusing to do so.
   ``There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a
close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the
adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their
respective cases,'' Stevens said.
   ``We have no hesitation in concluding that the Board of
Immigration Appeals did not abuse its discretion when it held that
Abudu had not reasonably explained his failure to apply for asylum
prior to the completion of the initial deportation proceeding,'' he
said.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who only recently joined the court,
did not take part in the decision.
   The case is INS vs. Abudu, 86-1128.

   A survey released today says that the threat
of malpractice suits caused 12 percent of obstetricians to close
their practices last year and that two-thirds leave the field
before age 55.
   The survey, conducted in October and November for the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, showed that the
national rate for physicians dropping obstetrics has remained at 12
percent for the last two years, but that the age of those quitting
is getting younger.
   ``If this trend continues, we are going to see more and more
physicians leaving obstetrics at the height of their professional
ability,'' said Dr. Jimmie Gleason, chairman of the doctors'
committee on professional liability. ``We are looking at a
situation where obstetrics is being concentrated more and more in
large urban and suburban areas.''
   In Florida, the number of doctors no longer delivering babies
has reached 25 percent, about twice the national average, and 75
percent of those quitting in Florida are doing so before the age
55, also far above the national average.
   Malpractice insurance premiums for obstetricians in Florida and
New York now average about $52,000 a year, the survey shows. The
national average has risen from $10,946 in 1982 to $37,015 in 1987,
according to the report.
   Gleason said the survey revealed ``several disturbing trends''
in the care of high-risk pregnancies.
   Twenty-seven of the surveyed doctors said they were limiting the
number of high-risk cases they will take, compared to 23 percent in
1985, and 18 percent in 1982.
   The survey showed that seven out of 10
obstetrician-gynecologists nationally have been sued at some point
in their career. In New York, 55 percent of the practicioners have
been sued two or more times.
   Fifty-two percent of the suits involved obstetric cases, with 31
percent of these cases for claims of neurologically-impaired
infants, and 15 percent for claims of stillbirths or infant deaths,
the survey showed.
   Of the claims resolved, 36 percent were dropped without payment.
Of those not dropped, 79 percent were settled with payment.
   The survey showed that obstetrician-gynecologists had a mean
gross income in 1986 of $296,133, with the highest gross in New
York, with $387,022, and in Florida, with $323,252. The mean gross
income increased by $81,122 from 1984 to 1986, the survey showed.
   The average medical practice overhead reported was $147,029,
with the average for Florida at $190,882.
   Opinion Research Corp. of Princeton, N.J. conducted the survey
for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

<HEAD>Court Declines to Decide if Mississippi or Federal Government
Controls Gulf Area</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today declined to decide yet
whether the state or the federal government should control a Gulf
of Mexico area off Mississippi's southwestern coastline.
   Rejecting arguments by the state's lawyers, the court ruled 7-0
that more information is needed before such a determination is made.
   Mississippi had sought a ruling that its southwestern coastline
extends beyond several barrier islands and into Chandeleur Sound,
south of the Mississippi Sound.
   Control of an area of about 150 square miles of the gulf, along
with control of the natural resources there, remains in dispute.
   The case acted on today has, in varying forms, been before the
high court since 1956, when the justices first invoked their
``original jurisdiction'' to hear the controversy before it had
been aired in any lower court.
   In such cases, the Supreme Court functions as a trial court and
acts on the recommendations of a court-appointed ``special
master.'' In this case, retired Judge Walter P. Armstrong Jr. is
serving as the special master.
   He recommended that Mississippi's pressing for a ruling that
gives it control of the disputed gulf area should be ruled
premature.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Harry A. Blackmun agreed.
   He said Mississippi's arguments ``are overruled but without
prejudice to the advancement of such claims as any party might have
with respect to the area south of Mississippi Sound in the vicinity
of Chandeleur Sound in an appropriate separate chapter of these
proceedings.''
   The Mississippi Sound is a body of water between the state's
mainland and a line of barrier islands several miles offshore.
   In 1985, the justices ruled that Alabama and Mississippi _ and
not the federal government _ own their respective portions of the
sound's bed and therefore control the natural resources there.
   Blackmun said the high court would retain jurisdiction in the
case, raising the likelihood that still another ruling on the issue
is in the court's future.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and Anthony M. Kennedy did not
participate in the decision.
   The case is Alabama and Mississippi Boundardy Case, 9 Original.

   A ``puff'' of tritium escaped from the
Department of Energy's Savannah River Plant today, but posed no
hazard to the public, officials said.
   Spokesman Jim Felder said about 20,000 curies of tritium, a
radioactive isotope of hydrogen, were released at 6:18 a.m. this
morning during routine operations.
   Felder characterized the release as ``a puff'' and said it
lasted less than a minute.
   The weapons production facility at the plant makes material used
in the production of nuclear weapons, and Felder said details on
the process under way when the release occurred are classified.
   The exposure at the plant boundary, about six miles from the H
Chemical Separations Area where the release occurred, was about
0.04 millirems, Felder said. By comparison, he said a normal chest
X-ray is 20 millirems.
   Two employees in the work area at the time of the release were
undergoing tests to see if they suffered any ill effects. They were
wearing full protective gear at the time, he said.
   All plant operations have returned to normal, he said.
   Felder said an initial assessment of the cause of the release
indicates equipmment malfunction. However, an investigation will be
conducted.
   The last such release at the plant occurred July 31, 1987, when
a dosage of .2 millirems was measured at the plant's boundary.
   The plant's reactors were reduced to half power last year amid
concerns over the cooling system, and Department of Energy
officials told a U.S. Senate subcommittee in Washington on Monday
that the reactors could be running at full capacity by 1990.
   Felder said this morning the process in which the tritium was
released is separate from that involving the reactors and would not
affect the reactor plans.

   How does a presidential candidate campaign for
20 far-flung contests held on the same day? The answer is
television.
   The primaries and caucuses of March 8, Super Tuesday, are being
held in states and territories from Florida to Washington, an
unprecedented sweep across more than 150 media markets with more
than 500 television stations.
   Television is as critical on the vast Super Tuesday battleground
as grass-roots organizing was in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole fired an opening salvo, starting a test-run
of tough television ads in Florida and North Carolina.
   The Florida ad, which the Dole campaign produced but did not run
during the New Hampshire campaign, depicts Vice President George
Bush walking through snow but leaving no footprints. The message,
said Dole campaign manager Bill Brock, was that Bush ``has held all
these big jobs'' yet left no mark.
   The other Dole ad, running in North Carolina, injects the
Iran-Contra affair into the campaign. It says Bush ``supported arms
for hostages,'' ``waffles on taxes'' and opposes legislation
limiting textile imports, a bill Dole supports and that is popular
in the textile-producing Carolinas. Bush said in South Carolina
last week that he opposes the textile bill as protectionist.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt also was taking the offensive with two
critical ads. One featured Rep. Marvin Leath of Texas criticizing
Gephardt rivals Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr. The other was a
retooled version of an ad that was considered a key factor in
Gephardt's victory over Dukakis last week in South Dakota.
   At the outset of his campaign, Dukakis mentioned Belgian endive,
a kind of yuppie lettuce, as an example of how Iowa farmers could
diversify their crops. The Gephardt ad criticizes the Massachusetts
governor's positions on trade and farm issues, and ends with a
voice saying sarcastically: ``Belgian endive?''
   Many observers said Dukakis made a major error in not responding
with an ad of his own _ a situation that won't be repeated. Dukakis
aide Leslie Dach said the Dukakis campaign had prepared a negative
ad about Gephardt and would use it soon, possibly starting today,
in Super Tuesday states.
   Gephardt has also revived an ad that was seen as having a big
impact in Iowa _ in which he criticizes South Korea for stifling
U.S. auto sales in that nation with stiff tariffs, and threatens to
respond in kind. See how many Hyundais the Koreans can sell here at
$48,000 apiece, he tells viewers.
   And Gephardt has a commercial featuring the popular Rep. Claude
Pepper, a Democrat who has ample clout with senior citizens. Pepper
is from Florida, the second-biggest Super Tuesday state.
   Dukakis has ads featuring fellow Massachusetts politician Tip
O'Neill, the former House speaker, and has been running a
biographical spot in which he stresses his economic accomplishments
as governor.
   Dukakis has mounted particularly strong efforts in four states
with pockets of ethnic or liberal voters: Florida, Texas, North
Carolina and Georgia.
   Gephardt and Dole have focused on the border states that lie
near their respective homes of Missouri and Kansas.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who bypassed early contests to
stress the Super Tuesday states, took out a loan Monday to pay for
a media blitz, a campaign spokesman said.
   ``We're going to saturate Super Tuesday. ... We want to pour it
on,'' said press spokesman Mike Kopp.
   Gore's state campaign treasurer in Tennessee, Johnny Hayes, said
Gore had taken a $1 million line of credit against which money
would be borrowed for a 20-state advertising campaign. Kopp said
new Gore commercials would go on the air today.
   Gore has already made national cable television buys and
purchases of time on individual stations in most of the Super
Tuesday states.
   Bush was first on the air in Texas, where he once lived. He has
been running a biographical ad. Republican rival Rep. Jack Kemp has
concentrated his advertising money in seven Super Tuesday states,
said his political director, Charles Black.
   Rarely are the candidates engaging in the small-scale,
``retail'' campaigning of the early contests _ visiting diners,
plant gates and firehouses, taking door-to-door strolls down
residential streets. When they do, it's mostly for the benefit of
television cameras.
   ``It's too vast a primary to even bother, other than for media
events,'' said Larry Sabato, a political media expert at the
University of Virginia. ``It's a wholesale day. The candidates have
to rely heavily on their strategic consultants and media
consultants.''
   A well-heeled candidate could spend upwards of $2 million
blanketing the territory with TV commercials, radio spots and
satellite feeds. The trick is to spend shrewdly as well as heavily.
   ``It's a matter of consultants sitting down with polling data
and Census data and deciding where you have your best bet,'' said
Bob Lichter, a media analyst and co-director of the Center for
Media and Public Affairs. ``It's applied science meets gut
political instinct.''
   The typical Super Tuesday technique calls for finding targets
within states, such as individual congressional districts, and
keeping mum about where they are.

   Strong waves off Puerto Rico's west
coast hampered a search today for possible survivors of a small
craft carrying illegal aliens from the Dominican Republic to this
U.S. Commonwealth, police said.
   Police Maj. Cesar Gracia said two bodies were found Monday and a
third has been spotted floating at sea. One survivor was
hospitalized Monday.
   Authorities and a survivor said the majority of the 45 people
aboard the craft made it to shore safely.
   The boat, estimated at 20 to 30 feet long, sank Sunday night
near the small fishing village of Aguada, about 85 miles west of
the capital San Juan, the landing site for many boats bringing
illegal aliens to the United States in recent years. The exact
number of illegals making the trip during that period is unknown.
   According to Gracia, the Dominican residents boarded the craft
on the east coast of Dominican Republic on Saturday night, when the
weather was clear. As they neared Puero Rico, the boat was
overturned by large waves about 180 feet from shore.

<HEAD>New Law Would Outlaw Foreign Funding Of Apartheid Opponents</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with possible impact on
specific churches and groups; picks up 7th graf pvs: Another

   The government intensified its
crackdown on apartheid opponents today by introducing a bill that
would outlaw foreign funding of political activity.
   The legislation, expected to be adopted during Parliament's
current session, could cripple the operations of anti-apartheid
organizations and churches spared during last week's crackdown on
major black opposition groups.
   Eighteen groups, including the largest anti-apartheid coalition
and largest labor federation, were barred from political activity.
   The new legislation, called ``The Promotion of Orderly Politics
Bill,'' would prohibit all organizations from receiving money from
abroad for political purposes. Many anti-apartheid, human rights
and religious groups receive the bulk of their funds from overseas.
   The bill would empower the justice minister to declare certain
organizations ``restricted'' and to take control of foreign funds
sent to them.
   Money which is deemed to be earmarked for undesirable political
activities will ``either be returned to the foreign source or dealt
with as determined by the minister,'' the bill says. No court
challenge of the restrictions would be allowed.
   The funding restrictions could be applied to politically related
activities of anti-apartheid church organizations, which have vowed
to step up protests because of bans on other groups.
   The South African Council of Churches, which includes most major
Protestant denominations and is deeply engaged in civil rights
work, has received more than 90 percent of its funds from abroad in
recent years.
   The Roman Catholic Church, which cooperates with the council of
churches but receives funds separately, also relies heavily on
overseas financing.
   The Rev. Smangiliso Mkhatshwa, secretary-general of the Southern
African Catholic Bishops Conference, said the bill might prove
difficult to enforce.
   ``If the church says supporting the families of detainees and
paying legal fees is the work of love, the work of evangelism, it
is dificult to see how the government can define for the church
what it pastoral and what is political,'' he said.
   Another section of the bill sets a penalty of two years in jail
or a $2,000 fine for anyone who ``says or does anything'' to foment
hostility or violence between of different racial, cultural or
religious groups. The penalties would apply to anyone who displays
any banner, emblem or slogan deemed to convey such hostility, and
also to anyone who attends a gathering where such items are
displayed.
   Helen Suzman, veteran Parliament member of the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party, said she planned to demand a special
debate today on the arrests of prominent clergymen who were
protesting the government crackdown.
   About 25 church leaders, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, and more than 100 other protesters were detained briefly
Monday after riot policeman blocked them from marching to
Parliament with a petition protesting the bans on opposition groups.
   One of the arrested churchmen, Roman Catholic Archbishop Stephen
Naidoo, said in an interview today that he and his colleagues
considered it their duty to continue challenging the government.
   ``The church has got to take a stand on the morality of the use
of political power,'' he said. ``If it being used by a minority for
the protection of the minority and the oppression of the majority,
then the church has got to point this out.''
   In another development, government officials warned the
country's largest conglomerate, the Anglo American Corp., that they
would not tolerate its announced plan to defy the Group Areas Act _
the law that establishes racially segregated living areas.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
nation's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts,
schools and health services.
   An executive in Anglo's property division, Graham Lindrop,
recently described the act as a sham and said his company was
prepared to negotiate leases directly with black tenants renting
apartments in the ``white'' Johannesburg neighborhood of Hillbrow.
   Currently, most of the thousands of blacks living illegally in
Hillbrow are forced to have their leases signed by a third party
and are vulnerable to exploitation and threats from their landlords.
   The government has indicated it might allow Hillbrow and a few
other areas to become integrated, but it says violations of the
Group Areas Act will not be tolerated in the meantime.
   ``The act still stands until changes are approved by Parliament,
Piet Badenhorst, a deputy Cabinet minister, said Monday. ``There
will be prosecutions.''
   Anglo American's stance was praised by foes of the Group Areas
Act and denounced as civil disobedience by the extreme-right
Conservative Party.

   A former Philadelphia Common Pleas judge who
presided over what prosecutors called a ``cesspool of corruption''
was sentenced today to 12 years in a federal prison and fined
$10,000.
   The former judge, Kenneth Harris, was permanently removed from
the bench last week by order of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
   Harris had been found guilty on Jan. 26 of racketeering,
extortion and conspiracy for soliciting $5,800 in payoffs from
defendants, their relatives or lawyers in 14 criminal cases. He
faced a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and a $1.5 million
fine.
   Harris' lawyers pleaded for leniency because he has diabetes and
other ailments.
   ``I was hoping the sentence would be shorter. But because of the
parole guidelines as I understand them, he would be eligible within
24 or 36 months. So, I'm not that unhappy,'' said defense attorney
Samuel Stretton.
   U.S. Attorney Edward Dennis had indicated Harris would have to
serve at least a third of his sentence before he could be freed.
   A federal jury convicted the 67-year-old Harris on Jan. 26 of
running a case-fixing operation out of his City Hall courtroom.
   Still to be sentenced are two co-defendants, former federal and
local prosecutor Romaine G. Phillips, and Harris associate Matthias
``Big Sonny'' Brown, were convicted of conspiring in the
case-fixing scheme. The maximum sentence for that crime is 20 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   A key part of the government's case against Harris was secretly
recorded video and audio tapes that recorded case-fixing in Harris'
robing room in City Hall.

   Only one major issue still separates
Northwest Airlines and its flight attendants, who continued working
as usual today even though their strike deadline passed last week,
company and union officials say.
   Another union official said there was a possibility that
Northwest could be faced with simultaneous strikes by the flight
attendants and ground workers.
   A federal mediator is scheduled to hold talks between the
company and District Lodge 143 of the International Association of
Machinists a week from today, said Guy Cook, president of that
union.
   If those talks break down and the mechanics declare a strike
deadline, the flight attendants, represented by the Teamsters,
could invoke their own walkout, Cook said.
   But Cook said he does not know how long the flight attendants
can maintain their right to strike or how long it will take for the
mechanics to set a strike deadline in accordance with labor laws.
   ``I think that's the game that is going on right now,'' said
Chuck Davis, a labor expert at the University of Minnesota. ``If
the machinists are going to begin negotiations, it may be to (the
flight attendants') advantage to work without a new contract until
the machinists take a position.
   ``The more coordination that goes on, the larger the numbers,
the more strength they have in dealing with Northwest.''
   There are about 6,700 union flight attendants and about 20,000
mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground workers at Northwest.
   Talks between Northwest and Teamsters officials broke off at
dawn Saturday after an all-night negotiating session. A strike
deadline of 11:01 p.m. Friday passed without a strike and no job
actions have been taken against the company, said company spokesman
William Wren.
   Wren and Teamsters spokesman Jeff Musto said Monday that there
is only one major sticking point in the talks: A company proposal
to delay the promotion of workers on a lower B-scale pay schedule
to the higher-paid A-scale bracket.
   All new employees hired since a 1982 contract have started as
B-scale employees at pay rates lower than the previous system,
Musto said.
   The 1982 contract called for B-scale employees to jump to
A-scale levels in their sixth year of employment, but the company
has proposed extending that wait until the ninth year, Musto said.
   Wren said a large number of senior flight attendants make more
than $40,000 a year, plus meal payments when they're working. Most
entry-level flight attendants are making about $15,000 a year, he
said.
   About a third of the company's flight attendants are at the
B-scale level, Musto said.

   The posh Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel is
not liable for the garrote death of a Nevada mortgage banker who
was killed there five years ago, a jury has found.
   John Masegian's body was found by a hotel worker in a stairwell
with a 32-inch nylon cord with wooden knobs wrapped around his neck.
   His widow sued, contending the death could have been prevented
if hotel security was better. Defense lawyers told jurors the death
was a contract killing that took place in Masegian's room and that
the body was dragged to the stairwell.
   ``This crime was not foreseeable, nor was it preventable,''
hotel lawyer Leland Stansell Jr. argued.
   Jurors deliberated about 2{ hours Monday before deciding the
hotel shouldn't be liable for someone murdered in his room, jury
foreman Nora Langford said.
   ``The incident would have had to happen outside the room,'' she
said.
   Widow Carol Masegian, 43, had sought more than $1 million for
herself and for five of the victim's five children from a previous
marriage.
   Police initially treated Mrs. Masegian as a suspect after
uncovering a mysterious telephone message she received at the hotel
the day before the killing. However, she was never charged.
   During the trial, defense attorneys portrayed her as a woman
with much to gain from the death of her wealthy husband, who
planned to divorce her and leave her with nothing.
   Because of her husband's death, Mrs. Masegian receives $857 a
month from her husband's worker's compensation benefits and
$140,000 from his estate.

   A week before Southern voters assert
themselves in the 1988 presidential campaign, Rep. Richard Gephardt
paid a call today on former President Carter and said, ``I come
here today not to enhance my prospects but to greet an old friend.''
   Carter made it clear that with fellow Georgian Sam Nunn not in
the race he had no plans to endorse any of the Democratic
presidential candidates before the nominating convention next July.
   On one of Gephardt's major issues, the former president also
said that he could accept the congressman's trade legislation ``if
the president has the authority to moderate any sort of
protectionist trends.''
   Asked about Carter's less than ringing endorsement of a proposal
that has been a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, the
Gephardt said that he and Carter ``shared the view we've got to
create a better more open world trade.''
   Standing on the front walk in front of his brick home in this
small town that he put on the map, Carter said he thought there was
a 50-50 chance that no one will have clinched the presidential
nomination before the convention.
   ``My hope is that out of the primary and caucus season will come
a clear winner,'' he said. ``I'm not sure that's a likelihood now.''
   The former president said he would attend the convention as a
delegate and that if there was a deadlock ``I would not personally
favor turning to someone outside the active candidate group for the
nomination.''
   Carter said he has met with all of the active candidates.
   From Georgia, Gephardt was flying to Columbia, S.C., to pick up
the endorsement of former Govs. Richard Riley and Robert McNair.
   As the campaign entered the final week before Super Tuesday on
March 8, the day 20 states, most of them in the South, hold
primaries and caucuses, Gephardt started running a new television
commercial throughout the region.
   The ad takes on Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   In it, Rep. Marvin Leath of Texas says Gephardt ``stood with us
for lower taxes, for an oil import fee to make America strong, for
a tough trade bill to stand up for American workers.''
   ``On all these issues, Gore and Dukakis were opposed to us. Gore
and Dukakis even think the Gephardt trade bill is too tough on the
Japanese, Europeans and Koreans. We're tired of hearing that you
can't fight for America anymore. That's why 35 Southern congressman
are fighting for Dick Gephardt for president.''
   Gephardt won favorable comment from several fellow Democrats
attending a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council the past
two days in Williamsburg, Va.
   ``Gephardt is the only candidate who is running a message
campaign,'' said Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. ``So he has the
benefit of operating almost in a vacuum.''
   Graham said he thought Super Tuesday would play a major role in
determining whether Gephardt or Gore survives in the presidential
race.
   Bill Carrick, Gephardt's campaign manager, said,``I don't think
it's going to be that definitive.''
   Carrick said the Gephardt campaign would spend $1 million on
television advertising during the week before Super Tuesday, most
of it in Florida and Texas, the two biggest states voting on March
8.
   Carrick described Riley, who was governor of South Carolina from
1977 to 1985, as a leader of the progressive wing of the Democratic
Party in the state.
   He said McNair, who was governor from 1965 to 1971, was a leader
of the ore conservative wing of the party.
   He said their dual backing was ``a nice little bookend
endorsement.''

   A federal judge today cleared the way for
enforcement of a federal regulation intended to save endangered sea
turtles by throwing out a suit filed by shrimpers who say the rule
will ruin their business.
   Shrimpers said they would defy the regulation, which goes into
effect today.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Carr brushed aside vehement
arguments from shrimpers battling the requirement that they use
bulky traps called turtle excluder devices, commonly called TEDs,
which are intended to eject trapped turtles from nets.
   ``I don't care if he upheld it. It's a bad law, and the
shrimpers ain't going to live by it,'' said Tee John Mialjevich of
Concerned Shrimpers of Louisiana, which filed suit against the law.
   Critics say the devices don't always work and that they allow
shrimp to escape. Mialjevich said shrimpers in Florida, where the
law has been in effect since Jan. 1, experienced reductions of 35
percent to 50 percent of their catches.
   The law was also scheduled to go into effect off the coast of
Texas today.
   Shrimpers had argued that there was not enough evidence to show
that the TEDs would be effective in protecting the endangered
turtles.
   ``A review of the administrative record demonstrates that
(shrimpers') arguments are unfounded in most aspects,'' Carr wrote.
``From the outset, the Secretary (of Commerce) through the National
Marine Fisheries Service collected scientific information from sea
turtle experts from states, universities and the private sector.''
   Carr had said in advance that his ruling would not determine the
usefulness or effectiveness of the controversial devices, but would
address only whether the government had followed proper procedures
when it imposed the legislation.
   The outcry against the TEDs spread even to the state
Legislature, where a law was passed forbidding state officials from
enforcing the new regulations.
   The state attorney general's office had joined the shrimpers'
suit, but Carr dismissed the state from the case, saying the
shrimpers were capable of speaking for themselves.
   State officials were not sure how they would act.
   Corky Perret, assistant secretary of Wildlife and Fisheries,
said his department is caught in a ``Catch-22'' situation between
state and federal law.
   ``Until I get some legal, firm position to sit on, I guess I'm
up in the air,'' Perret said.

   Senators Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., and Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., called on President Reagan today to strictly
penalize Latin American countries that fail to cooperate with the
United States in its effort to combat drug trafficking.
   Chiles, Wilson and Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., told the
White House Conference for a Drug Free America the Reagan
administration must decide the national security interest of the
United States before being concerned about Latin America,
particularly Panama, Mexico and Columbia.
   Reagan was to officially announce that Panama has failed to
cooperate with the United States, but will not impose forceful
sanctions in an effort to force the ouster of Central American
country's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The president also was to reject calls to decertify Mexico and
Colombia, which have been criticized heavily for failing to cut the
flow of drugs to this country.
   Chiles said many members of Congress believe the certification
process has not been used properly by the Reagan administration.
   Under the 1986 law, the U.S. is to decertify and cut off aid to
countries ``not fully cooperating'' with the United States to
combat drug traffic..
   ``This year, the good news is that Panama is on the list,'' said
Chiles. ``On the other hand, Mexico and Colombia aren't. We'll have
to examine why Mexico is certified. Colombia is a country under
siege and we will have to examine that. We have to ask ourselves
what is the national interest. I think we have to continue to apply
pressure against these countries.''
   He said the law will be changed next year to require a bilateral
agreement between the United States and Latin American nations ``so
that there will be a country-by-country certification, rather than
one list including all of them. We will tell them in advance what
we expect of them and we will be able to grade them on how they do.
That will be more helpful to this country.''
   Wilson was particularly upset that the administration did not
decertify Mexico, a country that borders on his state of California.
   ``How can we delude ourselves into thinking that Mexico should
be certified,'' he said. ``They should not. They have not
cooperated fully with the United States. If we are going to send
young drug agents into Mexico, we should demand full cooperation
and not wink at it. The 1986 act spelled out what is to be
expected, and it has not been done.''
   Chiles and Wilson both said the president relies too heavily on
the State Department for the basis of his certification of a
country. ``State is willing to be too tolerant in this area,'' said
Wilson.
   Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics
Abuse and Control, said the U.S. felt for years that Colombia was
the primary cause of concern for the nation's drug problem but now
``it seems that we have an entire hemisphere to worry about. The
so-called spread of Communist influence is the least of our worries
in this region at this point in time.''

   Vermont's ``beauty contest'' primary
today has been largely overshadowed by preparations for next week's
delegate-heavy Super Tuesday primaries, political observers say.
   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis _ who won
the Maine caucuses over the weekend _ were considered the
front-runners here, continuing to play on their ties to the region.
Bush, a Connecticut native, has a summer home in Maine; Dukakis is
the governor of Massachusetts.
   Vermont Secretary of State James Douglas predicted a record
turnout of 125,000 voters. Several communities reported strong
voting today under sunny skies, but turnout in the state's largest
city, Burlington, was running behind four years ago.
   Some had predicted that the Vermont primary _ falling between
the New Hampshire primary and Super Tuesday, March 8 _ would take
on more importance this year. But the primary has attracted little
attention.
   ``I think what we're seeing is we're getting jumped by Super
Tuesday,'' said Craig Fuller, executive director of the Vermont
Democratic Party.
   ``Vermont just got lost in the shuffle,'' said Garrison Nelson,
a political science professor at the University of Vermont. ``Those
timing factors when combined with the fact the Vermont primary is a
beauty contest ... led to an incredible loss of interest.''
   Tuesday's voting does not choose delegates; Vermonters merely
state their preferences in the non-binding primary. Delegates to
the national conventions will be elected at state conventions, a
process that begins in April with local caucuses to elect delegates
to the state convention.
   The candidates sent a lot of surrogates to stump for them, but
made few personal appearances.
   ``We got to see very little of the candidates. We saw their
mothers, their wives, their children, but we didn't see much of
them,'' Nelson said.
   Spokesmen for the candidates say attention now is on winning
delegates in local caucuses.
   ``That's our focus, that's where our energy is going even now,''
said Chris Wood, a campaign coordinator for Jesse Jackson, who
scored a surprisingly strong second in the weekend Maine Democratic
caucuses.
   ``I think there's a recognition that the (Vermont) primary is
the beginning of building for the caucus,'' said Marilyn Yager of
the Dukakis campaign.
   But Yager maintains Vermont probably gets more attention from
candidates than some of the 20 individual Super Tuesday states.
   ``No single state gets a lot of one-on-one attention,'' she said.
   Although non-binding, the Vermont primary has served an
important purpose in past years.
   In 1980, former President Jimmy Carter used a win in Vermont to
embarrass Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., in his own back yard. The same
year, a strong second-place finish in Vermont gave Republican John
Anderson's campaign a major boost.
   In 1984, Gary Hart's overwhelming defeat of Walter Mondale in
Vermont helped him shed his image as a dark horse.

   Apparel manufacturing is Mississippi's leader in employment.
Besides that, furniture building is centered in the Tupelo area,
and catfish processing employs people in the Delta.
   Since the 1960s, manufacturing has employed more people than
farming in this state where 70 percent of the people live outside
urban areas _ and yet in some recent years the leading source of
income in Mississippi was neither. It was government ``transfer
payments'' _ Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Social
Security, food stamps.
   ``As the economy becomes more automated, more geared toward
people with skills,'' Pepper said, ``you're going to see more
people left out.''
   Asked the solution, he quoted Mississippi's new governor, Ray
Mabus: ``Education, education, education.''
   Without that, high-technology companies will continue to stay
away, agreed Jane Jackson, a lawyer working for the Mississippi
House of Representatives. ``You've got to get them (students)
enough math and English so that the Vo-Tech can teach them to work
for a Sony.''
   In rural areas nationally, 18 percent of people fall below the
poverty level, about $11,200 for a family of four, according to
1986 Census Bureau figures. That's the same rate as in inner-cities.
   ``I don't think the people who are masterminding this economy
are paying attention to this,'' said John Zippert of the Federation
of Southern Cooperatives, a group based in Alabama that helps
family farmers hold onto their land.
   ``It's a little like the underclass question of the urban ghetto
_ that there's going to be a permanent class that's going to be
left behind.''
   Left behind is a fitting description.
   ``In one year, rural areas across the country lost 632,000
people to metro areas due to migration,'' Leahy, D-Vt., has said.
``That's like saying that all of North Dakota migrated in one
year.'' Those who leave tend to be the best educated, say
officials, lamenting the rural ``brain drain.''
   It's not that nothing is being done to address the rural-urban
economic restructuring that Jesse White of the Southern Growth
Policies Board has termed ``just as profound as what was happening
in the Rustbelt.'' But many observers of the rural poor say the
efforts of government are piecemeal and inadequate.
   Federal funding for a variety of rural development programs
added up to about $1.6 billion last year, according to a study just
completed by the Center for Community Change, a research and
advocacy group in Washington, D.C. Those programs included grant
and loan programs of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development _ from which Tchula received its grant _ and the
Agriculture, Commerce and other departments.
   ``The funding levels have shrunk radically from what they were
at the end of the Carter administration,'' said Norm DeWeaver, who
led the study.
   The Reagan administration's policy has been to decentralize
efforts to aid rural development, noted the economic research
organization MDC Inc., of Chapel Hill, N.C., in a report last month.
   ``The federal government now dictates fewer rules and provides
fewer dollars. As a result,'' said MDC, ``... there is a surge of
economic and social initiatives in state governments throughout the
country.''
   Besides a new emphasis on improving education in virtually all
Southern states, initiatives cited by MDC included: a bank in
Arkansas that focuses mainly on rural economic development;
innovative literacy projects in Kentucky; and a biracial group in
struggling Noxubee County, Miss., that promotes home-grown
businesses.
   Nonetheless, the study cited ``many more dark rural places still
lacking the resources, the information, and the encouragement'' to
make significant economic progress, and it called for more
carefully targeted federal and private-sector help in giving
isolated places access to capital and management assistance,
education and training.
   Just outside of Tchula, the members of the Mileston Co-op know
what a little outside help can mean.
   Sitting in the spare country store that the co-op of black
farmers has owned for 40 years, Willie Lacy, the acting president,
talked about the donation they received from FarmAid, the charity
fund created by country musicians.
   Some of the members, whose cotton farms average about 50 acres,
used the money to pay delinquent taxes or overdue rent on land or
old fertilizer bills.
   ``I can remember one fella,'' Lacy said, ``he had everything,
but he couldn't get diesel _ so that helped him.''
   In the store, the afternoon gathering place now a month before
planting time, the co-op members say they could use a different
kind of outside help.
   They'd like to restart their cotton gin, which closed a few
years ago because of drought-stricken crops and lack of money _ and
they'd like to diversify, maybe open a plant that would process,
package and freeze vegetables grown in their fields.
   A plant like that would employ some of the workers displaced by
planting and picking machines. First, though, they'd need the
expertise to help ensure profitability, and second, the start-up
investment.
   The idea is not to get rich, the men said, but to employ people
and give the next generation a chance to stay here.
   ``I realize it wouldn't cure the problem,'' Lacy said, ``but
that would help some.''

<HEAD>Drop in Lettuce, Other Vegetables Leads to Index Decline</HEAD>

   Lower prices for lettuce, tomatoes, cotton and
milk helped pushed down the Agriculture Department's index of
farm-level commodity prices in February.
   The price index declined 0.8 percent from January but still
averaged 6.6 percent above a year earlier, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said Monday.
   Higher prices for cattle, hogs, corn and soybeans helped soften
the declines for the other commodities, however.
   ``Most commercial vegetable prices dropped sharply from a month
earlier as supplies became plentiful,'' the report said. ``Warm
weather in the Southwest pushed vegetable crops to maturity.''
   But cattle and calf prices ``were the highest since May 1979''
and hog prices rose for the second month in a row, the report said.
Corn prices at the farm were the highest since July 1986, while
soybeans were the highest in more than three years.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers set a
record in 1987 of about $57 billion. This year's net _ the
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the
range of $50 billion to $55 billion.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
   According to the preliminary February figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was down 4.3 percent
from January but averaged 11 percent more than a year ago.
   Commercial vegetable prices dropped 33 percent from January and
were down 2.2 percent from February 1987. Sweet-corn prices rose
from January, while all other vegetables declined. Lettuce prices
dropped to $11.90 per 100 pounds from $35.60 in January.
   Feed grains and hay, collectively, showed a 3.2 percent price
gain from January, averaging 23 percent more than a year earlier.
Corn, sorghum, oats and hay were up, while barley prices declined
from January levels. Cotton prices were down 6 percent from January
but averaged 22 percent more than a year earlier.
   The index for livestock and livestock products was up 2 percent
from January and 4.2 percent above Februrary 1987. Prices were
higher for beef cattle, calves and hogs, which more than offset
declines in milk, poultry and egg prices.
   Prices of beef cattle averaged $67.90 per hundredweight, up
$2.50 from January. Calf prices, at $93.10, were up $4.90 per
hundredweight. Market hog prices rose $3.60 from January to $47.50
in February but were still below a year earlier.
   February farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977
base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures,
down from a revised January reading of 131 percent. A year ago, the
February index was 122 percent.
   No new figures for farm production costs were included in the
report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of
budget cutbacks.
   In January, however, farm expenses were up 0.6 percent from last
fall but averaged 1.4 percent below a year earlier. The next
quarterly figures will be reported in April.
   The report said:
   _ Cattle averaged $67.90 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $65.40 in January and the $58.80 reported for
February 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as
beef.
   _ Hogs averaged $46.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $43 in
January and $48.20 a year earlier.
   _ Corn, at $1.83 a bushel, was up from $1.77 in January and the
average of $1.42 per bushel a year earlier.
   _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.83 per bushel, compared with $2.75 in January and $2.58
a year earlier.
   _ Rice averaged $7.85 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.70 in
January and $3.83 a year earlier.
   _ Soybeans were $5.90 per bushel, compared with $5.73 in January
and $4.69 a year earlier.
   _ Upland cotton was reported at 57.1 cents per pound, compared
with 60.6 in January and 46.4 cents in February 1987.
   _ Milk was $12.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.50 in
January and $12.90 a year earlier.

   The Agriculture Department is making some
progress but still lags in expanding jobs and services to black
Americans, according to a panel's report.
   In 1986, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng directed all
agencies in the department to carry out new guidelines to improve
USDA compliance with civil rights and equal opportunity standards.
   As part of the department's February observance of Black History
Month, five study groups looked at how USDA has performed since
then.
   ``Black employees continue a modest but upward movement in all
occupational categories,'' the report said Monday. ``Some increases
have been realized both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of
total USDA employment. This is especially important because the
increases have occurred at a time when overall employment in USDA
was declining.''
   The USDA employs the equivalent of approximately 102,000
full-time employees, according to recent budget documents. The task
force report said blacks comprise 8.4 percent of the department's
employees, up from 8.1 percent in 1986. But that ``is low compared
with other federal agencies,'' it added.
   ``To continue to improve its equal opportunity posture, USDA
must realize larger increases in the number of blacks hired,
promoted and trained,'' the report said. ``And such increases must
be realized at a faster pace. Additionally the department must
place emphasis on retention strategies once black employees are
recruited and hired.''
   The task force report said there are ``encouraging signs'' that
USDA agencies are beginning to address the complex problems of
black farmers and their declining numbers.
   ``Coordinated efforts between the Soil Conservation Service,
Farmers Home Administration and Extension Service are just
beginning to show limited success at eliminating the historical
factors militating against small and economically disadvantaged
farmers,'' the report said.

   The Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with the
U.S. Embassy over the ``subversive thrust'' of Voice of America
broadcasts on nationalist unrest in the Baltic republics, Tass
reported.
   The official news agency charged Monday that VOA reports beamed
into the Soviet Union ``have been crudely distorting historical
facts, making provocative insinuations about the growth of
nationalist sentiment in the Baltic republics of the Soviet Union
and expressing U.S. support for forces that do not accept the
social system in this country.''
   In Washington, VOA director Richard W. Carlson said today:
   ``The Soviet charges are false. We are covering stories about
nationality problems in the Baltics and elsewhere in the USSR
fairly and honestly. We have tens of millions of listeners in the
USSR and the Soviet authorities don't want them to hear the message
so they attack the messenger. The complaints are unfounded and
we'll just keep doing our job.''
   There have been a number of nationalist demonstrations in recent
months in the once-independent republics of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia on the Baltic Sea.
   Tass said the U.S. government-operated radio has taken a
``dramatically increased subversive thrust'' in reporting on the
situation in the Baltic region.
   The news agency said the protest was made to the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow.
   The Soviets last May stopped routine jamming of VOA
Russian-language broadcasts, but there have been occasional
complaints in the official media about information broadcast by the
service.

   GOP presidential contender Bob Dole struck at George Bush in new
TV ads today, including one declaring Bush supported arms deals
with Iran, as Pat Robertson sought Cuban-Americans' support with
new talk about missiles in Cuba.
   The biggest delegate day of the primary season is a week from
today, and the presidential candidates were swarming across the
South, where most of the 20 Super Tuesday states are located. Jesse
Jackson started his day in New York, but then he, too, headed
South, to Baltimore for more campaigning.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt paid a call today on former President
Carter, who made it clear that with fellow Georgian Sam Nunn not in
the race he had no plans to endorse anyone before the Democratic
convention next July.
   Carter also said he thought there was a 50-50 chance that no one
will have clinched the party's nomination before the convention.
   Dole, in Durham, N.C., trails Vice President Bush in Southern
polls, and he began the final week before Super Tuesday with public
and televised attacks.
   The Senate minority leader accused Bush of offering ``nine
different answers'' on the Iran-Contra affair. ``But it's a fact he
did support it,'' Dole said.
   In Fort Lauderdale, meanwhile, Robertson said today a transcript
of 1967 Senate subcommittee testimony supports his belief there are
nuclear missiles in Cuba.
   The former television evangelist quoted testimony from a State
Department official who said Cuban refugees had told him about
seeing missiles.
   ``This is documented evidence,'' Robertson said today at a
breakfast attended by about 600 supporters. The Reagan
administration has denied his contention about missiles in Cuba,
which he first made in a debate in New Hampshire last month.
   Vermont began its non-binding ``beauty contest'' primary today
under sunny skies with a record turnout predicted and Michael
Dukakis, the governor of neighboring Massachusetts, the Demcratic
favorite.
   On the GOP side, Bush, who won Maine's GOP caucuses, has a
strong organization in Vermont, but Dole has won endorsements from
some top Republicans.
   Bush was campaigning in another pre-Super Tuesday state _ South
Carolina, which holds its primary Saturday. As he did in New
Hampshire, the vice president brought in former Arizona Sen. Barry
Goldwater, a hero to conservatives, to stump for him.
   Polls have given Bush a comfortable lead in South Carolina, but
he said he was taking nothing for granted.
   ``Two days before New Hampshire, some of the most respected
pollsters showed me down and almost out,'' he said Monday in
Charleston. Bush won the Feb. 16 New Hampshire primary by a solid
margin, after polls suggested rival Bob Dole was breathing down his
neck.
   Dole, on a Southern swing that took him to Mississippi, Georgia
and Florida, heaped scorn on the vice president, characterizing him
as a passive figure.
   ``Ask him what's he done in the last seven years,'' Dole said at
a Fort Lauderdale rally. ``What's he done anywhere in America or
the world to make a difference?''
   Continuing that theme, Dole unleashed a television ad which
depicts the vice president walking through the snow without leaving
any footprints. Dole's campaign said the commercial was having a
test run in Miami and other selected cities.
   Robertson, in Miami on Monday, produced a Cuban refugee who he
said had seen missiles in Cuba. The Cuban, who spoke through an
interpreter and identified himself only as E. Rodriguez, said he
had seen missile sites, but did not know whether the weapons had
nuclear warheads.
   Robertson also told Cuban-American senior citizens he would work
with them for an independent and democratic Cuba. ``Viva Cuba
Libre!'' he said. At a mostly Hispanic high school, he called
Castro a ``butcher and a tyrant.''
   Meanwhile, Democratic rivals Dukakis and Gephardt, who have been
trading victories in the early caucuses and primaries, traded jabs
at a Democratic debate in Williamsburg, Va.
   Dukakis ridiculed the Missouri congressman for ``running around
the country beating up on the establishment'' while accepting
political contributions from special interest groups. Gary Hart was
also critical of the practice.
   Gephardt called it ``an affront'' to suggest that such
contributions would influence the way he votes in Congress.
   During the debate, Jackson said he has sometimes been singled
out for different treatment during the campaign because of his
race. He cited an exit poll in which voters were asked if they
would support a black candidate for president.
   ``I said, did you ask how many would vote for a Greek?'' said
Jackson, referring to Dukakis, who is of Greek descent. ``My race
is self-evident and my leadership is obvious.''
   Earlier in the day, Jackson visited racially troubled Robeson
County in North Carolina and drew a comparison with white-ruled
South Africa.
   ``In South Africa people have been abandoned by the law. No law
protects them,'' he said. ``What is happening right here ... is a
whole body of people has been abandoned by the law.''
   He made the same comparison in Houston, where he walked through
a trash-strewn neighborhood. Jackson suggested city officials want
to force poor residents out and redevelop the property, likening it
to the South African government relocating blacks.
   He told college students at Pembroke State University that his
strong second-place showing in the Maine caucuses proves he has
broadened his appeal. ``Talk about mainstream; try the state of
Maine!'' he said.
   At Monday night's Democratic debate, at Jackson's suggestion,
the candidates wore yellow ribbons on their jackets in protest of
the arrest of Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu in South Africa.

   The government Tuesday defended a
treasure hunt at a historic Spanish fort and extended the U.S.
contractor's digging permit for another month.
   On Monday, the Senate approved a resolution calling for a halt
to the search for Japanese treasure believed buried at Fort
Santiago, which was active during the Spanish occupation that ended
in 1898 and later was used by the Japanese as a garrison during
World War II.
   The Senate action followed a speech by opposition Sen. Juan
Ponce Enrile, who said the search was being conducted ``by
foreigners whose only reason for being here is perhaps their greed
for gold.'' Enrile charged it was an insult to national honor.
   International Precious Metals Inc., a U.S. concern, began
excavating this month at a chamber in Fort Santiago for gold
believed buried there by Japanese soldiers at the end of World War
II. The company has agreed to give the government 75 percent of
whatever is recovered.
   National Security Adviser Emmanuel Soriano, who is monitoring
the project for the government, told reporters Tuesday the
government approved the company's request to extend the dig for 30
days. The contract would have expired this week.
   ``Nothing is going on right there in Fort Santiago that would
desecrate the national shrine,'' Soriano said in response to
Enrile's speech. He said Enrile had known of digging at the same
site when he was defense minister under President Ferdinand Marcos
in 1975 but had not moved to block it.
   Soriano said the dig was an ``authorized and legitimate project
of which the beneficiary would be the Filipino people,'' and that
the contractors would restore the excavated portions of the fort.
   Soriano said Charles MacDougald, an official of the U.S.
company, had reported they expect to recover gold bullion believed
hidden in the fort within 10 to 15 days.
   The treasure hunt was widely publicized after two Filipino
workers were killed last week when a tunnel they were digging
collapsed.
   Soriano said his company would give the equivalent of $5,000 to
each to the families of the two workers. Work has since resumed,
with troops now guarding the site around the clock.
   Manila Mayor Gemiliano Lopez, who inspected the site Tuesday,
said the dig was about 17 feet deep.

   Authorities in southwestern Poland
detained 20 people for a march in which demonstrators wore hats,
black raincoats and dark glasses to mock secret security police, an
opposition activist said.
   The event in downtown Wroclaw was staged by the opposition group
Orange Alternative, which often uses satire to poke fun at Poland's
communist government.
   Spokesman Jozef Pinior said young men dressed in traditional spy
garb and sporting arm bands with the letters ``SB,'' the Polish
initials for Security Service, evoked laughter from onlookers.
   After about a half-hour, they were intercepted by real police
and 20 were taken into custody, he said. Authorities began
releasing them shortly afterward, he said.
   In the past, Orange Alternative demonstrators have donned Santa
Claus outfits and costumes of Lenten penitents to mock the
government's economic policies.

   Investigators say a marriage in trouble
may have prompted a man to kill his wife and their three children
before setting the family's home on fire and fatally shooting
himself.
   Firefighters discovered the bodies of Lawrence Delabarto, 32,
his wife and their children, all in bed, late Sunday night after
responding to the fire.
   ``I am told by family and friends that there were some marital
difficulties,'' Livingston County Sheriff Richard Kane said Monday.
``His (Delabarto's) wounds are consistent with suicide, plus we
found that all the doors were locked and the phone was off the hook
which would indicate that this was planned.''
   Delabarto's body was found in bed next to his wife, 32-year-old
Linda, and a .16-gauge shotgun, Kane said.
   A preliminary examination indicated that Mrs. Delabarto had been
strangled, and that Delabarto and the children _ 12-year-old
Anthony, 10-year-old Danielle, and 6-year-old Dominic _ had been
shot, Kane aid.
   Investigators said the fire was started with fuel oil that had
been poured in several rooms.
   Kane said the family had gone to church on Sunday and had
breakfast with Delabarto's parents, who live in Geneseo.
   ``The father had no indication of any problems,'' Kane said.
   There also didn't seem to be anything unusual at Riverside Wine
and Liquor Co. in Mount Morris where Delabarto had worked as a
truckdriver for 2{ years.
   Richard Radesi, the company's owner, said Delabarto was
dependable, well-liked, proud of his family and ``just as congenial
as he could be.''

   Ed ReBrook, a candidate for the state
House and the Democratic National Convention, has won a ``capital
case.''
   ReBrook has been trying to persuade Secretary of State Ken
Hechler to list his name as ReBrook, not Rebrook, on the May 10
primary election ballot.
   Hechler argued the candidate has always signed his name Rebrook
and the bid for the capital letter was just a play for publicity
and an effort to make his name stand out on a crowded ballot.
   Kanawha County Circuit Judge Patrick Casey on Monday sided with
ReBrook, ruling that state election rules don't cover name
spelling, so Hechler ``is without constitutional or statutory
authority to determine the proper spelling or capitalization of (a
candidate's) name.''
   Hechler had no immediate comment.

   Convicted ``Onion Field'' murderer Jimmie
Lee Smith was ordered jailed for 180 days after he pleaded guilty
to misdemeanor possession of a hypodermic needle.
   Municipal Court Commissioner Alan S. Kalkin sentenced Smith on
Monday.
   Smith, 57, was arrested in November for allegedly driving under
the influence of an opiate after he was stopped for a traffic
violation.
   Smith has been on parole since March 1987 after serving three
years for a 1984 conviction on possession of heroin for sale. If
probation authorities deem he violated parole, Smith could go
immediately to state prison to serve the term.
   Convicted with Gregory Ulas Powell for shooting an officer in an
onion field in 1963, Smith served 19 years and was released on
parole in 1982. Powell is serving a life term.
   The case was made famous by Joseph Wambaugh's 1973 novel ``The
Onion Field,'' which later was made into a movie.

<HEAD>Bennett Gets Friendly Capitol Hill Reception With New Spending
Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett visited
Capitol Hill on Tuesday to promote his education spending proposal
for 1989 and found a friendlier reception than in past years, when
he was seeking cuts.
   The Reagan administration is asking for $21.2 billion in
education spending authority _ about $850 million or 4 percent
above the current level.
   ``This is a bill that should go through the House in one hour,''
Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee on labor, health and education, told Bennett.
   ``I would imagine the seat that you're sitting in is quite a bit
cooler than it has been in the last few years,'' added Rep. Silvio
Conte, R-Mass.
   Bennett laughed and denied Conte's assertion that he had
undergone a conversion and become a ``born-again education
spender.''
   ``I'm the same old mad Catholic I always was,'' Bennett said.
   Bennett said the education request was as high as possible under
the outlines of the deficit reduction agreement reached last year
between Congress and the administration.
   That agreement limited overall domestic spending increases to 2
percent. The proposed 4 percent education hike is ``way above
average,'' Bennett said. ``This is pretty much to the limit of what
we could in good conscience ask for.''
   Natcher questioned Bennett closely on proposed cuts in certain
types of student loans, a public libraries program and grants meant
to offset tax losses in areas with federal installations.
   He hinted the House might not go along with those cuts but
promised Bennett, ``We're going to bring you out a good bill. We're
going to bring out a bill that both you and I will like.''
   The administration has proposed expansions in a number of
programs, including Pell grants to needy college students, aid to
disadvantaged children, magnet schools and a college loan program
under which repayments are pegged to future income.
   Congress has consistently appropriated more for education than
the Reagan administration has sought. The fiscal 1989 education
increase is only the second one requested by the Reagan
administration. The first came in 1984, another election year.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., pointed that out in a statement and
noted that ``our kids go to school every year, not just election
years. ... Local school boards need help that isn't turned on and
off with election cycles.''

   Sodium cyanide pellets were spilled on
a snowy section of Interstate 80 because of a truck wreck, and
nearly 100 miles of the highway was shut down as a small amount of
deadly cyanide gas formed.
   A nearby rail line crossing the unpopulated area was also closed
for a time.
   State Motor Vehicles Director Wayne Teglia said a
tractor-trailer rig overturned seven miles east of Battle Mountain,
injuring the driver and spilling about 100 pounds of pellets.
   Some gas formed when the pellets, used in mining operations,
reacted with the wet snow, Teglia said.
   ``If it had been raining it would have been worse,'' said Teglia.
   He said clean-up crews from the trucking company, Wells Cargo,
and a mining company were dispatched to clean up the spill.

   Two police officers have been reprimanded for
persuading a deputy U.S. marshal to shoot out a light fixture in a
crowded bar, the police chief said Tuesday.
   The bullet richocheted behind the bar after striking the light,
but no one was injured.
   Officers David Sanders and Robert Kind were told they ``acted in
a way that brought unfavorable criticism upon the department,''
Chief Doug Franks said Tuesday.
   Sanders and Kind were sitting at a table with deputy U.S.
Marshal Garry Carroll at a Feb. 18 party attended by as many as 20
off-duty lawmen when they challenged Carroll to shoot out the
light, Franks said.
   Carroll was charged with reckless endangerment and is to appear
at a preliminary hearing March 7.
   Sanders and Kind will be suspended for a minimum of three days
if they are involved in a similar incident within the next 18
months, Franks said. Letters of reprimand will remain in their
personnel files, he said.
   No action has been taken against any other officers.

<TEXT>
   It would be counterproductive to create a new,
independent agency to oversee safety at federal nuclear weapons
materials facilities, a top Department of Energy official to
Congress on Tuesday.
   But Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., urged the subcommittee to approve
legislation creating such a watchdog agency, calling the
department's plan to establish an advisory committee ``an
inadequate response.''
   DOE operates 40 major facilities in 34 states, including
reactors that produce plutonium and tritium and plants that refine
it for use in nuclear weapons.
   Joseph Salgado, a DOE undersecretary, told the House Armed
Services procurement and military nuclear systems subcommittee it
would be ``premature'' to create an outside agency.
   ``The advisory committee needs time to work, to prove its
credibility,'' Salgado said.
   The DOE official said a new agency would be ``regulatory,
counterproductive and adversarial'' and could ``severely hamper the
department's ability to perform its national security and energy
research missions.
   Dicks has introduced legislation that would create a Defense
Nuclear Facilities Safety Agency. It would have the authority to
shut down any reactor or plant that was found unsafe.
   A new agency would cost between $6 million and $10 million a
year to operate and funds could be taken from current DOE safety
oversight programs to pay for it, Dicks said.
   The administrator of the agency would be appointed by the
president and confirmed by the Senate.
   Dicks said that DOE was caught between the Department of
Defense's demands for nuclear materials and the need to operate the
facilities safely.
   ``Studies conducted in recent years have revealed disturbing
evidence that DOE's defense facilities are not only operating with
deteriorating and unpredictable equipment, but receive oversight
through a poorly managed and ineffcient safety assurance process,''
Dicks said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Backs Immigration Officials on Deportation Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday made it easier
for immigration officials to deport aliens who seek reconsideration
of their claims to remain in the United States.
   By a vote of 8-0, the justices barred further hearings for a
California physician, Dr. Assibi L. Abudu, who said he might be
tortured or killed if forced to return to his native Ghana.
   Abudu asked the Board of Immigration Appeals for asylum in this
country after it denied his initial bid to avoid deportation.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said
immigration officials, having decided an alien should be deported,
generally are under no duty to reconsider the case when the alien
says he has new evidence to support a bid for asylum.
   Stevens said aliens seeking to reopen their deportation cases
have the difficult task of proving that immigration officials
abused their discretion in refusing reconsideration.
   ``There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a
close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the
adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their
respective cases,'' Stevens said.
   He continued, ``We have no hesitation in concluding that the
Board of Immigration Appeals did not abuse its discretion when it
held that Abudu had not reasonably explained his failure to apply
for asylum prior to the completion of the initial deportation
proceeding.''
   Abudu is a native and citizen of Ghana who graduated from the
University of Southern California medical school and married a U.S.
citizen.
   Immigration officials moved to deport him in 1981 after he was
convicted in California of illegally attempting to obtain the drug
demerol by fraud. He was given a one-year suspended prison sentence
and was placed on probation for three years.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service found him deportable,
and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that decision.
   He faces deportation to England, according to court papers. But
Abudu said he might be barred by that country and forced to return
to Ghana.
   Abudu asked immigration officials to reopen his case in 1985 and
grant him asylum in the United States from the military
dictatorship of Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, who regained power in
Ghana in a Dec. 31, 1981, military coup.
   Abudu said he had new evidence that his life might be in danger
if he was forced to return to Ghana.
   The Board of Immigration Appeals refused to reopen Abudu's case,
noting that Abudu did not initially seek asylum when he contested
his deportation.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 ordered the
board to reconsider granting Abudu asylum.
   The Supreme Court agreed with the Reagan administration that the
appeals court should have deferred to the immigration board.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who only recently joined the court,
did not take part in the decision.
   In other developments, the court:
   _Declined to decide yet whether the state or the federal
government should control a Gulf of Mexico area off Mississippi's
southwestern coastline. Rejecting arguments by the state's lawyers,
the court ruled 7-0 that more information is needed before such a
determination is made.
   _Heard arguments over the constitutionality of Texas' death
penalty law. A ruling is expected by July.

   John Roger, the alligator who was flushed
into the Hobbs sewer system as a baby and lived a pampered life in
his own solar home at the city water treatment plant, was buried
Tuesday.
   The alligator was buried 16 years after sewer workers named John
and Roger found the 24-inch reptile swimming in an effluent pond.
   John Roger was 7 feet, 9 inches long at the time of his death
Monday. He lived in a fenced compound that included a solar-heated
home, diving pond and grass knoll for sunbathing.
   The alligator's body was found at the compound at the bottom of
his pool. He apparently had gone for a post-hibernation swim. No
necropsy was scheduled but officials suspected the alligator died
of pneumonia.
   State Sen. Joe Harvey, who was city manager at the time John
Roger was adopted, recalled the alligator was fond of frogs.
   ``There were months where there wasn't a live frog in this
town,'' Harvey said. ``Kids found out that John Roger liked frogs _
live frogs _ and they'd go out and find them, then throw them over
the fence of his compound.''

   A small passenger plane
exploded in flight Tuesday and crashed in an industrial area east
of Johannesburg, killing all 17 people on board, the South African
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   The radio said the plane was operated by Comair, a private
commercial airline that flies between Johannesburg and towns in
north and central South Africa.
   The twin-engine plane, a Brazilian-made Bandeirante turboprop,
was en route to Johannesburg from the northern border town of
Phalaborwa when it crashed, state-run South African Broadcasting
reported. It said all 15 passengers and two crew members aboard
were killed.
   There was no immediate indication what caused the crash.
Witnesses told reporters they heard an explosion and saw what
appeared to be two pieces of the plane plunge to the ground.
   The plane went down in an area called Wadeville, about six miles
east of downtown Johannesburg.
   The identities of the victims were not immediately known.
   The Bandeirante can accommodate up to 18 passengers.

   Ridership on New York subways increased for the
third straight year in 1987 to its highest level in 13 years, the
Transit Authority reported Tuesday.
   TA President David Gunn attributed much of the increase to new
and overhauled cars on some lines and a boost in the number of
clean cars.
   Officials also said subway crime was down 8.1 percent for
serious felonies from 1986. TA spokesman Albert O'Leary said there
were 12,888 felonies on the subways last year compared with 14,030
in the previous 12 months.
   Gunn said 3,626,000 people rode the subways on an average
weekday last year, up by 216,000 from 1984 and 103,000 from 1986.
In all, 1.059 billion passengers rode the subways last year, up 29
million from 1986 and 62 million from 1984.
   Gunn said that 94 percent of the subway fleet should be
graffiti-free by the end of this year.

   The judge presided in the banquet room
at the Quality Inn. Tourists by the pool did a double-take when a
prisoner went by in handcuffs, while lawyers consulted under beach
umbrellas.
   ``The court reporter said she wasn't sure she got a good
transcript because of the noise from the kitchen,'' said Circuit
Judge Gil Goshorn.
   Such incongruous scenes have been taking place in Titusville
this week as judges, prosecutors, clerical workers and other county
employees moved out of the Brevard County Courthouse, which was
closed because of asbestos contamination.
   County officials quarantined the courthouse Saturday when air
tests showed asbestos levels far above federal standards in several
rooms. Some levels were considered dangerously high, and most
employees were urged to get medical tests.
   Asbestos was widely used for insulation and fireproofing until
the federal government banned its use in 1979.
   The county clerk's office set up shop in modular buildings in
the courthouse parking lot. Workers wearing breathing masks hurried
to build a plywood and plastic ``cocoon'' to provide safe access to
the clerk's computers inside the courthouse.
   All documents were locked inside when the courthouse was
evacuated. Experts said all paperwork and even many computer
terminals were contaminated and would have to be carefully dusted
and cleaned as they are removed piece-by-piece from the building.
   The closing of the court house also affects real estate
transactions, court-ordered child support payments and other
operations.

   Gov. Evan Mecham should be removed from
office for obstructing an investigation of an alleged death threat,
senators were told today during opening arguments of the first-term
Republican's impeachment trial.
   But a defense attonrey for Mecham told senators in an
impassioned statement that Mecham was the victim of a ``mutiny'' by
the state attorney general and director of the state Department of
Public Safety.
   Prosecutor William French said the man accused of making the
alleged threat, former state official Lee Watkins, had claimed that
jobs in the Mecham administration ``relate to the amount of money
that you were able to bring into the campaign.''
   French said the evidence was ``overwhelming'' that Mecham
violated criminal laws and his oath of office and committed
malfeasance in office, ``any one of which call for impeachment.''
   However, defense attorney Fred Craft told senators in his
opening statement that Mecham broke no laws and was acting within
his authority.
   ``What has this man done?'' Craft said. ``There's something
wrong in this state when you can depose the constitutionally
elected officer of the state and throw the book at him ... based
upon evidence that's being presented by people who have a stake in
the outcome to have him ousted.''
   Craft said the accusations resulted from a ``mutiny'' by
Attorney General Bob Corbin and DPS Director Ralph Milstead. The
DPS includes the Highway Patrol and investigative personnel.
   Craft also said he would present testimony that would cast dubt
on Milstead's integrity.
   Mecham, who also faces a March 22 criminal trial and a May 17
recall election, did not appear at the Senate on the second day of
his impeachment trial.
   The impeachment counts against Mecham include an allegation that
he ordered Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney general's
probe of an alleged death threat by Watkins, then the state prison
construction chief.
   ``There was an obstruction with regard to an ongoing
investigation that was being conducted by the attorney general's
office,'' French said.
   Watkins has denied making a threat against Donna Carlson, a
former top Mecham aide who testified before the state grand jury on
Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   DPS Officer Frank Martinez, a former member of Mecham's security
detail who was called as the trial's first witness, testified this
morning that Mecham administration official Peggy Griffith told him
about a conversation she had with Watkins.
   Ms. Griffith said Watkins had told her that if Ms. Carlson ``did
not keep her mouth shut, she could wind up taking a long boat ride
... and I know the right people who can help me,'' Martinez
testified.
   Martinez said that he met with Milstead, other DPS officers,
Corbin and several assistant attorneys general several days later
and that Milstead told of a conversation he had with Mecham.
   Martinez said Milstead told the group that Mecham ``stated he
didn't want him helping the attorney general.''
   ``The overall mood was just amazement,'' Martinez testified.
   Craft said Milstead and other officials did not fully advise
Mecham about the alleged threat, adding that Milstead ``was a
feckless employee of this state and he did not serve that governor
well.''
   French said Watkins complained about the job he was given by
Mecham and told Corrections Director Sam Lewis, ``If they don't
treat me right I can bring Mecham's administration down.''
   French warned the Senate to ``keep your eye on the ball'' and
not be distracted by any attacks on witnesses in the case. ``Know
that this is being done because there is no defense,'' French said.
   The opening arguments today dealt only with the alleged threat.
Arguments will precede discussion of the other allegations against
Mecham as they are reached during the trial.
   On the trial's opening day Monday, the Senate strongly rejected
efforts to dismiss impeachment charges against Mecham.
   Also, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule today on a
defense claim that the impeachment trial, the first of a U.S.
governor in 59 years, should be delayed until after Mecham's March
22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The high court last week refused to grant a temporary delay, and
Mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court if
necessary.
   Senate President Carl Kunasek, a Republican, said ``it was the
first-day jitters for everyone'' in the impeachment trial's opening
day Monday.
   ``It crosses everybody's mind _ the importance to do justice to
the governor and the state,'' said Senate Majority Leader Bob
Usdane, also a Republican. ``It's a large burden and we take it
seriously.''
   Senators refused to dismiss the 23 articles of impeachment
against Mecham, whose attorney, Jerris Leonard, entered an innocent
plea on his behalf.
   On 11 separate motions, the largest number of the 29 senators
voting for dismissal was seven. Several senators said the vote
should not be considered an indication that Mecham is likely to be
convicted, saying they want to hear the evidence first.
   However, Sen. Jeff Hill, a Republican who has strongly backed
Mecham, said the governor's conviction was virtually a foregone
conclusion. ``I think that it's not likely that he's going to
prevail,'' he said.
   If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be removed from office
and could be permanently barred from holding elective office in
Arizona.
   Mecham, 63, won election in a three-way race after five tries.
   He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and insisted he will survive
both trials and a May 17 recall election and return to the office
he gave up to acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, when he was
impeached by the House on Feb. 5.

<HEAD>Bosch Release Order Stayed Pending Government Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered the U.S. Parole Commission
on Tuesday to free an anti-Castro activist who has been in a
Venezuelan prison for 11 years on bond, but he stayed his order to
allow the agency to appeal.
   Even if Orlando Bosch won his freedom, U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials were waiting in the wings to take
custody of him, they said Tuesday.
   Bosch, a hero in Miami's Cuban community, has been in jail since
he arrived last month from Venezuela, where he spent 11 years in
prison despite being acquitted three times of bombing a Cuban
airliner.
   U.S. authorities said Bosch had violated parole by fleeing this
country in 1974 while on probation for planning a bazooka attack on
a Polish ship in the port of Miami in 1968, and conspiring to plant
bombs on other ships.
   Bosch's daughter, Lourdes, said outside court that she was
pleased with U.S. District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp's order. But,
she added, ``I am just confused and upset that now this is going to
be appealed and they can stall another week or more. To me, it's
just a farce, a political farce.''
   Ryskamp called Bosch's imprisonment until a scheduled March 21
parole hearing ``totally arbitrary and capricious.''
   Ryskamp said Parole Commissioner G. Mackenzie Rast used ``tunnel
vision in picking out those facts he wants to rely upon'' when he
ordered Bosch to remain jailed.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Chuck Senatore said he would appeal
Ryskamp's decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, and the judge granted a temporary stay of his release
order.
   Even if the appeals court upholds Ryskamp, Bosch also cannot be
released until his lawyers convince the INS.
   ``We of course have a detainer on him and would be holding him
on an immigration violation,'' said INS district director Perry
Rivkind.
   The INS has targeted Bosch for exclusion hearings and possible
deportation because he entered the United States without legal
immigration documents last month after his release from a
Venezuelan prison.
   INS officials have said they will not permit Bosch's release and
have labeled him a terrorist because of his conviction for
conspiring to bomb the Polish ship. Parole officials also accused
him of consorting with known criminals.
   On the probation commission order, Ryskamp said Rast went beyond
the facts on record to conclude that Bosch should be held. The
judge said Rast apparently considered Bosch's acquittals in
Venezuela as a strike against him and wrongly considered
``reported'' past associations of Bosch with known criminals.
   ``If that's going to be the basis of denying somebody their
liberty rights, then it's a sad day for the Constitution,'' said
Ryskamp. The judge also noted that Rast evidently reviewed
information in Bosch's parole file which was never disclosed to
Bosch.
   The judge also noted that Rast ignored the recommendation of a
probation officer who interviewed Bosch and concluded there was no
risk that he would flee.
   Ryskamp set bond at $250,000 and said that if Bosch is freed he
cannot make public appearances or statements or identify himself
with any militant groups opposing the Cuban government of Fidel
Castro. He also could not receive more than five visitors in his
home at any one time and would be required to report in three times
a day by telephone.

   Pick a political persuasion and there
is no doubt a party for it in Bangladesh, a nation so
philosophically fragmented that even groups committed to political
unity are split into factions.
   The nation's major opposition parties _ all 21 of them _ are
boycotting Thursday's elections to Parliament, but there certainly
is no lack of election interest. As many as 102 political groups
are vying for the 330 seats.
   Many, obviously, are quite small.
   ``One has to use a microscope or a telescope to see if they are
really political parties,'' says Shamsul Huda Haryn, a political
science professor at Dhaka University.
   Sorting out the groups in the parliamentary fray is difficult
because one group on the ballot is known as ``the 23-party
alliance'' and another is listed as the ``combined opposition
party,'' which is made up of 73 separate factions.
   Whatever the number, the parliamentary contest illustrates just
how fractured the political system is in this nation of 105 million
people.
   A government booklet on the country's ``multi-party political
system '' notes that the ``polycentric political system in
Bangladesh has marked a phenomenal fragmentation of existing
organizations and growth of new ones.''
   The booklet gives the history of 130 separate political parties.
Some experts, however, believe there many be more than 200 separate
political groups.
   Included in the political patchwork are 11 different Islamic
parties, reflecting the predominant Moslem population, along with
six Communist parties, a Social Democratic Party, a Socialist
Party, and two Republican parties.
   There are even two separate United People's parties.
   Harun, who studied in both England and the United States, said
Bangladesh's political groups are not really parties as defined in
the West.
   ``Call them pressure groups, or lobbies, or even sections,'' he
said.
   Harun said that many have no cohesive philosophy and were formed
around a single issue, tending to split or fall apart once the
issue waned.
   That politics is a passion here is evident in the grim toll it
often takes. At least eight people have died in the past two weeks
of parliamentary campaigns. In local elections Feb. 10, more than
100 were killed, according to government figures.
   The election Thursday was prompted by a campaign by the 21
opposition parties to topple President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.
   After more than 20 general strikes called by the opposition
since Nov. 10, which included 25 deaths in police clashes with
mobs, Ershad dissolved Parliament in December and ordered a new
election. The opposition groups, however, have vowed to boycott it.
   Those groups are the self-proclaimed ``eight-party alliance''
led by Sheik Hasina of the Awami league, the ``seven-party
alliance'' headed by Khaleda Zia, a group known as the ``five-party
alliance,'' and the Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Moslem
fundamentalist party.
   Diplomats and political observers say the Awami League is the
best organized. It was founded by Hasina's father, Sheik Mujibur
Rahman, the country's first president who was assassinated in a
1975 coup.
   Ershad, 58, is a former general who took power in a coup and
became president in 1986 in an election his opponents say was
rigged. They say Thursday's balloting also will be rife with fraud.
   The Bengalis were noted for their passion for politics even in
the days when Britain was ruling the subcontinent. Bangladesh was
East Bengal during British reign, then East Pakistan after the
partition of the subcontinent in 1947. It gained independence as
Bangladesh in 1971.
   While theories abound on why politics here is so splintered,
some say the Bengali people are by nature a divisive people.
   As one oft-repeated saying goes: `Two Bengalis equal a political
party, three equal a party plus one faction.''

<HEAD>Some of Reagan's Simplest Lines are Scripted for Him by Aides</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, pretty fast with an ad-lib
or quip, has many of his daily lines finitely scripted, ranging
from the ``Welcome to the House'' greeting to the ``God Bless You''
sendoff.
   One of the president's recent meetings _ a brief session known
as a ``drop by'' in the Cabinet Room with several corporation
executives _ was scheduled to last 20 minutes. For that
get-together, Reagan was provided with the following ``Sequence of
Events:''
   _`11:30 a.m. _ You enter Cabinet Room, are introduced by Senator
Baker and deliver remarks. At the conclusion of your remarks you
open the meeting to discussion.
   _`11:47 a.m. _ Rebecca Range will signal the end of the official
portion of the meeting.
   _`You move to the end of the Cabinet Room (under President
Coolidge's picture) for handshake photos with the participants.
   _`11:50 a.m. _ You depart.''
   In the briefing paper provided for Reagan's 30-minute meeting
with leaders of Congress who had recently met with North Atlantic
Treaty Organization allies about the arms control treaty signed in
December, the president was reminded, among other things, to say:
``Bob (Byrd), I appreciate you and your colleagues coming down
today.''
   A 20-page package of these briefing papers, obtained by ABC
White House correspondent Sam Donaldson, was made available to The
Associated Press.
   The unintended disclosure of Reagan's talking points left White
House aides red-faced, with Communications Director Thomas C.
Griscom maintaining that Reagan often ignores these scripts anyhow.
   At least part of the reason for this embarrassment is that
Reagan long has been considered by political observers to be too
heavily scripted by his aides. The president, a former actor,
generally is relatively quick with responses to questions raised by
reporters during picture-taking sessions and during chance
encounters.
   Though he often is seen cupping his ear because of difficulty in
hearing the questions, Reagan is fairly adept at answering them
when he chooses to do so.
   The package of talking points included remarks prepared for
outside visitors to the White House, ranging from singer Wayne
Newton to an interview with Washington Post reporter Lou Cannon.
   Absent from the package were any comments prepared for the
president's daily top-level staff meeting or national security
briefing.
   Some White House staff members dismiss the disclosures with a
laugh, contending the paperwork is similar to that provided other
high administration officials or corporate officers and is nothing
more than the product of an overzealous staff.
   ``I think the insinuation that President Reagan needs to be told
to say `Goodbye' or `God Bless You' is a cheap shot,'' said
Reagan's domestic policy adviser, Gary Bauer.
   ``Anyone who's around the president frequently knows that the
best stuff he says at meetings are the things he comes up with on
his own. It's unfair and silly to insinuate that he can't function
without those papers,'' said Bauer.
   ``It's little worker bees who have little jobs to do,'' said
Elaine Crispen, press secretary to first lady Nancy Reagan.
   White House communications director Thomas Griscom said Reagan
ignored the scripted dialogue during the meeting. He said such
texts are given to Reagan only to ``refresh his memory,'' if
necessary.
   ``He knew what points he wanted to make, so he didn't use the
talking points at all,'' Griscom said.
   ``Is it so unnatural for a staff person to tell his boss about a
meeting he's arranged, that these people are coming, this is what
we're doing?'' Griscom asked. ``He hasn't got the time to sit there
making notes about what each little meeting's supposed to be about
_ he has more important things to do.''
   Mrs. Crispen argued that some White House staffers are so eager
to do their jobs correctly that they include items and remarks that
are actually taken for granted by the official involved, including
the first lady.
   ``Both she and the president know to say, `Hello, how do you
do,''' Mrs. Crispen said.
   Besides, she said, ``show me a (television) correspondent who
doesn't use a script.''

<HEAD>Koop Concerned About Spread Of AIDS Virus Among Teen-Agers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop told a White
House panel Tuesday he is concerned about the spread of the AIDS
virus among teen-agers and expressed outrage at suggestions the
disease cannot be spread through heterosexual intercourse.
   Reiterating his call for sex education programs beginning at the
elementary grade levels, Koop said, ``I think it is quite possible
to raise a generation of adolescents down the road that would be
far less sexually active than the present one.''
   He emphasized that such programs should involve parents and
incorporate moral and social values along with anatomical studies.
   But in the best of future worlds, he said, ``that leaves the
teen-agers of today.''
   ``Many people are discouraged about teen-agers because some of
them are so sexually active,'' he said.
   While it is important to recommend abstinence, Koop said, ``I
think it is also realistic to understand that sexually active
teen-agers are unlikely to reverse their pattern and go backward,
and therefore prevention for them has to be our third line of
defense. ...
   ``We have to teach them about the protection of themselves and
others through the use of condoms and spermicides.
   ``I know that goes against the grain of many people in this
country,'' he continued, ``but we cannot abandon more than half of
our teen-agers because they are sexually active. And we have to
reach them where they are and tell them about those things they
have to do.''
   Although only a relative handful of the more than 50,000 AIDS
cases reported so far involve teen-agers, Koop said little
information is available on the extent to which the virus may be
lying dormant among that group.
   Because of the long incubation period of the disease _ five
years or more _ Koop said he is reluctant to rule out an outbreak
of AIDS cases in young heterosexual adults who contracted the virus
as teen-agers.
   Largely because of that concern, Koop criticized some press
accounts that have suggested there is virtually no danger of AIDS
being spread through vaginal intercourse.
   ``We know from the infected spouses of persons with hemophilia
that (this virus) can be spread through normal vaginal intercourse.
What concerns me is the potential for a more rapid spread ... into
the general population,'' he said.
   ``I am outraged at recent newspaper and magazine articles
stating that there is no danger of heterosexual transmission from
normal vaginal intercourse,'' said Koop. ``Although homosexual sex
and IV drug abuse are the principal modes by which most cases are
transmitted, it is just not true that there is no danger from
normal vaginal intercourse.
   ``What is unknown is the level of danger. There is always a
danger whenever people engage in casual sex.''
   He did not mention any specific articles, but other Public
Health Service officials _ responding to specific queries _ have
criticized a recent article in a magazine aimed at young single
women which downplayed the risk of acquiring AIDS through
intercourse.
   Koop was the main witness Tuesday as the 13-member commission
began three days of hearings into some of the most controversial
aspects of AIDS, including education and prevention.
   Education Secretary William Bennett, who has differed publicly
with Koop about the emphasis to put on advising sexually active
people to use condoms, is scheduled to testify Thursday.
   Retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins said Monday he is confident
that the commission can reach consensus recommendations on such
controversial topics by the time it submits its final report to
President Reagan June 24.
   Responding to questions at the National Press Club a day before
Koop's testimony, Watkins also called attention to the concern of
health authorities that little is known about the rate of dormant
AIDS infection among teen-agers.
   ``We don't know what it is in adolescents,'' he said. ``There
may be lurking on the horizon a real problem that has yet to
unfold.''

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's
remarks as he left Tuesday for the NATO summit meeting in Belgium.
   Thank you all very much, and good morning.
   I'm going to Europe to meet with a group of friends and
colleagues, the leaders of the North Atlantic Alliance.
   We and our foreign affairs and defense ministers see a good deal
of each other, just as friends should.
   But the meeting that begins in Brussels tomorrow will be special.
   It will be the first time in almost six years that leaders of
all the NATO countries have met together for a summit.
   Much has happened in those six years that we can be very proud
of, including the INF Treaty with the Soviet Union that removes an
entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons, weapons that on
the Soviet side have held the European continent at risk.
   That historic agreement was possible because the alliance's
steadfast political and military resolve backed up our negotiations
with the Soviets.
   But the purpose of this summit is not self-congratulations.
   Our responsibility is to the future, and it will be to the
future that we turn our attention tomorrow.
   Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthy
partnership between North America and Europe, for this is the
foundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially depends.
   We will never sacrifice the interests of this partnership in any
agreement with the Soviet Union.
   NATO's agenda for peace and freedom has always been ambitious,
and it must remain so.
   In the arms control area, we will continue to press for Soviet
agreement to 50 percent reductions in the strategic nuclear forces
on both sides, and for a truly global and verifiable ban on
chemical weapons.
   My colleagues and I will be working to give negotiations on
conventional forces a new start as well.
   We will also discuss Soviet behavior toward its own citizens and
toward other countries, since problems of human rights and external
aggression remain key obstacles to long-term improvement of
East-West relations.
   If our common approach to the East over the years has given
coherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has been
our unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given it
credibility.
   Arms reduction can only succeed if it is backed up by a strong
defense.
   My Atlantic colleagues and I will rededicate ourselves to
maintaining the deterrent that has protected our freedom and
prosperity for almost 40 years.
   I will repeat to my colleagues my strong conviction that
American troops will remain in Europe, under any administration, so
long as Europeans want them to stay.
   We can be rightfully proud of these 40 years of peace that our
common commitment has brought.
   But the job is not finished.
   We in the alliance will not be satisfied merely with a record
period without war.
   We seek nothing less than permanent peace with freedom in the
North Atlantic.
   This bold objective can be obtained, but we must have the
courage to follow the course that we have set for ourselves.
   For four decades, a combination of a strong common defense and
pursuit of dialogue with the East has been a winning formula for
NATO.
   It is a combination that can lead us to a future of peace,
freedom and prosperity for generations to come.
   Thank you. God bless you. And thank you all for coming out here
to see us off.

<HEAD>Curfew In Effect in City in Azerbaidzhan Where Rioting Broke Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have clamped a curfew on a southern
city where weekend rioting broke out and tensions are still running
high because of a territorial dispute between ethnic groups, a
Soviet official said Tuesday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov suggested that
the Sunday unrest in Sumgait, as well as demonstrations and other
violence elsewhere in the Caucasus region in which at least two
people died, were due to ``mistakes'' made 65 years ago when a
territory composed largely of Armenians was made part of
neighboring Azerbaidzhan.
   He told a government news briefing that ``there were certain
injuries'' in Sumgait, an industrial city of more than 160,000
people in Azerbaidzhan where hooligans were blamed for touching off
the Sunday riot.
   ``The situation is calm there today, but it is tense,''
Gerasimov said.
   The official was peppered with questions about the civil unrest
in the southern Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaidzhan at his
regular Tuesday news briefing, but he said he had few details about
events there.
   Moscow-based foreign journalists have been barred from the
region, and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and the
official media have reached the Soviet capital.
   ``When passions calm down and life starts to normalize, the
appearance of some journalists in this region can lead to
intensification of nationalistic feelings,'' Gerasimov said,
explaining why restrictions have been imposed to keep
correspondents from visiting the area.
   Asked about reports that Soviet tanks are patrolling the streets
of Sumgait, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians in the
streets, and that there have been at least two deaths in the city,
Gerasimov said,``There is a curfew.''
   He said he had not heard anything about tanks being sent to the
city.
   Asked if troops remained in the city Tuesday, Gerasimov said,
``I don't know, but I guess so. Presumably.''
   The violence in Sumgait, reported Monday by the official news
agency Tass, followed earlier outbreaks 150 miles away in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the contested region in Azerbaidzhan, and massive
but apparently peaceful demonstrations in Yerevan, the capital of
Armenia.
   The demonstrators demanded that Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been
part of Azerbaidzhan since 1923, be made part of Armenia. About
three-quarters of the region's population of 157,000 are ethnic
Armenians.
   Gerasimov said he did not have detailed reports from the entire
region but that what information he had indicated ``everything is
calm'' in Yerevan and surrounding areas.
   ``The events that took place caused great concern to us,'' the
spokesman said. ``We think it is not a proper way to settle the
problems that have accumulated.''
   Gerasimov acknowledged, however, that the unrest apparently
stemmed from ``some mistakes made in national relations, and these
mistakes should be rectified.''
   Soviet authorities have pledged to reconsider the issue of
whether Nagorno-Karabakh should remain part of Azerbaidzhan.
Gerasimov's remarks seemed to indicate the region would be turned
over to Armenia. He did not, however, say when that might occur.
   Asked if he was indeed saying Nagorno-Karabakh should be made
part of Armenia, the spokesman said, ``I meant there were some
mistakes in Nagorno-Karabakh.''
   Gerasimov described the region as ``a kind of enclave'' in
Azerbaidzhan with 49 nationalities represented among the population
that is nonetheless mostly Armenian.
   ``That is why we should be very tactful in handling this
question in order not to cause differences between brothers and
nationalities. The previous policy had some mistakes in this
area,'' he said.
   On Saturday, a Soviet prosecutor reported that two people living
in a region of Azerbaidzhan that borders on Nagorno-Karabakh had
been slain in unrest caused by the territorial dispute.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for
``civic maturity and restraint'' in Azerbaidzhan and Armenia, and
promised that the Communist Party Central Committee would review
relations among the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.
   That same day Gorbachev also met with two prominent Armenian
writers to help work out a solution to the problem over
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet republics in the
Caucasus. It is bordered on the west by largely Christian Armenia
and Georgia and on the north by the Russian Republic. The Caspian
Sea runs for nearly 800 miles along its eastern edge.
   The republic is mainly Shiite Moslem, except for Armenian
Christians living in the Nagorno-Karbakh region.

<HEAD>Singer Brian Wilson's Psychologist Accused Of Drug, Sex Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State medical authorities want to revoke the
license of a psychologist who has been Beach Boy Brian Wilson's
therapist, alleging the man financially exploited the eccentric
songwriter.
   In documents released Monday, the Board of Medical Quality
Assurance accused psychologist Eugene Landy of drug violations,
patient sexual abuse and ``grossly negligent'' conduct.
   Seven causes of action were filed against Landy, Wilson's
near-constant companion for the last five years.
   The accusations largely concern Landy's relationship with
Wilson, saying multiple business relationships with Wilson caused
the singer ``severe emotional damage, psychological dependence and
financial exploitation.''
   A request for comment was left at the office of a spokesman for
Wilson and Landy on Tuesday but there was no immediate response.
   Attorney John Mason, representing Wilson, said the accusations
were false.
   ``Brian Wilson has made a miraculous recovery with the help of
Dr. Landy, psychologically, physically and financially. He's in the
best shape he's ever been in his life,'' Mason said.
   Landy has said he became a virtual 24-hour guardian of Wilson to
save him from obesity and a dependence on drugs and alcohol that
left him cloistered in a sand box in his house for a year.
   In a 1983 interview in People magazine, Landy said his staff
controlled Wilson's every moment, monitored everything he ate and
drank and recorded everything he said.
   The medical board said Landy abused his privileges as a
psychologist by serving as Wilson's business manager, business
adviser, executive producer and co-songwriter while also as a
therapist.
   Last year, the Beach Boys formed a management advisory committee
to make business decisions. The state board said Landy used his
influence over Wilson to be picked as the singer's representative,
and was paid $140,000 for serving on the committee for 11 months.
   Also questioned was Landy's control of Wilson's prescription
drugs for a five-year period. Psychologists are not permitted to
prescribe drugs.
   The board said Landy would have Wilson examined by a physician
who would prescribe medications that were kept in Wilson's home in
a locked cabinet. Wilson didn't have a key, but Landy's unlicensed
assistants did.
   Landy was also accused by the board of using cocaine and amyl
nitrate with an unidentified female patient to induce her to have
sex with him.
   Linda McCready, a spokeswoman for the board's Sacramento office,
said the next step in Landy's case is for the state attorney
general to schedule a hearing before an administrative law judge,
which usually takes six months.
   The judge would make a recommendation to the board's psychology
examining committee, which will determine what action to take. Ms.
McCready said if Landy disagrees with the committee's decision he
can appeal to Superior Court.

<TEXT>
   Pro-choice groups filed 229,128 signatures
Tuesday in support of a statewide vote on whether Michigan should
continue to pay for poor women's abortions.
   That gave the People's Campaign for Choice coalition more than
100,000 names above the minimum needed to put the issue on the Nov.
8 ballot and suspend a new law that will halt welfare abortion
funding beginning March 29.
   However, the petitions may have been filed too late to avoid a
temporary funding cutoff.
   ``We have every reason to believe that 29 days is enough time''
to confirm the required 119,829 valid signatures and put the law on
hold, said Judith Frey, speaking for the coalition.
   ``I would find that very unlikely,'' responded Elections
Director Christopher Thomas. He said election-year petition
certification normally takes 45 days to 60 days.
   Both Frey and Right to Life of Michigan President Barbara
Listing said they were confident the signatures will be certified.
   ``It's a large pad. It's certainly enough to, I think, place it
on the ballot,'' Listing said.
   Both sides have estimated the statewide campaign to sway
referendum votes will cost $2 million to $3 million.
   The petition drive that ended Tuesday was the second in as many
years dealing with welfare abortion funding.
   Since 1978, Gov. James Blanchard, a Democrat, and his Republican
predecessor, William Milliken, have used their veto power 17 times
to preserve state-paid abortions for the poor.
   Right to Life initiated the no-funding law last year with a
petition drive intended to avoid the veto.
   In Michigan, anyone who can gather 191,726 valid signatures can
place before the Legislature a measure that, if approved by both
houses, becomes law without the governor's signature.
   After gathering about 400,000 signatures, the Right to
Life-written proposal breezed through the Legislature and became
law.
   Michigan is one of 14 states that uses taxpayer money to finance
abortions for the poor. In 1986, the most recent year for which a
final tally is available, Michigan paid about $5.8 million for
18,600 abortions.

<HEAD>Disciplinary Actions Against Doctors Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The states took disciplinary action against
1,277 of the nation's half-million physicians in 1986, but a
consumer group that compiled the figures said Tuesday that too many
doctors are still getting away with shoddy work.
   The actions taken in 1986 represented a 17 percent increase over
the previous year and contrasted with a 46 percent jump in
disciplinary actions from 1984 to 1985.
   ``Even though the 1986 total ... is better than in any previous
year, it falls very short of catching most of the incompetent
doctors in this country,'' said a report by the Public Citizen
Health Research Group founded by Ralph Nader and director Dr.
Sidney M. Wolfe.
   ``In most states, the majority of disciplinary actions are for
drug and alcohol problems, only a fraction being for
incompetence,'' it said.
   ``The absence ... of the maximum effort to discipline doctors is
one of the most serious threats to the health of American
patients.''
   Although the federal government can suspend doctors from
participating in federal health programs such as Medicare and
Medicaid, the underlying permission to practice medicine is
determined solely by the individual states.
   Surveying data from the Federation of State Medical Boards,
Public Citizen ranked all 50 states and the District of Columbia
according to the number of 1986 ``serious actions'' per 1,000
doctors. A serious action was defined as a revocation or suspension
of the license to practice medicine, or a probation.
   The national average was 2.37 actions per 1,000 doctors.
   Georgia led with 6.94 actions per 1,000, followed by Indiana,
Iowa, West Virginia, Utah, Oregon, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky and
Colorado.
   Wyoming was in 51st place with none. New Hampshire ranked 50th,
preceded by Vermont, Maryland, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington, Rhode Island and Alabama in
40th place.
   Nationwide, the group found there were 745 serious actions in
1984, 1,089 in 1985 and 1,277 in 1986, the last year for which
figures from all localities were available.
   ``Since there is no evidence that doctors settle in certain
states depending on how competent they are, differences in the rate
of doctor discipline reflect differences in how serious states are
about disciplining doctors,'' the report said.
   ``We continue to believe that until the rate of doctor
discipline in this country significantly increases, there is no
realistic possibility of a major decrease in the amount of medical
malpractice.''

   A county supervisor who prides himself on
doing right by his district and recently offered $1 to any
constituent who spotted a pothole, has issued a $5 bounty on
flooded intersections.
   ``Whether I pay off one or two, it'll be the best survey the
Flood Control District ever had,'' said Kenneth Hahn, who is
running for an unprecedented 10th term.
   ``It'll keep the Flood Control engineers out of their offices in
downtown and down in the streets where they belong,'' he said.
   The offer, intended to pull the plug on storm-caused flooding,
is good from Tuesday through March 10.
   Hahn paid $3 on his pothole offer _ $2 of it to a Los Angeles
Herald Examiner reporter who cruised the byways of the 2nd District
in a near-fruitless search for poor pavement.
   ``I pride myself on taking care of my district,'' Hahn said.
``If you do your homework and take care of the little things in
your district, the big things will take care of themselves.''

<HEAD>Haughey Challenges British Army's View of Civilian's Shooting
Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey on Tuesday
challenged the British army's contention that one of its soldiers
accidentally shot and killed an unarmed civilian from an
observation post just inside Northern Ireland.
   ``A suggestion that death was due to a freak accident of an
extraordinary kind must give rise to disbelief,'' Haughey told the
Irish Parliament.
   Haughey's administration launched its own investigation into the
Feb. 21 shooting of 23-year-old Aidan McAnespie, which strained
already tense relations between Britain and Ireland. An Irish
police officer said he witnessed the shooting from across the
border.
   Police in the British-ruled province charged an 18-year-old
soldier with unlawful killing. He is being held in military custody.
   The army said the bullet that hit McAnespie ricocheted after
being fired accidentally from an observation post at a checkpoint
near Auchnacloy, less than half a mile from the Irish Republic's
border.
   Relatives said McAnespie, a campaign worker for Sinn Fein, the
legal political arm of the Irish Republican Army, had been harassed
by the British army. His sister, Eilish McCabe, claimed her brother
had received a number of death threats from the army.
   Haughey's inquiry angered the British government and Protestant
political leaders in Northern Ireland, who see it as interference
in their affairs.
   Haughey said the Irish investigation was obligatory because of
the ``considerable concern'' over the incident among the province's
Roman Catholic minority.
   He said McAnespie's death, along with the British government's
refusal to prosecute Northern Ireland police officers who killed
six unarmed Roman Catholics in 1982 and the release from prison of
a British soldier who served just three years of a life sentence
for killing a Catholic ``have combined to create the impression
that the security forces are above the law.''
   ``Any such impression among the public in Northern Ireland must
have disastrous consequences on the community and impinge on every
aspect of British policy for the administration of justice in
Northern Ireland,'' Haughey said.
   McAnespie's body was exhumed Sunday after his family requested
an autopsy by an Irishman in addition to that held by the British
in the north. The family said they wanted to determine the course
of the fatal bullet. He was later reburied in the Irish Republic.

   President Reagan announced today that Panama
and three other countries long hostile to the United States _
Afghanistan, Iran and Syria _ have not cooperated with U.S. efforts
to stop the smuggling of drugs to American markets.
   But Reagan plans no steps to penalize Panama economically beyond
measures already taken, said Ann Wrobleski, a State Department
official responsible for narcotics matters.
   Reagan will ``wait and see'' if Panama's military-dominated
government improves its cooperation before deciding on additional
sanctions, she said.
   The decisions concerning Afghanistan, Iran and Syria will have
no economic impact on them, partly because none is a U.S. aid
recipient.
   Under law, Reagan is required to suspend all economic and
military aid to countries found not to be cooperating in U.S. drug
enforcement efforts. Ms. Wrobleski noted that all such aid to
Panama was suspended in 1987.
   Such a finding also requires the United States to vote against
loan requests by the offending country in international lending
institutions. Ms. Wrobleski said the United States has been
abstaining on Panama's requests for some time and that, in any
case, Panama has no loan applications pending.
   Ms. Wrobleski raised the possibility that the administration may
increase tariffs on Panamanian products if that country's attitude
on drug-smuggling does not improve.
   She said a contributing factor in the decision on Panama was the
drug-smuggling indictments handed down a month ago against military
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega. The indictment said Panama has
become a major transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine from Colombia.
   Reagan certified that Mexico and Colombia are cooperating with
U.S. drug enforcement efforts, but Ms. Wrobleski said the president
indicated that ``these countries should do more.''
   Under a 1986 law, Reagan is required to take punitive measures
against countries found not to cooperate in curbing drug-smuggling
to the United States. Countries which are ``decertified'' are
subject to the penalties.
   Today was the deadline for the announcement of Reagan's findings.
   The announcement on Panama's lack of cooperation in drug
enforcement carried heavy political overtones, given the dramatic
developments over the past few days.
   The administration has refused to extend recognition to the new
Panamanian government which took office following the ouster last
Friday of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Delvalle was deposed by Noriega's allies in the National
Assembly after the president tried to fire the defense chief. The
Reagan administration continues to look on Delvalle as Panama's
constitutional president.
   The new government has named a U.N.-based envoy to replace
Delvalle's ambassador, Juan B. Sosa, but Sosa refused to relinquish
the embassy. The appointed successor, Leonardo Kam, showed up at
the embassy on Monday and left after what he said was a ``frank''
exchange with Sosa.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced a Senate resolution
urging additional economic sanctions against Panama, including a
trade embargo. An administration official, however, said the
government is not contemplating any such action.
   Kennedy's resolution also asks that the United States cut off
all contacts with Noriega because he is ``no longer the lawful
commander'' of the Defense Forces.
   In a brief speech on the Senate floor, Kennedy said Noriega ``is
a threat to peace and security in the region.''
   ``When a drug trafficker gets control over the governmental
powers of a nation, it's a threat to other nations,'' Kennedy said.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said the administration should go
much further than it has in pressuring Noriega to step down.
   ``This business of let's go slow, let's exercise restraint and
caution, that is what has produced the situation. We've been going
cautiously with this gangster for 20 years,'' D'Amato said.

   A fire spread through a mobile home sales
lot Tuesday, destroying 45 homes, authorities said.
   High wind and a lack of water hindered firefighters at Connor
Mobile Homes. There were no injuries reported in the Tuesday
morning fire.
   The mobile homes were valued about about $10,000 each. About
half the homes in the lot were destroyed.
   ``With the way the wind was blowing and just the three of us out
here, there was nothing we could do. It got up under the houses and
that was it,'' said Tony Cantrell, a Connor salesman.
   Fire Department Captain Richard Newman said the department
received a report of a grass fire and that the trailers were
burning when firefighters arrived.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidates scrambled to discredit
their rivals with increasingly rough-and-tumble television
commercials a week before the nation's biggest primary day ever.
   Sen. Bob Dole scored Vice President George Bush for his role in
the Iran-Contra affair in one new ad. In another, Rep. Marvin Leath
of Texas criticizes two Democrats competing against his colleague,
Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   The candidates under attack _ Bush, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee _ all have produced
hard-hitting TV ads of their own and were expected to respond
promptly.
   Television is shaping up as the candidates' most important tool
in the far-flung Super Tuesday contests on March 8. There are 712
Republican delegates and 1,307 Democratic delegates up for grabs
that day in caucuses and primaries in 20 states and American Samoa.
   Super Tuesday stretches across more than 150 media markets and
more than 500 television stations, with a multi-million dollar
price tag for any candidate who wanted to clog the air with
commercials.
   Most of the contenders were targeting their media spending to
carefully selected areas where they thoguht they had the best
chances of winning delegates. Both Dukakis and Gore predicted they
would in the end have spent the most for Super Tuesday; Bush had
the most money in the bank as the contest approached.
   Dole and Gephardt were first out of the box with negative ads.
   One Dole spot depicts someone walking through snow but leaving
no footprints. Dole campaign manager Bill Brock said the message is
that Bush ``has held all these big jobs'' yet left no mark.
   Another ad, the first to inject the Iran-Contra affair into the
campaign, says Dole was ``opposed selling arms to Iran. Bush
supported the arms-for-hostages deal.'' The ad also accuses Bush of
waffling on taxes, taking a soft line on the U.S.-Soviet arms
control treaty, and opposing a textile bill popular in several
Southern states.
   In his ad on behalf of Gephardt, Leath said the Missouri
congressman ``stood with us for lower taxes, for an oil import fee
to make America strong, for a tough trade bill to stand up for
American workers.''
   ``On all these issues, Gore and Dukakis were opposed to us. Gore
and Dukakis even think the Gephardt trade bill is too tough on the
Japanese, Europeans and Koreans. We're tired of hearing that you
can't fight for America anymore. That's why 35 Southern congressman
are fighting for Dick Gephardt for president,'' Leath says in the
ad.
   Gephardt also is using a slightly retooled version of a
commercial that gave him the edge he needed to beat Dukakis last
week in South Dakota. The ad called Dukakis ``one of the biggest
tax raisers in Massachusetts history'' and mocked the governor's
suggestion that struggling Iowa farmers switch to growing Belgian
endive.
   The Dukakis campaign has prepared several tough responses,
including an ad that shows a weathervane swinging back and forth as
a narrator accuses Gephardt of flip-flops on issues.
   Leslie Dach, the campaign's communications director, declined to
provide any scripts because he said final decisions on what would
be used, when and where had not been made.
   But he said the general content would be along the following
lines: ``He says he is leading the little guy's fight but his
campaign is financed and supported by the big guys. His biggest
contributors are America's biggest corporations. He has failed to
show a set of principles or a set of values that give a rudder to
his policies.''
   In a footnote to the fierce Super Tuesday TV campaign, Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., began attacking Pat Robertson in ads running on radio
stations in South Carolina. The state holds a GOP primary on
Saturday.
   The Kemp ad asks if the former television evangelist has ``the
qualifications and the judgment to be our next president'' and
cites some of his more unusual positions such as a 1979 suggestion
that public schools be eliminated. Robertson later changed his mind.
   In addition to negative ads, the candidates are using more
subdued biographical spots and traditional political testimonials.
Among them: former Sen. Barry Goldwater endorses Bush, former House
Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill of Massachusetts praises Dukakis, and
Rep. Claude Pepper _ an elderly Florida legislator with enormous
clout among senior citizens _ speaks kindly of Gephardt.
   Gephardt is also using the Hyundai ad credited with putting his
campaign message into sharp focus and helping him win last month's
Iowa caucuses. In the spot he criticizes South Korea for putting
stiff tariffs on U.S. autos and asks how many Hyundais the Koreans
could sell here at $48,000 apiece.

<HEAD>Court Hears Arguments Challenging Texas Death Penalty Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas' capital punishment law, under which
some 260 convicted murderers are awaiting death by lethal
injection, was challenged Tuesday in the Supreme Court.
   Mark Stevens of San Antonio, a lawyer representing death row
inmate Donald Gene Franklin, argued that the law, as applied,
stacks the deck in favor of death over life in prison.
   Stevens said the jurors who sentenced Franklin for the 1975
murder of a San Antonio nurse were prevented from giving full
consideration to ``mitigating circumstances,'' those factors
suggesting life in prison as the appropriate punishment.
   ``Consideration of particularized mitigating circumstances was
not allowed,'' Stevens contended.
   But William C. Zapalac, an assistant state attorney general,
urged the justices to uphold a federal appeals court ruling that
said Franklin was sentenced properly.
   Noting that Franklin was allowed to present any mitigating
evidence he desired, Zapalac added, ``Franklin cannot reasonably
claim that the jury could not see the relevance of the evidence he
wanted to present.''
   Under Texas law, capital case sentencing juries are asked two
questions: whether the murder was committed deliberately and
whether the killer poses a continuing, violent threat to society.
   If the jurors unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that
the answer to both questions is ``yes'' a death sentence is imposed.
   But Stevens told the justices that the judge's instructions to
jurors at Franklin's trial, similar to those typically used in
Texas, directs the jury to consider all mitigating evidence in
light of the two questions.
   For example, Stevens said the fact that Franklin had been a
well-behaved prison inmate for seven years could only be used to
consider whether he was a continuing threat to society and not for
some other reason.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, no relation to the lawyer, asked
Zapalac why such evidence could not be used by jurors to decide
that Franklin was a man of good character ``who should not die.''
   Zapalac said Franklin failed to show that any other kind of jury
instruction would have helped him.
   Franklin was convicted of abducting and killing 27-year-old Mary
Margaret Moran.
   His lawyer repeatedly said Tuesday he was not attacking the
Supreme Court's 1976 decision, in a case called Jurek vs. Texas,
that upheld the state's death penalty law. But the justices seemed
skeptical that overturning Franklin's sentence could leave the 1976
ruling intact.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist suggested that Stevens'
arguments appeared to be ``cutting into Jurek.''
   Justice Antonin Scalia said it seemed to him that the argument
came down to whether ``the language of the statute'' did not allow
full and independent consideration of mitigating circumstances.
   If the court were to rule that way, its decision could affect
all Texas death row inmates. Out of about 2,000 death row inmates
nationwide, 260 are in Texas. That total is second only to Florida,
which has about 280 inmates on death row.
   A number of executions have been postponed in Texas pending the
court's decision in the case, which is expected by July.
   The case is Franklin vs. Lynaugh, 87-5546.

<HEAD>Commissioners Approve $2.3 Million Contract For Construction of
Museum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a struggle to fund an exhibit on the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Dallas County
Commission approved a $2.3 million contract to build an elevator to
what was believed to have been the killer's perch.
   ``The eyes of the world will be on this project,'' said Lindalyn
Adams, president of Dallas County Historical Foundation. ``As sad
as it is, it is the most important historical site in Dallas.''
   The foundation has worked 11 years to get the exhibit funded,
and plans to raise $1.5 million more from private sources for
additional renovations on the sixth floor of the former Texas
Schoolbook Depository.
   The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald fired at
Kennedy from the sixth floor of what is now the Dallas County
Administration Building on Nov. 22, 1963.
   The contract award was approved by a 3-2 vote Monday to Thomas
J. Hayman Construction Co., which could begin work as early as this
week.
   The exhibit, ``The Sixth Floor,'' will be reached via an outside
elevator that will carry an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 visitors
annually to the exhibit without disrupting work inside.
   Tony Callaway, a partner in the architectural firm of Hendrick
Callaway, said construction could be completed by November.
Foundation officials say they are unlikely to schedule the
exhibit's opening Nov. 22, the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's
assassination.
   ``We think it would be inappropriate,'' Adams said.

   Peace talks on Afghanistan open their most crucial
and fragile phase on Wednesday, one that is widely hoped to produce
a settlement to end a conflict that has claimed more than a million
lives.
   But complex and potentially disruptive issues remain to be
resolved during the United Nations-sponsored talks before a package
of agreements, drawn up during almost six years of bargaining,
finally can be completed.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez has said the new round of talks
will focus on closing the gap between the varying timetables for
withdrawing an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops.
   But likely to dominate the talks is a question that is formally
outside their scope: Who will be in charge in Kabul until all
Soviet troops have moved out?
   Delegates from Afghanistan and from Pakistan both said Tuesday
that they have come to Geneva to finalize a settlement to end the
9-year-old conflict.
   But Pakistan Foreign Minister Zain Noorani said his country
would decide next week whether it was prepared to sign the peace
package with the present Marxist government of President Najib,
which it does not recognize.
   Noorani said Pakistan is continuing to press for the formation
of a transitional government to coincide with the withdrawal of
Soviet troops. Without it, he said, there can be no peace.
   But he said ``we have come to Geneva with a constructive
attitude to finalize the text'' of the four-agreement package.
   Meanwhile, the head of the Afghan delegation, foreign minister
Abdul Wakil, told a news conference that he was looking forward to
the new round with a ``sense of full optimism.''
   The present leadership, he said, were ``not ambitious'' about
retaining power. He said the timetable for the withdrawal was
``within negotiable range.''
   The negotiations have come under mounting pressure since Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced Feb. 8 that Moscow will
withdraw its troops beginning on May 15 if a final deal is sealed
in Geneva by March 15.
   He said the withdrawal could be completed in 10 months. Pakistan
originally demanded that the troops quit in three months but has
gradually widened that span to eight months.
   Pakistan wants the settlement to include the transitional
government because it could oversee the safe return of more than 5
million anti-Soviet Afghan refugees, one-third of Afghanistan's
pre-war population.
   Moscow has accused Pakistan of creating last-minute obstacles to
an accord and said the makeup of the government should be left to
the Afghans.
   The alliance of Pakistan-based Afghan resistance groups,
claiming to represent 200,000 Moslem guerrillas, responded last
week by revealing its own plan for a government.
   It has ruled out any power-sharing with Najib but offered a
minor role to ``Moslems presently living in Kabul,'' a formula that
could refer to moderates in the present government.
   Yunis Khalis, chairman of the seven-group alliance, vowed the
guerrillas won't lay down their arms until the ``Islamic
government'' is set up.
   Predictably, that concept has been rejected by Najib and Wakil,
who heads the Afghan delegation in Geneva. Wakil says he represents
the ``only legal government in Afghanistan which has been
recognized by 80 countries.''
   Pakistan so far has not given its formal support to the
guerrilla proposal and has hinted it prefers a more broad-based
approach.
   The United States, which along with the Soviet Union is to
guarantee implementation of the peace package, has been ambivalent
in its reaction to the calls for an interim government.
   But the U.S. Senate, in a non-binding resolution Monday, urged
formation of an interim government in Kabul that is acceptable to
the Afghan resistance.
   U.S. Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost, visiting Pakistan
last week, said the guerrilla plan was a ``very welcome step
towards the resolution of the Afghan problem.''
   There has also been a lack of clear signals on when Washington
would be prepared to cut off its aid to the guerrillas, reported to
have been about $700 million last year.
   The Afghan monarchy was overthrown in 1978 and a communist
government was installed. The Soviets intervened at the request of
the embattled new Marxist government.

   President Reagan was greeted by
officials of Belgium, and reunited with Secretary of State George
Shultz, as he arrived today for a summit with America's NATO allies.
   About seven hours after pledging that the United States will
keep its troops in Europe ``as long as Europeans want them to
stay,'' Reagan's Air Force Boeing 707 jetliner touched down on a
windy, moonlit tarmac at Brussels Zaventem Airport.
   He smiled and chatted amiably as he was greeted by Shultz, who
had just arrived from a meeting in London with Jordan's King
Hussein. Also on hand was Belgium's prime minister, Wilfried
Martens and Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans.
   Following a five-minute courtesy get-together with Tindemans in
an airport salon, Reagan was ferried by motorcade for an overnight
stay at Chateau Stuyvenberg, a 1840 brick and stone palace one used
as the favored residence of the Belgium royal family.
   Reagan, as he left the White House for a two-day NATO summit in
Belgium, said the session comes at a historic moment for both East
and West.
   ``For four decades, the combination of a strong common defense
and pursuit of dialogue with the East has been a winning formula
for NATO,'' Reagan said. ``It is a combination that can lead us to
a future of peace, freedom and prosperity for generations to come.''
   A throng of teen-age participants in the White House Conference
on a Drug-Free America, brought to the diplomatic entrance to give
Reagan a sendoff, sang ``God Bless America'' as the president
emerged.
   Reagan attempted to calm allied fears that the U.S.-Soviet
treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles portends an American
abandonment of its long-time commitment to the European democracies.
   ``That historic agreement was possible because the alliance's
steadfast political and military resolve backed up our negotiations
with the Soviets,'' Reagan said.
   The NATO allies are also concerned that the force of 326,000
U.S. troops stationed in Europe might be cut due to the U.S.
economic budget crunch.
   ``My Atlantic colleagues and I will rededicate ourselves to
maintaining the deterrent that has protected our freedom and
prosperity for almost 40 years,'' Reagan said. ``I will repeat to
my colleagues my strong conviction that American troops will remain
in Europe, under any administration, so long as Europeans want them
to stay.''
   As the first full-scale North Atlantic Treaty Organization
summit since 1982, the meeting has been touted as a chance for the
16-nation alliance to evaluate its goals and accentuate its
solidarity.
   But the summit, Reagan said, will not be held for
``self-congratulations.'' Instead, he said, it will be a time for a
rededication to the democratic goals that forged the alliance in
1949 in the face of the spread of Soviet influence in Eastern
Europe.
   ``If our common approach to the East over the years has given
coherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has been
our unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given it
credibility,'' Reagan said. ``Arms reduction can only succeed if it
is backed up by a strong defense.''
   His first priority, Reagan said, ``is to maintain a strong and
healthy partnership between North America and Europe.''
   Reagan pledged anew to forge ahead with attempts to achieve a 50
percent cut in strategic nuclear arms, as well as a global ban on
chemical weapons.
   He asserted that he also intends to press the Soviets on human
rights violations and its ``external aggression, '' apparently a
reference to its involvement in nations such as Afghanistan and
Nicaragua.
   The summit meeting comes as Reagan prepares for an expected

campaign that paints Gorbachev as a champion of peace and arms
control.
   For the most part, Reagan will appear only in brief photo
opportunities at the NATO session. The meetings among the heads of
state or government Wednesday and Thursday will be private.
   Reagan is slated to deliver closing remarks on Thursday.
   On Monday, Reagan previewed his slant on the summit in an
address to the annual convention of the American Legion.
   He promised to forge ahead with attempts to cut superpower
strategic arsenals in half and to seek a ban on chemical weapons.
But he also pledged that negotiations to reduce Warsaw Pact
conventional forces will receive equal weight.
   ``The serious imbalance of conventional forces in Europe must be
addressed as an equally high priority,'' Reagan said. ``Warsaw Pact
tanks and artillery far outnumber our own. Ours are positioned for
defense, theirs for an offensive attack.''
   Reagan attempted to sweep aside European doubts about America's
willingness to help its friends, but he advised that the alliance
cannot stand still.
   ``The Warsaw Pact's numerical superiority and the Soviet
strategy which emphasizes surprise attack means that our remaining
nuclear forces are fully capable of supporting NATO's flexible
response strategy,'' Reagan said.
   ``At the same time we must modernize our chemical weapons to
deter Soviet first-use and we must provide for conventional forces
that are capable of protecting free Europe,'' Reagan said.

   The Reagan administration has failed to stop
the heavy influx of illicit drugs into the United States, a group
of congressmen told a White House conference on drugs Tuesday.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., said the administration has earned
nothing more than a ``C'' grade for its efforts in the so-called
war on drugs. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chided administration
officials, including President Reagan, for claiming the battle
against drugs was being won.
   ``If we are winning the war on drugs, I wish the commanders
would go out and tell it to the troops in the field,'' Rangel said,
drawing a standing ovation from a cheering crowd of about 2,000 at
the White House Conference on a Drug-Free America.
   ``It's tragic to believe we are winning this battle against
drugs when we haven't even fired the first shot,'' said Rangel, who
is chairman of the House Narcotics Committee.
   He and six other members of Congress criticized the
administration, as well as their own colleagues, for not taking
such actions as sanctions toward Latin America countries who do not
cooperate with the U.S. in trying to combat drug trafficking.
   They urged the creation of a drug czar to oversee the U.S.
anti-drug efforts, the use of military forces for the interdiction
of drugs from Latin America countries and the mandatory, random
testing of railroad employees.
   Rangel and Chiles were joined at the Congressional Forum of the
five-day White House drug conference by Sens. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., and John C. Danforth, R-Mo., and Reps. Glenn English,
D-Okla., Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., and E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla.
   The conference, which was required by a 1986 anti-drug law, is
bringing together drug abuse experts who will submit a final report
and recommend solutions to the president and Congress this summer.
   Shaw told the enthusiastic crowd: ``We need to get away from a
policy of containment. We want you to come up with a plan for
victory. Let's fight it like we fought World War II, not like
Vietnam. Let's fight to win.''
   Rangel and several others praised the role first lady Nancy
Reagan has played during the past seven years in her anti-drug
campaign, ``Say No to Drugs.''
   ``Thank God, we have Nancy Reagan,'' Rangel said. ``She is the
only voice we have in this administration. We have no domestic or
foreign policy on drugs. If you want to fight this war, you have to
put up the resources for the boys in the front lines.''
   Chiles and Wilson also said there has been a lack of resources
assigned to the the battle against drugs.
   ``Nothing is a bigger threat internally or externally than the
use of drugs,'' Wilson said. ``We have to focus on the problem and
set priorities before it engulfs us completely.''
   Chiles, Wilson and Rangel also urged Reagan to impose severe
sanctions against Latin American countries, particularly Panama,
Mexico and Colombia, if they refuse to cooperate with the United
States in combatting drug trafficking.
   Under the 1986 law, the United States is to decertify and cut
off aid to countries ``not fully cooperating'' with the United
States to combat drug traffic.
   Reagan decided Tuesday that Panama, Afghanistan, Iran and Syria
have not cooperated with U.S. efforts to stop the drug smuggling to
American markets. But Ann Wrobleski, a State Department official
responsible for narcotics matters, said Reagan planned no steps to
penalize Panama economically beyond measures already taken.
   Reagan certified that Mexico and Colombia are cooperating with
U.S. drug enforcement efforts, but Ms. Wrobleski said the president
indicated that ``these countries should do more.''
   Reagan will ``wait and see'' if Panama's military-dominated
government improves its cooperation before deciding on additional
sanctions, she said.
   The decisions concerning Afghanistan, Iran and Syria will have
no economic impact on them, partly because none is a U.S. aid
recipient.
   Chiles said many members of Congress believe the administration
has not used the certification process properly.
   ``This year, the good news is that Panama is on the list,''
Chiles said. ``On the other hand, Mexico and Colombia aren't. ... I
think we have to continue to apply pressure against these
countries.''

   Construction spending fell 2.9 percent in
January, the biggest decline in 10 months, reflecting widespread
weakness in all sectors of the building industry, the government
reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said construction spending fell to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $395.2 billion in January
following a revised 0.4 percent advance in December.
   Economists said the decline was bigger than expected and will
likely mean that construction will be a drag on overall economic
growth in the first quarter of 1988.
   ``What was surprising about the figures was how widespread and
pervasive the weakness was. Virtually every category from housing
to industrial to hotels and motels did poorly in January,'' said
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co.
   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and publisher of a construction
industry newsletter, said he expects housing starts to fall by
about 15 percent this year and non-residential construction to drop
by 10 percent.
   ``I haven't found any area in the United States with strong
housing activity. The only strong area is public construction,
which I think will rise by about 4 percent,'' Sumichrast said.
   The January decline was the largest since a 3.3 percent drop in
March 1987, but some analysts said unusually severe weather in
January may have contributed to the decline.
   Residential contruction fell 2.6 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $191.3 billion as construction of
single-family homes fell 2.2 percent and multi-family construction
dropped 6.4 percent.
   Analysts said single-family construction will strengthen in
coming months because of recent mortgage-rate declines, but they
forecast further declines in apartment building because of
continued high vacancy rates.
   Non-residential construction fell 2.2 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $90.9 billion, reflecting declines in
office construction, hotels, factories and shopping centers.
   Government construction spending was off 4.9 percent in January
to a rate of $74.3 billion. The weakness in the public sector was
led by a 3.9 percent fall in the largest government construction
area, highway building, which declined to $24.8 billion.

<TEXT>
   America's preoccupation with the Vietnam War and
with the POW-MIA issue is hurting U.S. interests in Southeast Asia,
three American China specialists said Tuesday after returning from
two weeks in Vietnam.
   They described a Vietnam that is changing from a closed society
dependent on the Soviet Union to a country more open to the West.
   The specialists said that if the United States does not take
advantage of Vietnam's new openness, it could cede influence in the
region to the Soviet Union, China and Japan.
   ``The United States must reassert itself in Southeast Asia,''
said Helen Chauncey, a professor of history at Georgetown
University. ``If it doesn't we will be left behind in what will be
a realignment of political and economic forces.''
   ``We have to stop letting the past determine our actions in the
region,'' said Brantly Womack, professor of political science at
Northern Illinois University. ``Emotional topics like POW-MIA issue
are just red herrings.''
   Chauncey and Womack were joined by Frederic Wakeman Jr., a
professor of history from the University of California, Berkeley,
in their call for a more open policy toward Vietnam.
   Wakeman urged increasing educational and business contacts with
Vietnam.
   ``In the long run our stakes in Asia are enlarged by our
training of the technocracy,'' he said, noting that China now has
20,000 students studying in the United States.
   The three specialists along with a fourth ``China hand,''
Jonathan Pollack, of the Rand Corporation, spoke at a briefing
sponsored by The Henry Luce Foundation, which supported their trip
from Dec. 29 to Jan. 11.
   Seven American China specialists took part in the voyage, which
included stays in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, once known as Saigon,
and talks with high-ranking Vietnamese officials.
   For the first time, Womack said, Vietnamese officials, including
Foreign Minister and Vice Premier Nguyen Co Thach, are talking
about Vietnam's foreign policy in a ``post-Cambodian future.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, kicked out the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge and installed a puppet government in
Phnom Penh.
   A stalemate ensued in Indochina, with the Soviet Union and
Vietnam on one side and a resistance coalition, lead by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, China, the United States and the free-market
countries of Southeast Asia on the other.
   Last year Sihanouk split with the coalition and began direct
negotiations with Hun Sen, prime minister of the Vietnamese-backed
government.
   Nguyen van Linh, Vietnamese Communist Party chief, is pushing
for economic change in Vietnam, where the average annual income
hovers around $125. He has recognized the need for foreign exchange
and investment from the West.
   Wakeman said South Korean officials told him that both they and
Japan want to invest in Vietnam because of its disciplined,
inexpensive labor force.
   Ever since the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, American policy in
Indochina has been ``reactive,'' following the lead of China or the
capitalist countries of Southeast Asia, such as Thailand or
Indonesia, Chauncey said.
   ``American officials who I've talked to express a deep-seated
bitterness against the Vietnamese,'' Chauncey said. ``It's like,
`They beat us so we'll let them stew in their own juice.'''
   Other American officials, Womack said, think too much of the
issue of American prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action.
   ``This issue is important to Americans at home,'' he said. ``But
it's hurting American interests abroad.''

<HEAD>Government Study Says DAT Anti-Copying System Is Flawed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed electronic encoding system designed
to prevent music from being copied by new digital audio tape
recorders is flawed, the government said Tuesday in a report that
boosted efforts to introduce the new machines in the United States.
   ``There is no reason at this point why manufacturers should not
be selling'' digital recorders in this country, said Gary Shapiro
of the Home Recording Rights Coalition.
   But recording industry officials promised to sue any
manufacturer that tries to sell the machines in the United States
before the copying issue is resolved, either legislatively or
through industry negotiations.
   Digital audio tape, or DAT, recorders can make copies of compact
disc recordings without discernible loss of quality. The recording
industry fears that such high-quality copying would cut into their
compact disc profits.
   DAT recorders costing about $2,000 were introduced last year in
Japan, West Germany and France. But manufacturers have held off
bringing them to the United States, where pending legislation in
Congress would require DAT recorders to contain an anti-taping chip
that would prevent home recordings.
   A spokesman for Sony Corp. of America, a DAT manufacturer, said
the study's results would not effect the company's decisions on
when to introduce the recorders in United States.
   ``We're not rushing to market,'' Sony spokesman Stephen Burke
said. He said Sony would have to evaluate the availability of
software and other factors before deciding when to sell the
recorders in this country.
   Congress asked the National Bureau of Standards to study an
encoding system proposed by CBS Records in which a narrow band in
the upper mid-range frequencies is removed from a recording. A DAT
recorder equipped with the anti-taping chip detects the ``notch''
and disables the machine's recording circuitry for a short period.
   The study found that the system is flawed because it doesn't
always work, the ``notch'' can sometimes be heard by listeners, and
the system can be bypassed ``for about $100 by a competent
electronics technician.''
   ``It's like selling you a camera that won't take certain
pictures,'' said John Lyons, director of the bureau's National
Engineering Laboratory, describing the encoding system.
   Lyons said the effect of the notch on the recordings ``is
subtle. Sometimes you can hear it and sometimes you can't.'' When
the notch is discerned, it is often recognized as a missing note,
he said.
   The bureau's testing team didn't study other anti-taping
methods, he said. He added that while ``there are any number of
ways'' of altering a recording to prevent copying, ``none of them
is going to be fool proof.''
   The Home Recording Rights Coalition said the results of the
study were a victory for the consumer and signals the end of the
legislation before Congress.
   The coalition has been fighting all anti-taping efforts as
infringment on the rights of consumers to make recordings at home,
for their private use, of records, tapes and compact discs.
   Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, questioned aspects of the study but said it virtually
kills the CBS copy-code system ``as a viable political solution.''
   But he said the recording industry remains committed to finding
a solution through ``negotiation, legislation or litigation.''
   Berman said his is a $5 billion a year industry that is losing
$1.5 billion a year to home copying.

   Vice President George Bush said
Tuesday he wouldn't ``get into the gutter'' and respond to attacks
by his Republican presidential opponents.
   As the Super Tuesday collection of 20 primaries and caucuses
draws near, Bush toured the South and acted the part of
front-runner.
   ``I have tried to wage an honorable campaign and I'm not going
to get into this gutter answering every single attack,'' Bush told
supporters outside his Broward County campaign headquarters
downtown here. ``I want this nomination to be worth something after
I win it and, believe me, I'm going to win it.''
   ``I support the president. I have nothing to say about Dole's
charges, nothing at all,'' Bush said later when asked by reporters
to respond to Dole criticism that Bush has changed his version of
the Iran-Contra affair repeatedly.
   Bush began his day-long swing through south Florida, scheduled
to end in Tampa with a foreign-policy lecture to political science
students at Florida International University in Miami. He also
briefly addressed a rally at the state university.
   ``Things are going well but I am taking absolutely nothing for
granted. I am convinced that whoever wins Super Tuesday will be the
next president,'' Bush said at the campus, where one of the
introductory speakers was ``Miami Vice'' co-star Michael Talbott.
   Bush also was joined for his trip by former Arizona Sen. Barry
Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, and Florida
Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Sen. Bob Dole stepped up criticism of Bush in commercials and
speeches that say Bush has accomplished nothing of significance and
questioning Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Bush told the students that he was in charge of two meetings in
which the 1983 Grenada invasion was planned and he said he had
helped form and head the South Florida Task Force on Drugs that
began seven years ago.
   He expressed pride in the Grenada invasion, saying: ``Kicking
Castro out of Grenada was a very good thing.''
   Bush said although there have been some slight improvements in
relations with Cuba and Fidel Castro's regime, he said there was no
reason to expect a change in policy toward Castro because he
continues to ``support and export revolution.''
   At the campus rally, Bush took note of placards denouncing the
new U.S.-Cuban immigration accord that calls for normalized
immigration of Cubans in return for the return of Mariel boatlift
Cubans. Many in Miami's large Cuban exile community, which numbers
more than 600,000, have said they strongly oppose sending any
Cubans back to Cuba.
   Bush pledged that Cubans would not be treated in the same way as
immigrants from other countries because they are fleeing oppression.
   Later in the afternoon, Bush drove a paving machine at the
construction site of a development called Mystic Pointe, which will
have 1,600 units for sale at an average $100,000 price.
   The project is adjacent to the prestigious Turnberry Isle
development, which was mentioned in the national news last year
when Miami model Donna Rice disclosed she took a chartered trip to
Bimini with Democratic candidate Gary Hart from the marina there in
a yacht called the ``Monkey Business.''

<TEXT>
   A proposed free-trade agreement between the
United States and Canada will leave the U.S. auto industry at a
competitive disadvantage, the United Auto Workers union told a
House subcommittee Tuesday.
   ``Thousands of American auto workers' jobs would be at risk
under the agrement's terms,'' said Steve Beckman, international
economist for the UAW, in testimony before the trade subcommittee
of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   Witnesses at the hearing, including a representative of auto
parts makers and the state of Michigan, center of the U.S. auto
manufacturing, gave a mostly negative evaluation of the treaty's
effect on the auto industry.
   The only witness who gave unqualified praise to the treaty was
Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association.
   ``The agreement takes on and resolves most of the trouble spots
which were developing in the bilateral auto trade,'' he said.
   Criticism of the pact, which seeks to eliminate nearly all
tariff barriers between the U.S. and Canada, centered on the
failure of the treaty to eliminate present areas of discontent on
the U.S. side.
   ``Our current bilateral auto trade is skewed, to Canada's
benefit, by a number of trade-distorting practices,'' said Rep.
Sander Levin, D-Mich., resulting in part from Canada's
domestic-content requirements and duty rebates on some auto parts.
   Beckman said that by retaining Canadian production incentives
for Honda, Toyota and Hyundai, the treaty provides ``a subsidy of
Canadian production, much of which will be sold in the U.S.''
   Hanna, however, downplayed the union's worry, saying the North
American auto industry already has excess manufacturing capacity.
   ``Canada's duty remissions programs ... are eliminated or phased
out (in the agreement),'' he said. ``It makes no sense for the
Canadian government to lure more foreign auto investment,
especially when much of the production would be headed for the U.S.
market.''
   Lee Kadrich, director of governmental affairs and international
trade with the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association, said
the treaty was ``a lopsided agreement that sanctions long-standing
Canadian protectionism.''
   Marc Santucci, trade adviser to Michigan Gov. James Blanchard,
told the subcommittee the free-trade agreement would benefit the
state in some areas, such as access to Canadian electrical power
and services resulting from increased trade.
   ``While important, these benefits cannot compare to the
magnitude of trade in automotive products,'' Santucci said.
   ``It is my view that the Reagan administration sacrificed a
critical opportunity to make significant changes in the terms of
automotive trade to its imperative of getting an agreement,'' he
said.
   For example, he said, Canada's duty remissions program on auto
parts, designed to foster Canadian production, have been declared
illegal under international trade agreements, yet the incentives
will continue through 1997 for exports to third countries, allowing
inroads by Japanese and Korean manufacturers.

   A sting operation caught 52 suspects who
allegedly operated a $100 million poaching ring which dealt in
tiger, bear, sea lion and rhinoceros parts, state officials
announced Tuesday.
   Surrounded by bear gall bladders, bear-claw jewelry, skin parts,
whole stuffed bears, skulls, dried abalone and the genitalia of
seals and Asian tigers, regional game warden chief Chuck Monroe
said the investigation helped to ``wipe out the poaching of
California's precious wildlife.''
   An additional 23 people in Southern California are expected to
be charged as a result of ``Operation Ursus,'' the code name given
the 23-month probe by the state Department of Fish and Game.
   Many of the animal parts were sold to Asians who regard them as
aphrodisiacs and tonics, he said.
   At one point, an undercover warden taking part in an illegal
``safari'' in the Sierra was forced to kill a treed bear, Monroe
said as he described the complexity and danger of the probe.
   Monroe said 74 misdemeanor complaints were filed against 52
defendants. The charges range from illegally killing bears to
selling bear-claw jewelry at swap meets.
   So far, Monroe said, agents have made 14 arrests and obtained
three search warrants. Those convicted of poaching can draw stiff
fines and prison sentences, according to Monroe.
   The display in the council chamber at Colma City Hall, just
south of San Francisco, represented $85,000 worth of exotic animals
and organs seized in the sting, he said.
   The probe extended from the black bear range of Northern
California to San Francisco and Los Angeles, with the arrests made
over two months, said Monroe.
   He singled out the Yau Hing Apothecary Ship in San Francisco,
object of a search that yielded ``bear galls, mounted bears, seal
and tiger penises, abalone, rhino horn and powder.''
   The probe recovered parts of animals taken outside the country
and illegally shipped here, he said.
   Russian bear gall bladders were sold in two cases, but one
turned out to be from a cow, he said. The bear parts are purchased
mainly by Asians who believe eating the organs will transfer the
bear's strength, health and courage.
   ``Northern California arrests included a Weaverville man for
felony sale of 25 wet bear galls and five skulls; a Fresno art
dealer for felony sale of bear-claw rings and pendants; a San Bruno
exotic meat dealer for sale of bear hams, galls, skin and other
bear and tiger parts, and a San Bruno taxidermist for sale of a
bear rug and skull,'' said Monroe.
   In describing the illegal safari, Monroe said the undercover
warden was included in the party after passing himself off as a
game hunter.
   ``He had been with them on several hunts,'' Monroe said. ``When
the bear was treed, the agent was with three outlaws, all of whom
were armed. The time was 1 a.m. in a remote and steep forest. If he
had refused to kill the bear, they surely would have suspected who
he really was and his life would have been in danger.''
   Prior approval had been given for the killing ``if it became
necessary,'' said Monroe.
   ``Although we regret the loss of the bear, we hope its sacrifice
will prevent the loss of many other bears in the future,'' he said.

<HEAD>Misuse of Auto Seat Belts Said Cutting Their Effectiveness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the increasingly widespread use of
automobile lap-shoulder belts is saving hundreds of lives, the
belts often are misused in ways that reduce their effectiveness, a
federal study concluded Tuesday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the most common
abuse of the car safety belts is that they are worn too loosely or
_ often in the case of children _ are tucked under the arm or back
because of concern about the high angle of the harness.
   ``The lap-shoulder belts are very effective and achieve about
all that can be expected of them if they are properly used,'' said
NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett. ``But we have a lot of misuse and that
problem has to be tackled.''
   The safety board report is based on previous studies of seat
belt use by other government agencies and the insurance industry as
well as a detailed examination of 167 accidents in which at least
one occupant wore a belt.
   Lynne Smith, one of the NTSB staff investigators involved in the
study, said the findings were not meant to be a random statistical
sample, but that the data is ``consistent with the finding of
widespread (belt) misuse.''
   An examination of the accidents showed that 21 percent of the
motorists were wearing belts too loosely, reducing their
protection, the safety board said. It also cited an insurance
industry study of Maryland motorists that put the estimate at about
25 percent.
   Ms. Smith said belts should be worn with no more than the width
of a person's fist separating the belt from the body.
   The safety board urged the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to require that safety belts meet standards as to
the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt
systems be equipped with a ``pre-tension'' device that
automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash.
   In addition, the examination of accident cases by the NTSB
showed that 7 percent of the belt users had the shoulder harness
portion of their belt routed improperly under an arm or behind
their backs.
   Misuse of the belts was most prevelent among children, where
one-third had belts not properly used. In some cases, children had
belts routed under an arm or behind the back, two children were
wearing a single belt or children wore belts with the seat in a
reclining position, the report said.
   ``Such misuse ... seriously degrades the protective capabilities
of the lap-shoulder belt, reducing it to a lap-only belt with
inferior crash protection,'' the safety board said.
   Ironically, a number of auto safety pamphlets, including two
distributed by the NHTSA and one by the American Automobile
Association, have advised parents to place the shoulder belt behind
a child if the harness crosses the neck or face.
   ``The safety board does not agree,'' the NTSB report said. ``...
There is little evidence that small children or short adults are
likely to be harmed by the shoulder portion of a ... belt.''
   It said that in the accidents investigated it found no evidence
``that the shoulder ... belt induced more serious injuries to
children than it prevented.''
   The board called for the highway safety agency to revise its
brochures.
   ``We have not had a chance to read (the NTSB report) and have no
comment at this time,'' NHTSA spokeswoman Betsy Tyson said.
   Among the accidents, according to the NTSB, in which belt misuse
had tragic results, were:
   _A head-on crash in which a woman passenger, who had loosened
her shoulder harness extensively, was killed. Her husband, the
driver, had worn his belt snugly and ``walked away from the crash
with moderate injuries,'' said Suzanne Stack, an NTSB staff
researcher.
   _A crash in which a car struck a tree. The driver, who had worn
his belt properly, escaped with minor injuries while the passenger,
whose shoulder belt was routed under her arm, was killed.

   Having an official flower and an
official bird just isn't enough when for a state that depends on
farming, so lawmakers dug up the idea of designating ``official
Iowa soil.''
   Proponents of a resolution declaring ``Tama soil'' as the
official soil of the state of Iowa gained ground Tuesday in the
Senate, winning Agriculture Committee approval of their measure.
   The lawmakers want to place Tama, a thick, black topsoil found
in at least 17 counties in east-central and eastern Iowa, alongside
the official wild rose, eastern goldfinch, oak tree and geode.
   ``Tama soil represents the richest of soils found in the
state,'' the Senate resolution states.
   Said Sen. Emil Husak, ``It's the best we've got.''

   A manners expert says a self-help video she
plans to produce will be just the thing for young executives hoping
to avoid ``power failures at power lunches.''
   ``It's going to show young businessmen and women how to eat
their way to the top with style and grace,'' Marjabelle Young
Stewart said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Stewart, who has written 15 books on etiquette, said there
was a growing need for well-groomed manners in the business world.
   Instructions on how to hold silverware would be similar to a
golf lesson, she said.
   ``I'll show them the proper grip and motion, everything,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Stewart said more and more executives were scrutinizing the
manners of prospective employees, taking applicants to lunch to
``see how they get along with the other members of the club.''
   The video, ``The Code of Etiquette,'' will retail for $89.98 and
is due for release in the spring, Mrs. Stewart said.
   It also may be useful for busy parents and could replace
traditional manners lessons dispensed daily around dinner tables,
she said.
   ``Young working parents don't have time anymore to serve big
meals every night and teach their children manners,'' she said.
``Today, we're eating at the stove; eating out of the refrigerator;
eating in front of the television.''

   ``Deaf President Now'' was the cry, made by
voice or by fluttering fingers, as about 1,500 people rallied at
Gallaudet University on Tuesday to urge selection of the first deaf
president in the school's 124-year history.
   ``Today we are marching and speaking for our civil rights,''
Allen Sussman, former dean of student affairs, said in sweeping
sign language to the cheering crowd of students, alumni, faculty
members and administrators.
   ``I think it's high time that we are in control of our own lives
and our own institution,'' Sussman, who is a professor of
counseling and psychology, told The Associated Press. Communicating
through an interpreter, Sussman, who is deaf, said, ``I think we
can do it much better and with more sensitivity than people who are
not deaf.
   Gallaudet, established by Congress in 1864, is the only liberal
arts college for the deaf in the United States.
   ``We need a deaf president now!'' student body president Greg
Hlibok signed enthusiastically, leading the crowd in a signed and
shouted chant of ``Now! Now! Now!''
   A presidential search committee gave the board of trustees a
list of three finalists on Monday to fill the post vacated by Jerry
C. Lee, who resigned Jan. 1 to go into private industry. Two of the
candidates are deaf and one can hear.
   The trustees were expected to name a new president this Sunday
after interviewing the finalists later this week, according to
Gallaudet officials. Four of the 19 board members are deaf.
   The deaf candidates are Harvey J. Corson, 44, superintendent of
the Louisiana School for the Deaf in Baton Rouge, and I. King
Jordan, 45, dean of Gallaudet's College of Arts and Sciences. The
third finalist is Elisabeth A. Zinser, vice chancellor at the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro, who can hear.
   Katherine Ingold, a member of the search committee, said deaf
applicants would not be given special preference.
   ``The committee's role is to find the best possible president
for Gallaudet University,'' she explained. ``But if there were two
equally qualified candidates, one deaf and one hearing, of course
the preference would be a deaf candidate.''
   Gallaudet has an enrollment of 2,200 university students, 400
high school students and 200 elementary school students.

   America's allies in NATO should spend more
money for defense, but congressional denunciations aren't the best
way to get that done, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Tuesday.
   ``I quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to do
more,'' Carlucci told the House Budget Committee.
   But he added that ``I don't think it is very useful to simply
berate the Europeans on this.''
   Carlucci's comments came as President Reagan was heading for
Europe to attend a two-day summit meeting of leaders of the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the Budget Committee chairman,
criticized NATO nations for what he said was ``unequal sharing.''
He told Carlucci ``our allies in NATO are not doing, in my
estimation, enough for their own defense.''
   Criticism of NATO has long been popular on Capitol Hill, where
legislators have complained time and again that American taxpayers
are footing a disproportionate share of the alliance's defense bill.
   Gray said the United States is devoting about 6 percent of its
gross national product to defense while no other NATO countries
spend a little more than 3 percent.
   Carlucci agreed that ``we need to make every effort to get our
allies to do more,'' but he said they now do more than is
``generally recognized.'' For example, Carlucci said, NATO supplies
90 percent of the ground troops which would be used to halt a
Soviet attack.
   America's defense budget is 5.7 percent of the nation's GNP, not
6 percent, Carlucci said. He also noted that American defense
budgets have generally stayed even or declined in recent years.
   That wasn't good enough for Gray, who noted that the recent
reductions came atop large increases in Reagan's first term.
   NATO has long set a target for each member to increase spending
by 3 percent a year after inflation, and most nations don't meet
that target, Carluicci said. The United States hasn't met the 3
percent target for at least four years, he added.
   Both Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told the committee that NATO needs to improve its
conventional defenses in the wake of the treaty banning
medium-range atomic missiles from Europe.
   That is similar to the message Reagan is carrying to NATO allies
and echoes a theme which the administration has been pushing since
the treaty was signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Crowe detailed NATO's shortcomings in non-nuclear weapons, but
added, ``surely the prospect of having to fight 16 nations at once
remains a sobering one for the Kremlin.''
   ``But, put candidly, both the level of (nuclear) deterrence and
the nuclear threshold remain too low,'' Crowe said. ``The chiefs
have for a number of years consistently testified to that effect.''
   ``It is essential for the NATO members to correct'' the problems
in non-nuclear weapons, he said.
   At the Senate Budget Committee, Yale historian Paul Kennedy said
that U.S. allies ``ought to bear a larger share of the defense
burden'' now that they have been rebuilt with U.S. help after World
War II.
   Kennedy, author of the best-selling ``The Rise and Fall of Great
Nations,'' said the United States should spurn protectionism and
increase spending for basic technologies and for commercial
research and development.
   Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
agreed with Kennedy that U.S. allies should bear more of the
burden. But she criticized his view that there is a direct
correlation between military spending and economic growth.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the panel, noted that
``the help we gave and the protection we've given have helped
Europe and Asia grow back into power. Now, they are friendly
competitors. But while they've taken us to the woodshed in
international trade, we're the ones paying for the guards at the
woodshed door.''
   ``It seems to me we are draining our power trying to do too
much,'' said Chiles. ``Our adversaries are happy to see us try. Our
allies haven't done as much as they can to help.''

   A 16-month-old girl pushed onto a fire
ant mound by the family's dog has died of hundreds of insect bites,
officials said Tuesday.
   The bites probably would not have killed Tiffany Cheatham if she
had not had a severe allergic reaction, said her physician, Rex
Northup. She had been ``essentially comatose'' since she was
hospitalized, Northup said.
   Tiffany was declared brain dead Monday night, said Kathy Musial,
spokeswoman for Sacred Heart Hospital.
   The cause of death was anaphylactic shock in combination with
toxic poisoning, Northup said.
   Tiffany was rushed to the hospital Feb. 23 after the dog pushed
her into an ant hill near her home in Navarre, 20 miles east of
Pensacola, said Chief Don Van Derryt of the Holley-Navarre Fire and
Rescue Association.
   The girl's mother, Lynn Cheatham, and a neighbor had tried to
remove the ants, taking off Tiffany's clothes and putting her in a
bathtub, but many of the insects were entangled in her hair.

   Soldiers enforced calm in Dakar Tuesday
following a day of rioting prompted by the announcement that the
president was winning national elections. The president defended
his decision to impose a state of emergency.
   Streets were littered with stones and children played with spent
tear gas cannisters on Tuesday, a day after soldiers and riot
police battled demonstrators. Crews removed the shells of
burned-out cars from the roads.
   Riot police and soldiers were visible in much of the city,
especially in the most densely populated neighborhoods. President
Abdou Diouf met with members of his Cabinet on Tuesday to assess
the situation.
   Opponents had charged that the vote that gave Diouf his second
5-year term was rigged. The president, in a communique read over
national radio, said the voting was fair.
   The communique said Diouf imposed a state of emergency to
``guarantee the legitimate aims of the people: peace, security, and
economic and social progress.''
   In an interview with French television, Diouf also defended the
decision to arrest the leading opposition presidential candidate,
Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party.
   ``I have the impression that our adversaries, as I had feared,
are very bad losers and they had used many children in a maneuver
to try to sow disorder and violence,'' Diouf said.
   He said his actions were necessary to ``protect democracy.''
   The preliminary tally showed Diouf with 688,476 votes to Wade's
299,998. Two other candidates got less than 10,000 votes. The
Supreme Court in this West African nation will announce the
official results Friday.
   Radio broadcasts announcing that Diouf was receiving about 77
percent of the vote sparked widespread demonstrations Monday in the
capital.
   The headquarters of Wade's party, which was scene of
considerable violence on Monday, was quiet. The government said
Wade and other opposition leaders were being questioned about the
riots.
   More than 260 people were believed to have been arrested during
the violence Monday.
   Dakar's Cheikh Anta Diop University also remained closed and
riot police stood guard at several of the entrances.
   A week before the election, Wade had said his party would become
a liberation movement if the voting was rigged. On election day
Sunday and again on Monday, Wade and other opposition leaders
accused Diouf's Socialist Party of providing its supporters with
cards to allow them to vote several times.
   Diouf was widely expected to win re-election. Opposition
supporters view his government as a continuation of the leadership
in Senegal since it achieved independence from France in 1960.
Diouf succeeded President Leopold Senghor when Senghor retired in
January 1981.
   In another development, Director of Communications Tidiane
Ndiongue apologized to a photographer who works for The Associated
Press and was arrested for seven hours during Monday's riots.
   The photographer, Axel Schulz-Ebbers of West Germany, said he
was picked up outside opposition party headquarters and beaten.
Ndiongue said the Ministry of Information had informed police that
accredited journalists were allowed to report on the disturbances.
   Diouf's government has been praised by the United States and
other Western nations for maintaining a multiparty system, a rarity
in Africa. Diouf also has been pro-Western in international forums.

   A record-low number of rare right whales was
spotted during an annual survey off the coasts of Georgia and
Florida, the New England Aquarium said Tuesday.
   An aquarium team that spent February surveying the right whale
population in their popular wintering grounds detected only one
mother-calf pair and five whales traveling separately.
   The total was three below the previous low of 10 in 1984, said
aquarium researcher Scott Kraus. The highest number spotted during
the five years the survey has been conducted off the Florida and
Georgia coasts was 26 in 1986, Kraus said.
   He said it was premature to speculate on reasons for the
apparent decline in the right whale population in the Georgia and
Florida waters, which are considered popular calving grounds.
   ``We don't know whether the numbers are low because of a local
problem that kept the whales away from that area,'' said Kraus.
``Or they may be somewhere down there and we are missing them.''
   Kraus said there were reports the water temperature had been
abnormally high this winter. But he said it was not clear if that
caused the whales to winter elsewhere.
   The aquarium will match the winter survey numbers with those
recorded next spring when the whales return to waters from Maine to
Nova Scotia. That should help determine whether the right whale
population has declined or if the whales chose a new location to
spend the winter, Kraus said.
   The surveys have been conducted in North Atlantic waters for
nine years and this was the fifth year of the survey off Florida
and Georgia.
   The four prior surveys there have found right whales prefer to
winter in waters five to 20 miles off the Georgia coast and within
two miles of the beaches of northeast Florida.
   Right whales are considered the rarest of the large whale
species. The worldwide right whale population is estimated at
2,500. It it is believed that 240 to 350 live in the North Atlantic.
   There are three types of right whales, which are known for their
unusually large heads. The type found in the North Atlantic are
Black Right Whales, which have black bodies and sometimes with
white areas on the belly. Black Right Whales grow up to 60 feet
long.

   Morning rush-hour was quiet Tuesday as a massive
rebuilding job began on one of the nation's busiest freeways, a
project that had state highway officials ready for the worst.
   The $210 million overhaul will widen the Dan Ryan Expressway
from eight to 10 lanes, and while work is under way _ for six-month
periods both this year and next year _ traffic will be squeezed
into half the normal number of lanes.
   On Tuesday several lanes were closed on each side of the freeway
for building crossovers and making surface repairs.
   Commuters and traffic experts have feared that the project could
create massive traffic jams because the highway is one of the
nation's busiest, carrying 225,000 cars daily, but things went
smoothly early Monday.
   ``The congestion was apparently zilch,'' said Ed Nash, a
spokesman for the Illinois Department of Transportation. ``The Ryan
was clear the whole morning and there was no buildup of traffic.''
   The state had conducted a months-long publicity campaign, urging
commuters to use alternate routes, car pool or take public
transportation. The Chicago Area Transportation Study distributed
37,000 ride-sharing applications and doubled its list of car-pool
applicants to 6,000.
   State officials say the overhaul of the three-mile stretch will
greatly improve the commute on the 11-mile freeway.
   The work will cost more than the $179.7 million it took to build
road 25 years ago.

   A defense attorney attacked the
credibility of a pilot testifying Tuesday in the smuggling trial of
Carlos Lehder Rivas, winning an admission that the man continued
trafficking drugs while cooperating with the government.
   Leverett Francis, 66, testified Monday that he made six cocaine
flights in 1979. Those flights, made with admitted smuggler Ed
Ward, are those listed in the indictment of Lehder, 38, and
co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed.
   Lehder, reputed to be one of the leaders of Colombia's violent
Medellin Cartel of cocaine smugglers, is on trial on charges that
he and others conspired to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine into the
United States from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas from
1978 to 1980.
   Under cross-examination Tuesday by defense attorney Jose Quinon,
Francis admitted he conducted other smuggling activity while we was
cooperating with the government and testifying before a grand jury
in 1980. Francis is testifying under immunity from prosecution.
   He said he made flights to Jamaica for other people in 1980,
bringing in either hashish or marijuana.
   Francis, a former Navy pilot, bristled when Quinon used the word
`lie' when discussing inconsistent statements in his testimony and
his grand jury appearances eight years ago.
   ``I don't like the word, `lie.' I looked it up in the dictionary
last night and I suggest you do the same,'' he told Quinon.
   Quinon laboriously questioned Francis about his grand jury
testimony in 1980 and many times Tuesday Francis said he couldn't
remember what he said in 1980.
   ``I'm sure the grand jury testimony as a whole is correct,''
Francis said.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged only with being a part of
the smuggling conspiracy.
   Defense attorneys and prosecutors got into several exchanges
Tuesday out of the jury's presence.
   After one of a number of bench conferences with the judge,
defense attorney Ed Shohat accused U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle
of saying to him: ``You're going to sleaze yourself right into a
hole, mister.''
   Shohat called Merkle's remarks ``patently offensive.''
   Merkle, however, argued that he made the comment to Assistant
U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller and said: ``They're (defense attorneys)
going to sleaze themselves into a hole.''
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton said he didn't plan to take
any action and told the attorneys to present the exchange to a
grievance committee if they desired to do so.

   A middle-aged gunman riding on a motorbike
fatally wounded the chief executive officer of a Greek chemical
company as he was driving to work Tuesday. A left-wing group
claimed responsibility.
   A police spokesman said Alexandros Athanassiadis, 59, was hit
four times in the chest and stomach as he reached for a pistol that
he kept in his car.
   The shooting took place at 8:15 a.m. in rush-hour traffic on
Kifissias Avenue, a main highway leading north from the city
center, according to the spokesman, who was not identified in line
with police regulations.
   He said the attack was ``a carbon copy'' of the 1983 killing of
Capt. George Tsantes, a U.S. Navy officer attached to the American
Embassy who was shot by two men on a motorbike at the same
Kifissias Avenue intersection.
   And the same terrorist group, the November 17 organization,
asserted responsibility for both slayings.
   The spokesman gave this account of Tuesday's attack.
   ``Athanassiadis had the passenger window down and was chatting
to someone in another car at a red light when two men on a
motorbike came up on his right-hand side.
   ``A white-haired man in his 50s'' riding behind the younger,
dark-haired driver fired at least six bullets at Athanassiadis from
a 45-caliber pistol.
   The two men turned down down a side road into the Psychico
suburb where the motorbike was found abandoned.
   Athanassiadis died at the Hygeia Hospital during emergency
surgery, Dr. Vassilis Georgoulis said.
   A typewritten note found in the street near the intersection and
signed ``November 17'' said Athanassiadis was ``a classic
capitalist ... indifferent to the health of the workers and the
environment.''
   Athanassiadis was chief executive officer of Hellenic Chemical
Products and Fertilizers and also was a director of Greece's
largest holding group, the non-profit Bodossakis Foundation.
   He had headed Pyrkal, an ammunition and explosives manufacturing
firm, until it was taken over by Premier Andreas Papandreou's
socialist government in 1982.
   The note claimed that a Hellenic Chemical Products plant in
western Athens that Athanassiadis planned to expand ``holds one of
the largest responsibilities'' for air pollution in the capital.
   November 17 terrorists have asserted responsibility for 10 other
killings since 1975. None of the slayings has been solved.
   It also boasted of carrying out the remote-control bombings of
two buses carrying U.S. military personnel in April and August 1987
that wounded 26 Americans and three Greeks.
   Other business executives said Athanassiadis maintained a low
profile, refused to hire bodyguards and always drove his own car.
   ``He kept a pistol beside him in the car ever since learning
that he was probably on the November 17 hit list,'' said one
businessmen, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal.
   It was the first fatal attack by November 17 terrorists since
February 1986 when steel magnate Dimitris Angelopoulos was shot
while walking to work in central Athens.
   November 17 is named for the day in 1973 that troops crushed a
student rebellion against the military dictatorship that ruled
Greece from 1967-74.
   In its previous declarations the group demanded the closure of
U.S. military bases in Greece and said the government had failed to
reform Greek society.

saying ``the Greek people as a whole condemn such terrorist
actions.''

   The cars of the White Pass & Yukon
Railroad will roll along the gold rush Trail of '98 this spring for
the first time in more than five years, officials said Tuesday.
   The railroad plans to reopen May 12 as a seasonal tourist line
out of Skagway, said Marvin Taylor, vice president and chief
executive officer for the White Pass & Yukon Corp. Ltd.
   ``Everything is a go,'' Taylor said in a conference call from
Skagway. ``We anticipate 50,000 passengers this first year.''
   For a $65 ticket, tourists will get a 3{-hour, 40.8-mile round
trip to the peak of the White Pass. Most of the route shadows the
Deadhorse Trail, which miners followed into the Klondike gold
fields in 1898.
   The railroad took the place of the trail in 1900 and ran until
October 1982, carrying passengers and freight the 110 miles between
Skagway and Whitehorse, capital of the Yukon Territory.
   The line closed after losing its freight business during a
worldwide mining slump. The 800 people of Skagway lost 150 railroad
jobs; Whitehorse lost 50.
   White Pass is trying to sell its freight equipment, and Taylor
said unless there's an unforeseen development boom in Whitehorse,
it's unlikely the full line will reopen.
   But tourism may prompt further expansion in 1989 and after,
Taylor said.
   The line will stop short of the Canadian border this year
because the railroad did not have time to negotiate the crossing.
   The reopening was assured when the Alaska Teamsters and United
Transportation unions agreed Monday to contract concessions, Taylor
said. The primary concession allows the train to run with
three-person crews instead of the traditional five-person crew used
on freight lines, he said.
   The May-through-September business will employ more than 20
people during the season and four to six people year-around, Taylor
said.
   It will cost about $1 million to get the line running by May 12,
he said.
   The line itself is in fairly good condition, but the passenger
cars need substantial renovation, he said. The railroad plans to
run up to four round trips a day, carrying an average of 250
passengers each.

   President Reagan, urging Western
solidarity in arms talks with the Soviets, arrived Tuesday for the
first NATO summit in six years after pledging that U.S. troops will
remain in Europe ``so long as Europeans want them to stay.''
   After Air Force One touched down on the tarmac at Brussels
Zavantem Airport in windy conditions, Reagan was reunited with
Secretary of State George Shultz, who had arrived from London, and
met briefly with Belgian officials.
   In a gesture of reassurance given in a departure statement
Tuesday morning at the White House, Reagan pledged that American
troops will remain in Europe ``so long as Europeans want them to
stay.''
   He also promised to protect NATO's interests in any arms deals
with the Soviet Union. ``We will never sacrifice the interests of
this partnership in any agreement with the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   After stepping down the ramp from his Boeing 707 jetliner,
Reagan smiled and chatted amiably as he was greeted by Shultz, who
had just arrived from a talks Jordan's King Hussein. Also on hand
were Belgium's prime minister, Wilfried Martens, and Foreign
Minister Leo Tindemans.
   Posing for pictures at the airport, Reagan said he was still
troubled by congestion and cold-like symptons that had bothered him
in Washington. ``The allergies are still bothering me,'' Reagan
said, adding in an aside to Shultz that his ears were stopped up
after the long flight. Reagan coughed loudly as reporters were
ushered from the room.
   Following a five-minute courtesy get-together with Tindemans in
an airport salon, Reagan was ferried by motorcade for an overnight
stay at Chateau Stuyvenberg, a 1840 brick and stone palace one used
as the favored residence of the Belgian royal family.
   His motorcade _ extending nearly 20 cars _ included the now
standard anti-sniper team and Reagan's armored limousine and a
backup flown in from Washington, complete with District of Columbia
license plates.
   The two-day meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels, beginning
Wednesday, brings together the heads of state or government of the
16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The conference sets
the stage for Reagan's expected summit in Moscow with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in late May or early June.
   With the NATO headquarters site under unusually tight security,
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was the first to arrive. The
representatives of 14 other countries were scheduled to arrive
Wednesday.
   In his departure statement, Reagan hailed the newly signed
treaty to abolish U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear
missiles (INF), but said, ``the purpose of this summit is not
self-congratulations.''
   ``Our first priority is to maintain a strong and healthy
partnership between North America and Europe, for this is the
foundation on which the cause of freedom so crucially depends,'' he
said.
   Reagan said the United States will continue to press for a 50
percent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons and a global ban on
chemical weapons.
   Beyond that, he said the NATO leaders will try ``to give
negotiations on conventional forces a new start, as well.''
   ``If our common approach to the East over the years has given
coherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has been
our unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given it
credibility,'' Reagan said.
   ``Arms reduction can only succeed if it is backed up by a strong
defense,'' he added. ``My Atlantic colleagues and I will rededicate
ourselves to maintaining the deterrent that has protected our
freedom and prosperity for almost 40 years.''
   The NATO session opens Wednesday with remarks by Britain's Lord
Carrington, the NATO secretary general, followed by two restricted
working sessions, a luncheon and dinner.
   Another restricted working session is planned Thursday, followed
by closing remarks by Carrington and Reagan, and a news conference
by Shultz, who broke off his shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East
to join the president in Brussels.
   Besides the United States, the members of the alliance are
Canada, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Denmark,
Greece, Norway, Iceland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Turkey and
The Netherlands.
   Alton G. Keel, the U.S. NATO ambassador, said on the eve of the
summit that he thought the leaders would likely declare that NATO
places a high priority on negotiating conventional arms stability
in Europe.
   Alliance sources, declining to be identified publicly, have said
that such a declaration may be in addition to an overall statement
which will boil down to a renewed pledge of confidence in NATO
policies and goals.
   It is hoped the new conventional talks can begin in earnest in
the fall in Vienna.
   ``There's a general consensus now'' on key elements of NATO's
negotiating position, namely, that cuts should be ``assymetric'' in
view of the Warsaw Pact's large numerical advantage in conventional
firepower, according to Keel.
   The summit is designed to be a public display of alliance
solidarity despite peace and disarmament gestures from the Soviet
Union.
   It also is intended to reassure Europeans that the INF agreement
will not leave them vulnerable to superior numbers of Warsaw Pact
tanks and artillery.
   The budget crunch in the United States has triggered some fears
in NATO about a possible reduction in the 326,000 American troops
stationed in Western Europe.
   Planners on both sides of the Atlantic said the leaders planned
to play down disagreements, such as the updating of NATO's
short-range nuclear arms, most of which are deployed by the United
States in West Germany, and disputes over basing U.S. forces in
Europe.
   Despite the U.S. role as the leader and paymaster of NATO,
Reagan will play a low-key role in public at the two-day meeting,
delivering only a brief summary statement at the close on Thursday.
   In all, the schedule called for Reagan to be away from
Washington only 57 and one-half hours, including 15 hours and 15
minutes on Air Force One flying to and from Brussels.
   He will return Thursday evening, in plenty of time to celebrate
his 36th wedding annivesary Friday with his wife, Nancy.
   Reagan's themes for the meeting were carefully sketched out in
advance in a series of public remarks, including an address
broadcast to Europe last week and a speech on Monday to an American
Legion convention.
   He warned that the West must remain vigilant about the Soviet
Union and be skeptical about its intentions. Reagan also said NATO
must keep nuclear forces in place and up to date.
   The president said the Warsaw Pact's numerical superiority in
non-nuclear forces _ the so-called conventional forces _ must be
addressed with the same urgency as the problem of strategic nuclear
weapons.
   And he suggested that NATO members should pay a greater share of
the alliance's defense burden.
   Testifying to the House Budget Committee Tuesday, Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci said America's NATO allies should spend
more money for defense. But he also said that congressional
denunciation of alliance partners is not the best way to get that
done.
   ``I quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to do
more,'' Carlucci said. But he added that ``I don't think it is very
useful to simply berate the Europeans on this.''

<TEXT>
   An Air Force plan to spend $6.1 million
on World War II-style leather jackets to boost flight crews' esprit
de corps is drawing flak from civilians and retirees affected by
budget cuts.
   ``I'm upset with this leather-jacket bit,'' Hugh Enyart, a
retired Air Force major who now lives in nearby Fairview Heights,
said Tuesday. ``If we have to measure our patriotism by whether or
not we have leather jackets, God help us, we're in trouble.''
   About 280 of the 53,000 ``bomber'' jackets will go to flight
crews with the Military Airlift Command at Scott Air Force Base.
   ``To me it doesn't reflect the professionalism of the Air
Force,'' said Enyart, a former official of the Air Force
Association, a national organization that works to promote a strong
national defense.
   ``It reflects a bunch of people wanting leather jackets,'' he
said.
   The nation's armed services were ordered in November to slash 10
percent from their budgets for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
The Air Force share of the reductions for the year amount to about
$10.5 billion. Smaller custs were ordered for the current fiscal
year.
   Critics say the jackets, which cost $115 each, are a prime
example of waste.
   Enyart said he had received calls from about 20 people _
civilians as well as active and retired Air Force personnel _
supporting his stance after local reports about his criticism of
the jacket purchases during a time of budget austerity.
   Wide-ranging spending reductions throughout the Air Force
include curtailment of equipment purchases and personnel cuts. Even
retirees' medical benefits have been reduced, Enyart said.
   A hiring freeze has been in effect at Scott's Military Airlift
Command since Dec. 8, and last month, an undetermined number of
temporary part-time civilian jobs were eliminated at Scott.
   On Tuesday, the base's command began offering voluntary early
retirement to eligible civilian workers.
   The jacket purchases should be cut before jobs, said Carl
Denton, an official of the National Association of Government
Employees' Local R7-23, which represents about 3,000 civilian
workers at Scott.
   ``It would seem to me that people putting hamburger on their
table should come before they (Air Force officials) put a new
jacket on a pilot's back,'' he said.
   The Air Force sees it differently.
   ``The Air Force plans to issue these flying jackets to primary
crew members in order to enhance esprit de corps and to recognize
the Air Force's front-line pilots, navigators, weapons officers and
enlisted crew members for their important contributions to the
nation's defense,'' said a statement Tuesday from Military Airlift
Command officials at Scott.
   The Air Force plans to distribute the jackets to active and
reserve forces.
   The jackets are to be purchased during the 1988 and 1989 fiscal
years, officials say. Delivering them to flight crews is expected
to take about a year, beginning in June.

<TEXT>
   Walden Pond, the retreat idealized by Henry David
Thoreau in 1845, is at the center of a debate over whether it
should be preserved or whether it should, as Thoreau wrote,
``belong to the public.''
   The Legislature's Natural Resources Committee declined Tuesday
to adopt a bill that would ban swimming at Walden in Concord, 15
miles west of Boston.
   The bill would eliminate a manmade sand beach, restrict fishing
and boating and require construction of sound barriers beside
nearby roadways. Instead, committee members said they would
consider expanding membership on the pond's citizen advisory panel.
   ``Fencing off Walden Pond and banning swimming would be contrary
to both the philosophy of Thoreau and the wishes of the owners who
gave the property to the state,'' Department of Environmental
Management Commissioner James Gutensohn told the committee.
   ``I'm sure the Indians swam at Walden Pond, I'm sure Henry David
Thoreau swam at Walden Pond and I'm sure the people of Boston
should,'' Gutensohn said.
   The chief opponent of continued recreation at Walden, Mary
Sherwood of Connecticut, did not attend the hearing though the
legislation was sponsored by her group, Walden Forever Wild Inc.
   Sherwood, a former Concord resident, said in a telephone
interview that 50 years of public recreation at the pond have
endangered its fragile banks and spoiled a pristine site.
   ``They've turned it into another Coney Island,'' Sherwood said.
She charged DEM officials with spending their spare time scouring
Thoreau's writings looking for a quotation that would support
public recreation at the pond.
   Gutensohn did slip a Thoreau quotation into his remarks. The
19th-century naturalist philosopher said, ``As in many countries
precious metals belong to the crown, so here more precious natural
objects of rare beauty should belong to the public.''
   A state pamphlet on the pond quotes Thoreau as writing in his
``Journal'' in 1850, ``When the frogs dream and the grass waves,
and the buttercups toss their heads, and the heat disposes to bathe
in the ponds and streams, then is summer begun.''
   Gutensohn said that the deed from the Forbes, Heywood and
Emerson families bequeathing Walden to the state in 1922 specified
that it be preserved ``for the public who wish to enjoy the pond,
the woods and nature, including bathing, boating, fishing and
picnicking.''
   Today the 62-acre pond in a 333-acre reservation receives
350,000 visitors a year. On summer weekends crowds frequently
exceed its rated capacity of 1,000 visitors, according to Don
Faron, supervisor of the reservation.
   State officials acknowledge that Walden took a beating when
little was done to prevent visitors from causing erosion and much
done to render the pond unrecognizable to its 19th-century admirers.
   ``Anytime you have a first-class resource you have a threat of
overuse,'' said Stuart Weinreb, the state's project manager for the
pond.
   In the 13 years that the DEM has controlled Walden, the state
has spent $2 million on projects to upgrade and preserve the site.
Another $500,000 has been set aside for restoring the banks of the
pond. Gutensohn said the money will cover about half of the
restoration job.
   In addition, the state plans to limit parking around the pond to
keep down summertime attendance.

<HEAD>Cuba Has Battlefield Missiles, But They Aren't Nukes, Officials
Say</HEAD>

   The Cuban military has some surface-to-surface
missiles in its inventory, but none has a nuclear warhead and none
could reach the United States even if they did, U.S. officials said
Tuesday.
   The defense and administration officials commented under
questioning prompted by Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson's continued insistence, in the face of denials, that Cuba
may have Soviet-made nuclear missiles aimed at the United States.
   The officials said Cuba has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7
battlefield missiles, date to the 1960s.
   The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, could
carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, ``but we're
confident no nuclear warheads ever went to Cuba for that missile
and it doesn't have any range anyway,'' said one source who
requested anonymity.
   According to the reference book ``Jane's Weapon Systems,'' the
Frog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distance
between Cuba and Florida. Moreover, the rocket has no guidance
system to direct it to a specific target.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed Robertson's
missile claim when the candidate first advanced it last month. He
said Cuba had been under extensive surveillance since the 1962
missile crisis and there was ``no evidence'' any other nuclear
weaponry had ever been deployed there by the Soviet Union.
   The officials contacted Tuesday endorsed that assessment, but
most insisted they not be identified on grounds they wished to
avoid entanglement in the presidential race.
   The sources said Cuban President Fidel Castro long ago assembled
the strongest military in the Caribbean, but they said his forces
posed little offensive threat to the United States.
   On the other hand, they said, Cuba does serve as a major outpost
for Soviet forces, particularly surveillance units, and it supports
communist movements around the world from Nicaragua to Angola and
Ethiopia.
   ``Cuba is a horrible force for instability, but it is not a
military threat to us directly,'' said one Pentagon official.
   ``And it is certainly not a nuclear threat. They do not have any
missiles that could reach the United States _ nuclear or
conventional _ and they do not have any nuclear bombs to hang on
the jets that could reach us.''
   ``Cuba's military power has not appreciably increased in recent
years,'' said one administration official. ``Rather, their forces
have been modernized to keep pace.''
   ``In overall terms, they really are not any more of a direct
military threat to us than they were 10 years ago,'' said another
source. ``It's serving as the host to the Russians that bothers
us.''
   Navy Cmdr. Robert Prucha, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense
Department endorsed the most recent assessment of Cuban military
power published by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies in London. According to that assessment, the Cubans have an
active-duty military force of approximately 175,000, of which
145,000 are in the army, 12,000 in the navy and 18,500 in the air
force.
   Within the army, the Pentagon believes the Cubans have about 65
of the Frog missiles, Prucha said. Also in the Cuban inventory:

<TEXT>
   _A wide variety of Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles that
could be used against attacking aircraft, as well as short-range
artillery rockets like the BM-21 and BM-24.
   _About 950 tanks, including 300 of the more capable T-62 tanks,
and at least 50 BMP infantry combat vehicles.
   _Two Koni-class navy frigates made by the Soviet Union, along
with three diesel submarines, 77 fast-attack patrol boats and 15
mine sweepers.
   _More than 250 Soviet-supplied combat aircraft, including at
least 50 modern MiG-23 Flogger ground-attack jets and more than 100
MiG-21 jet interceptors.
   Three years ago, Adm. Wesley McDonald, then the head of the U.S.
Atlantic Command, described Cuba's forces as well equipped ``to
defend Cuba against anything short of a massive invasion.''
   He said the Cuban air force _ with aircraft like the MiG-25s _
had ``the range to reach portions of the southeastern U.S.A. and
most of the Caribbean Sea area.''
   ``But that doesn't mean they have anything nuclear to hang on
those planes,'' said one Pentagon source. ``We maintain constant
surveillance on Cuba, including SR-71 (spy plane) reconnaissance.
   ``Everything that goes in to Cuba is monitored, and nuclear
weapons haven't gone in.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William H. Webster spoke out
Tuesday against efforts to place an independent watchdog at his
agency like those already in place at 19 other federal departments.
   Webster said a proposal by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., to place
an independent inspector general at the spy agency ``will actually
prove to be counterproductive to an effective inspection and
investigation process.''
   He told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the presence of
an investigator with access to personnel and secret records could
deter foreign intelligence services and other sensitive sources
from sharing information with CIA, fearing its possible disclosure.
   The proposal for an independent inspector general at the CIA
grew out of last summer's Iran-Contra investigation, which found
the agency's current inspector general ``lacked the manpower,
resources and tenacity'' to uncover many of the abuses turned up
during that probe.
   The current inspector general is chosen by the agency's director
and lacks the institutional independence of the IG post at most
other federal departments. The post is now held by William
Donnelly, a 33-year CIA veteran appointed by Webster.
   Specter, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said the panel
is unable to oversee the agency as thoroughly as an in-house
watchdog would be able to do. He noted that other departments with
sensitive intelligence operations, like the Pentagon and the State
Department, have independent investigators inside their
bureaucracies.
   Specter's bill would permit the CIA director to deny
investigators access to documents or personnel if needed to protect
sensitive secrets or an active covert operation. But the director
would have to defend such an action to the congressional
intelligence committees.
   Both June Gibbs Brown, the Pentagon's inspector general, and
Sherman M. Funk, inspector general at the State Department,
testified they have had no problems with disclosure of classified
information.
   Charles Bowsher, director of the General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative arm, said a review of inspector general
operations government-wide had found they substantially strengthen
accountability and improve operations.
   ``We believe that a statutory IG would be as appropriate and
effective for the CIA as it has been for the other agencies,''
Bowsher said.
   And he said he was concerned that making a tour of duty in the
inspector general's office a part of routine career development for
CIA employees, as Webster proposed, would further rob the office of
independence.
   Specter said that while he did not doubt Webster's good
intentions, ``the problem is that you're not going to always be
director of the CIA. Our memories are fresh about a director of the
CIA who did not always forward information to this committee'' _ an
apparent reference to William J. Casey, Webster's predecessor.

   Democratic presidential candidate Richard
Gephardt, described as ``middle America at its very best,''
received the endorsement Tuesday of two former governors of South
Carolina.
   Standing in the sun-bathed steps of the state Capitol, the
Missouri congressman told supporters the nation's future depended
on ``our ability to gain control of our economic destiny.''
   Former governors Robert McNair and Richard Riley defended the
candidate against charges that his trade program was protectionist.
   McNair said Gephardt ``has faced up to putting America first
with a fair, sound and sensible trade bill. One who believes if
we're going to open our markets up, you open your markets up.''
   McNair said the Gephardt bill was ``not a protectionist piece of
legislation, as some have tried to portray it, but it is what's
best for this country.''
   ``He's not a protectionist at all,'' said Riley. ``He's a
pragmatist.''
   Riley, who served as governor from 1977 to 1985, said of
Gephardt, ``He's middle America at its very best.''
   Gephardt said he supported legislation that would limit the
growth of textile imports to 1 percent a year.
   An estimated 45 percent of the jobs in South carolina are in the
textile industry.
   The import restriction legislation is an issue in the Republican
as well as Democratic race.
   Republicans Bob Dole and Pat Robertson, campaigning for support
in the South Carolina GOP primary this Saturday support the bill.
GOP rivals George Bush and Jack Kemp oppose it.
   ``For people here to have the kind of opportunity we all want,
we have to have a new trade policy,'' said Gephardt.
   ``This is a state that had a great textile industry, a great
fabric industry,'' he went on. ``That industry is in trouble, has
been in trouble in part because we have not had leadership and
policies at the federal level that will guarantee fair treatment
for the textile workers and the textile companies here in South
Carolina.''
   The Missouri congressman said that as president he would press
for policies that ``will give the textile workers of South Carolina
an equal right to sell their products in markets all over the
country and give them the right to not be impacted by unfair trade
practices by countries all over the world.''
   Gephardt's campaign manager Bill Carrick described Riley, who
was governor of South Carolina from 1977 to 1985, as a leader of
the progressive wing of the Democratic Party in the state.
   He said McNair, who was governor from 1965 to 1971, was a leader
of the ore conservative wing of the party.
   He said their dual backing was ``a nice little bookend
endorsement.''
   Earlier Tuesday, Gephardt visited former President Carter in
Plains, Ga. Carter made it clear that with fellow Georgian Sam Nunn
not in the race he had no plans to endorse any of the Democratic
presidential candidates before the nominating convention next July.

while thunderstorms dumped hail in Oklahoma.
   Snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 6
inches at Blue Canyon, Calif., and 1 inch at Austin, Nev. Crescent
City, Calif., received .87 inch of rain.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted Tuesday afternoon for
portions of southwestern Oklahoma and northwestern Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed across south-central

   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10 degrees at Massena,
N.Y., to 86 degrees at McAllen, Texas. The nation's cold spot
Tuesday morning was Pellston, Mich., with a low of 16 degrees below
zero.
   For Wednesday, the National Weather Service forecast calls for
rain in the lower Great Lakes, Michigan, the lower Ohio Valley and
southern Illinois. Showers and occasional thunderstorms will reach
from Missouri across northern Louisiana and northern Mississippi,

   The Reagan administration on Tuesday called
attacks on Iranian and Iraqi cities a dangerous development in the
Persian Gulf war and adds ``a new urgency'' to United Nations work
on an arms embargo designed to force a truce.
   Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, condemned the
missile raids and said they represent ``a serious escalation of the
Iran-Iraq war.''
   ``Attacks on civilians achieve no military end,'' she said.
``They fuel the psychology of hatred which is responsible for
continuing this destructive conflict.''
   Iraq said Tuesday it fired 16 missiles into Tehran. It was the
first long-range rocket attack on the Iranian capital since the war
began in September 1980. Iran said 27 civilians were killed.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iran hit Baghdad with two
missiles late Tuesday night, killing or wounding an unspecified
number of civilians.
   Last July, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 598
calling for a truce in the war and pledging to impose an arms
embargo against either party that refused to heed the call. Iraq
has said it would accept a cease-fire but Iran has declined to go
along and the United States has been pressing the world body to
impose the weapons ban on Iran.
   ``We believe adoption of an arms embargo resolution to enforce
598 has taken a new urgency with the renewal of the war of the
cities,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``We urge all members of the Security Council to act on this
now, without further delay, particularly permament members who have
special responsibilities to provide leadership,'' she said.
   She was referring to the Soviet Union, said another State
Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States offered a compromise last week in an effort to
satisfy U.S. demands for quick passage of a U.N. resolution against
Iran and meet a Soviet desire for more diplomacy by U.N. Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar, the official said.
   It would permit immediate passage of an embargo followed by a
30-day delay in implementation and another peace effort by Perez de
Cuellar.
   The official said that in response to U.S. pressure to accept
the compromise, the Soviet envoy to the Security Council, Alexander
M. Belonogov has said he is awaiting a decision from Moscow.
   On March 1, the rotating chairmanship of the Security Council
will pass from the United States to Yugoslavia.
   Mrs. Oakley said an arms embargo ``will make it more difficult
for Iran to pursue the war,'' but will not mean an end to the
conflict if Iran desires to continue the fight.
   Negotiations between Iran and Iraq will also be necessary, she
said.

<DATELINE>AMIENS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of a comatose man who was used
as a human guinea pig filed suit Tuesday against the doctor who
carried out the experiment.
   Pascal Louette, 24, who went into a deep coma following an auto
accident, died Sunday after Dr. Alain Milhaud placed him on a
sabotaged medical device to see if the effects matched those of a
similar case, currently the subject of a trial in Poitiers.
   Louette was considered clinically dead at the time of the
experiment, which was performed at the Regional Hospital Center of
Amiens.
   News of the experiment was made public a week ago and touched
off a furor in France.
   Health Minister Michele Barzach suspended Milhaud on Feb. 24
from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital center.
   The Louette family's lawyer, Alain Lhote, said his clients filed
suit against Milhaud for ``willful injury of a person unable to
defend himself because of his mental or physical state.''
   ``One can't treat a human being in the way Pascal was treated,''
said Lhote.
   He said Louette's parents were not properly informed about the
medical care their son was receiving and suffered ``a double
traumatism: the loss of a loved one and also the theft of a soul
which was stolen from them.''
   The exact date of the experiment hasn't been made public. It was
announced Feb. 23 in court testimony at the Poitiers trial. Louette
was injured late last year and transferred to the Regional Hospital
Center on Jan. 19. He fell into a deep coma shortly thereafter and
was kept alive on a respirator.
   Milhaud's experiment was prompted by a trial of three physicians
in Poitiers, accused in connection with the 1984 death of a woman
following an operation to remove a tumor.
   The woman, Nicole Berneron, received nitrogen oxide instead of
oxygen during resuscitation after the operation. A report later
showed the tubes supplying the two gases had been switched.
   The state prosecutor on Tuesday asked for 15-year prison terms
each for Drs. Bakari Diallo and Denis Archambeau, both
anesthesiologists. He did not ask for a specific sentence for Dr.
Pierre Desforges-Meriel, charged with involuntary homicide.

   Singer-actress Bette Midler and her husband have
bought a 38-acre property on Kauai Island that the federal
government confiscated in a drug case.
   U.S. Marshal Faith Evans said Midler and her husband, Martin von
Haselberg, paid $1.5 million cash for the parcel, which includes a
partly completed tri-level home and a panoramic view of the Pacific
Ocean and a river.
   The property, situated near Kilauea, was among 141 acres seized
by the Justice Department in 1986 after authorities charged that
the owners bought it with money from illegal drug sales, Evans said.
   Midler grew up in Hawaii and attended the University of Hawaii
before moving to New York to pursue her career.

   Pornographic film star John Holmes was
questioned again by police in the unsolved 1981 bludgeoning murders
of four people as he lay gravely ill in a hospital bed, officials
said Wednesday.
   Holmes, who starred as Johnny Wadd in a series of sex films in
the 1970s and early 1980s, is suffering from AIDS, the Los Angeles
Times reported Tuesday, quoting anonymous sources.
   Holmes' attorney, Mitchell Egers, said Wednesday that his client
did not answer the questions.
   Egers confirmed that Holmes was hospitalized with a serious
illness but refused to say if he suffered from AIDS. Rumors that
Holmes was suffering from AIDS have been circulating in the
pornographic film industry for about a year.
   The incurable ailment usually is transmitted through sex, shared
hypodermic needles, tainted blood products and from pregnant women
to their babies.
   Holmes was acquitted in 1982 of the 1981 bludgeon murders of
four people in the exclusive hillside community of Laurel Canyon.
The crime remains unsolved.
   However, the Times said a new witness had surfaced and was in
custody out of state. That, combined with Holmes' illness, prompted
police to re-question him in his hospital bed, the newspaper said.
   Detective Tom Lange, supervisor of the murder investigation,
would say only that the case remained active.
   Holmes, 43, the premier male sex film star of the 1970s and
early 1980s, made hundreds of sexually explicit films and thousands
of peep shows.
   He was featured as the detective Johnny Wadd in films such as
``Tell Them Johnny Wadd Is Here,'' ``Liquid Lips'' and ``Blonde
Fire.''
   Holmes was cleared in 1982 of killing Ronald Launius, 37;
William DeVerell, 44; Barbara Richardson, 22; and Joy Miller, 46,
all of whom were beaten to death.
   Prosecutors said the four were part of a theft ring for which
Holmes acted as a middleman to Los Angeles nightclub owner Adel
Nasrallah, also known as Eddie Nash. Holmes allegedly fenced stolen
property for the group to Nash, who allegedly paid for the loot
with drugs.
   Nash was sentenced later to eight years in prison for possession
of two pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $1 million. He was
released after serving less than two years.

   President Reagan brought more to Europe
Tuesday than just a message of Western military solidarity. Air
Force One ferried in three pizzas for NATO Ambassador Alton Keel.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who accompanied Reagan
to Brussels on Air Force One, told reporters the pizzas were
purchased in a suburb of Washington, D.C, by deputy White House
chief of staff Kennethy Duberstein.
   Fitzwater described Keel, a former acting national security

<HEAD>Major U.S. Jewish Groups Distancing Selves From PLO Mission
Closure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major American Jewish groups said Tuesday
they have distanced themselves from the U.S. government's hotly
contested move to close the PLO observer mission to the United
Nations.
   ``They (U.S. officials) are not doing this at the request of the
American Jewish community,'' said Phil Baum, associate executive
director of the American Jewish Congress.
   Anti-terrorism legislation ordering the Palestine Liberation
Organization's mission closed by March 21 has put the United States
in an isolated position at the United Nations. An emergency General
Assembly session is under way on the mission's future.
   Scores of speakers, including close U.S. allies, called the move
a threat to the independence of the United Nations and asked the
United States to submit the dispute to binding arbitration.
   The State Department and the United Nations both say closing the
mission would violate the 1947 treaty under which the U.N.
headquarters is based in the United States. But Attorney General
Edwin Meese III reportedly is going to enforce the legislation.
   The State Department tried to head off the legislation, but
major Jewish groups supported it. They saw it as a way to get at
their main target, the PLO's Washington office, according to Baum,
Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
and others.
   ``Our hope was to induce the State Department to use the powers
it had to close the Washington office,'' Baum said. ``We wanted it
to send a symbolic message that the PLO is a terrorist organization
and it was not welcome in the United States.''
   In a meeting last year with Deputy Secretary of State John
Whitehead, the groups offered not to press for closure of the U.N.
mission if the Washington office was shuttered, the Jewish leaders
said.
   In September, the department ordered the PLO office in the
capital closed.
   Baum said his group told Meese in a Feb. 12 letter it would not
press for the U.N. mission's closure. He said Meese has not replied.
   Baum said major Jewish groups sent a similar letter to Congress
on Dec. 3.
   ``We recognized that the headquarters agreement was a
complicating factor,'' he said.
   But by then the legislation had won the support of such
presidential aspirants as Sens. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Jack Kemp
(R-N.Y.) and Paul Simon (D-Ill.)
   ``It took on the life of its own,'' Baum said.
   Several speakers in the General Assembly accused the United
States of sacrificing international commitments to the pressure of
domestic politics. They said closing the mission will further
damage U.S. prestige at the United Nations and cripple the U.S.
Middle East peace initiative.
   Arab League spokesman Clovis Maksoud on Tuesday laid much of the
blame for what he called a ``corrosive legislative tantrum'' on the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a powerful lobby.
   He said the Reagan administration ``fell into the trap. It
underestimated the hold of AIPAC on a majority of the Congress.''
   The Committee and the Zionist Organization of America were the
only Jewish groups who kept lobbying against the PLO U.N. mission
once the government closed the PLO Washington office, Baum and
others said in interviews.
   The 159-nation General Assembly is expected to approve a
resolution Wednesday calling for arbitration and saying closure of
the mission would violate the treaty. Another resolution asks the
World Court to rule on whether the United States must submit to
arbitration.
   The resolutions are sponsored by the Soviet Union, several
Soviet allies and by members of the movement of nations professing
non-alliance with either superpower.
   Israel was initially scheduled to address the General Assembly
Tuesday, but the address was later moved to Wednesday because of
the length of other speeches.

<HEAD>Text of New Statement on Higgins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a statement released
Tuesday, purporting to be from the kidnappers of kidnapped Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, as translated from the Arabic by The Associated
Press:
   In the name of God, supporter of the oppressed, to the sons of
our struggling people in Lebanon and Palestine, to the free men of
the oppressed world.
   In addition to our previous statements on the detention of
American CIA agent Col. Higgins, we are keen to explain the
following:
   1. The propaganda that is being waged nowadays is aimed at
minimizing the espionage role of Col. Higgins and diverting the
issue of his detention into other incorrect objectives. It is also
aimed at circumventing his political activity with certain
suspicious currents and elements in the south.
   2. The attempts undertaken by the American administration and
the criminal Reagan (who) is moving inside and outside Lebanon to
ensure a quick release of Higgins so that he will not reveal
secrets and make confessions are aimed at stopping the
investigation of this criminal at a stage that will not allow us to
find out all about the American-Israeli conspiracies against our
people and nation. This is a failed attempt to wriggle out of the
impasse the Reagan administration is currently trapped in.
   3. But we declare today that we have uncovered solid facts about
an American-Israeli deal being hatched for south Lebanon. Once the
investigation of Higgins is over, we will place the details at the
disposal of our ulema (Moslem clergy) to make of them whatever they
deem fit.
   4. We reiterate that we shall continue the investigation of this
spy to complete his record, which is full of crimes. We shall put
forward all the facts to our people at the proper time.
   5. Israel's persistence in daily attacks to suppress the Islamic
uprising of the struggling Palestinian people and the steadfast
villages of Jebel Amel (Shiite name for south Lebanon), and the
shuttles of American criminal Shultz to abort the achievements of
this uprising will make us more determined to put this criminal
Higgins on trial. This will be done after the completion of the
investigation to make the world understand that any hand that
reaches out to hurt (our) pride, Islam and the dignity of our
people will be chopped off.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.

   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah,
took in a Hollywood glamour tour Tuesday that brought them
face-to-face with a gregarious movie robot, bashful celebrities and
curious everyday folk bearing flowers.
   The duke and duchess, midway through a 10-day Southern
California tour to promote Britain, greeted such actors as Vincent
Price, Roger Moore, Jack Nicholson, Robin Leach, Roddy McDowall,
Pierce Brosnan and Joseph Cotten.
   ``I think they were modern and literate and good-mannered and
were handsome people. I loved being here,'' Cotten said after
pausing with the royal couple at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences.
   Jack Lemmon and Brosnan were visibly nervous, and humbled, by
the meeting.
   ``It gives one butterflies,'' Brosnan said afterward. ``I wasn't
sure about bowing correctly. I didn't know what to say.''
   Lemmon said later that he realized that ``for them it was like
doing a scene over and over about 100 times. ... It is such a
grueling schedule for them. They couldn't have been more charming.''
   The couple had started the day earlier at the Showscan Film Co.
a special effects studio in Culver City.
   ``Greetings, salutations, hello,'' said ``Number 5,'' the impish
robot from the movie ``Short Circuit.'' Attended by a half dozen
technicians, the robot presented Sarah with a bouquet, then spun on
its triangular tank treads and introduced Sarah to company
officials.
   As Sarah entered the building, ``Number 5'' commented: ``Nice
hat.''
   ``Thank you,'' replied the duchess, who also accepted a bouquet
and a rose from fans in the small crowd outside the studio.
   The wildest scene in the studio visit consisted of two
hair-raising rides for Andrew in something called the ``dynamic
animation theater.''
   The prince and seven other people took seats on a hydraulically
operated platform in front of a curved movie screen as a film shot
from the perspective of the front seat in a roller coaster roared
by.
   For the next several minutes, they were jolted up and down,
backward and forward, and finally brought to a lurching halt. The
duchess, who is three months pregnant, watched from a director's
chair, telling her husband later, ``You looked very funny.''
   The royal couple also saw a breakaway bottle smashed harmlessly
over the head of their private secretary, Lt. Col. Sean O'Dwyer.
   The rain that has been dampening crowds for much of the visit
eased for the day's events, which also included a luncheon at the
Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood that was held by the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts.
   The royals heard actress Anjelica Huston salute British
contributions to film, particularly in comedy. Britons have an
ability ``to puff themselves up to their most British, then burst
the balloon,'' she said.
   Dudley Moore then gently mocked Miss Huston's serious speech,
beginning his remarks: ``Your royal highnesses, extinguished guests
...''
   ``I was reminded of our legacy,'' the British entertainer said.
``The heritage of Shakespeare and Milton that courses through the
veins of every red-blooded English film star who is living now,
very nicely, thank you, in Marina del Rey.''
   The Yorks, both 28, are touring to promote trade and as patrons
of UK@LA '88, a festival of British arts. They are staying aboard
the 416-foot royal yacht Britannia in Long Beach.

   Moslem kidnappers freed two Scandinavian
relief workers Tuesday, nearly a month after they had been
kidnapped in southern Lebanon, and left a note saying the hostages
were ``proved innocent.''
   Swede Jan Stening, 44, and Norwegian William Jorgensen, 58,
employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, were released in
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Norwegian Charge d'Affaires Peter Raeder told The Associated
Press, ``I saw them. They looked a little bit pale but in fairly
good condition.''
   Reporters in Sidon said the U.N. workers were freed at 8 p.m.
and turned over to Salah Salah, a representative of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   They said Salah took the two to Sunni Moslem leader Mustafa
Saad, whose militia controls Sidon. Militiamen then drove the
former captives to Moslem west Beirut and delivered them to UNRWA
security chief John Carolan.
   UNRWA's acting director, John Fennessy, said the two were taken
to a hotel in Christian east Beirut to rest.
   He expressed ``the relief and satisfaction of my colleagues and
myself'' that the Scandinavians ``have at last been released and
are unharmed.''
   Stening and Jorgensen were abducted near Sidon on Feb. 5. Their
release reduced the number of foreign hostages held by extremists
in Lebanon to 23.
   Also on Tuesday, a statement purporting to be from the
kidnappers of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins said the U.S. Marine will
be put on ``trial'' for espionage when his captors finish
questioning him. There was no way of authenticating the statement.
   Members of a group called the Revolutionary Cells kidnapped the
Scandinavians. In a handwritten Arabic statement delivered to a
Western news agency in Beirut late Tuesday the group announced the
two men had been released. A photograph of the Scandinavians
accompanied the statement.
   It did not say what they had been accused of, but in earlier
statements the group claimed the men were involved with the
intelligence service of an unidentified foreign power.
   U.N. officials blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting
individually without a political motive.
   Government officials in Norway and Stockholm expressed gratitude
to those who had helped secure freedom for the two.
   The one-paragraph statement from the kidnappers said:
   ``After the two employees were proved innocent, they were
released. We ask UNRWA to reverse its decision to freeze its
activities, and we remind them that we will not allow suspicious
elements to use international agencies for cover.''
   The U.N. agency, which cares for an estimated 280,000
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, suspended most of its medical,
social and educational services after the abductions.
   The statement on Higgins was delivered to a Western news agency
in Beirut without a picture of the U.S. Marine, who was abducted
Feb. 17 near Tyre.
   It was typewritten in Arabic and signed Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, the name of the group that claimed
responsibility for abducting Higgins, 43.
   The statement said Israel's tough response to 12 weeks of
Palestinian riots in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the
Middle East peace shuttle of U.S. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz ``make us more determined to try this criminal, Higgins.''
   It repeated the claim that Higgins was a CIA agent.
   It was the third statement issued since the Marine from
Danville, Ky., was seized by gunmen who stopped his U.N. car on the
coastal highway.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth is believed made up
of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. It has claimed responsibility for
kidnapping 12 Lebanese Jews in Moslem west Beirut since 1984 and
says it killed eight of them.
   Higgins is one of nine American hostages in Lebanon. Held
longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The Marine colonel was the commander of 76 U.N. observers from
16 nations who monitor truce violations on the Lebanon-Israel
border under a 1949 armistice agreement.
   His observers are attached to the 5,800-member U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon that was sent into southern Lebanon in 1978 as a
buffer between Israel and Palestinian guerrillas.
   The statement about Higgins said in part: ``The criminal Reagan
is moving inside and outside Lebanon to ensure a quick release of
Higgins so that he will not reveal secrets and make confessions.
But we declare today that we have uncovered solid facts about an
American-Israeli deal being hatched for south Lebanon.''
   In Washington, the State Department said it had no comment
except to repeat the U.S. position ``that all the hostages should
be released immediately and unconditionally.''
   In Stockholm, Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said of the
release of the UNRWA workers, ``I would like to express the
government's great gratitude to all who have helped achieve this
result.''
   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway issued a
statement in Oslo saying: ``On behalf of the government and myself
I'm extremely relieved and happy with the release of William
Jorgensen of Norway and his Swedish collegue Jan Stening.''
   In Vienna, UNRWA spokesman Ron Wilkinson said Stening and
Jorgensen probably would travel to Vienna where the agency has its
headquarters.
   He also said the agency will ``still have to think about our
operations'' in Lebanon, adding: ``We have to have certain
guarantees of safety.''

<HEAD>Toll in Alien Boat Accident Hits Eight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGUADA, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight bodies have been recovered so
far since a small craft carrying about 45 illegal aliens from the
Dominican Republic capsized near Puerto Rico, authorities said
Tuesday.
   Authorities and a survivor say most of the 45 made it to shore
safely after the boat sank Sunday night near this small fishing
village, about 85 miles west of the capital city of San Juan.
   Police Lt. Jose Vega said two bodies were found Monday and six
more were pulled from the ocean near the beach Tuesday.
   Strong waves hampered the search, which was expected to resume
Wednesday.
   Police Maj. Cesar Gracia said the Dominican residents boarded
the craft on the east coast of Dominican Republic Saturday night,
when the weather was clear for the 90-mile trip across Mona
Passage. As they neared Puerto Rico, large waves overturned the
boat about 180 feet from shore.
   The boat was estimated to be 20 to 30 feet long.
   One survivor was hospitalized and another was taken into custody
Monday by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in this U.S.
Caribbean commonwealth.
   Aguada has been the landing site for many boats bringing illegal
aliens to Puerto Rico in search of a better life. Immigration
authorities estimate the number of illegal Dominicans living in
Puerto Rico to be between 40,000 and 160,000.

   Soldiers with tear gas
fought protesters hurling stones in the poor, densely populated
Capotillo neighborhood of the capital Tuesday. Ten people were hurt
and about 50 were arrested.
   The disturbances began with a strike to protest increases in the
cost of living. Schools and stores in the neighborhood closed, but
traffic and activity were normal in the rest of Santo Domingo.
   Elsewhere in this Caribbean nation of 6 million, residents of
Azua and Barahona provinces south of the capital burned tires,
blocked roads and stoned businesses and cars.
   In similar protests last week, five people were killed and 20
injured in eight of the 26 provinces of the Dominican Republic,
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The unrest is the
worst faced by President Joaquin Balaguer since he took office in
August 1986.
   The inflation rate is running at about 30 percent a year. The
foreign exchange value of the peso meanwhile has skidded. It takes
5.3 pesos to buy one U.S. dollar, about 72 percent more than the
3.85-1 ratio several months ago.
   Many people are furious that a 5-gallon container of cooking oil
has doubled to 84 pesos. Taxi drivers resent paying 3.6 pesos for a
gallon of gas that a few months ago cost 3 pesos.
   A one-pound steAP Business Writer=
   NEW YORK (AP) _ Aluminum maker KaiserTech Ltd. sued its chairman
for millions of dollars Tuesday, alleging he violated securities
law by improperly engaging in profitable short-term buying and
selling of company stock.
   The suit against Alan E. Clore came a day after the reclusive
British investor agreed to sell his 27 percent stake in KaiserTech
to Texas oilman Charles Hurwitz, a move that appeared to irritate
KaiserTech officials and signaled management turbulence at the
Oakland, Calif.-based company.
   Neither Clore nor Hurwitz are considered familiar with the
aluminum business. Clore acquired his position at KaiserTech after
a lengthy takeover struggle last year. Hurwitz's intentions toward
KaiserTech remain unclear.
   Asked if it was considered unusual that a company would sue its
own chairman, KaiserTech spokesman Robert W. Irelan said: ``It's
the first time we've done it.''
   In a statement, KaiserTech said its suit filed in a Manhattan
federal court resulted from Clore's disclosures in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing Monday about his sale of stock to a
Hurwitz-controlled company, Los Angeles-based Maxxam Group Inc.
   KaiserTech contended the SEC disclosures showed Clore and his
affiliates made about $4 million in undisclosed profits via
so-called ``short-swing trading'' _ trading done within a six-month
period _ of KaiserTech stock.
   Under federal securities law, a company or its stockholders are
entitled to recover such profits from a director or officer who
engages in short-swing trading.
   Clore, who usually resides in Switzerland, could not be reached
for comment on the lawsuit, part of a rapid series of events
concerning the stock of the aluminum producer.
   In Los Angeles, the investment firm Jefferies & Co. said it was
selling 1.39 million shares of KaiserTech stock to Maxxam for
$16.68 million or $12 a share.
   Combined with the 6.2 million shares acquired from Clore, plus
an option to buy his 8.2 million convertible preferred KaiserTech
shares, the shares purchased from Jefferies would give Maxxam about
one-third of KaiserTech's approximately 45 million shares
outstanding.
   Wall Street's reaction reflected skepticism about a possible
takeover move. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading
Tuesday, KaiserTech fell 12{ cents a share to $11.75, after rising
$1.12{ in the previous session.
   KaiserTech said in a statement Monday it would have preferred
that Clore had sold his stock to a broader range of investors,
reflecting concern about what Maxxam intends to do with its stake.
Maxxam officials said it was premature to speculate on whether it
would attempt to acquire more.
   Clore's maneuvering to sell his KaiserTech shares came against a
background of heavy pressure on him to cut losses that stemmed from
the October stock market crash.
   If Clore hadn't found a buyer by a Monday deadline, he could
have faced default on loans he had obtained by using Kaiser stock
as collateral. After the stock plunged in October, lenders wanted
repayment.
   His sale of stock came as the company was rebounding from six
straight years of losses. Kaiser has sold its chemical, oil and gas
businesses, slashed debt and concentrated on its core aluminum
business.

<HEAD>170 Families Cannot Leave Because They Allegedly Know State
Secrets</HEAD>

   Authorities told a group of activists Tuesday that
170 Soviet Jewish families cannot be allowed to emigrate because
members have been exposed to state secrets, a member of the group
said.
   Vladimir Kislik, who has been trying to leave for 15 years, said
10 Jews from Moscow and Leningrad met with officials of the
Communist Party Central Committee and Justice Ministry.
   On Jan. 20 the group had given Vitaly Siderov, a Central
Committee official, a list of more than 300 families denied
permission to emigrate and requested a review.
   Siderov promised an answer within a month. The activists
returned Feb. 21, were told the review was not ready and were asked
to come back Tuesday, Kislik said in a telephone interview.
   They met with Siderov, Alexander Gorkovluk of the Central
Committee's propaganda department and officials of the Office of
Visas and Registrations and the Justice Ministry, he said.
   From the list of 300 families, Kislik reported, the officials
said 25 people had been authorized to emigrate. He said 20 had
received notification since the list was drawn up Jan. 1.
   About 80 other people were refused exit visas because parents or
spouses have not certified that they have no financial claims,
Kislik said. Soviet regulations require an applicant for emigration
to furnish such a guarantee.
   Kislik said some families were refused for emigration because
they do not have close enough relatives in Israel, which ``fully
contradicted'' what Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told him last month in
Moscow.
   Shultz told reporters Feb. 22, after meeting with Shevardnadze,
that the Soviet minister promised ``flexibility'' in applying rules
that require applicants to have close relatives abroad.
   He said Shevardnadze also told him ``categorically'' that the
only barrier to emigration is past work involving state secrets.
   Many people whom the government alleges were exposed to state
secrets say they saw the information years or decades ago and that
it does not compromise the Soviet Union.
   ``I last worked in atomic science 22 years ago and they are
refusing me because of that reason even today,'' Kislik said.
   He added that the officials indicated they would meet with the
Jews again to discuss the cases of 20 Soviet Jews who have heart
conditions, cancer or other ailments and who want to leave. ``We
also gave them a list of people from 60 to 82 years old who want to
emigrate,'' he said.
   In February, Soviet authorities allowed 723 Jews to emigrate,
according to the Geneva-based agency that helps the emigrants
resettle. That was a slight increase from the January total of 658.
   According to the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration,
Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union last year reached 8,011,
its highest level since 1981.

   Bob Dole was locked in a tight race with
George Bush Tuesday night in fractional returns from Vermont's
Republican presidential primary, a low-key, low-stakes tuneup for
Super Tuesday. Michael Dukakis had an early advantage over Jesse
Jackson in the Democratic race.
   Sen. Dole was flush with endorsements in his effort to challenge
the vice president in his New England backyard. Jackson, in the
state with the fewest blacks in the nation, hoped to finish a
strong second to Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis as he did last weekend
in Maine.
   Gary Hart, the big winner here in 1984, was far, far back in the
pack where he has been stuck all year.
   The elections were ``beauty-contest'' primaries. Vermont's
national convention delegates won't be apportioned until next month
in party caucuses, and the candidates have practically ignored the
state to concentrate on the South. The primary took place on Town
Meeting Day when Vermont's 328,466 voters decided town budgets,
road repairs and a host of other local issues.
   With just a handful of Vermont's 262 precincts reporting, Bush
had 288 and Dole 287. Pat Robertson, whose supporters said they
were focusing on the April caucuses, had 61 votes. Jack Kemp was
not active in Vermont and had just 38 votes.
   Among the Democrats, Dukakis had 336 votes and Jackson 198. Sen.
Paul Simon, who made no real effort here, had 29 votes and Rep.
Richard Gephardt _
   who campaigned several times in the state _ had 28. Hart had 16
votes and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was not on the ballot.
   Dukakis, governor of neighboring Massachusetts, boasted 15 paid
staffers and up to 60 volunteers in Vermont, while most
organizations felt fortunate to have two or three paid staffers.
But Jackson's Rainbow Coalition has been active in Vermont since
his 1984 presidential campaign and prompted an uneasy mixture of
concern and admiration from the Dukakis organization.
   Jackson hoped to do well in Vermont to follow up a strong
showing last weekend in Maine and demonstrate he can win broad
support from people of all races. ``The issue of another person's
skin, ought not to be an issue,'' said Chris Wood of the Jackson
campaign.
   Among the Republicans, Bush had the strongest organization, but
Dole was helped by heavyweight endorsements from Sen. Robert
Stafford, Rep. James Jeffords and former Gov. Richard Snelling.
   Vermont's primary was overshadowed by next Tuesday's elections
in which 20 states will apportion hundreds of delegates. The only
thing at stake in Vermont was news media attention, bragging rights
and the Bush-Dukakis regional winning streak. They both already
have won the New Hampshire primary and the Maine caucuses and have
high hopes next week in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

   Minority students drew up a contract
Tuesday to end the eight-day takeover of a Hampshire College
building that was held to protest racism at the private liberal
arts school.
   ``We all want it over,'' said Anita Fearman, a spokesman for the
40 black, Hispanic, Indian and other minority students who have
occupied a dormitory office since Feb. 23.
   A tentative agreement was hammered out late Monday in meetings
with the school's president, Adele Simmons, and two other
administrators.
   Students drew up the formal contract Tuesday and college
officials were expected to sign it Wednesday. Specifics of the
contract were not released Tuesday.
   Protesters said they expected to continue holding the Dakin
House office until Wednesday despite the apparent agreement.
   Among the demands Dean of Faculty Penina Glazer said the
administration agreed to was the hiring of a full-time adviser for
the campus group that occupied the building, Students of
Underrepresented Cultures.
   The school also agreed to allow a professor to serve part-time
as dean of multicultural affairs and to try to win grants to
increase the number of Third World books in the library, she said.
   The college was founded in 1965 as an alternative to the
traditional education offered at nearby Smith, Mount Holyoke and
Amherst colleges and University of Massachusetts. Students design
their own courses of study and advance through three divisional
examinations requiring them to complete individual research
projects.
   About 100 of Hampshire's 1,100 students are minorities.
   Two weeks earlier, an occupation sparked by campus racial
violence ended at at UMass when Chancellor Joseph Duffey agreed to
demands including increase funding of minority student programs.
   Meanwhile, in Springfield, the Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination has found probable cause in a complaint by Roland A.
Wiggins, 54, a black professor at Hampshire College, alleging he
was denied a 10-year teaching contract in 1986 because of race.
   The panel will attempt to resolve dispute or, failing that,
conduct public hearings, Hurst said.
   Wiggins, a music professor, said he had worked under short
contracts since he was hired in 1979 and in 1985 had won backing of
faculty, students and the college appointments committee for a
10-year appointment.
   The college cited complaints that Wiggins often was unavailable
to students, submitted evaluations late and had ``offered little
leadership in the music program, although he was the senior
member,'' according to Hurst's report.
   No blacks have been granted 10-year contracts, the longest the
college provides, Hurst said in his report. The school does not
offer tenure. Six of the 86 professors at the college are black, he
said.

   The Post Office on Tuesday began postmarking
nearly all letters mailed in Britain with the words ``Jesus is
Alive!'' as part of a private arrangement financed by an evangelist.
   Jewish leaders criticized the Christian cancellation as
potentially offensive.
   The special postmark, which also contains a small cross, will
last six weeks and was paid for by Paul Slennet, who sells
religious literature at two bookstores in Southend-on-Sea, east of
London. He said God told him to buy the postmark.
   The state-owned Post Office said Slennet paid the equivalent of
$88,500 for the privilege of having every letter mailed through 68
of Britain's 69 sorting offices stamped ``Jesus is Alive!''
   The Post Office has adopted various methods of boosting revenue
under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government,
which believes that state-owned services should pay for themselves.
   Receiving the postmark will be all mail _ including that sent
abroad _ excluding parcels, periodicals and those letters stamped
by businesses that have their own franking facilities. Nearly 52
million letters are mailed daily in Britain.
   ``The printing of this slogan in no way confirms Post Office
approval of its contents,'' said Post Office spokesman Duncan
Marshall. ``The slogan is not considered to be contentious.''
   Shimon Cohen, spokesman for Lord Jakobovits, the chief rabbi of
Britain, said his office was ``flooded with phone calls'' after
news of the slogan appeared in newspapers Tuesday.
   ``We recognize that this is a Christian country and we have the
utmost respect for the primacy for the church,'' Cohen said in an
interview.
   However, ``we do fear that the slogan that will be carried is by
implication addressed to non-Christians and could well cause
offense and resentment. We've made our feelings known to the Post
Office,'' he said.
   Rabbi Charles Emmanuel, chairman of the Assembly of Rabbis of
the Reform Movement of Great Britain, said: ``This country allows
me freedom of religion, and an official organization should not
have accepted such a commission that will infringe not only upon my
rights but the rights of other non-Christians.'' Marshall said his
office was aware of ``a number of complaints.'' Asked if these had
caused any change of heart, he said: ``I've had no indication of
that.''
   He said no complaints had been received from other non-Christian
groups.
   However, the British Humanist Association, a national
association for the non-religious, said the decision showed
``insensitive disregard'' for other beliefs.
   ``Imagine the furor if we had asked to have `Jesus is Dead'
printed on hundreds of millions of letters,'' said association
spokesman Martin Horwood.
   He said he is writing the Post Office asking that the postmark
be withdrawn.
   In Washington, a U.S. Postal Service official said the chance of
something similar in the United States was unlikely. Dick Rustin,
manager of the Stamp Information Branch, said limits are strict on
special cancellations and religious messages are excluded.
   Britain's Post Office regulations require paid messages to be
``non-controversial, non-political and likely to be generally
acceptable to the public,'' Marshall said.
   Slennet, 41, said he got the idea five years ago listening to a
sermon in which the preacher talked about collecting stamps and
postmarks.
   ``The Lord has since confirmed to me in various ways that this
is the right thing to do,'' he said in an interview. ``In 1986 that
small quiet voice we hear when God speaks said `postmark'.''
   He said that he has informed Christian groups around the country
of his idea and received contributions toward paying for it.
   Slennet belongs to Intercessors for Britain, an evangelical
organization. He said the slogan was chosen in the spirit of Easter.
   The Plymouth Post Office isn't printing the slogan because it
already had been booked for one commemorating England's defeat of
the Spanish Armada in 1588.

<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday proposed a
bill to outlaw foreign funding of political activity, a move that
could cripple anti-apartheid groups and churches thus far spared
from the new crackdown on opposition.
   No court challenge of the restrictions would be allowed.
   Last week, the government banned 18 predominantly black
organizations from political activity, including the largest
anti-apartheid coalition and largest labor federation.
   Leading anti-apartheid clergymen vowed Tuesday _ before the new
bill was introduced _ that the churches would take over some of the
programs of the banned groups and more aggressively confront the
government.
   The new legislation, called ``The Promotion of Orderly Politics
Bill,'' would prohibit all organizations from receiving money from
abroad for political purposes and would empower the justice
minister to seize foreign funds received by certain groups. His
powers would be indefinitely retroactive.
   The foreign funds provision was not expected to hurt right-wing
organizations, which receive most of their money from donations
from within South Africa.
   However, another section of the bill could apply to right-wing
white supremacist groups that oppose the government's limited
apartheid reforms. It sets a penalty of two years in jail or a fine
of about $2,000 for anyone who ``says or does anything'' to foment
hostility or violence between different racial, cultural or
religious groups. The penalties would apply to anyone who displays
a banner, emblem or slogan deemed to convey such hostility, and
also to anyone who attends a gathering where such items are
displayed.
   The South African Council of Churches, which includes most major
Protestant denominations and is engaged in civil rights work, has
received more than 90 percent of its funds from abroad in recent
years.
   The Roman Catholic Church cooperates with the council of
churches but receives substantial overseas funds separately.
   The Rev. Smangiliso Mkhatshwa, secretary-general of the Southern
African Catholic Bishops Conference, said the bill might be
difficult to enforce.
   ``If the church says supporting the families of detainees and
paying legal fees is the work of love, the work of evangelism, it
is difficult to see how the government can define for the church
what is pastoral and what is political,'' he said.
   In Parliament, Helen Suzman, veteran member of the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, condemned the arrests
Monday of prominent clergymen who were protesting the government
crackdown.
   About 25 church leaders, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, and 125 other protesters were detained briefly after riot
policeman blocked them from marching to Parliament with a petition
protesting the bans on opposition groups. After the most prominent
clergymen were placed in police vehicles, a water cannon was
sprayed on the other protesters, who were kneeling and singing
hymns.
   Mrs. Suzman said Tuesday police should have allowed the march to
proceed, ``thus avoiding all that sensational publicity that has
resulted in adverse headlines across the world and has added
further fuel to the campaign for sanctions. This government has a
death wish.''
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said the clergymen had
defied a request to disperse and ``scandalously provoked'' police.
``We have to once again take the blame for the misconduct of people
who hide behind the cloth of sanctimony,'' he said.
   One of the arrested churchmen, Roman Catholic Archibishop
Stephen Naidoo of Cape Town, said in an interview Tuesday that he
and his colleagues considered it their duty to intensify the
churches' challenge of the government.
   ``There is going to be in this country a continuing moral
confrontation,'' he said.
   He predicted the authorities would deal cautiously with defiant
clergymen because ``they are intelligent enough to realize they are
dealing here with a great moral force ... and the moral
sensibilities of people all over the world.''
   The government has backed off before in the face of concerted
church resistance, the last time in 1986 when many of the same
ministers arrested Monday had gathered at Cape Town's St. George's
Anglican Cathderal to defy a ban on calling for the release of
detainees. The prohibition was not enforced and was dropped from
the next issue of emergency regulations.
   The Rev. Edward King, dean of St. George's, said it was
significant that no one in Monday's march had been charged and all
were freed without bail. ``I think they're embarrassed by this;
they don't want to put archbishops in jail. But they make their own
nooses for their own necks.''

<HEAD>Police Say Dead IRA Bomber Was Their Most Wanted Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two IRA men accidentally
killed by their own bomb has been linked to at least 25 killings
since 1979 and headed the police most-wanted list, the British news
agency Press Association said Tuesday.
   The agency quoted security sources it did not identify as saying
Brendan Burns, 33, was believed to have directed IRA bombing
campaigns along the British province's border with the Irish
Republic.
   Burns and Brendan Morley, 30, were killed Monday by the
detonation of explosives they apparently were installing in a van
about two miles outside Crossmaglen in south Armagh.
   The Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to oust Britain
from Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish Republic, said
the men belonged to the organization.
   Press Association said Burns was involved in an IRA ambush that
cost the lives of 18 British soldiers in Warrenpoint, County Down,
in August 1969, when sectarian violence began in the
Protestant-dominated province.
   Burns also was sought in connection with a land mine explosion
that killed five soldiers at Camlough, County Armagh, in 1981, the
agency said.
   It said he was linked with the killings of Lord Justice Sir
Maurice Gibson, the province's second-highest judge, and his wife.
A land mine destroyed their car as they drove into Northern Ireland
from across the border last summer.
   Northern Ireland's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
refused comment on the report Tuesday night.

   Republican presidential candidate
Pat Robertson on Tuesday cited second-hand testimony from a Senate
subcommittee hearing 21 years ago as documentation that Soviet
intermediate-range missiles are based in Cuba.
   However, several U.S. officials said Tuesday the Cuban military
has some surface-to-surface missiles in its inventory, but none has
a nuclear warhead and none could reach the United States even if
they did.
   The former religious broadcaster said the information indicates
a ``loophole'' in the U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty awaiting
ratification in the Senate.
   Robertson quoted 1967 testimony by Paul Bethel, a State
Department official from Miami who said Cuban refugees had told him
of seeing missiles, and one of the refugees, identified only as Mr.
Apud, who swore Cuban soldiers let him know about missiles aimed at
Washington before he left in 1966.
   Neither man testified he had personally seen the missiles, the
transcript indicates.
   The testimony was given to the Judiciary subcommittee to
investigate the administration of the Internal Security Act and
other internal security laws. Robertson read portions of it to
supporters at a breakfast here and during a rally the night before
in Miami.
   ``I've been accused of bringing funny facts,'' Robertson told
the Fort Lauderdale gathering. ``Ladies and gentlemen, the clear
eyewitness, sworn testimony of witnesses before a Senate Judiciary
committee is not funny facts. ... This is documented evidence.''
   Robertson's assertion that there are missiles based in Cuba has
been denied by the White House, congressional defense experts and
Cuban president Fidel Castro.
   Several defense and administration officials were asked Tuesday
about Robertson's claim. The officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity because they did not want to become involved in the
presidential race, said Cuba has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7
battlefield missiles, date to the 1960s.
   The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, could
carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, ``but we're
confident no nuclear warheads ever went to Cuba for that missile
and it doesn't have any range anyway,'' said one source who
requested anonymity.
   According to the reference book ``Jane's Weapon Systems,'' the
Frog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distance
between Cuba and Florida. Moreover, the rocket has no guidance
system to direct it to a specific target.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said last month that Cuba
has been under extensive surveillance since the 1962 missile crisis
and there was ``no evidence'' any other nuclear weaponry had ever
been deployed there by the Soviet Union.
   Robertson concentrated heavily on the Cuban-American vote for
the March 8 Super Tuesday primary during a two-day swing through
South Florida.
   The Miami rally drew little more than half of the 1,500 people
that campaign organizers had predicted in a show of the candidate's
strength among Hispanics.
   At a news conference following the breakfast, Robertson refused
to say how he obtained the missile testimony transcript.
   ``How I got it is my business, but the thing that's important is
that it's available in the records of the United State
government,'' he said. ``And, frankly, I think it shows that the
staff work by the State Department was not adequate on the INF
treaty because there's clearly a Cuban loophole.''
   A Cuban refugee who claims he saw a variety of missiles,
including long-range surface-to-surface missiles, there as late as
1985 said he met Thursday in Miami with Robertson.
   Copies of a Spanish-language newspaper, Diario Libre, with a
headline proclaiming ``YES, PAT! YOU'RE RIGHT!'' and maps drawn by
the refugee to pinpoint the missile sites were distributed to
campaign supporters throughout his South Florida visit.
   The man identified himself only as E. Rodriguez, saying he
feared revealing his full name would result in retribution against
family members still in Cuba. He said he was an agricultural
planner and had access to aerial photographs and to areas of Cuba
where the missiles were based.
   Robertson said he couldn't vouch for the authenticity of the
newspaper's account of the refugee's story.
   ``I'm not saying I have other than this proof,'' he said,
referring to the subcommittee transcript. ``It's coming to me from
many, many people now, people who are aware of it.
   ``But the issue is not can we prove or can we not prove. The
issue is verification We have a treaty. There's a loophole in the
treaty. We must put in verification of the Cuban missile sites.''
   He told reporters the only way to verify his claim was to
personally go to Cuba and look for the missiles. But, responding to
a question, he said he would decline an invitation to do so should
it be extended by Castro, who he has described as ``a butcher and a
tyrant.''
   In the subcommittee transcript, Apud said he was told by Cuban
soldiers he had known for many years that the missiles were
nicknamed ``Washington Left,'' ``Washington Right,'' and
``Washington Central.''
   Robertson quoted Bethel's acknowledgement, in response to
questioning by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., that numerous refugees
had told him they had seen missiles left in Cuba after the Cuban
Missile Crisis and new ones constructed in 1964.
   Bethel testified he could not state with certainty that
intermediate or intercontinental ballistic missiles were in Cuba,
but that the State Department also couldn't be certain they weren't
there.

<HEAD>Nasser's Son Accuses US and Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of late President Gamal Abdel Nasser of
Egypt was quoted Tuesday as saying the United States and Israel are
defaming him and his brothers to ``settle old accounts'' with his
father.
   The Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa said the interview conducted in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was the first with Khaled Abdel Nasser since
criminal charges were filed against him in Cairo. It quoted him as
saying he would return to Egypt for trial even though he faced
possible execution.
   Khaled Nasser is among 20 men charged in connection with four
shooting attacks on U.S. and Israeli diplomats and embassy workers
between 1984 and 1987. Two Israelis were killed and six Israelis
and two Americans were wounded.
   He and the other defendants are accused of membership in a
clandestine group called Egypt's Revolution. The indictment demands
the death penalty for Nasser, 38, and 10 other defendants, and
prison terms of up to life for the others.
   Egypt has said it is trying to extradite Khaled Nasser for trial
as one of three founders of Egypt's Revolution and its main
financial backer. The group is committed to ending the Israeli
presence in Egypt and Egyptian commitment to the 1979 peace treaty
with the Jewish state.
   Al-Anbaa said Algeria had offered political refugee status to
Nasser but he refused, saying: ``My father never imagined being
such in any country and preferred to die while fighting his enemies
rather than accept that. Therefore I am determined to return to
Cairo because death in Cairo is much better than living elsewhere.''
   Gamal Abdel Nasser led a bloodless military coup that ousted
King Farouk in 1952, and ruled as a fierce nationalist until his
death in 1970.
   While he was in office, Egypt faced the 1956 invasion by
Britain, France and Israel and Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula
and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Nasser's successor, the late Anwar Sadat, led the country
through the 1973 war with Israel and signed the peace treaty with
Israel in 1979.
   In referring to ``a defamation campaign'' in the Egyptian press
against him and his two younger brothers, according to Al-Anbaa,
Nasser said it was ``not separate from the hostile American and
Israeli blueprint which has been employed over the past 36 years
with the aim of obliterating Nasser's legendary place in the hearts
of the Arab masses.''
   ``The defamation campaign being launched against me and my
brothers is but an American and Israeli attempt to settle old
accounts,'' he said.
   ``Those who failed to face President Nasser for 18 years of his
rule and to eradicate his name from the conscience of the Egyptian
masses for 18 years after his death now return to launch their
campaigns.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report: Rights Violations Continue in Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Nations report released Tuesday said
human rights violations including torture and abductions continue
in Chile but the overall situation is improving.
   The report presented to the 43-nation U.N. Human Rights
Commission said that since February 1985 ``there have been
important changes which have improved the human rights situation .
.. but much still remains to be done.''
   It said specific problems are the increasing scope of military
courts and ``violent and criminal activities of private gangs and
terrorists.''
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet has headed Chile's military government
since the coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist
President Salvador Allende in September 1973.
   The report was prepared by Costa Rican jurist Fernando Volio
Jimenez under a mandate from the commission. Volio Jiminez visited
Chile in December and met with government officials and human
rights activists.
   He wrote that ``a state of violence affecting fundamental rights
continues to exist in Chile, despite the government's general
attitude condemning such violations.''
   The report said many citizens are victims of intimidation by
``supposedly private individuals'' seeking to ``inspire terror in
circles opposed to the political status quo.''
   Such intimidation is ``generally the work of private gangs ...
having the secret support of some public authority,'' it said.
   Harassment, mainly of people who recently returned from exile,
has become more ``articulate, blatant and general,'' the report
said.
   It also said the government has taken measures to try to prevent
the torture of detainees, but ``torture is still practiced
although, according to non-governmental sources, this revolting
practice may have declined in terms of numbers.''
   The report noted an increase in the number of civilians tried in
military courts and the ``irregular conduct'' of those courts.
   It listed five cases of ``involuntary disappearances'' in 1987,
following a year when no cases were reported, and said the
recurrence is ``an especially serious situation.''
   On the positive side, Volio reported the government since
February 1985 had permitted the return of about 4,000 Chileans who
were in forced exile. It said that according to the government, 350
Chileans are still living in forced exile but non-governmental
sources put the figure at 583.
   The report cited the cases of nine people killed in 1985-86 that
have not been solved and said one investigating magistrate
complained about lack of police cooperation and said he had
received death threats.
   ``This situation makes things look gloomy for the cause of human
rights,'' it added.

   A federal judge Tuesday gave the three major
television networks the go-ahead to take exit polls at Georgia
voting places during the Super Tuesday presidential preference
primaries next week.
   CBS, NBC and ABC had sued state and Fulton County election
officials to stop enforcement of a 1985 law prohibiting exit polls
or public opinion surveys within 250 feet of a polling place.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Hall Tuesday issued a preliminary
injunction stopping the state from enforcing the new law beyond 25
feet of buildings in which polling places are located.
   The ruling, which came after a hearing on the lawsuit Monday,
allows the networks to conduct the exit polls during the March 8
primaries, as long as their poll takers are stationed no closer
than 25 feet from the door.
   Hall indicated he would rule later on the networks' contention
that the law violates the Constitution's First Amendment guarantee
of freedom of speech and of the press.
   While the state ``has a legitimate interest in protecting the
`sanctity of the polling place,''' Hall wrote in Tueday's ruling,
it appears the 250 foot prohibition on exit polls ``is not
`narrowly tailored' to accomplish that goal in the `least
restrictive means available,''' as required by previous court
rulings on free speech issues.
   A more limited ban, keeping exit pollers out of polling places
and 25 feet away from their doors, ``would likely satisfy even the
most rigorous constitutional scrutiny,'' he wrote.
   ``We're delighted by the results,'' said Floyd Abrams, an
attorney representing the networks. ``It will make it possible for
more people to have more information more quickly about the
election results and their meaning on Super Tuesday.''
   Frances Duncan, the assistant secretary of state in charge of
elections, said Tuesday that copies of the judge's order will be
sent to county election officials for relay to their precinct
managers before the primaries next week.
   In exit polling, survey takers ask a random sample of voters
leaving the polling place to fill out a written list of questions
about whom they voted for and what issues are important to them, as
well as such information as their age, sex and economic status.
   During testimony in Monday's hearing, Warren Mitofsky, director
of CBS News' election and survey unit, testified that exit polls
are by far the most accurate and the quickest way to gauge what
groups of people are voting for which candidate.
   But, he said, the 250-foot distance limitation effectively
banned public opinion surveys of people leaving polling places
because the surveyor is too far away from the exit to be able to
intercept the voters randomly.
   The law had been enacted because elections officials, mostly in
metropolitan Atlanta, had complained that exit poll takers
intimidated voters, according to testimony from former state Rep.
Claude Bray, who chaired the House State Governmental Affairs
Committee when it considered the measure.

   Jesse Jackson met with the South African
ambassador Tuesday and said he conveyed the ``outrage felt by
freedom-loving peoples everywhere'' at the recent clampdown of
anti-apartheid factions in that country.
   The Democratic presidential candidate said he objected to
Pretoria's restriction of the activities of anti-apartheid
organizations and Monday's arrest of Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and other top religious leaders.
   Jackson told a news conference later that the ambassador, Piet
G.J. Koornhof, asked for a follow-up meeting with Rep. Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., who attended the meeting and who is sponsoring
legislation on sanctions against South Africa because of its
apartheid policy of racial separation.
   The Democrat also called on the Reagan administration to take
several steps against the Pretoria regime.
   He said he informed the South African ambassador of his
proposals, which include:
   _ ``Comprehensive international economic and financial sanctions
on apartheid.'' Jackson said U.S. corporations and banks should be
ordered to leave South Africa.
   _ Invocation by the administration of a special session of the
U.N. Security Council to seek international support for such
sanctions.
   _ Broadcasting of news from South Africa via ``a new Radio Free
South Africa.''
   _ Support for the so-called frontline states around South Africa
and aid to build rail corridor railways so that Zimbabwe and Zambia
would not be dependent on South African trade routes.
   Jackson said he attempted to telephone President Reagan on the
eve of Reagan's Tuesday departure for a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization meeting in Brussels. Jackson said he spoke with
national security adviser Colin Powell and urged that Reagan seek
support from the NATO allies for Jackson's South Africa proposals.
   Jackson's press secretary, Elizabeth Coulton, said Powell agreed
the South Africa situation would be raised at the NATO meeting.
   Campaigning earlier in Maryland, one of the Super Tuesday states
that holds its primary next week, Jackson spoke to a downtown
Baltimore rally and blasted Reagan for using ``government power to
take from the poor and give to the rich.''
   Of his recent second-place finish in the Maine caucuses, Jackson
told the crowd of a few hundred, ``There are signs we are growing
every day.''
   He also walked through Baltimore's trendy Lexington Market food
bazaar shaking hands with the lunchtime crowds. He stood on a large
plant pot and shouted over the din, urging the crowd to vote for
him.
   Later, Jackson flew to his hometown of Greenville, S.C., and
proclaimed to a church full of people, ``It's good to be home.''
   ``I'm a son of the South...I know the South and its ways,'' he
said.

<HEAD>BBC Says Government Drops Objections to Program on Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Tuesday the
government has withdrawn its objections to a radio program that
included interviews with intelligence officials.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government won a court order
in December preventing the broadcasting of the first program in the
planned three-part series, ``My Country: Right or Wrong.''
   The government argued that the series, dealing with the tug of
war between state secrecy and freedom of information, could harm
national security.
   Publicly funded BBC said the series portrays the work of
Britain's intelligence agencies and did not reveal anything an
enemy could not already know.
   The government withdrew its objections to the program after its
lawyers received a transcript of it from the BBC, the company said.
   The second and third programs have yet to be recorded.
   ``I am glad that we will be able to transmit this program,''
said John Birt, BBC's deputy director general. ``I am only sorry it
has been long delayed.''
   He did not say when the program will be broadcast.
   The High Court judge who approved the gag order had said the
government was properly concerned that nine former and serving
intelligence officials interviewed for the series may have broken
their oaths of secrecy.
   BBC spokeswoman Helen Cleary said Tuesday night: ``The BBC
initially refused to turn over the transcripts to the government,
arguing that would amount to pre-censorship. But the BBC later,
during the legal process, had to provide the transcripts as part of
its defense evidence.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government had used the argument of
lifetime confidentiality by security agents to prevent the
publication in Britain of ``Spycatcher,'' a book by former agent
Peter Wright, who now lives in Australia. The book has been
published in the United States.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's investment
manager allocated stock-trading profits to Meese's brokerage
accounts under a procedure that a senator said Tuesday raises
questions of ``possible financial favors or gifts'' to the Cabinet
member.
   In a report by its Democratic majority staff, the Senate
Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management said stock
trader W. Franklyn Chinn pooled Meese's money with that of several
other customers in 1985 and 1986 and, after completing stock
trades, assigned profits or losses to the attorney general's
account.
   The report said it appears that in seven instances, Chinn
allocated stock trades to Meese's account in amounts exceeding the
balance available in the account to pay for those trades.
   In the seven instances, the amount of the stock trades exceeded
the balances in Meese's account by $5,000 to $140,000.
   Chinn turned a profit of nearly $40,000 for Meese on a $50,000
investment in just 23 stock trades over a 19-month span.
   E. Robert Wallach, Meese's longtime friend who is under
indictment in the Wedtech Corp. scandal, in five of the trades was
one of the customers whose money was pooled with that of the
attorney general. Wallach introduced Meese to Chinn, who became the
attorney general's financial adviser in May 1985.
   Chinn ``wasn't investing Mr. Meese's money, as much as he was
assigning profits and losses to the accounts of Mr. Meese and his
other clients at his own discretion,'' Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
the subcommittee's chairman, said in a letter to the Office of
Government Ethics.
   Chinn's ``assignment of stock transactions retroactively to
those accounts appears to have no relationship to the amount of
money in those accounts,'' Levin continued.
   ``Because he did not allocate winners and losers to his clients'
accounts until after the fact, he was effectively able to assign
greater benefits to some _ including apparently Mr. Meese on
numerous occasions.''
   The procedure ``raises questions about possible financial favors
or gifts, about possible conflict of interest, (and) about the
judgment of the attorney general in being involved in a partnership
with a director of a company (Wedtech Corp.) with Mr. Meese had
directly assisted when he was working in the White House as
counselor to the president,'' said Levin.
   Levin asked the ethics office for a formal finding as to whether
Meese has complied with federal regulations governing gifts and
loans to public officials and whether he has violated an executive
order prohibiting the appearance of a conflict of interest.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said the issues
raised by Levin were matters that had been fully examined in
congressional hearings last July and that now are before the
independent counsel studying Meese's dealings with Wedtech. He said
it would be inappropriate for the ethics office to get involved at
this point.
   ``What Senator Levin is trying to do is wrap an 8-month old fish
in today's paper,'' Korten said. ``All we have here is a highly
partisan effort to grab another headline on this thing and keep the
Meese pot boiling.''
   Meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of Wedtech when the
Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor was seeking a $32 million, no-bid
contract to build small engines for the Army. Within months of
Meese's intercession, Wedtech was awarded the work.
   The report said that in one instance, Chinn bought and sold
5,000 shares of a new stock issue in Oliver Stores Inc. worth
$30,000 on Feb. 11, 1986.
   It wasn't until the next day, however, that Chinn instructed
Imperial Trust Co. where one of Meese's accounts was established,
that 2,000 of the shares were to be recorded for Meese's account.
The transaction gave Meese a profit of more than $1,700.
   In another instance, on Sept. 12, 1985, Chinn allocated a
purchase of $80,000 worth of stock in Rockefeller Center Properties
to Meese's account at the brokerage house of Bear, Stearns at a
time when the account had a balance of only $51,000. The trade
resulted in a profit of nearly $900.
   In a third instance, Chinn bought and sold Firemans Fund Corp.
stock on Oct. 23, 1985. It wasn't until mid-afternoon of the day he
bought and sold it that Chinn directed that 2,000 of the shares be
assigned to Meese's account. That transaction earned Meese more
than $900.
   Levin said Chinn assigned purchases to Meese's and his other
customers' accounts ``after it was known whether the purchase would
yield a profit or loss.
   ``It appears that Mr. Chinn was able to decide just which of his
clients would get profits and which would get losses,'' the senator
said in his letter to the ethics office.
   One of Chinn's lawyers, Cristina Arguedas, said that her
client's stock trading has been examined at length by independent
counsel James McKay, who is conducting a criminal investigation of
Meese. She said the independent counsel has found no wrongdoing in
connection with the stock trading.
   One of Meese's attorneys, Nathan Lewin, said the attorney
general had set up a limited blind partnership with Chinn's company
under which Meese was kept unaware of any of the details of Chinn's
stock trading. Lewin noted that Meese lost money on five of the 23
stock transactions.
   Chinn was indicted Dec. 22 with longtime Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach and a business associate, R. Kent London, on racketeering,
fraud and conspiracy charges in an alleged scheme to extract
payments from Wedtech in order to influence Meese and other federal
officials. All three have pleaded innocent.
   Meese's involvement with Wedtech has been under criminal
investigation by independent counsel James McKay since last May 11.
The attorney general has denied wrongdoing.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday overturned the
Texas ban on Florida citrus fruit, and state officials began
planning their next legal move against regulations allowing the
shipments.
   The ban was imposed last month ban after the U.S. Department of
Agriculture lifted a 3{-year-old federal quarantine on Florida
citrus that was prompted by outbreaks of citrus canker in Florida.
   Texas agriculture officials said the ban was necessary to
protect Texas' $65 million-a-year citrus industry from canker.
   The state now plans to seek an injunction against new federal
rules that allow shipment of Florida citrus meeting certain
standards to other citrus-producing states, said Max Woodfin,
spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   U.S. District Judge James Nowlin said Tuesday that he lifted the
state ban, imposed last month after the new federal rule took
effect, because the federal regulation took precedence over the
state rule.
   The ban was due to end March 12, when Texas officials planned to
have gathered information on the federal rule and take some
permanent action.
   ``We feel we need to do whatever we can to protect the Texas
citrus industry,'' Woodfin said.
   The injunction request will charge that the federal rule was
issued abruptly and did not allow sufficient time to study its
possible effects, he said.
   Florida Citrus Mutual, a growers association, and Tuxedo Fruit
Co., a Florida shipper and grower, sued Texas last month to stop
the emergency state quarantine.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and Agriculture Commissioner Doyle
Conner joined the court action.
   The lawsuit called the ban unconstitutional and invalid. It said
the action would mean a loss of millions of dollars to the Florida
citrus industry.
   ``We expected this decision,'' Conner said. ``Federal rules and
regulations supersede state rules and regulations as it pertains to
plant matters. The law's a little different between plant and
animal.''
   Canker, which can seriously damage citrus plants and fruit, was
found in Florida in 1984. Florida officials said Florida producers
must meet strict standards under the new federal regulation in
order to ship fruit to citrus-producing states, including Texas.
   Robert Griffith, chief of the bureau of pest eradication for the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Service, said he had
never heard of canker being found on mature citrus fruit that was
ready to be shipped.
   It would be difficult to transmit canker from fruit to citrus
groves, he said.

<HEAD>Chancellor Raises Possibility Of New Elections Over Tax Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The coalition government of Socialists
and conservatives, already under strain because of the Kurt
Waldheim affair, could collapse over tax reform, according to
comments by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky on Tuesday.
   The coalition has been strained for months over President
Waldheim's World War II activities, and Vranitzky said again
Tuesday he would consider resigning if that issue continued to
affect his government's work.
   But Socialist Vranitzky, speaking with reporters after a Cabinet
session, dealt mainly with tax legislation.
   He said it was possible he would meet again this week with Vice
Chancellor Alois Mock in a last-ditch effort to reach agreement on
tax reform.
   Mock is chairman of the conservative Austrian People's Party.
Waldheim, running as the conservative candidate, won the
presidential election in June 1986. The term for the mainly titular
presidency is for six years, and Waldheim has rejected critics'
demands that he resign.
   Vranitzky said the question of new elections ``would lie close
at hand'' if the tax dispute is not resolved.
   The last parliamentary elections were held on Nov. 23, 1986, for
four-year terms.
   Vranitzky was asked about early elections and he said, ``I do
not seek them but I do not shy away from them either.''
   Mock and Vranitzky have had several inconclusive meetings on the
proposed tax reform.
   The Socialists insist that a major gap in the budget cannot be
filled without imposing a tax on savings deposit interest. The
conservatives strongly oppose such a tax.
   Some political observers have said the combined tax dispute and
controversy over Waldheim may be too much for the coalition to
survive.
   Vranitzky, criticizing Waldheim, said it was not enough for the
president to keep restating his position.
   He said Waldheim would have to contribute to resolving the
crisis over his presidency ``in word and deed,'' but added he did
not want to elaborate.
   Waldheim served as a lieutenant in the German army in the
Balkans during World War II. The World Jewish Congress and other
groups say he was involved with army units that deported thousands
of Jews and other people from the area to Nazi labor or death camps.
   An international commission of six historians, appointed by the
Austrian government to investigate Waldheim's past, said he was
``in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the Balkans and
knew they were going on but made no attempt to prevent them.
   The report, released last month, did not support allegations
that Waldheim was involved in atrocities. But it left open the
question of whether he was guilty of any crime.
   Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary-general, has repeatedly denied
any wrongdoings during the war.

   The Derbyshire County Council
suggested a compromise Tuesday in its campaign to have 16th century
Chesterfield School replace a Latin motto on its stationery with an
anti-nuclear slogan.
   The left-dominated council, which runs the boys' preparatory
school in north-central England, had told the school to stop using
stationery bearing a coat of arms and the motto ``Non quo sed
quomodo'' _ ``Not whither but in what manner.''
   The school was told to use standard-issue council letter paper
bearing the slogan ``Derbyshire Council Council supports
nuclear-free zones,'' according to Headmaster Geoffrey Price.
   Price opposed the idea, and Conservative member of Parliament
Peter Rost said Tuesday he would ask Education Secretary Kenneth
Baker to intervene.
   Later Tuesday, the council's Labor Party leader, David
Bookbinder, said the council would have no objection to the school
keeping its motto on the stationery as long as it used the slogan
as well.
   Price said he welcomed the compromise but was puzzled by it.
   ``I have been suggesting this for a year or more but was told it
was unacceptable,'' he said. ``However, so let it be.''
   Chesterfield School was founded in 1594.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson said Tuesday he will drop his libel suit against former
Rep. Pete McCloskey rather than go to trial on Super Tuesday, the
biggest day of the primary season.
   Robertson, who was accused of avoiding combat duty in the Korean
War through his father's influence, said he wants to take the case
to voluntary arbitration in an effort to clear his and his father's
names. But he said if McCloskey refuses to do that he will drop the
suit anyway.
   McCloskey's lawyer, George Lehner, said a proposal to use
arbitration was rejected by Robertson's lawyers nine months ago,
and he said to propose it on the eve of trial ``is a little
disingenuous'' and ``a red herring.''
   Lehner has said repeatedly that McCloskey will not agree to
settlement in the case unless Robertson pays legal fees _ estimated
at $400,000 _ piled up by the former congressmen.
   ``We are prepared to go to trial,'' Lehner said after learning
of Robertson's announcement. ``If he wants to drop the suit,'' the
lawyer said, Robertson must ``pay the legal fees'' amassed by
McCloskey to defend the case.
   McCloskey said it's ``not for him (Robertson) to decide'' to
drop the suit, saying he would oppose any motion by Robertson to
dismiss the case.
   ``I would rather go to trial. He's called me a liar all over the
United States,'' McCloskey said in a telephone interview. ``I would
much prefer there be a verdict as to which of us has told the
truth.''
   Robertson's $35 million suit accuses McCloskey of defaming him
in a widely publicized letter contending the former television
evangelist had used the influence of his father, the late Sen. A.
Willis Robertson, to avoid combat duty in the Korean War as a
Marine Corps officer.
   The case had been scheduled for next Tuesday, the same date as
Republican primaries and caucuses in 17 states, including Florida
where Robertson was campaigning.
   ``In order to compete in that trial I would have to break off my
campaign today and run the risk of losing Florida, Texas, South
Carolina and other parts of the South,'' Robertson said at an
airport news conference. ``That was an impossible decision for me
to make and an unfair one.''
   He has proposed that the issue be resolved by the Iowa Libel
Dispute Program run jointly by the University of Iowa College of
Law and the American Arbitration Association.
   Robertson said if McCloskey refuses arbitration he would take
pre-trial evidence and testimony already collected to an
unspecified panel of experts and have them give a public opinion on
McCloskey's contentions.
   ``If he doesn't (go to arbitration), we will prove to the
American people that he truly doesn't want the truth to come out,''
Robertson said.
   At another news conference later in Orlando, Robertson
complained about the judge's actions, saying: ``She has done
everything she can to get us to drop the case. I have done
everything I could to make a settlement based on the truth.''
   In his letter, McCloskey wrote that he and Robertson had been on
the same Korea-bound troop ship in 1951 but that Robertson was
taken off the vessel in Japan where he was given a non-combat post
after telling other Marines his father would arrange a transfer.
   McCloskey also wrote that when Robertson later was sent to Korea
he was known as the ``division liquor officer'' because he made
frequent trips to Japan.
   Robertson has denied that his father used any influence to get
him off the troop ship.
   While campaigning in Miami on Monday, Robertson called McCloskey
a ``pathological liar'' and charged that he circulated the Korea
story in an effort to hurt Robertson's political campaign.
   He also contended McCloskey is a supporter of Vice President
George Bush, one of Robertson's opponents in the campaign for the
GOP presidential nomination.

   More than 500 military police
troopers fought about 2,500 striking coal miners in southern Brazil
on Tuesday and dozens of people were injured, according to a union
lawyer and a state senator.
   The melee took place in Criciuma, a town in southern Santa
Catarina state, 800 miles southwest of Rio.
   The union lawyer, Alfredo Gava, told The Associated Press by
telephone from the region, ``Many miners from other companies and
townspeople joined in the protest, which turned the city center
into a war zone. By the end, there were more than 5,000 people
throwing rocks and objects.''
   Gava said at least 30 police and miners were injured and one
miner was arrested. The chief of local police, Luis Gonzaga
Schmidt, reported that five people were held for a few hours, then
were let go.
   The chief put the number of injured _ police, miners and others
caught up in the turmoil _ at 20.
   However, State Sen. Itamar da Silva, who was at the site of the
brawl, said that 33 military police and 33 miners were hurt.
   Authorities said the troopers were under orders not to attack
the strikers, but retaliated when they themselves came under attack.
   Gava said the trouble began when police tried to remove striking
mine workers who were demonstrating peacefully in front of a branch
of the government-run bank, Banco do Brasil.
   ``The downtown square was almost completely destroyed,'' Gava
reported. ``Miners pulled down walls to break up the bricks for
ammunition against police and stoned houses and office buildings in
the immediate area.''
   TV Globo, Brazil's largest private network, showed a burning
motorbike in the square and military police with truncheons and
behind big shields rushing at miners. Troopers threw tear gas and
exploded concussion bombs to disperse the mob.
   Gava said the miners had been striking for 21 days to force
Carbonifera Prospera Mining Co. to adhere to a Jan. 1 agreement for
a 145 percent pay raise to make up for losses to 17 percent monthly
inflation. Pay scales were not immediately available.
   The company, along with five others in Criciuma, signed the
accord, but while the others paid up, Prospera went back on the
deal after the company was sold to the government-run National
Steel Co., Gava said.
   Company representatives said over TV Globo that Prospera's
responsibility to adhere to the agreement ended with the sale of
the company.
   TV Globo said the company had agreed to meet with union
representatives Wednesday.
   Da Silva, a Social Democrat, called the attack on the strikers
``unmotivated'' and said the state senate would investigate the
fray.

   A 77-year-old man who told authorities
he shot and killed his ailing wife in a nursing home so she
wouldn't have to ``go through any more pain'' was charged Tuesday
with first- and second-degree murder.
   Oscar Carlson of Evansville is accused of killing Agnes Carlson,
71, who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease.
   Mrs. Carlson, who was a cleaning woman in a doctor's office
before being stricken with Alzheimer's, was shot four times with a
.22-caliber pistol Monday at Crestview Manor Nursing Home in
Evansville, said Douglas County Sheriff Terry Eilers.
   Carlson, a former farmer and bus driver, was arrested without
incident at the nursing home and was being held in the county jail
in Alexandria, the sheriff said. The couple had three children.
   Judge Paul Ballard set bond at $100,000 Tuesday and scheduled a
second hearing Monday to determine when Carlson could be released,
Eilers said.
   ``We're planning on convening a grand jury relatively soon,''
Douglas County attorney Ann Carrott said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Carlson had been a patient at the home periodically and was
to undergo surgery Monday for a broken hip she suffered Sunday in a
fall, Eilers said.
   Carlson told nursing home administrators he wanted to visit his
wife before she was taken to the hospital and he went to her room,
Eilers said.
   Police were called when shots were heard, and authorities found
Carlson slumped over the victim's body, Eilers said.
   ``He said he realized what he was doing and he would have to
come with us,'' Eilers said. ``He stated to us he planned this
because he did not want her to suffer any more. He said he didn't
want her to go through any more pain.''
   Asked if Carlson had indicated whether he had discussed the
action with his wife, Eilers said: ``His wife was unable to discuss
anything with anybody.'' He said she was in very advanced stages of
Alzheimer's, a degenerative disease of the central nervous system
characterized especially by premature senility.
   The first-degree murder charge alleges that the killing was
premeditated, while state law defines second-degree murder as a
spontaneous killing.

<TEXT>
   Four Libyan warplanes landed Tuesday at an
airfield beside a Sahara oasis and their crew members asked for
political asylum in Egypt, the government's Middle East News Agency
reported.
   A source at Cairo International Airport, speaking on condition
of anonymity under security regulations, said the two-seater,
Soviet-made MiG-23s landed at the military base in Siwa Oasis, 385
miles west of Cairo and 30 miles east of the Libyan border.
   The source said all the crewmembers requested political asylum,
but he did not specify how many there were.
   Egyptian authorities are considering the asylum requests, the
source said.
   The Middle East News Agency _ MENA _ reported the landings in a
brief report that was carried by television.
   MENA said the planes were MiG-23 jet fighters and they landed at
1:09 p.m.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies
said in its book ``The Military Balance 1987-1988'' that Libya's
10,000-man air force has 198 MiG-23s.
   Last year, the crews of three Libyan aircraft defected to Egypt.
   In March, the five-member crew of a U.S.-built C-130 Hercules
cargo plane landed at Abu Simbel in southern Egypt.
   The four-engine transport reportedly was on its way from Libya
to Chad. The Libyan media reported the pilot lost his way in a
sandstorm and the crewmen were taken prisoner along with their
plane by the Egyptians when they strayed hundreds of miles and
landed at Abu Simbel.
   Later that month, a Chinook helicopter's pilot asked for
permission to enter Egyptian airspace, then landed at Marsa
Matrouh, a port on the northwestern coast near the Libyan frontier.
   And in July 1987, an Mi-8 helicopter landed at a western Egypt
airfield after a pursuing Libyan fighter broke off the chase as
Egyptian interceptors met it at the border.
   President Hosni Mubarak's government has returned one of the
aircraft, but it has not said which one or given information about
the others.
   Egypt and Libya have been enemies since the early 1970s, when
the late President Anwar Sadat spurned a move by Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi to merge the two North African countries.
   After a series of terrorist bombings in Egypt that Sadat blamed
on Libya, the two fought a brief border war in 1977.

<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham was told that one of his
aides might have committed a felony, tampering with a grand jury
witness, the governor's former chief of security testified at
Mecham's impeachment trial Tuesday.
   As the opening day of testimony closed in the first impeachment
trial of a U.S. governor in six decades, lawyers were questioning
Charles ``Beau'' Johnson, who once supervised security for the
governor's every move.
   Mecham has said under oath that he was not told about an alleged
death threat by one of his aides against a grand jury witness and
wasn't aware it might have been a crime.
   Johnson's testimony came at the end of a day that featured
opening statements by both sides, a state Supreme Court refusal to
stop the impeachment trial, and confusion over whether Mecham had
tried from his suburban ``government in exile'' to contact the
trial's first witness during a lunch break. There also was a lower
court ruling refusing a move by Mecham supporters to block a recall
election scheduled for May.
   Johnson said he went to the governor as soon as he knew about
the situation and researched the law to determine that if the
allegation was true it was a felony.
   The governor has claimed that Johnson ``mumbled'' when they
talked and said nothing about the possibly criminal nature of the
situation. Mecham is accused of obstructing justice by thwarting
the official investigation of the alleged threat.
   Johnson insisted he personally told the governor a felony might
have occurred.
   ``Lieutenant, is there any question in your mind that the
governor understood the problem?''asked prosecutor William French.
   ``He never asked me to repeat anything,'' said Johnson.
   However, he said he never mentioned the words, ``death threat.''
   Frank Martinez, a state Department of Public Safety officer who
testified both Tuesday morning and afternoon, told the Senate he
hung up the phone before the governor could talk to him.
   Mecham, absent from the impeachment trial for a second day,
issued a statement denying the story. His spokesman said the
governor made a mistake and asked for the wrong officer, asking for
``Frank'' when he meant ``Dave.''
   On Tuesday night, Department of Public Safety Sgt. Allan Schmidt
said the incident had been difficult to sort out, but ``we accept
that the scenario they (the governor's office) are putting out is
accurate.''
   He said a mistake may have been made in trying to put Martinez
in touch with Mecham.
   In his ruling, the state Supreme Court denied the request by
Mecham's lawyers in a 4-0 ruling. The governor's lawyers had
contended that his constitutional right to a fair trial in criminal
court would be jeopardized by allowing the impeachment to proceed
now.
   However, the Supreme Court said the Senate's impeachment trial
is not a criminal proceeding. Rather, the court said, the
impeachment trial is a legislative proceeding solely intended to
decide whether to remove a state officer.
   Friday, the court had denied a request from Mecham's lawyers
that it delay Monday's start of the impeachment trial. The court
had said it would consider during its Tuesday conference a request
from Mecham's lawyers for an injunction against the trial.
   The governor was the subject of both praise and denunications as
attorneys delivered opening statements.
   ``There's something wrong in this state when you can take an
elected official and throw the book at him ... on the basis of
witnesses who have a stake in his being outsted,'' defense attorney
Fred Craft said in a loud, feverish statement to state senators who
are sitting as judge and jury.
   ``What the facts are going to demonstrate is you had a mutiny,''
said Craft, Mecham's former lobbyist in Washington. Several of the
officials involved in allegations against Mecham, he noted, were in
office before Mecham was inaugurated in January 1987.
   The attorney, warning of personal attacks to come on Mecham
associates, said he might be forced to ``take our dirty laundry out
and lay it before the world.''
   It has been reported that Craft will attack the credibility of
Director of Public Safety Ralph Milstead, one of the key witnesses
against Mecham, by alleging Milstead had sexual affairs with
members of his staff.
   Milstead issued a short statement Tuesday afternoon saying the
sexual allegations are ``a ridiculous bunch of lies and
intolerable.''
   Craft's emotional opening followed a quieter presentation by
prosecutor William French, who said he would prove the governor
broke the law when he allegedly ordered Milstead to resist
cooperating with an investigation of an alleged death threat by a
Mecham aide.
   ``The governor's conduct surrounding this threat was positively
wrong, without lawful authority. He violated his oath of office and
obstructed justice,'' said French.
   French, who is serving as a prosecutor for the state House,
warned senators that the defense would try to divert their
attention from the governor and to ``prosecute'' others. He
implored them: ``Don't be distracted. Keep your eye on the ball.''
   With Mecham again absent from the proceedings which could end
his political career, testimony began on the first of three charges
against him _ the obstruction of justice allegation.
   Mecham, a Republican, also is accused of improperly concealing a
$350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by loaning it to his car dealership.
   The opening statements Tuesday only dealt with the alleged
threat because the Senate agreed to consider one section of the
articles of impeachment at a time.
   In his testinomy, Martinez offered a rough outline of the events
behind the obstruction of justice claim.
   The 28 senators present Tuesday in the contemporary, reddih
wood-paneled Senate chamber listened intently as Martinez spoke
from the witness stand elevated at the front of the semi-circular
room. Seated next to the witness stand was Frank X. Gordon, chief
justice of the Arizona Supreme Court, who is serving as referee in
the proceeding. Four clerks sat below Gordon.
   Several senators, seated at individual desks, took notes on
yellow legal pads.
   The gallery was only partly filled with spectators and
reporters, including former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman,
who went to prison in the Watergate scandal and is covering the
impeachment proceeding for Rolling Stone magazine.
   Martinez, who was assigned to Mecham's security detail, said he
was on duty last Nov. 13 when Mecham administration official Peggy
Griffith came to the detail's office appearing ``nervous, excited
and in need to speak to someone.''
   Martinez said Mrs. Griffith spilled out details of a parking lot
confrontation with Lee Watkins, a senior aide of the governor, in
which Watkins allegedly threatened the life of another Mecham
assistant, Donna Carlson, who was believed to be testifying before
a grand jury investigating the loan.
   He said Mrs. Griffith told of being confronted by Watkins who
said: ``Your friend's been a naughty girl.''
   ``Mr. Watkins then went on to say if she (Ms. Carlson) kept
acting as she did she could take a long boat ride,'' Martinez said,
quoting Mrs. Griffith.
   The officer said he reported the matter to his superior, Lt.
Beau Johnson, who consulted others. Eventually, it was reported to
the attorney general's office, he said.
   The end result, Martinez said, was a meeting with Milstead two
days later in which Johnson was removed from command of the
governor's security detail.
   ``What did Mr. Milstead say?'' asked prosecutor Paul Eckstein.
   ``That he had advised the governor what took place,'' said
Martinez. ``... The governor was very upset and angry. He asked for
Lt. Johnson to be transferred. He said he didn't want to have him
cooperating with the attorney general and it would cost Lt. Johnson
his job.''
   Asked why he reported Mrs. Griffith's comments in the first
place, Martinez said: ``In my opinion, the commission of a crime
had taken place.''
   Mecham also faces a May 17 recall election and a March 22 trial
on felony charges accusing him of concealing the loan.
   The recall passed another hurdle Tuesday when Maricopa County
Superior Court Judge Frederick Martone ruled that a pro-Mecham
group, Concerned Arizona Voters, hadn't produced evidence of
widespread fraud in the petition signatures that put the recall on
the ballot.
   ``Plaintiffs have failed to show ... that the consequence of
fraud would be to invalidate enough signatures as to fall below the
constitutional threshold'' for signatures necessary to force a
recall, Martone said. The recall backers had turned in about 80,000
more petition signatures than the minimum needed for a recall vote.
   Concerned Arizona Voters had contended in its suit that the
election should be stopped and a ``special master'' be appointed to
investigate possible fraud.

   Louisiana Assemblies of God church leaders
have rejected a request by national church officials that they
reconsider their sanction against television evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart, a church official confirmed Tuesday.
   The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the 19-member
state presbytery decided to send back its original censure barring
Swaggart from preaching for three months. That decision came Monday
during a nine-hour meeting at Louisiana district headquarters in
Alexandria, La.
   ``The ball's in their court,'' the source said, indicating that
it would now be up to national Assemblies of God officials to
decide whether to abide by the state panel's recommendation.
   There was no immediate comment from the national headquarters in
Springfield, Mo.
   The Rev. Raymond Hudson, general treasurer, said he had no
comment and other officials were not at home Tuesday night. Calls
to the home of spokeswoman Juleen Turnage were met by busy signals.
   The Louisiana Presbytery's original sanction was a two-year
rehabilitation program that also included counseling for Swaggart,
who heads a ministry which reportedly has an annual income of $150
million.
   Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21, telling the
congregation at his Baton Rouge worship center in a tearful
confession that he had sinned against his family and God. Swaggart
reportedly paid a prostitute to pose naked for him and then tried
to make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it.
   The latest development in the scandal surfaced in a story by
KATC-TV in Lafayette, La. The station said it had also learned that
the national presbytery had recommended barring Swaggart from the
pulpit and television for a year, with an additional year of
regulation of his ministry afterwards.
   A Louisiana Assemblies of God official contacted by The
Associated Press Tuesday night confirmed that the state panel had
sent its previous sanction back to the national council. The
official talked only under conditions he not be identified.
   When asked if Louisiana officials had sent back their original
censure to the church's national leaders, the source said, ``It
would be correct to say that.''
   Cecil Janway, the Assemblies of God district superintendent for
Louisiana, said when the state panel met Monday that there would be
no announcement of its decision.
   ``Decisions made by the Louisiana district presbytery today will
be returned to the executive presbytery. There will be no further
announcement or comment from the Louisiana district council,''
Janway said.
   There was no indication whether Swaggart attended that meeting,
which lasted from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The Rev. Jim Rentz, who is
substituting for Swaggart at the Family Worship Center in Baton
Rouge, attended the meeting.
   Forrest Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Louisiana district
council, acknowledged Monday that national Assemblies of God
representatives were at the Alexandria meeting.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Fines Seven Church Members in Child Labor Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A federal judge ruled Tuesday that two
companies who used young people in a church job-training program
had violated child-labor laws and ordered stiff penalties for seven
people who ran the program.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter threatened to fine the seven
$21,000 a day if they continued to use the children, as young as 9
years old. He wrote that the children were ``manifestly being
exploited.''
   Shiloh True Light Church members acknowledged during the January
trial that their children worked at construction sites and in shops
where they carried bricks, laid foundations and more recently,
operated forklifts and power saws.
   They said they had been doing so for at least 100 years.
   Potter ordered McGee Brothers Co. of Union County to pay $98,225
in back wages plus nearly $36,000 in interest. McGee Brothers and
co-defendant Wendell's Woodworking Inc. of Mint Hill also were
ordered to pay nearly $70,000 in court costs.
   Spokesmen for the companies were not immediately available for
comment. There was no answer at the company offices, and their
lawyers were not in their offices.
   U.S. Department of Labor officials in Atlanta said they had not
received a copy of the decision and could not comment on whether
the $21,000-per-day fine was retroactive to Oct. 5, when Potter
issued an order to stop using the children.
   ``The minors are clearly dependent on the defendants' business
for their employment and are the class of person whom the act is
designed to protect,'' Potter wrote in a 58-page opinion.
   ``They are manifestly being exploited by defendants in this
case, whether or not they proclaim their purpose to be in
furtherance of their religious beliefs,'' Potter wrote.
   When the owners of the companies, both church members, continued
the program for the church after Potter's October order, the Labor
Department asked they be found in contempt of the injunction and be
fined $20,000 a day.
   On Tuesday, Potter said Wendell's would be fined $5,000 per day
and its two owners, Wendell Long and Herbert Long, be fined $500
each per day thay they remained in contempt of his order.
   The judge ordered McGee Brothers to pay $10,000 per day and
order five brothers who owned the company to pay $1,000 each per
day that they remained in contempt of the order.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
appeared ready on Tuesday night to resume his diplomatic shuttle in
the Middle East after reporting to President Reagan.
   A U.S. official said Jordan's King Hussein told Shultz at a
three-hour meeting in London earlier Tuesday that he was interested
in Shultz's effort to set up Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hussein
did not directly endorse the U.S. initiative, but told Shultz he
appreciated the effort being made to open talks.
   ``It was a serious discussion, covering the whole waterfront,''
the official said. ``Nobody is saying yes or no.''
   A statement issued by the Jordanian Embassy in London said
Hussein reiterated Jordan's position that an international peace
conference should be attended by the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France _ and ``all parties to the conflict, including
the Palestine Liberation Organization.''
   Shultz arranged to confer with Reagan briefly Tuesday night and
more fully on Wednesday before Reagan begins his talks in the
Belgian capital with 15 other allied leaders attending a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit.
   Shultz would return to the Middle East at the conclusion of the
summit Thursday night and try over the next two days to get
acceptance of the U.S. formula for negotiations to deal with both
Palestinian unrest in areas under Israeli control and an overall
Arab-Israeli settlement.
   ``He's a key, in my opinion,'' Shultz said of Hussein before
their meeting at the king's residence in London's Kensington
district.
   ``He has immense standing and is a person who has been here a
long time.'' Talking to reporters on the way to London from the
Middle East, Shultz acknowledged he made little progress in four
days of shuttle diplomacy.
   He said he could detect a narrowing of differences, but ``I
don't know if I could describe them in any way that would be
perceptible to anyone else.''
   Yet, Shultz said, ``assuming everyone continues the attitude
they have to keep working, to keep working, we'll do it.''
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, however, in his first comment
on his talks with Shultz, said Tuesday he had reservations about
the U.S. plan and he would disclose them only after a final formula
was reached.
   Mubarak and Shultz conferred in Egypt Sunday. Mubarak spoke to
reporters while visiting neighboring Sudan. Egypt's Middle East
News Agency carried his statements from Khartoum.
   In Amman Monday, reporters were told that Jordan was not putting
pressure on the PLO to form a mixed negotiating delegation for
peace talks with Israel.
   Instead, it was reported, Jordan had taken the position the PLO
was the sole representative of the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs
who live on the Israel-held West Bank and in Gaza, where clashes
have killed more than 70 Arabs.
   The U.S. proposal calls for Israel, Jordan and Palestinians to
open negotiations about April 1 on self-rule for the Palestinians
in Israeli-held territory. Talks on an overall Mideast settlement
would begin by December.
   Shultz met twice with Jordanian officials, but he had to seek an
authoritative answer from Hussein, who was in London for dental
treatment.
   Diplomatic sources in Jerusalem, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Shultz told Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel
he would return to the Middle East after the NATO summit if Hussein
gave at least qualified support to the U.S. proposal.
   On his flight to London, Shultz stressed a need for the United
States to step up contacts with Palestinians.
   Shultz confirmed the United States had persuaded Israel to relax
restrictions in permitting two Palestinians, Hanna Siniora, a
Jerusalem editor, and Fayez Abu Rahme, a Gaza lawyer, to go to
Washington to meet with him five weeks ago.
   ``We have communicated with them in some important, substantive
ways,'' Shultz said of U.S. approaches to the Palestinians.
   He said he had got the Palestinians' reaction indirectly while
in the Middle East from Egypt and Jordan.
   ``It isn't as though there's no feedback, '' Shultz said.
``There is feedback. It's not a substitute for directly sitting
down with people, and that in a sense is what we've been calling
for all along. In the end we've got to sit down together, so we
have made a major effort to communicate with them.''
   A group of 15 Palestinians invited to meet with Shultz in
Jerusalem Friday did not show up under PLO orders. He was similarly
snubbed in October on a trip to the Middle East.

   Jewish settlers distributed leaflets warning
Arabs that rioting in the occupied lands will ``bring destruction
upon you'' and held a protest in Tel Aviv calling for harsh
treatment of the rioters.
   Earlier Monday, two Palestinians died of gunshot wounds
inflicted in clashes with Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank,
and two Arabs were wounded by Israeli gunfire in the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   In another development, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Monday
said he did not reject the recommendation of some Cabinet members
that the occupied lands be closed to media coverage. ``If it
becomes clear that indeed it may limit the damage, I would be
willing to consider it,'' he said.

will talk about human rights and budget problems, alliance
officials say.
   Leaders of the 16 NATO countries meet Wednesday and Thursday. In
their closing declaration, they are expected to stress support for
strengthening the 1975 Helsinki Accords on respecting basic human
rights such as freedom to emigrate and to dissent.
   ``What is at the core of underlying tensions in East-West
relations is the human dimension,'' Alton G. Keel Jr., the U.S.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge is flashing warning signs of an economic slowdown this year,
but most economists believe the country will be able to escape
without a recession.
   These analysts believe that economic activity will slow
dramatically in the current January-March quarter as businesses cut
production plans in order to work off high backlogs of unsold goods.
   This weak growth will be followed by an improving economic
performance for the rest of 1988 as strength in U.S. exports
offsets lackluster consumer spending, many economists believe.

   President Reagan's imposition of economic
sanctions on Panama for alleged drug running is merely symbolic
because the penalties prescribed under U.S. law already have been
applied against the country, according to U.S. officials.
   The formal application of the drug trafficking sanctions law,
expected today, will have little effect on Panama, a senior U.S.
official said Monday.
   Under a 1986 law, Reagan is required to take punitive measures
against countries found not to cooperate in curbing drug smuggling
to the United States. Countries which are ``decertified'' are
subject to the penalties.

conviction was almost certain.
   During the second day of Mecham's impeachment trial today,
prosecution and defense attorneys planned to make opening

_ that he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death
threat by a state official.
   Also, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule today on a

governor in 59 years, should be delayed until after Mecham's March

presidential field was scattered across the Super Tuesday landscape
today after a forum in which Rep. Richard Gephardt was singled out
for attacks on his trade policy, tax vote and the contributions he

   In one of the liveliest debates of the campaign, the Democrats

   While serving in the German army, Kurt
Waldheim forwarded a request for the mass deportation of Greek
civilians to labor camps in 1943, according to a key Nazi document.
   The authenticity of the document, found in the U.S. National
Archives and made public Monday, was confirmed by U.S. Justice
Department spokesman John Russell. He said it was among the crucial
documents on which the government based its decision to place
Waldheim, now Austria's president and formerly U.N.
secretary-general, on a list barring him from entering the United
States.
   Under the Nuremberg Charter adopted at the end of the war,
deportation of civilians is both a war crime and a crime against
humanity. When the U.S. Justice Department barred Waldheim from the
United States, it said he had ``assisted or otherwise
participated'' in ``mass deportation of civilians.''

   The pollutants that cause acid rain may be

   The theory, which has not yet been tested, is an attempt to
explain why colon cancer and other cancers are more common in the
north central and northeastern United States than in other parts of
the country, said Cedric Garland of the University of California,
San Diego and his brother Frank of the Naval Health Research Center
in San Diego.
   According to their theory, sulfur dioxide, one of the principal
contributors to acid rain, absorbs certain ultraviolet rays in
sunlight that trigger the skin to produce vitamin D. Studies by
Cedric Garland and others have suggested that vitamin D may help
protect against colon cancer.

   The National Transportation Safety Board said the most common
abuse of the car safety belts is that they are worn too loosely or

   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov suggested that
the Sunday unrest in Sumgait, as well as demonstrations and other

territory composed largely of Armenians was made part of
neighboring Azerbaidzhan.

   The government said Tuesday that its chief
barometer of future economic activity fell again in January, but an
upward revision in December eased fears that the nation was headed
for a recession.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
dropped 0.6 percent in January. Analysts discounted the sharp
decline and instead focused on a revision that changed the index's
showing in December from a 0.2 percent decline to a 0.3 percent
increase.
   The upward revision for December broke a string of three
consecutive monthly declines, which has often in the past been the
signal of an impending recession. The index had fallen 0.1 percent
in October and 1.1 percent in November.

<HEAD>Acting With Hepburn Like Playing Baseball with Babe Ruth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actress Karen Austin says she hasn't quite found
the words to describe what it was like to work with screen legend
Katharine Hepburn in the NBC movie ``Laura Lansing Slept Here,''
but she gives it a shot.
   ``I was intimidated, I was exhilarated, I was overwhelmed, I was
inspired, all those things. I don't know, it's like a kid getting
to play baseball with Babe Ruth,'' said Austin. The made-for-TV
movie airs Monday.
   ``She has a great sense of humor about herself. She has no
reverence about herself as an icon. The fact that other people
regard her so highly is, I think, a source of benign amusement for
her.''
   Austin, who starred in the first season of ``Night Court'' and
later had a recurring role on ``St. Elsewhere,'' plays Melody
Gomphers, a suburban housewife whose life is turned upside-down
when a publisher bets a fabulously wealthy novelist that she can't
stand to live with a typical American family for a week.
   ``It's a gentle comedy,'' Austin says. ``You can imagine her
descending on suburbia in full sail, with chauffeur and luggage.
It's a great part for her, and she's costumed wonderfully, hats and
Tibetan jewelry and exotic clothes. I kept my hair in a braid,
little housedress. It was kind of fun finding a character that was
realistic, but also would contrast well with her. That was my aim,
really, was to be a backdrop as much as anything for her, a
springboard.''
   Hepburn plays Laura Lansing, a famous, relentlessly spunky
author whose publisher (Lee Richardson) says she should give up
writing because she's lost touch with the common people.
   He bets her she can't stand to stay for a week with the
Gompherses and their three children in their little tract house in
Hicksville on Long Island.
   It's a cute movie. Lansing expects to find a little gingham
world, not a soap-opera plot with a philandering husband, crabby
kids and a rebellious teen-ager on the road to juvenile delinquency.
   For their part, the Gompherses are awe-struck when their famous
guest arrives, cowing them to the point that they sit silently in
the living room, terrified to turn on the television or make any
noise that would disturb her.
   ``Is this what you do in the evening,'' Lansing asks innocently
when she emerges to find them all lined up on the sofa, ``sit in
silent meditation?''
   Joel Higgins plays Walter Gomphers. Schuyler Grant, who is
Hepburn's grand-niece in real life, plays the Gomphers' teen-age
daughter. Sean Harmon plays their prepubescent son, and twins Ryan
and Kyle Comber play 17-month-old Malcolm.
   ``Katharine's grand-niece (Grant) and I used to sit around,''
said Austin, ``and I would try to explain to her, because to her
it's just Aunt Katie, but I would try and explain to her what it
was like for me to work with her aunt.''
   In real life, Hepburn did descend on suburbia in Vancouver where
the movie was shot last year.
   ``The neighbors actually would go away when we asked them to,''
Austin says with wonder. ``They'd be crowding over the fence taking
pictures, and she'd say, `Go away, now. Go away, don't do that.'
And they would actually leave. They were so polite and respectful.
You can imagine what they would do in New York City?''
   Hepburn, Austin said, ``knows what quality is, and it's great to
be around someone whose standards will not be compromised, and who
has the clout to just say, `Well, we can't do it this way,' and
everybody says, `Well, we can't, I guess we can't.' And then it
gets done right. It's great.''

   `LATE NIGHT' IN LONDON, `TODAY' ON ORIENT EXPRESS _ ``Late Night
with David Letterman'' has settled on dates for its London run, May
3-6, at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Though Britons have been able
to see ``Late Night'' once a week since last year, they won't see
the four London shows until sometime in the future. Says producer
Robert Morton, ``We plan to do basically the same program we do
here in New York, except that we'll have new audiences that
hopefully speak the same language we do.'' The following week,
NBC's ``Today'' show will do five shows from aboard the famed
train, the Orient Express, starting in Paris with stops in Zurich,
Munich, Vienna and Venice. ...

   This is a deal you might want to consider, and
one that you might want to reconsider after learning the facts.
   This is the deal:
   Under Section 7623, the Internal Revenue Service can pay
tipsters who provide information that leads to detection and
punishment of tax violators.
   You know your neighbor is cheating; you consider turning him in.
   ``Why not?'' you ask yourself. ``I have to pay, and most of the
people I know have to pay. And what my neighbor doesn't pay means
higher payments for honest taxpayers.''
   Besides, you might add, the extra money can help in paying what
you owe.
   On investigating further, you learn that 7,853 claims for
rewards were filed in 1986, and that Uncle Sam recovered
$258,372,880 in taxes as a result of the program. That's big money;
you'd like a share of it.
   Spurred by the possibility, you continue your research.
   You learn that if you provide specific and responsible
information that prompts an investigation and aids the IRS in
determining the amount of taxes due, you are entitled to 10 percent
of the first $75,000 recovered.
   You may be entitled to 5 percent of the first $75,000 if your
information leads to the recovery of taxes but is considered of
value only in determining the amount due, rather than being the
cause of the investigation.
   And you learn, finally, that if your tip brings about an
investigation but is of no value in determining the tax due, you
may be eligible for 1 percent of the first $75,000.
   The rewards don't end with the first $75,000, but the
percentages change. However, your information must be, as the IRS
states, ``specific and responsible.'' And the dollar basis for the
reward is computed only on the amount of tax collected that
wouldn't otherwise be collected. Fair enough.
   But as you dig into the details you may begin to have doubts.
You learn that of the 7,853 claims filed in 1986, only 820 resulted
in payoffs to tipsters. And on average they didn't get very much.
   The total of all rewards was $1,307,000, meaning an average
payout of $1,600. In other words and numbers, the percentage of
reward to taxes collected came to less than one-half of 1 percent,
a decidedly small finder's fee.
   ``The IRS is the real winner in the tipster program,'' says Bob
Doyle, speaking for associates Ed Graves and Jim Ivers, who
researched this data for clients of their newsletter, ``On The
Money.''
   The three men aren't just editors. All are authorities on
financial matters _ Doyle on investments and tax shelters, Graves
on insurance, Ivers on taxes and financial planning _ and all are
professors at American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa.
   It might be added that American College is where many of the
nation's financial advisers, such as Chartered Life Underwriters
and Chartered Financial Consultants, are trained.
   It is from that vantage point that they declare the IRS rather
than the taxpayer to be the real winner.
   They observe that while the total collected in 1986 was more
than 20 times the amount obtained in 1982, the percentage of reward
to taxes collected was the lowest.
   One more item: The IRS classifies the rewards as taxable income.

<HEAD>Among Presidential Candidates, Robertson Toughest on Tobacco</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is another in an occasional series of stories examining
the presidential candidates' stands on major issues in Campaign '88</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson, a reformed
pack-and-a-half-a-day smoker, is taking the toughest stand against
tobacco among the 10 presidential candidates. Most of his rivals,
campaigning in the tobacco belt in advance of Super Tuesday,
support the government's tobacco price support program.
   In response to a survey by The Associated Press, nearly all the
candidates said they would maintain or intensify efforts to
discourage people from smoking. Seven of 10 said they back the
government's price support program.
   But Robertson wants to snuff out the tobacco industry entirely
over 10 years and stiffen taxes on cigarettes to help pay for
long-term health care for the elderly.
   The AP surveyed the candidates about tobacco and smoking as they
gird for the March 8 round of primaries across the South, where
tobacco may no longer be king but remains the top cash crop.
   Tobacco provides wages and benefits of more than $14 billion a
year for 710,000 people across the region.
   With the exception of Robertson and Democrats Gary Hart and Paul
Simon, the candidates favor continuing the price support program
for tobacco, which guarantees growers a minimum price and regulates
how much they can produce.
   Vice President George Bush said, ``I support the law requiring
the tobacco program to be run at no net cost to the federal
government.''
   Bush did not reply to a separate question about whether he would
expand government anti-smoking efforts.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee raised eyebrows at a
Democrats' debate in Iowa in January when he brought up the death
toll caused by smoking and said that despite the 100,000 tobacco
farmers in Tennessee, ``I don't think there should be any public
subsidy of tobacco at all.''
   But in subsequent campaign appearances in the South and again in
response to the AP survey, Gore made clear that he is no critic of
the tobacco price support program, which he said ``does not rely at
all on taxpayers' dollars ... (and) helps many small tobacco
farmers stay in business.''
   Gore added, ``I believe the government should do everything in
its power to educate the public about the hazards associated with
smoking.'' He said he supports stronger warning labels on cigarette
packages.
   Gore, himself, quit growing tobacco on a family farm after his
sister Nancy died of lung cancer in 1984.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson strongly defended the price support
program, although he favors shifting more of its benefits to small,
family farms.
   But Jackson added: ``We have to recognize that 350,000 deaths
per year are related to smoking. The government must beef-up
educational efforts to inform the public of this hazard.'' He said
the government should consider using revenues from the 16-cent
excise tax on cigarettes to assist tobacco farmers who want to
switch to other crops.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said he supports tobacco
price supports, as well as ``a vigorous public health campaign to
encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from
taking up the habit.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said he supports the current
federal tobacco program, as well as a ban on smoking on short
commercial flights and ``an active public education campaign''
against smoking.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who is not campaigning in the Super
Tuesday states, favors doubling the excise tax on cigarettes.
   Of price supports, Simon said: ``The tobacco industry is very
clear about getting the message across that the current tobacco
program does not cost the taxpayers. While that may be true ... the
fact is that smoking costs all of us greatly. I believe we must
expand government efforts to discourage people from smoking.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said it is unlikely
that the United States would ever outlaw smoking. If it eliminated
domestic tobacco production, American smokers would just be forced
to use ``lower quality, imported'' tobacco with ``no real gains in
public health,'' he said.
   Robertson said smoking-related deaths cost the nation at least
$65 billion a year. He called for earmarking revenues from a users'
fee on tobacco ``exclusively for meeting the long-term health care
needs of our older citizens.''
   Robertson has called for a government buyout of farmers' tobacco
allotments over 10 years and tax breaks to allow tobacco companies
to phase out their investments.
   The Associated Press asked all the presidential candidates on
Feb. 11:
   ``Do you support the current federal price support program for
tobacco? Would you expand government efforts to discourage people
from smoking?''
   All replied in writing except Hart, whose positions were
outlined by a campaign aide.
   Here are the Republicans' replies:

   ``One of the most misunderstood aspects of tobacco is the
government price support program, sometimes called `the tobacco
subsidy.' ... The Commodity Credit Corporation, which administers
commodity stabilization programs for USDA, has in the past incurred
minor expenses in the tobacco program _ only $58 million over a
period of 50 years prior to 1984. Meanwhile, federal, state, and
local excise taxes collected from the sale of tobacco products have
exceeded $150 billion.
   ``I have supported efforts to increase public awareness of the
potential dangers of smoking. It seems unlikely that smoking will
be outlawed in the U.S. and tobacco imports will undoubtedly
continue, regardless of U.S. production. In other words, if the
U.S. eliminated tobacco production, those U.S. citizens choosing to
smoke would do so using lower quality, imported foreign tobacco
instead of U.S. produced tobacco.''

   ``Smoking-related deaths are costing the nation at least $65
billion each year ... one-third on direct health care costs, while
the remaining two-thirds _ a whopping $43 billion _ is attributable
to lost job productivity. Ultimately, these staggering costs are
borne by the average citizen _ and nearly 75 percent of Americans
don't even smoke.
   ``It makes no sense that while the Surgeon General's office is
waging a campaign against smoking, the federal government is
involved in price supports for tobacco. And it's illogical for
politicians to bemoan the grave health consequences of tobacco
while, at the same time, supporting its production.
   ``I believe the federal government should get out of tobacco
production, and continue its campaign to educate the public on the
dangers of smoking ... A user fee on tobacco products would serve
as an added incentive to stop smoking. Revenues from such a fee
should be earmarked exclusively for meeting the long-term health

   ``I do not favor direct taxpayer subsidies to farmers who grow
tobacco. However, I do not oppose the tobacco industry's own effort
to provide economic assistance through the existing Commodity
Credit Corporation loan program, which operates at no net cost to
the taxpayer. And I strongly support efforts to encourage tobacco
farmers to diversify so that they can deal with the economic impact

small- and medium-sized farmers who depend on that program to give

the government any money: it's paid for by the people who smoke
cigarettes.
   ``I support measures to ban smoking on commercial airlines on
short flights and to restrict smoking to certain areas on longer
flights. Also, although I do not favor a total ban on advertising
and promotion of tobacco products, I do support an active public
education campaign to inform people of the potential adverse

   Campaign aide Jay Angoff said Hart does not support price
supports because ``it makes no sense on the one hand to pay people
to grow tobacco and then for us as a society to incur the
tremendous costs that tobacco imposes.''
   On anti-smoking efforts, Angoff said Hart ``certainly wouldn't
spend a lot of money on it, but he would use the powers of the

their livelihood from meeting that demand, the federal government
should offer its assistance.
   ``But we have to recognize that 350,000 deaths per year are

protect non-smokers from the adverse effects of smoking. I
generally support legislative efforts to discourage smoking. I am
co-sponsor of legislation that would double the federal excise tax

<BYLINE>Swaggart Oddly Began Belittling Himself Before His Fall^
^By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the month before TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart
was silenced by scandal, his preaching turned from outward attacks
to self-criticism in what ``may have been the outgrowth of his own
sin,'' a researcher says.
   ``He lately started putting himself down,'' says Stephen M.
Winzenburg, a communications professor at Florida Southern College.
``It makes you wonder how much of it was guilt seeping through.
   ``He usually had put others down and pumped himself up as being
greater than anyone else, with an inside, direct line to God. But
then all of a sudden, he started saying these negative, deprecating
things about himself. He seemed to be pointing a finger at himself,
and preaching it to others.''
   Leaders of the Assemblies of God in Swaggart's Louisiana
district initially recommended that he be suspended from preaching
for at least three months because of his reported involvement with
a prostitute. National leaders of the church have asked the
district to review that recommendation, and perhaps make the
penalty more severe.
   Winzenburg, a Catholic whose monitoring project mainly aimed at
timing and comparing fund-raising pitches of TV evangelists, said
he was puzzled when Swaggart began switching his preaching targets.
   ``It was something that hadn't been there before, but now it
makes more sense,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It may have
been the outgrowth of his own sin.
   ``He also started picking on fellow Pentecostals. Before, he had
focused more on attacking Catholics and mainline Protestants. But
now he was denouncing his own kind.''
   From Swaggart's preaching since mid-1987, some of it taped and
broadcast after his Feb. 21 confession to his congregation of
``grievous sin,'' Winzenburg cites these samples of Swaggart's
self-deprecation:
   July l2 _ ``I'm scared to death of money and scared to death of
women. Those two things have caused more creatures' downfall than
any other.''
   Dec. 14 _ ``I'm a poor, pitiful, flawed creature.''
   Dec. 20 _ Taking an odd subject for a Christmas sermon, he
identified himself with Judas, who betrayed Christ.
   Feb. 21 _ Comparing himself to the biblical harlot, Rahab, he
said he was a ``poor, pitiful, scarred, flawed piece of humanity.''
   Samples given of his put-down of other Pentecostals:
   Feb. 24 _ Attacking higher education, he said, ``Even
Pentecostal schools are straying.''
   Feb. 25 _ ``Holy Ghost preachers are falling for seducing
spirits at an alarming rate. This is the paramount danger of the
church.... In supposedly Holy Ghost (Pentecostal) churches, the
pastors never preach on the Holy Spirit.''
   July 24 _ He said that after criticizing the Catholic Church,
``all hell broke loose,'' but he had ``a right to criticize others
because the book (Bible) gives us the right.
   ``If Catholics go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. If
Baptists go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. Even if
Pentecostals go wrong, somebody's got to let them know. That's what
we'll continue to do.''
   Swaggart lodged complaints of sexual misconduct that led to the
ouster of former TV evangelist Jim Bakker and that also bumped a
New Orleans evangelist, Marvin Gorman. Both were ministers of the
Assemblies of God. Gorman reportedly provided evidence that
unseated Swaggart _ pictures of him at a motel with a prostitute.
   Swaggart also has harshly assailed other denominations,
declaring Dec. 13 that ``in most churches in America, you couldn't
get saved if you wanted to.''
   Some of his sharpest assaults on Roman Catholicism seem to have
been toned down lately, Winzenburg said. Some TV stations had
threatened to drop his program if the attacks continued.
   The Louisiana Interchurch Conference, including most major
Protestant and Catholic bodies in the state of Swaggart's
headquarters, in 1983 formally protested his attacks on Catholicism.
   The Rev. James L. Stovall, the conference executive director,
says ``we took it pretty lightly'' when Swaggart denounced
Baptists, Methodists and other Protestants, but when he began
stirring up anti-Catholic venom, ``We had to condemn it.''
   Swaggart has called Catholicism a ``false cult,'' a
``monstrosity of heresy'' and a ``complete contradiction of the
word of God.''
   Roman Catholic Bishop Stanley J. Ott of Baton Rouge, La., met
with Swaggart in 1984 to urge him to stop the attacks, but said
afterward Swaggart continued to ``harbor judgments and make
statements'' about the church that were neither true nor fair.
   The Rev. Robert Furlow, a Catholic permanent deacon and
communications officer for the Baton Rouge diocese, observed
somewhat prophetically before Swaggart's downfall:
   ``When you start attacking others, it can turn in on oneself.
When you're firing rockets around, you're liable to hit yourself in
the foot.''

<HEAD>Paris' Ritz Opens Cooking School and Cordon Bleu Goes Hi-Tech</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two French-cooking schools _ one the oldest, the
other the newest _ are giving the world's gastronomic capital yet
another culinary lift.
   Cordon Bleu, the oldest and most prestigious, has taken on a
high-tech image at a new location in a five-story building that
once was an infirmary.
   The luxurious Ritz Hotel, the newest, is opening its kitchens
April 5 to students of haute cuisine.
   The cachet of the elegant Right Bank hotel is maintained in the
decor of its new basement cooking school, where gleaming
white-tiled spaces and hand-painted murals set the tone.
   The Cordon Bleu, long situated in cramped quarters in the classy
Champ de Mars district under the Eiffel Tower, moved in January to
the building on an anonymous corner of the 15th arrondissement in
southern Paris.
   The school where servants from affluent families long ago
watched cooking demonstrations in an amphitheater now offers every
high-tech amenity, including video screens.
   Both schools offer all levels of instruction up to professional.
   Despite the new home, tradition at the venerable Cordon Bleu
remains intact. The top diploma at the Cordon Bleu is awarded to
students who pass a nine-month session. The Ritz school's top
diploma follows a 12-week course.
   Hardly a newcomer to fine food, the Ritz has been known for its
cuisine since Auguste Escoffier attracted international gastronomes
early in the century. It decided to spread its know-how as part of
an overall renovation plan started by Mohammed Al-Fayed, the
Egyptian entrepreneur who bought the hotel nine years ago.
   ``We feel we're offering unique and superior instruction for a
private cooking school,'' said Gregory Usher, an American who left
the Cordon Bleu to take over the Ritz school's administration.
``Our chefs are tops.''
   The courses are to be supervised by three of the Ritz's own
chefs, all winners of the top professional award, Meilleur Ouvrier
de France. Most daily courses will be handled by two chefs with
credentials from prestigious French restaurants. One, Andre
Guillut, perfected his English while working at restaurants like
l'Orangerie and Ma Cuisine in Los Angeles.
   The up-to-date equipment includes permanently cooled pastry
marbles, the latest in ovens, freezers and mixers. The hotel's meat
smoker will be used for ``charcuterie'' courses, and video outlets
are available for taping recipes.
   Pupils can browse in a reference library, taste wine with the
Ritz's sommelier, and the change and shower after the course in a
special area.
   Across the Seine at Cordon Bleu, in the business since 1896,
it's a whole new world.
   Spanking clean in light greys and blues, today's big-scale
school includes two demonstration rooms, four huge cooking and
pastry rooms, and a beautiful winter garden.
   Equipment includes convection ovens, pastry-rising ovens and
huge dough-kneaders, plus special machines for a new course on
vacuum-packing and cooking _ to be taught by Patrick Martin, the
1987 winner of the French National Cuisine and Pastry trophy.
   ``We're still emphasizing traditional French cuisine,'' said
Robin Cahill, a Cordon Bleu graduate and its spokeswoman. ``But in
our expanded facilities just about everything is new.''
   ``The basics are still the main point,'' said Chef Martin, one
of seven chefs. ``The students will still learn how to chop, knead,
whip and do everything else by hand as well.''
   The overwhelming majority of Cordon Bleu students are from
abroad _ about 30 percent American and 20 percent Japanese, said
Ms. Cahill.
   While the Ritz plans English translations in all courses, the
Cordon Bleu still teaches its advanced courses in French.
   Financing for the modernization comes from the Pages group,
headed by Andre Cointreau, which bought the school in 1981.
   Intermediate students at the Ritz may choose a one-to-six week
course of practical sessions and demonstrations at cost in French
francs of about $800 a week. The Ritz's highest-level Auguste
Escoffier course, a 12-week session, costs about $10,000.
   Cordon Bleu's main three 12-week courses comprise a cycle of
``basic'' through ``superior'' at a cost of about $4,200 each.
   To get the coveted Cordon Bleu Grand Diplome, pupils now spend
nine months, reduced from 12, in intensive cooking and pastry
courses preparing for the big exam, at a cost of $19,000.
   ``We're also offering new intensive four-day practical and
demonstration sessions,'' ranging from charcuterie to regional
cuisine and costing about $500, said Ms. Cahill.
   Both schools conduct wine tasting courses.
   A visitor to Paris who wants to compare the big-school ambience
of the Cordon Bleu with the tonier Ritz can attend demonstrations
at either one for less than $35 each.

<HEAD>The New Boy at Commerce Tangles with NASA, Japan and Shakes Things
Up</HEAD>

   As other upper-echelon administration
officials plot a return to private life, retired Ohio steel
executive C. William Verity is relishing his role as ``the new boy
on the block.''
   Just four months into his job, the new Commerce secretary
appears determined to leave an activist's stamp on his agency,
although he allows ``I have a lot of catching up to do.''
   ``There's so much going on, it's hard to get your arms around
it,'' he said in an interview. But Verity, soft-spoken and gracious
like predecessor Malcolm Baldrige, says he considers himself a
``late bloomer'' at 71.
   His first months in office have been anything but placid.
   There have been trade tangles with the Japanese, attacks from
conservatives over his views on Soviet trade, a run-in with NASA, a
staff upheaval.
   And whales.
   ``I never had any idea I would be in charge of whales some day.
And I had no idea it would take so much of my time,'' Verity said,
referring to his recent recommendation for sanctions on Japan for
their killing of minke whales in violation of international whaling
agreements.
   That action, while mostly symbolic, won plaudits from
conservationists.
   As the Commerce Department celebrates the 75th anniversary of
its creation on Friday, Verity has been pressing ahead with his own
schemes to more fully automate the activities of the once staid but
now sprawling agency.
   The department administers U.S. trade policy, probably its most
vital role in a day of $170 billion trade deficits. But it also
collects and analyzes economic data and serves as home for the
Census Bureau, the National Weather Service, the Bureau of
Standards and a host of other agencies.
   One of Verity's first moves was getting behind a program for
encouraging the commercialization of space _ a project, he said,
which brought him into immediate conflict with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``NASA doesn't want anybody
else out there,'' he said.
   And Verity set up a program to help smaller companies ``get into
the export game'' by capitalizing on exchange-rate changes that are
making U.S. goods more competitive abroad, a project he says is now
his top priority.
   ``It may be that a new boy on the block can help move things
along,'' the white-haired former industrialist said in an interview
in his sparsely furnished office in the Commerce Department.
   The office is a huge room built to the specifications of Herbert
Hoover, the commerce secretary from 1921 to 1928, but more recently
festooned with the cowboy and rodeo memorabilia that were the pride
of Baldrige, an immensely popular Cabinet secretary among agency
employes.
   Baldrige's death last summer in a freak rodeo accident brought
Verity, a longtime Republican fundraiser and Reagan suporter, out
of a comfortable retirement in South Carolina. He had been chairman
of Armco Steel.
   But he was not able to win over all former Baldrige loyalists.
   Some of the highest-ranking agency officials have quit since
Verity took the helm, the most recent departure coming last week
with the resignation of Bruce Smart, an under commerce secretary
well respected on Capital Hill for his expertise on trade issues.
   Verity and Smart had a number of personality clashes, according
to other department employes who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   The friction culminated in Verity's withdrawal of his earlier
recommendation that Smart be elevated to the No. 2 Commerce
Department to succeed former Deputy Sectretary Clarence J. Brown.
   Brown, a rival to Verity in early speculation on whom Reagan
would pick to succeed Baldrige, also resigned his post soon after
Verity's confirmation.
   Still, Verity's no-nonsense approach, particularly his tough
stance toward Japan, has won him a lot of fans in the business
community.
   ``It has endeared him to a lot of people around here. Other
secretaries and other U.S. spokesmen have not been urging the
government to start speaking in plain language to these guys,''
said Richard Muller, a Washington representative for Chrysler Corp.
   Soon after taking office, Verity went on the offensive, telling
a Tokyo audience that Japan faced near-certain retaliation if it
continued to restrict its markets while underpricing its own
products in U.S. markets.
   ``I understand their culture, I understand that they are a
closed society,'' Verity said in the interview. ``They're not the
least bit interested in opening their society.''
   When he was nominated, congressional conservatives balked at
Verity's long support of closer ties with the Soviet Union as past
chairman of a U.S.-Soviet trade advocacy council.
   And some Jewish groups considered troublesome his public
skepticism toward the Jackson-Vanik law, which denies preferential
trade treatment to the Soviets because of their refusal to allow
free Soviet Jewish emigration.
   Japanese-Americans rued his use of the term ``Japs'' in a
pre-confirmation speech. And environmentalists were unhappy about
his industrialist's record on clean air and clean water.
   However, since he was sworn in last Oct. 19 _ the day the Stock
Market crashed _ Verity has weathered most of these criticisms.
   But he says that's he's learned one thing: the difference
between running a steel company and running a federal agency.
   ``I think you find out you're not really in charge,'' Verity
said.
   ``The big difference is the mission of private business is to
get something done. In government, this is not so. In government,
it's to move toward solving a problem, but to get everybody on
board with you as you try to solve it.''
   ``And that just requires a lot of time and a lot of massaging of
people's feelings.''

<HEAD>Public Quarrel Of Bishops Seen As Eroding Their Joint Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Vatican's doctrinal umpire was asked at
a recent New York news conference whether current controversy among
American bishops might weaken their collective voice, he wouldn't
say.
   However, the question is regarded a potentially more underlying
threat to the bishops' joint influence than the surface cause of
their present public quarrel _ a statement on AIDS.
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a powerful dispenser of church
discipline, said only that he wouldn't talk about the matter until
he speaks with U.S. bishops about it this spring.
   He has been critical of organizations of bishops such as the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and he left hanging the
potential of Vatican intervention of some kind.
   The bishops' unusual out-in-the-open dispute _ over an AIDS
statement issued by the bishops' 50-member administrative board in
mid-December _ has focused on some content of the statement itself.
   But several knowledgeable churchmen saw in the conflict a
potential erosion of the bishops' collective teaching function via
their conference, which has become increasingly vigorous on issues
from economics to nuclear weaponry.
   ``The loser will be the bishops' conference itself,'' writes
Monsignor Howard Basler in the Brooklyn Tablet.
   Catholic sociologist Eugene Kennedy of Loyola University says
the controversy ``plays into the hands of people who question the
purpose and effectiveness of the national conference's
collegiality.''
   Collegiality, the mutually shared responsibility of bishops and
others, was stressed by the reforming Second Vatican Council of
1962-65, and has been manifested increasingly in the U.S. bishops'
joint teaching documents.
   Kennedy, author of numerous books on church developments,
including his study of the growing scope of the conference,
``Re-Imagining American Catholicism,'' said in an interview:
   ``If personalities begin to speak outside the conference and
indicate that the conference wishes do not match their own, then
the harm to the conference could be irreparable.''
   Asked if that was happening, he said, ``Exactly.''
   He said it ``would please certain people in Rome who have long
been suspicious and wary of the bishops' conference in the United
States. There are several Curial officials who wish to diminish its
influence on a practical level.''
   Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's watchful Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith, has said there is ``no theological basis''
for national bishops' conferences.
   He says such organizations risk smothering Rome's direct line of
authority with individual bishops. That authority plainly can be
more readily exercised with lone bishops than with national blocs
of them.
   In any case, those objecting to the AIDS statement have been
largely those regarded as among the bishops' conservative wing,
tending to be more closely aligned with the conservative Ratzinger.
   Kennedy said he presumed ``good motives'' of those challenging
the AIDS statement, but ``the effect is to damage the process of
collegiality itself.''
   ``Collegiality is the process used to avoid seeming personality
conflicts,'' he said. ``Collegiality means everybody is heard, with
a focus on the issue, rather than on two or three personalities.''
   Individual bishops always are free to dissent from conference
conclusions, but a highly inclusive consensus usually is achieved,
and any bishops disagreeing simply disregard the recommendations in
their dioceses, rather than challenging the process.
   In the present conflict, several bishops, notably New York's
Cardinal John O'Connor and Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law, have
publicly assailed the AIDs document. Several others, including
Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin and Cincinnati's Archbishop
Daniel E. Pilarczyk, have defended it.
   The document repeatedly insists on the church's teaching of
abstinence from sex before marriage and fidelity within marriage as
the only sure safeguards against AIDS, saying that without them,
there is no such thing as ``safe sex.''
   But one paragraph caused the fuss. It says public educational
programs, directed at people who may reject church standards, could
include information about condoms, which some medical experts say
may help prevent AIDS.
   Critics charged this implied approving condoms, condemned by the
church as birth-control devices. Defenders insist the document does
not approve condoms, but saw them as a ``lesser evil'' compared to
the ``greater evil'' of spreading a deadly disease.
   The bishops' administrative board meets March 21 to consider the
furor, and may put it before the entire conference of bishops in
June. Meanwhile, Ratzinger said he would discuss it with bishops in
their ad limina (periodic) visits to Rome beginning in March.
   The bishops' conference first was formed in 1917 to coordinate
church efforts in World War I. The Vatican threatened to supress it
in 1922 on grounds it infringed on jurisdiction of individual
bishops.
   The bishops managed to preserve it, insisting it was a voluntary
organization, depending on each bishop's free choice to
participate, and by their consensus, exercised collective
responsibilities and moral suasion.
   The U.S. conference has inspired 42 similar national Catholic
bishops' conferences around the world, acting to carry out mutual
responsibilities.

   Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern
Orthodox representatives have urged the U.S. Senate to ratify,
without amendments or delay, the U.S.-Soviet treaty for reducing
intermediate-range nuclear forces.
   The Rev. Arie Brouwer of the National Council of Churches,
including most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox bodies, called
the treaty a ``first step toward developing real security for us
and the world's people.''
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angles, head of
the U.S. bishops' international policy committee, said the treaty
should become part of a continuing process of disarmament, making
for more stable Soviet-U.S. relationships.
   The religious leaders testified before the Senate Foreign

recommended that the Board of Pensions of the Presbyterian Church
(USA) be based in Philadelphia.
   The choice, subject to ratification by the church's general

   Louisville, where the newly merged denomination has established
its headquarters; Atlanta, where the former Southern branch had its
headquarters, or Philadelphia where the Northern branch had its

   Despite the anguish of American Jews over the

has not been weakened, says a veteran observer of the Middle East
scene.
   Hyman Bookbinder, American Jewish Committee special
representative, told a conference sponsored by the Miami Herald and
the University of Miami that U.S. Jews have felt ``agony, anguish,
frustration _ even anger at times.''
   But he added: ``It would be a serious mistake to interpret these
reactions as rejection of Israel or even a dilution of commitment.''

   A leader of the fundamentalist wing of Southern
Baptists predicts that that its candidate for president will be the
Rev. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla., opposing the Rev. Richard
Jackson of Phoenix, Ariz.
   Both take a conservative view of Scripture, the Rev. Paige
Patterson, a fundamentalist leader, said in predicting their
candidacies, but he said Jackson has been co-opted by the moderates.
   To maintain the nine-year resurgence of
conservative-fundamentalists at the denomination's convention in
June, he said, they must back ``an inerrantist for president who
will do their bidding.''
   ``Inerrantists'' maintain Scripture is without factual error.

   The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to
reconsider a lower court decision that parents don't have a right
to substitute home teaching for school-required textbooks that
offend parental religious sensitibilites.
   The high court let stand a federal Court of Appeals ruling that
the Hawkins County, Tenn., school board was not obligated to
provide alternative reading arrangements for pupils whose parents
objected to various textbooks.
   A district court had ordered school officials to excuse students
for home instruction from the controversial reading assignments,
but the appeals court said the state is not obliged to shelter
children ``from exposure to some ideas they find offensive.''

   Roman Catholic worshipers in this
diocese _ and others across the country _ last weekend took home a
little cardboard piece that folds into a small ``bowl.''
   During the Lenten season between now and Easter, they're asked
to place in the ``bowl'' each week the cost of a small meal _ the
accumulated proceeds of which go to feed the hungry.
   Called ``Operation Rice Bowl,'' the program is sponsored by
Catholic Relief Services, with 75 percent of the total collected
going to world-wide relief, and 25 percent of it retained to help
the local poor.
   Youngstown Bishop James Malone said the project is an excellent
means of observing the Lenten practice of almsgiving and ``adds an
element of awareness of the hunger that others suffer.''

   There is so little left.
   A red cardboard valentine with torn paper lace, which proclaims,
``I love you Mom.'' A carefully penned Thanksgiving essay in which
the writer says he's grateful for his family ``to have someone to
love me.'' A child's ``Life Story'' book with extra pages left
blank for future adventures.
   Chad Eugene Gragg, 12, Aaron Wayne Gragg, 11, and Stephen
Douglas Gragg, 8, died together at dusk on the cold afternoon of
Feb. 4.
   It was Aaron's 11th birthday. Despite admonishments from a
teacher and a chum who rode home with him on the bus, he chose to
celebrate it by sliding on the frozen surface of a farmer's pond.
   The ice broke. Aaron fell into the frigid water. His big brother
Chad, doing what his parents had always taught him to do, attempted
to save him. He, too, fell in. Stevie, strong for his age, also
tried to be his brothers' keeper. His body plunged through the thin
crust.
   A horrified neighbor boy ran for help. Frantic firemen pulled
the brothers from the pond within 30 minutes. They weren't
breathing and had no pulse. Two helicopters and an ambulance rushed
them to three separate hospitals.
   Thus began the agonizing pilgrimage of Charles and Mary Gragg,
two ordinary people who now stagger in the footsteps of Job.
   Meanwhile, word of the tragedy spread like woodsmoke over this
western Missouri town of 2,800. The event would change forever
Buckner's image of itself.
   As doctors at St. Mary's Hospital in nearby Blue Springs told
the parents their son Chad was dead, teachers and friends arrived
to surround the stunned couple in a protective cocoon.
   Hoping against hope, the Graggs next went to St. Luke's Hospital
in Kansas City, only to be told Aaron, too, was gone.
   By the time they reached Children's Mercy Hospital the Graggs
were at the heart of a caravan of grief. They found Stephen on a
life support system. At 10 p.m., he passed away.
   In the space and time it took for the sun to set and the moon to
rise, three healthy, happy, handsome little boys vanished from the
lives of all who knew them.
   They left behind bits of homework and smiling celluloid images,
a puppy named Scooter who looks for them everywhere, empty school
desks, classmates who struggle to remember their last words,
teachers who wish they'd known them better.
   They left behind the townspeople of Buckner, who were galvanized
by the loss to dig deep within their hearts and pockets to bury the
children with dignity, and continue to mourn them with honest tears.
   They left behind their mother and their father, but Mary and
Charles Gragg, both 41, are no longer parents. The sounds of
laughter, of life, are gone from their empty house. The only noise
comes from the television set. The door to the boys' bedroom is
closed.
   The unbearable must now be borne.
   ``In our age, children aren't eligible to die because our
expectations have been set up that children can survive anything,''
said Kathryn Howard, a grief counselor with Comprehensive Mental
Health Services in nearby Independence, Mo.
   ``All the time we read about children who fall into freezing
water and survive. Why not Aaron, or Chad, or at least Stevie? They
couldn't be saved because the water wasn't deep enough nor cold
enough. But because of modern medical miracles, we are conditioned
to believe it is outrageous that they died.''
   Ms. Howard, whose nonprofit agency has contracts with both the
local school district and fire department, has headed grief and
death counseling in Buckner since the drownings. She also helped
the Graggs plan their children's funeral.
   ``The human spirit is resilient beyond belief, and that is the
hope here,'' said Ms. Howard. ``At a time like this you can get
swamped by the grinding pain of it. But out of that pain comes some
of the most substantial character and human elegance to be found on
Earth. You learn how people can rise up and care for one another.
   ``This is now a community that speaks with one voice. That
phenomena is rare _ too often we are too big and fragmented a
society for this to happen. But if you listen to Buckner today,
what you hear is, `We care. This matters to us. They were our
children, too.'''
   The Graggs had no close relatives living nearby. Acting out of
instinct and compassion, Buckner Elementary School Principal
Richard Thompson stepped into the abyss.
   ``The school in a sense became their family,'' said Thompson.
``Working with me, Kathryn Howard, and Jerry Brown, the funeral
director, Charlie and Mary decided to have the funeral in the
junior high gymnasium. The parents wanted the teachers to speak,
and to be pallbearers.
   ``This became a chance for the community to fulfill what a
community is all about. Before the accident happened you could have
counted on one hand the number of people who knew Charlie and Mary
Gragg. Now everyone knows them and wants to help them.''
   The Parent-Teacher Association mobilized to take food to the
Gragg home for the next two weeks. Secretly thanking God it wasn't
their own kids, mothers reached into closets and brought forth
suits and ties for the boys to wear to their graves.
   Funds were established to accept donations to offset medical and
funeral expenses. The local bank, the savings and loan and a
florist donated flower sprays for the coffins.
   ``It is so hard to take it in,'' said James B. Jones, president
of the First State Bank of Missouri, where nearly $20,000 was sent
in the first two weeks after the accident.
   Pondering the event's anguishing mathematics, Jones wondered,
``if people had only one child and lost it, isn't that just as
terrible as having three and losing them all? I don't know, I
simply don't know, it's just so hard to make yourself think about
it.''
   Mortician Brown tried not to think about his own boys, aged 7
and 8, as he plotted the funeral like a general planning a battle.
   ``We went into this with no idea there'd be any money to pay for
it. I was estimating a minimum of $2,500 each. I went to my vault
manufacturer and coffin supplier and explained the situation. They
were willing to share the burden, no matter what happened,'' said
Brown, whose family has served as Buckner's only morticians for
three generations.

   Brown decided on three identical coffins, three identical
hearses. He reserved three side-by-side plots on a gently sloping
hillside in the town cemetery.
   From the graves you can look out over the walnut and oak trees,
past dormant farm pastures, and down toward the creek where an
angry crawdad once bit Aaron's big toe, where Chad caught a
two-pound lunker of a catfish, where Stevie loved to hunt for frogs.
   Those are the same hills and hollars Brown scampered over as a
child. He, too, remembers sliding across frozen ponds with his
buddies.
   Brown steeled himself not to think about any of those memories,
or the event that brought him into the Graggs' circle, ``because it
is so overwhelming, so awesome, that it stops you in your tracks.''
He'd think later. First, he had a big job to do.
   When he'd finished embalming and dressing the dead children in
their new clothes, he tucked each boy's favorite toy into the
silk-lined caskets.
   As Brown ministered to the dead, Thompson and Ms. Howard, along
with every clergyman in town, local teachers, and reinforcements
from other schools, consoled the living.
   ``The day after it happened we conducted emotional triage in the
halls, the library, the cafeteria, and the classrooms,'' said Ms.
Howard. ``We had kids crying with counselors in corners everywhere
you looked. Part of being young is learning how to deal with your
pain. The kids were shown they could support one another and that
they wouldn't be alone.''
   Teachers read ``The Taste of Blackberries'' to all fourth and
fifth graders. The book relates the tale of a boy who loses his
best friend. Younger children heard ``The 10th Good Thing About
Barney,'' a story of a little boy whose cat dies.
   Thompson sent letters home with every student, detailing the
day's upheavel and warning parents their children ``might have
tears or depression but that is expected and is normal in the grief
process ...'' Attached were four pages of guidelines for dealing
with the situation.
   ``That day we just put a Band-Aid on it, we flew by the seat of
our pants,'' recalled Thompson. ``We decided to leave the Gragg
boys' desks empty to stress the finality of death, to show some
physical remains. We talked about the details. We tried to cope
with the onslaught of the media but refused to let reporters talk
to teachers or students. And we braced for the funeral.''
   Thompson is described by faculty, city fathers, and the Graggs
as the glue that held everything together through that long weekend.
   Besides organizing the school's response to the tragedy,
Thompson set up the junior high gymnasium for the funeral, helped
teachers prepare their farewell remarks, acceded to any family
wishes, and comforted students who attended the open coffin
visitation and closed casket funeral.
   ``It was tough trying to make an appropriate setting for a
funeral out of a basketball court, but we did it,'' said Thompson.
   He had a carpenter build a wooden schoolhouse which was then
covered with flowers and presented by the students of Buckner.
Thompson also gave the parents a brass school bell engraved with
the boys' names. The gift usually is reserved for retiring teachers.
   ``We consider that your boys have retired to a heavenly
school,'' Thompson told the Graggs.
   More than 600 mourners heard fourth-grade teacher Jeanne Young
describe the Gragg children as ``three adventuresome, energetic
little boys ... each of us has a special place in our heart, locked
and guarded _ it's the place just for Chad and Stephen and Aaron.''
   Symbols of each boy's interests rested atop the blue-gray
caskets: art materials for Aaron, a soccer ball for Stephen, a
basketball for Chad.
   Finally, the three brothers were laid to rest in winter's hard
ground.
   Mortician Brown left town for a convention in Florida, allowing
himself to cry most of the way.
   Mental health counselor Kathryn Howard began planning a series
of forums on death and dying for the Buckner community.
   Principal Thompson fielded calls from People magazine and tried
to get his school back to some semblance of normalcy.
   ``The tragedy will long be remembered in this community,'' said
Thompson, pausing to wipe tears from his eyes and catch his breath
over the big lump in his throat. ``They were rambunctious country
boys who were one for all and all for one.
   ``Two of the boys willingly gave up their lives for the other.
That is the only thing that makes it comprehensible.''
   Mary and Charlie Gragg's relatives have gone home and neighbors
visit less now. Gragg has resumed the commute to his job at a metal
treating company in Kansas City. His wife has returned to shift
work for a janitorial contractor at the nearby Lake City Army
Ammunition Plant.
   The Graggs believe they'll stay in the neighborhood where dogs
run free and kids' boundaries are defined by a stop sign on a
country road.
   They speak of their sons in the present tense.
   Looking at a small pile of photographs, Mary Gragg remembers
each of her sons as a sturdy blue-eyed, blonde-haired baby.
   ``They were so good. They slept through the night every night.
   ``Aaron is my artist, my loner, he loves his dinosaurs. Chad is
his daddy made over, my helper, everybody's helper, such a good
student. He loves school, he never misses, and he loves riding his
bicycle. Stevie's a little slow, a shy kid. Stevie loves Alf ...''
   Charlie Gragg takes up the sentence.
   ``You'll never see kids that alike, that close. If one goes out
the front door the other two are right behind. ... I wasn't
surprised they all died trying to pull each other out of that pond.
   ``I always told them, `No matter what happens, you help your
brothers.' I told them that more than once. I told Chad he was
responsible. He was in charge. He went to help Aaron, and Stevie
followed.''
   Is there anything anyone can do for the Graggs? They say there
is nothing. They are baffled that there might be an answer to such
a question.
   Soon it will be spring, time to go fishin' again, and frog
huntin', and crawdad catchin'. That's when the children of Buckner
Elementary School will plant three new trees in memory of Aaron,
Chad, and Stevie.
   By then, the ice will be gone from the ponds.

<HEAD>Harewood Says Movie Shatters Myths About Homeless</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>

   Dorian Harewood predicts that the ABC Theater
presentation of ``God Bless the Child'' is going to shatter some
myths about the homeless.
   The two-hour movie tells the story of a desperate young mother
trapped in poverty and an Outreach worker who tries to help her and
her young daughter.
   ``It's a myth that the majority of the poor and homeless are
lazy and don't want to work and want to take advantage of the
welfare system,'' he said. ``The fact is that most of them do want
to work, and those who are working are being paid at a sub-poverty
level.
   ``It's a myth that the majority of the homeless are minorities.
The fact is most are white. That should shake up people into
solving this problem.''
   Harewood stars as Calvin Reid, the Outreach worker. Mare
Winningham is the young Appalachian mother, Theresa, and Grace
Johnson is Hilary, her daughter. Dennis Nemec wrote the screenplay
and Larry Elikann directed on location in Montreal. ABC will
telecast the movie on Monday.
   ``My character was inspired by a real Outreach worker, Otis
Woodard in St. Louis,'' said Harewood. ``He's a very special guy
who's done a lot for the homeless.''
   The story's set in an unspecified Midwestern city. It follows
the tribulations of the young Appalachian woman and her daughter,
who through no fault of their own, are in a downward spiral of
poverty. ``It's a cycle that leaves her homeless and without much
prospect of improvement,'' Harewood said.
   Harewood notes that many programs set up in the 1960s and '70s
to aid the poor have been scaled down.
   ``This film doesn't make a political statement,'' he said, ``but
it does make the statement that the government has got to become
involved. Children are our greatest resource and too many are
growing up malnourished. Is it any wonder that we've fallen behind
the rest of the world in educating our children?''
   Harewood is involved with several programs that help people in
need, among them LIFE (Love Is Feeding Everyone) and CHIP-IN
(Community Housing Involving People In Need).
   By the time the movie goes on the air, Harewood expects to be
well into the filming of a pilot for ABC called ``Mama's Boys.'' He
and Perry King star as half-brothers who inherit an investigative
newspaper.
   ``Perry and I are good friends and we're looking forward to
working together again,'' he said. `The movie `Foster and Laurie'
in 1975 was our only time to work together. They wanted to make a
series out of that, strange as it seems, since we were both
assassinated (they played police officers).
   ``But the chemistry between us is good. We didn't want to do
that as a series, but we have been wanting to do something together
for a long time.''
   The idea for the series came from Harewood's wife, actress Ann
McCurry, and her friend, Louise Haven. ``I met Ann when we did one
musical in New York and we started dating when we did another,'' he
said. ``Louise was in `General Hospital.'''
   The concept is of two half-brothers, one white, one black, who
inherit the newspaper and are forced to settle their differences to
keep it running. William Blinn (``Brian's Song,'' ``Roots'') wrote
the screenplay.
   The last year or so has been extremely busy for Harewood. He
starred in Stanley Kubrick's ``Full Metal Jacket,'' and played the
title role in the TV movie ``Guilty of Innocence: The Lenell Geter
Story.'' He also played a television reporter in the ABC miniseries
``Amerika.''
   Harewood said he also got back to singing, which had been his
original goal. He has an album coming out in April called ``Love
Will Stop Calling.'' ``It's R&B, with some rock,'' he said. ``I
hate labeling it.
   ``I'd gotten some good offers when I started years ago, so it's
not like I'm just capitalizing on my success as an actor. I've had
other offers to record, but they weren't just right. I was able to
do this album without slowing down my acting career.''
   He may also do a musical version of ``To Sir With Love'' on
Broadway with Stephanie Mills.
   He is also planning to do a new version of ``Othello'' for
Joseph Papp, with Mike Nichols directing. Papp is doing
Shakespearean plays with name actors.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Switching Channels''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play ``The Front Page'' has
enjoyed a long career in films. Adolphe Menjou and Pat O'Brien
starred in the 1931 talkie directed by Lewis Milestone and produced
by Howard Hughes.
   Howard Hawks had the brilliant idea of changing the reporter to
a woman, and ``His Girl Friday'' was a 1940 hit with Cary Grant and
Rosalind Russell. Billy Wilder went back to the 1920s era with
Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon in 1973.
   Now comes ``Switching Channels.'' It is patterned after ``His
Girl Friday,'' with Burt Reynolds as the demonic editor and
Kathleen Turner as his star reporter and ex-wife. But something new
has been added: television.
   Changing from a Chicago newspaper to a satellite news network
does surprisingly little damage to the timeless ``Front Page''
plot. If anything, the deadline urgency is more pronounced, given
the competitive nature of TV news.
   Where the filmmakers have gone astray is in their apparent
belief that ``The Front Page'' needed a heavy dose of farce. The
result is more Marx Brothers than Hecht and MacArthur.
   Turner, star reporter for the news network, takes a rare
vacation and falls in love with a dashing industrialist,
Christopher Reeve. She returns to Chicago and tells her news-crazy
boss and former husband, Reynolds, that she is quitting for married
life.
   The wily Reynolds prevents her departure, and Turner agrees to
one last assignment: the execution of an accused cop killer (Henry
Gibson). When the condemned man escapes, the chase begins. Instead
of the customary roll-top desk, the reporter hides the escapee in
the press room's copying machine.
   The actors romp through their roles in high style. Reynolds is
perfect as the fast-talking con artist, and Turner is credible as
the energetic reporter. Reeve displays an unsuspected talent for
comedy in the Ralph Bellamy role as the self-assured fiance. There
is marvelous irony when the one-time Man of Steel is portrayed as a
sufferer of acrophobia who panics in an elevator.
   Where ``Switching Channels'' goes awry is with Ted Kotcheff's
ambivalent direction, particularly at the frenetic, unfunny climax.
Ned Beatty as the puffed-up politician overacts outrageously, and
the media people are portrayed as gargoyles and cretins.
   Oh well, ``The Front Page'' will survive.
   Produced by Martin Ransohoff and written by Jonathan Reynolds,
``Switching Channels'' is rated PG, perhaps for language. Running
time: 104 minutes.

   Burt Reynolds was recalling when he first
arrived in Hollywood almost 30 years ago:
   ``I went to see a friend of a friend of a friend who was
supposed to be in the movie business. It turned out he was in the
insurance business and he wrote policies for a studio. He lived in
the Valley, and I rented a car to follow him.
   ``Now, I'm from Florida. When I went through Laurel Canyon, I
thought I was in Switzerland. I had never seen anything like that.
I had the top down and was looking everywhere. I thought, `This is
about as close to heaven as I'll ever get. This is where I'll
live.'''
   Reynolds was in a rare reflective mood during a visit to help
publicize the new Tri-Star movie ``Switching Channels.'' He came
here from his Jupiter, Fla., base to talk about the movie, which is
``The Front Page'' switched to television. But he also seemed to
enjoy reminiscing about his early Hollywood days.
   ``When I went under contract to Universal,'' he recalled, ``it
was like a campus. You could walk across the lot and see all these
people who were much prettier than you. Gorgeous guys _ they all
had names like Race Gentry. In those days the studios put beauty
contest winners under contract. You could see Miss Universe and
Miss America tripping off to class.''
   All contract players attended classes to learn drama, dance,
singing, horseback riding and fencing. Reynolds recalled a boxing
class in which he was pitted against a smaller actor and knocked
him down: ``It was Audie Murphy, and he went to get a gun. As it
turned out, we became good friends. But I learned never to knock
down a Congressional Medal of Honor winner.''
   The first big break for Reynolds, who was once married to
actress and comedian Judy Carne, came when Universal cast him in
``Riverboat,'' the first TV series in color. Co-starring with
Darrin McGavin was ``a little bit like playing tackle opposite Lyle
Alzado; you learn to play the game very quickly.''
   Fired from ``Riverboat,'' Reynolds practiced his craft in New
York and returned to star in more TV series. ``I'm the only actor
who has been canceled by all three networks,'' he said.
   After ``Dan August,'' he appeared on several Merv Griffin talk
shows. Johnny Carson saw him and invited him on ``The Tonight
Show.'' Reynolds was warned that Carson didn't talk between
commercial breaks. But during the first one, Carson asked, ``Do you
want to host the show?''
   So Reynolds was host of 10 ``Tonight'' shows in New York and was
called to Hollywood for an interview with director John Boorman
about a role in ``Deliverance.'' It turned out Boorman had seen him
as a talk-show host.
   ``I saw you in command of four people; that's what you have to
do in this movie,'' Reynolds recalled Boorman as saying.
   Twenty-odd movies later, Burt Reynolds, 52, remains as ambitious
as when he was a contract player at Universal. ``I'm healthy as a
horse,'' he proclaimed, despite those rumors of three years ago
that he had a fatal disease. He said a jaw injury on ``City Heat''
made eating difficult.
   Reynolds was off the screen for more than two years. To dispel
the rumors, he made three movies in a row: ``Heat,'' ``Malone'' and
``Rent-a-Cop,'' none of which ignited the box office. He has great
hopes for ``Switching Channels,'' in which he plays the Walter
Burns role with Kathleen Turner as the reporter and Christopher
Reeve as her fiance.
   ``I was a late comer to the film,'' said Reynolds. ``I had the
good fortune to live across the street from the producer, Martin
Ransohoff. When Michael Caine got stuck in the mouth of `Jaws IV'
and wasn't available, Ransohoff was running around looking for a
replacement. Richard Dreyfuss wasn't available. A lot of guys
weren't available.
   ``I was across the street eating an apple. Ransohoff came over
and said, `Read this script.' Twenty-four hours later I was in the
lap of Kathleen Turner,'' he said.
   ``The character was much more elegant with Michael Caine. He
changed from David Niven to Broderick Crawford real quickly. They
switched the pictures on the wall from Winston Churchill to Marvin
Hagler. However, the dialogue wasn't changed. Just some ad libs
added.''
   Reynolds intends to maintain the filming pace, directing as well
as acting.
   ``I missed it,'' he admitted. ``After all those stupid rumors, I
decided just to go back to work. The best revenge is the good life:
to be happy and be surrounded by the people I liked most.
   ``It worked. I've gotten healthier and happier with each
picture. Most of all I had missed the crew, the guys, the gals _
the making of the film is the most fun part of all.''
   During his hiatus, he's kept a low profile, and that was part of
his design: ``It was time for me to be less visible. I was seen
everywhere for everything; I was doing everything but open
supermarkets. (Clint) Eastwood used to tell me, `You could have
such a big career _ if you'd just go away.'''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Zinman, who has been the music director of
the Baltimore Symphony since 1985, is as delighted with the
orchestra as he is with the city itself.
   Just before Zinman arrived in Baltimore from his previous
orchestra in Rochester, N.Y., Baltimore philanthropist Joseph
Meyerhoff, who'd been picking up the symphony's bills, died.
   ``To my horror, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.3 million
and we were losing $1 million a year. We would be out of business
in a year unless we raised money,'' he said.
   A new executive director and the board, with some new members,
were told by consultants they probably couldn't raise a $14 million
endowment. ``They went out and raised $40 million in Baltimore in
22 months _ a new world's record.
   ``It was done by business leaders, which is essentially the way
it has to be done. The selling point was, if you want to have a
city that's taken seriously, we have to have an orchestra,'' Zinman
said. ``Baltimore had a renaissance in the last 15 years. It's a
can-do town. People who live there feel they can do what they want
to do.
   ``We did a tour of Europe and Russia last May. One of
Baltimore's banks paid for it. The governor and a senator came
along. They did a presentation lunch in London, with a big slide
show. Orchestra musicians played. People were invited to our
concert the next night.''
   The year's tour for the orchestra started March 7 in New York.
It will continue in Davis, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Costa Mesa
and Palm Springs, Calif., and Tucson, with cellist Yo-Yo Ma as
guest. Next year, the orchestra will tour the East Coast with flute
soloist James Galway.
   This season, Zinman started Saturday morning ``informal
concerts,'' repeats of Friday night concerts with a top price of $9
and a little conversation.
   ``They said, `You have to talk to the audience.' I'm a fan of
`Prairie Home Companion.' I decided to do it like an old radio
show,'' Zinman said. ``We have a phony sponsor _ tapioca _ and a
tapioca jingle. Next year we'll do eight of them, broadcast live by
National Public Radio. I explain the musical themes for them to
follow while they listen. We recommend that little kids don't come;
it's serious classical music with zaniness in between pieces.
   ``I'm an American. I'm not Viennese. I have wild ideas and
fantasies. Why not let them loose when you have the chance?''
   This season, Public Radio is broadcasting 13 regular symphony
concerts and the British Broadcasting Corp. is doing several.
   After the tour, Ma and the Baltimore Symphony will record
Britten's ``Symphony for Cello and Orchestra'' and Barber's ``Cello
Concerto'' for CBS. The orchestra has made a Berlioz album for
Telarc and an album by resident composer Christopher Rouse for
Nonesuch. Telarc plans to record the Schumann symphonies and an
all-Elgar compact disc with the Baltimore Symphony.
   ``I work with my orchestra a lot,'' the 51-year-old conductor
said. ``My contract calls for 20 weeks a year. I do about 24. The
days are over when I want to flit about, guest conducting.
   ``I want to make the Baltimore into a great orchestra. In order
to do that you have to spend time digging in the garden. You can't
just smell the flowers. You have to make them grow; you have to be
there. Guest conducting doesn't do much for you musically. What
really does a lot for you is to work with your orchestra to develop
a repertoire and a style of playing that is uniquely your own. You
really then get to make the music you're capable of making.
   ``With guesting, you're doing pieces you know pretty well. You
come in like a lover, smile, make love and go away. It's a little
like the singles scene. When you're with the wife, you really have
to be there for the long haul.''
   The conductor's family includes a son who has a synthesizer
business, a daughter in a Brisbane, Australia, dance company and a
12-year-old son living with Zinman and his wife in Baltimore.
   Zinman, a New York native, met the late Pierre Monteux,
conductor of the London Symphony who was then 83, at Tanglewood one
summer. Three years later, Zinman began to assist him.
   ``He was a great model to emulate,'' Zinman said. ``He was a
master of balance and was at home in all styles of music. He had a
great tradition behind him. He'd played in a string quartet for
Brahms. He conducted Diaghilev's ballets, including the first `Rite
of Spring.' He was a warm human being who got along with orchestra
musicians. He was a psychologist and had wonderful patience.''
   At the 1983 Holland Festival, Monteux recommended Zinman to the
Netherlands Chamber Orchestra when a scheduled conductor got sick.
From that, Zinman became music director of the Netherlands Chamber
Orchestra from 1964 -77 and of the Rotterdam Philharmonic from
1979-82. He was the Rochester Philharmonic's music director from
1974-85.
   Someday he'd like to help young conductors.
   ``I would like to take three pupils, use them as assistants and
coach them. It's a question of finding a way to schedule that and
get the money to do it,'' he said.
   ``I really believe you must pay back what you've borrowed.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: David Lee Roth Rocks for Nine Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE PETERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The child in David Lee Roth is taking plenty
of toys on his next trip: a 28-foot flying surfboard; a huge banner
featuring bikini-clad women; and a regulation-size, red, white and
blue Everlast boxing ring.
   But this is no ordinary summer vaction for the shaggy-haired
rock star with the trademark scream. It's a concert tour, and the
playthings are meant to wow audiences for the next nine months in
arenas from Australia to New York.
   ``Music should look like it sounds, no matter what kind of music
it is,'' Roth said in a recent interview. ``A lot of times this
music sounds like something thundering up out of the floorboards or
raining down from the heavens. Sometimes it's like rolling waves of
sound. And what's a wave without somebody to surf it?''
   Despite the props and an endless stream of jokes, Roth is a
shrewd businessman. He knows the gimmicks will bring attention to
his craft _ rock 'n' roll.
   ``There's a lot of aerial tricks, but it's all built around the
music. The band is doing more musical gymnastics than you've ever
heard a rock band do,'' he said.
   Roth, 32, is touring to promote his third solo album,
``Skyscraper.'' The record, which includes the single, ``Just Like
Paradise,'' marks the first time he has tried on the producer's
hat. His tour began on March 4 in Lakeland, Fla.
   ``I wanted to try something different,'' Roth said. ``Always in
the back of my mind I had thought about producing. But I wouldn't
try a flight like this unless I had the tools and the know-how to
do it, and I didn't feel secure with that until fairly recently.''
   The comic book-like showman spoke about his tour, with his long,
blond hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing camouflage pants and a
torn T-shirt, sitting in the second row of his rehearsal hall. He
was careful not to reveal too many of the tour's surprises.
   ``During the band's moment of patriotism, I climb a ladder to
the ceiling of the arena _ Jeez, I don't want to give it all
away,'' he said, but added, ``It's death-defying stuff.''
   Roth's hometown is Bloomington, Ind., but he moved to Pasadena,
Calif., when he was about 12 and has lived there ever since. As a
child, he was inspired by television. He said he figured if all
these people were entertaining him on television, maybe he could be
some kind of entertainer, too.
   The influences which led him to music ran the gamut of groups
and styles.
   ``If I say to you Deep Purple was a big inspiration to me and so
were the Ohio Players, you'd say, `Oh, that's where Dave got his
scream from, Deep Purple!' No, no, no, I got the scream from the
Ohio Players, I got the haircut from Deep Purple.''
   He began his career after meeting Eddie and Alex Van Halen and
Michael Anthony at Pasadena City College. The four formed Van
Halen, a band that set the standard for many heavy-metal bands to
come, especially because of Eddie's innovative guitar playing, and
Roth's wild-man antics.
   The group split up in 1985, and Roth moved on to a solo career.
His new band includes lead guitarist Steve Vai, bass guitarist
Billy Sheehan, drummer Gregg Bissonette and keyboardist Brett
Tuggle.
   Roth's international tour will include some of the old Van Halen
standards, in addition to his solo efforts, including a remake of
the Beach Boy's ``California Girls'' and the bluesy ``Just a
Gigolo.''
   In his spare time, Roth climbs mountains, as seen on the ``Just
Like Paradise'' video in which he scales a 3,000-foot-high vertical
wall of granite. He said he may be reverting to his childhood,
because he got the climbing bug when he was a boy scout. Climbing
is a kind of therapy for him.
   ``You know, the most scariest place you can put yourself in has
the most calming effect.''
   Although experienced, he says the hobby has not made him want to
conquer mountains such as Mount Everest.
   ``Something like that is a hyper-commitment,'' he said. ``I need
all of my toes in order to jump around with great abandon.
Inevitably, you're going to lose a finger or a toe on a trip like
that. Somebody checks out early. Taking that kind of risk is not my
interest. The music gives me enough of that kind of adventure.
Fooling around with my career burns enough calories.''
   Roth also fools around with martial arts, receiving a black belt
in karate about nine years ago. At one point he experimented with
kick boxing. These days, he incorporates both disciplines in his
stage show.
   ``Martial arts has a lot of visceral impact. You can feel it _
Pow! And combining it with the music, 10,000 people say, `Oh, did
you feel that?'''
   Despite his devil-may-care manner, Roth is definitely a success.
Two previous albums have sold more that 1 million copies,
certifying them as platinum, and ``Skyscraper'' is well on its way.
This does not include his revenues from the six Van Halen LPs that
share the same honor.
   ``A lot of what stands for success in rock 'n' roll or showbiz
after a while seems like so many little trophies and prizes along
the way,'' he said. ``If there's any real glory to be had it's in
legend.''
   All kidding aside, he insists the money he's made is not for
things, but rather experiences. He said experiences provide better
memories.
   If anything, Roth's whole career is built around making a single
point, getting across a single message:
   ``There's a very definite message in all of this music. People
say, `Dave, what's the message?' That's it. Imagination. Take a
chance. Not just take your best shot, that's too dependable.''

   The characters who inhabit Black Lizard
books are contemporary losers struggling through scenes set in the
sizzling middle of hell on earth.
   Although that may not spur hordes of readers to rush out to buy
one, Black Lizard co-founders Barry Gifford and Don Ellis report
their dark suspense novels nevertheless have become a big hit, with
sales approaching $1 million this year.
   They're not worried that fans of traditional mysteries or gothic
romances shun harsh Lizard novels such as ``A Ticket to Hell,''
``The Alcoholics,'' ``Swamp Sister'' or ``A Moment to Prey.''
   ``I don't read mysteries, I don't know anything about mysteries
... I can't read them,'' said Gifford, contending most are poorly
written and focus primarily on advancing the plot. Black Lizard
books may contain a mystery, but many don't include a corpse or
even a crime, he said.
   As the editor who selects the Black Lizard lineup, Gifford has a
clear vision of what fits and what doesn't, and he has no intention
of trying to attract the fainthearted.
   These thrillers are ``not just hard-boiled. They're books with a
certain psychological edge,'' he said. Many of Black Lizard's
readers are young, and Gifford speculated they may share the
generally nihilistic views presented in the novels.
   Consider this classic Black Lizard example from ``Cassidy's
Girl'' by David Goodis:
   ``A feeling of vague uneasiness took root inside him and grew
and sharpened and became acute. He knew he was disappointed because
the battle hadn't continued. Of course, he told himself, that
didn't make sense. But then there were very few elements in his
life with Mildred that made sense. And lately, he recalled, there
was absolutely nothing that made sense. It was getting worse all
the time.''
   In Black Lizard's own bibliography, the novels are described as
presenting ``distinctive and absolutely authentic (mostly) American
voices; satirical, maddening, compelling, fascinating.''
   According to Gifford and Ellis, Black Lizard has become so
successful that major publishing companies are trying to imitate
the innovations of the small Creative Arts company that has carried
the Black Lizard imprint since 1983.
   That's when Gifford was browsing in a Paris bookstore and
discovered a stack of Jim Thompson and Harry Whittington novels,
many of them the same ``dark'' 25-cent paperbacks that he loved to
read as a kid while hanging out at his Tampa, Fla. neighborhood
drugstore.
   While the books' popularity had plunged in the United States
since the '50s, they remained a strong favorite with the French,
who have shown steady appreciation of the ``serie noire'' storyline
of such authors as Thompson, Whittington and Goodis.
   ``It best represents the vision of America that the French like
to retain,'' Gifford said. ``It's kind of like the Wild West.''
   Filmmaker Francois Truffaut claimed Goodis as one of his
favorites, filming the writer's ``Shoot the Piano Player.'' Goodis
also wrote ``Dark Passage,'' and did the screenplay as well for the
Humphrey Bogart-Lauren Bacall film. Gifford's own ``Port Tropique''
is in pre-production for a movie.
   He said his friend, best-selling novelist Elmore Leonard,
routinely calls to suggest Black Lizard nab a certain new author or
novel. ``It's become a writers' series as well,'' Gifford said.
   But the company's budget remains relatively small and it's
impossible for it to lure big names such as Leonard. And some New
York publishing houses trying to duplicate Black Lizard have landed
certain books and authors by paying higher fees.
   Even so, Black Lizard founders are confident that by retaining
the novels' strong identity it will survive and flourish. ``You can
fill it (a company's booklist) with a lot of glop, but pretty soon
your readership falls away,'' said Gifford.
   ``I think we're just going to get better at what we do, not
necessarily bigger,'' Ellis said.
   Despite Black Lizard's surge in popularity, Gifford said he
wasn't sure what to expect at first: ``I thought it would either
catch on right away or we wouldn't sell more than 10 books. I
didn't expect a mediocre reaction.''
   They started out printing 5,000 copies for each of their first
three books. Today they begin with 10,000 copies each, reprinting
when necessary. Their booklist totals 43. Black Lizard is
publishing its first hardcovers this spring and bookstore chains
such as B. Dalton and Waldenbooks have placed orders.
   Black Lizard books are easy to spot. In addition to the
trademark lizard logo taken from a Peruvian stone rubbing and
strategically placed on each cover, most of the novels also feature
haunting, lurid cover designs by San Francisco artist Jim Kirwin.
   Gifford said they decided to tone down the focus of the novel
cover after the first three, making it less violent and graphic yet
``something that can penetrate the psyche. ... It's almost like a
dream.''
   The covers have become so successful that contrary to the old
maxim, some people judge Black Lizard books by their covers and buy
them for that reason alone.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: No More Double Vision on `Hee Haw'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hager Twins no longer stand in the
``Hee Haw'' cornfields or get smacked from the rear by a swinging
board fence.
   The brothers, who often gave viewers double vision, are off the
cornball program after 18 years. They left the syndicated show two
seasons ago, and in their appearances across the country, they
still tell jokes in the finest ``Hee Haw'' tradition:
   What do you get when you jump in front of a car? ``Tire''d.
   What do you get when you jump behind a car? ``Exhaust''ed.
   Where do you take old melons and cantaloupes? To John Cougar's
mellon camp.
   Last year they performed for about three months in the Smoky
Mountain resort town of Gatlinburg, Tenn., where Jim and Tammy
Bakker lived briefly after leaving the PTL ministry. Never one to
miss an opportunity, the Hagers came up with some humor about the
former evangelists.
   Did you hear about Jim and Tammy Bakker's new magazine?
RePenthouse.
   ``I think we drove them out of town,'' recalled Jon Hager, the
older of the twins by 20 minutes.
   The two perform on cruises, at rodeos, benefits, exhibitions and
state and county fairs. They frequently appear on The Nashville
Network on cable TV, do TV commercials and are now putting songs
together for an album.
   They appeared in the ABC-TV movie, ``Twin Detectives,'' about 10
years ago. In the works now is a 30-minute situation comedy-variety
show tentatively called ``Doubles.''
   ``We're different, being twins,'' Jim Hager said. ``We can tell
a joke pretty good, I guess.''
   The two will always be known for their singing and skits on
``Hee Haw.'' They were original cast members, dating back to the
first show in 1968.
   ``America grew up watching us,'' Jon Hager said in an interview
as Jim sat alongside. ``We'll always be associated with the show.''
   The two were born in the Chicago area and adopted at age 3 by a
Methodist minister. They've been together all their lives except
for 3{ years when Jon left Los Angeles and moved to Nashville. Jim
remained on the West Coast, but finally followed.
   ``We get along; it's more profitable,'' Jon said.
   ``To go along, we've got to get along,'' Jim said.
   The two, who are also guitarists and drummers, had worked with
country star Buck Owens and used his connection to join ``Hee Haw''
when Owens signed as the show's co-host with Roy Clark.
   ``We auditioned and signed a contract that day,'' Jon recalled.
   They remained on the show until two seasons ago when a contract
dispute arose and they decided to concentrate on other projects.
   ``It gave us national exposure and made us a lot of friends,''
Jon said. ``The pay was not that good but we got $1 million in
exposure. It kept us off the street for a long time. The police
knew where we were.''
   ```Hee Haw' made country music. It brought country music into
city homes,'' he said.
   The Hagers are not the only familiar faces gone from the show.
Owens left at the same time they did, saying he wanted to focus on
his business interests. Mainstays Junior Samples, Archie Campbell
and Kenny Price all have died in recent years.
   But the program continues to showcase the major names in country
music, from such pioneers as Roy Acuff to emerging stars such as
Randy Travis.
   And the cornpone humor remains.
   ``They're not all platinum,'' Jim Hager said. ``The writers
count on the person delivering the line to pull it off. It was
cornball, no denying it.''
   He said about the success of the show, ``People laughed at
themselves. They liked the chemistry on the show and the fast
pace.''
   In their personal appearances, the two perform country hits such
as Kenny Rogers' ``Daytime Friends,'' Eddie Rabbitt's ``Driving My
Life Away'' and Charley Pride's ``Kiss an Angel Good Morning.''
   They describe their humor as suitable for the family with
nothing off-color.
   ``We don't need to do that (risque material) because it's being
done already. It's not what the audiences expect of us,'' Jon Hager
said.
   Their life off-camera and off-stage is not all laughs, but
levity is valued. ``We have our serious moments, but I prefer a
good laugh to a good frown,'' Jon Hager said.

   ``Never Die Young'' (CBS) _ James Taylor
   
   ``Never Die Young'' is classic James Taylor, which is to say
warm, melodic, soothing, thoughtful, reminiscent of ``Sweet Baby
James'' _ progressive but just as personal.
   The LP's title comes from the fine cut: ``Never give up, never
slow down, never grow old, never die young.''
   Love seems to be in bloom once again in the rock world. Well,
sort of. Bruce Springsteen recently turned away from larger issues
to tackle the subject in ``Tunnel of Love.'' ``Never Die Young'' is
Taylor's two-cents' worth. It's prettier and more cutting. On the
cover of ``Tunnel of Love,'' Springsteen leans on a convertible on
a beach. Taylor puts a lone wolf on ``Never Die Young.'' It's the
call of the wild.
   His affinity for the wild life helped destroy his marriage with
singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and he talks a lot here about
troubled relationships.
   Take ``Valentine's Day,'' which starts as a silly sweet ode to
romance: ``Beneath the tide the fishes glide, fin to fin and side
to side, for fishy love has now begun, fishy love, finny fun.''
   But in later verses, its true nature surfaces: ``Me and you, you
and him, him and her, us and them, we keep score, love as war,
Valentine's Day.''
   ``Runaway Boy'' is a slice of Zydeco that inspires Taylor to
declare he's cleaning up his act: ``I'm gonna give up believing I
was born to run, and stop acting like a man that gets shot from a
gun. I'm putting down roots, I want to soak up the sun and stay
right here until my days are done.''
   ``Sweet Potato Pie'' is the most commercial cut, a happy bounce
down a latter-day Tin Pan Alley. Taylor even rhymes June, moon,
spoon and loon.
   ``Never Die Young'' is tough, pretty, loose, funny _ just about
perfect. Luckily for us, Taylor took his own advice.

   ``Pontiac'' (MCA-Curb) _ Lyle Lovett
   
   Country singer Lyle Lovett looks more like a Pet Shop Boy than
an Oak Ridge Boy, so it's no surprise that ``Pontiac'' is slightly
off center. The tone is set by the opening song, ``If I Had a
Boat,'' wherein Lovett recalls the time Tonto told off the Lone
Ranger. It's impossible not to like.
   Other highlights are the title cut, which could have been writen
by Randy Newman in a dark mood; ``L.A. County,'' with a violent
climax that Lovett nearly sneaks past the listener; and three
hilarious songs about the art of compromise _ ``Give Back My
Heart,'' ``She's No Lady'' and ``She's Hot to Go.''
   Lovett includes several graceful bows to traditional Nashville
as well. The best is ``Walk Through the Bottomland,'' which
features Emmylou Harris' harmony on the chorus.
   Lovett, who co-produced, doesn't clutter the arrangements. But
along with pedal steel and piano, he effectively uses horns and, on
the title song, a cello. Altogether, ``Pontiac'' is a most
enjoyable ride.

   Crude oil futures prices have moved above $16
per barrel on the strength of a big jump in heating oil prices that
analysts said was prompted by reports of bad weather in Europe.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude for April delivery settled at $16.01 per 42-gallon barrel
Monday, up 23 cents from Friday's close.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil for March delivery gained 1.46 cents to 47.16 cents per gallon
and wholesale unleaded gasoline gained .45 cent to 45.71 cents per
gallon.
   Analysts said several days of bad weather in Europe and cooler
than normal temperatures in the northeastern United States had
touched off the heavy buying in heating oil.
   Storms reported in the North Sea also prompted some buying among
oil companies hedging against a slowdown in production, the
analysts said.
   ``The market is testing to see if we have bargain prices,'' said
Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Baker said last week's reports speculating about excess
production by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, which helped depress crude prices, may have been
overblown.
   ``There is still a lot of oil out there, but whether it's a big
excess or a little excess is what we're trying to find out,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Southland Corp. To Sell 473 7-Eleven Stores To Circle K</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp.'s agreement to buy 473 7-Eleven
stores from Southland Corp. reflects the continuing strength of the
convenience store industry.
   ``They've been growing rapidly,'' said Ian Bell, a retail
analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., of convenience stores,
noting there are more than 70,000 such outlets across the country.
   Southland decided to sell the 473 stores in 10 states to its
chief competitor not because it's getting out of the business, but
because it needs to raise more than $147 million to help finance
the founding Thompson family's $4.9 billion leveraged buyout of the
company in December.
   Southland plans to keep selling stores until it has between
7,000 and 7,300 by the end of 1989, said spokeswoman Markeeta
McNatt. The company will have 7,542 stores after the Circle K
transaction, down from the 8,296 it held before beginning its
divestiture plan.
   Despite the sales, Southland will remain the largest convenience
store operator in the country and the world.
   ``We have such a solid name now that we do not feel that name
recognition is a problem,'' Ms. McNatt said. ``We are firmly
planted in the minds of Americans as the convenience store people.''
   Southland's plans fit right in with Circle K's desire to expand.
The Phoenix-based convenience store operator has been growing by
leaps and bounds in recent years and the latest acquisition will
give it just over 4,000 outlets in 25 states.
   Susan Plumb, a spokeswoman for Circle K, said the company was
looking to continue its expansion and hoped to have a total of
5,000 stores by 1990. The company is negotiating the purchase of
another 500 stores in the South and Northeast from the Charter Co.,
she said.
   The 7-Eleven stores will be converted to the Circle K name, she
said.
   The $147 million purchase price for the 473 7-Eleven stores
includes real estate and other assets, and Circle K will pay an
additional amount for store inventories, Southland President Jere
W. Thompson said.
   Included in the sale are all of Southland's convenience stores
in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina, Ms.
McNatt said.
   The proposed transaction, subject to a definitive agreement and
government approval, also includes 63 stores in North Carolina;
three in Yuma, Ariz.; 18 in Nashville, Tenn.; 57 stores in small
Texas markets; and 23 stores in the Florida Panhandle.
   Many of the stores also sell gasoline, which further increases
their attractiveness, said Bell.
   Convenience stores are successful because they give consumers a
place to buy quickly one or two items, such as coffee or cigarettes.
   Bell said the stores also have been successful because they tend
to be innovative, offering automatic cash machines and video
cassette rentals to increase their main attraction _ convenience.
   Southland's $4.9 billion leveraged buyout took the chain private
and cemented the control of the founding Thompson family.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors use mostly borrowed funds to
acquire a company. The debt is repaid with the target company's
cash flow or with money raised by selling its assets.
   Southland already has sold 270 7-Eleven stores to National
Convenience Stores, the third-largest convenience store operator
with about 1,170 outlets.
   Southland also has announced definitive agreements for the
divestiture of its Chief Auto Parts, Dairies Group, Tidel Systems
and MovieQuik videocassette rental operations.
   The company also plans to divest its Reddy Ice, Snack Foods and
Chemical-Food Labs divisions.

<HEAD>Dr Pepper, Seven-Up In Tentative Agreement To Combine Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blending the operations of Dr Pepper Co. and The
Seven-Up Co. will allow the companies to continue an aggressive
style in the beverage industry, company officials say.
   The boards of directors at holding companies for Dr Pepper and
Seven-Up announced the merger of operations on Monday. The
transaction, which is contingent on a definitive agreement and
regulatory approval, was expected to be completed in 60 to 90 days.
   Groups led by the Dallas-based investment partnership Hicks &
Haas acquired Dr Pepper and Seven-Up October in separate
transactions during 1986. One group acquired Dr Pepper Co. for $416
million in August 1986 and another group bought Seven Up Co. for
$240 million two months later.
   Thomas O. Hicks and Robert B. Haas, co-chairmen of both
companies, said the merger was a culmination of ``superb
achievement'' at both companies since their acquisition. No
management changes were expected, the pair said in a prepared
statement
   ``The combination of our two companies will enable us to
continue our aggressive style in this industry, as demonstrated by
our recent introduction of two new products, 7Up Gold and Diet 7Up
Gold,'' said John R. Albers, who is chief executive of both
companies.
   The operations of the two companies have been increasingly
integrated in recent months, the companies said. For instance, they
each have used manufacturing facilities in St. Louis to produce
soft drink concentrate.
   ``The merger will allow the companies to be completely operated
as one company, which has obvious advantages internally and in the
marketplace,'' said Albers.
   The trade newsletter Beverage Digest estimated the two companies
captured about 10.7 percent of the $38 billion soft drink market in
1987, up from 10.4 percent the previous year.
   The soft drink leaders are Coca-Cola Co., whose various brands
accounted for 40.3 percent of the soft drink market last year, and
Pepsi-Cola Co., which had 30.2 percent, according to the newsletter
based in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``This formalizes a close and efficient relationship,'' said
Emanuel Goldman, who follows the beverage industry for the

   Upon completion of the merger, significant owners of the
combined enterprise will include senior management; Hicks & Haas;
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.; Cadbury Schweppes PLC; Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. and Citicorp Venture Capital.

   R.H. Macy & Co. has proposed a merger with
Federated Department Stores Inc. with an indicated value of about
$6.6 billion, apparently topping a rival $6.1 billion offer from
Toronto-based Campeau Corp., Federated said late Monday night.
   The offer from Macy's was disclosed as Federated's board
considered a $68 a share negotiated offer from Campeau for all of
Federated's 89.6 million common shares outstanding.
   Privately-held Macy's would make a cash tender offer for
approximately 80 percent of Federated's outstanding shares at
$73.80 per share, Federated said.
   Federated shares not purchased in the tender offer would be
exchanged in a merger transaction, for a number of newly issued
shares of Macy's common stock, equal to approximately 40 percent of
the unpurchased shares.
   No value immediately could be placed on the stock portion of the
buyout offer, but the total offer would be worth about $6.6 billion
if valued at $73.80 in cash or stock for all of Federated's shares.
   The Federated board took no action on the Campeau bid but
directed its management and advisers to investigate Macy's
proposals, to negotiate a definitive agreement and submit both
negotiated agreements to the board as soon as possible, the company
stated.
   Federated officials did not know when the board would get the
proposals, according to spokeswoman Carol Sanger.
   The board of directors of the merged company, which would be
renamed Macy's-Federated Inc., would include significant
representation from the existing Federated board, Federated said.
   Macy's management and financial adivisers spoke at the board
meeting in New York, Federated said.
   Macy's offices in New York were closed when Federated announced
the proposal late Monday, and a spokesman could not be reached for
comment.
   The Macy's proposal was subject to execution of a definitive
merger agreement, and to approval by the boards of directors and
stockholders of both companies. A number of Macy's outside
directors already have participated in the deliberations, with
respect to the combination, Ms. Sanger said.
   Macy's was taken private in a $3.6 billion management leveraged
buyout in 1986. Its stockholders and directors include A. Alfred
Taubman, a major shopping mall developer, and Laurence A. Tisch,
chief executive of CBS Inc. and Loews Corp.
   The company is one of the nation's biggest and best known
retailers, with $5.21 billion in sales during the year ended last
Aug. 1.
   Macy's operates 100 department stores and recently opened three
specialty clothing stores.
   Cincinnati-based Federated is a $10.5 billion diversified
retailer with more than 650 department stores, supermarkets and
other retail outlets nationwide.

   Federated's retail operations include the Bloomingdale's,
Filene's, Burdine's, Lazarus, Bullock's and Gold Circle store
chains.
   Macy's has indicated its financial advisers, Drexel Burnham
Lambert and Kidder Peabody Inc. were confident they could privately
place $1.8 billion in senior subordinated debt to finance the
transaction, Federated said. Bankers Trust Co. and Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. have agreed conditionally to arrange the balance
of the financing.
   Federated had announced earlier that its board was considering a
third-party proposal that was competitive with Campeau's offer.
   A Campeau spokeswoman declined earlier Monday to comment on the
last-minute bid, although Campeau repeatedly has stated it wanted
the opportunity to meet competing offers.
   Federated stock closed up $2 at $66.50 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Monday.
   The Federated board, after rejecting three alternative, hostile
tender offers from Campeau, announced Friday it had authorized
merger negotiations with the Toronto-based retailing and real
estate company.
   In addition to the Campeau proposal, Federated's board had been
considering whether to entirely shun purchase offers in favor of a
restructuring that woudl keep present management in control.
   Campeau, which acquired giant Allied Stores Corp. in December
1986, has been pressing its takeover attempt since Jan. 25.
   Some industry analysts have said they expect Federated to
continue soliciting other buyers to fend off Campeau's overtures.

<HEAD>Dart To Continue Stop & Shop Offer Despite Buyout Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dart Group Corp. says it plans to continue its
hostile bid for Stop & Shop Cos. Inc., even though its target has
agreed to a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout in an attempt to thwart
Dart.
   Dart extended through March 9 its hostile $37 a share offer for
Stop & Shop's 28 million outstanding shares, totaling about $1.03
billion, and indicated it planned to proceed with a proxy fight to
replace Stop & Shop directors later this month, spokesman Jeffrey
Gast said Monday.
   The tender offer had been scheduled to expire Monday night.
   Stop & Shop, a major Northeastern retailing chain, earlier
Monday had announced its tentative agreement to be taken private in
a leveraged buyout led by the firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.,
which will pay its stockholders $44 a share.
   The firm will purchase at least 66 percent of Stop & Shop's
outstanding Stop & Shop shares. If all the outstanding stock were
purchased, the leveraged buyout would total $1.23 billion.
   The company's shareholders still must approve the deal.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flow
or the sale of its assets.
   Stop & Shop has 113 supermarkets and 169 Bradlees department
stores in 12 states in the Northeast.
   Under the buyout plan , which may include participation by the
company's top executives, Stop & Shop will retain its present
management and remain based in Braintree, Mass.
   The company's stock has risen by more than $25 a share since
Dart first announced its takeover intent in January. In New York
Stock Exchange trading on Monday, it rose another 87{ cents to
$43.50 a share.
   Harry Wells, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston,
guessed that Dart was unlikely to match the $44 a share offer.
   ``You've got to be able to support the debt with some level of
safety ... and ($44) is about as much as one can reasonably afford
to pay (for Stop & Shop),'' Wells said.
   Dart, which owns 738,200 Stop & Shop shares, is best known for a
series of unsuccessful but profitable takeover attempts of major
retailers.
   In its most recent bid, Dart dropped a $6 billion hostile offer
for Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. following the October
stock market crash.
   Other Dart takeover attempts included a 1986 bid for Safeway Co.
and a 1987 bid for Supermarkets General.
   KKR, which took Safeway private in a leveraged buyout following
the failed Dart bid, is one of the nation's biggest investment
partnerships specializing i leveraged buyouts.
   Last week, the firm acquired New York-based Seaman Furniture Co.
for $350 million.

<HEAD>Saturn Begins Recruiting Workers for Tennessee Assembly Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s newest carmaking division
has begun recruiting the first 3,000 factory workers for its Spring
Hill, Tenn., assembly plant, Saturn Corp. said Monday.
   The Saturn plant will begin production in the summer of 1990 for
the 1991 model year. Most workers will be hired in mid-1989, when
Saturn begins production on pilot models, said Saturn spokeswoman
Laurie Kay.
   Saturn representatives will tour GM facilities around the
nation, explaining directly to workers for the first time how
Saturn will work and what a job there would be like.
   Saturn already has received a number of resumes, but the push
announced Monday is the first real recruitment effort it has made.
   Under an agreement between GM and the UAW, GM workers will get
the first 6,000 Saturn jobs available over time, including the
initial 3,000. Saturn workers will be covered by a separate labor
contract from the national GM-UAW pact.
   Like Japanese automakers that have hired for U.S. factories,
including Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., Saturn's
hiring process will be lengthy.
   Potential Saturn workers will go through an assessment process
intended to give them an idea of what Saturn work will be like and
whether they want to do it, while giving Saturn an idea of how well
the prospective employee works in a team situation, Kay said.
   Saturn employees will work in teams, instead of performing more
traditional auto assembly work that consists of repeating one
precise task over and over. Kay said the Saturn plant probably will
run on two shifts.
   Workers' salaries will amount to 80 percent of GM hourly
workers' base pay, with the 20 percent difference made up in
incentive pay linked to such factors such as productivity increases
and Saturn's profitability, Kay said.
   Active or laid-off workers who leave the GM system for Saturn
automatically give up any recall rights and seniority at GM plants,
she said.
   But at Saturn, their jobs would be protected during industry
slumps because the company will be required to look for ways to cut
its inventory that exclude laying off workers, Kay said.

   The U.S. dollar rose marginally against most major
currencies in very thin European trading early today. Gold prices
were higher.
   Traders said activity was muted before the release later today
of the January index of leading U.S. economic indicators, although
the report was expected to have little impact.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday:
1.6909 West German marks, up from 1.6875; 1.3945 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3903; 5.7205 French francs, up from 5.7150; 1.8963 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8945; 1,245.75 Italian lire, up from 1,244.25;
and 1.2578 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2622.
   The British pound slipped to $1.7712 from $1.7725.
   The dollar rose in Tokyo in heavy speculative trading, closing
at 128.63 Japanese yen, up from Monday's close of 128.12 yen. In
later London trading today, the dollar was pegged at 128.50 yen.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$429.15 a troy ounce at midmorning, down from an opening bid of
$431.30 but up from Monday's late bid of $425.
   A trader said gold drifted off its higher opening levels as
market participants took profits on the metal's rally in New York
late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $428.70 an ounce, up from $426.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $433.80 an ounce,
up from $430.19.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $6.21 a troy
ounce, up from $6.14.

<HEAD>Giuliani Assumes Suing of Goodyear In False Claims Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has filed a lawsuit seeking at
least $21 million from Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. for allegedly
falsifying price information about balloon-type devices used to
guide bombs.
   The suit, originally filed last year by a competitor, was taken
over by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and filed Monday in
Manhattan.
   The suit names Goodyear, a subsidiary called Goodyear Aerospace
Corp., and Loral Corp., which bought the subsidiary last year.
   ``Goodyear is confident that once the facts in the case are
examined objectively, the suit will be found without merit and the
charges dropped,'' Goodyear spokesman Walt McClenny said from his
Akron, Ohio, office.
   The case involves two devices called Air Inflatable Retarder
Assemblies that are used to slow and guide the flight of MK
500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs dropped from low-flying airplanes.
   The government charged that Goodyear Aerospace misrepresented
prices and costs of the labor involved; that the company unlawfully
induced a subcontractor to lower its price; and that it failed to
disclose substantial price reductions proposed for a subcontractor.
   Goodyear Aerospace was the only maker of the devices from 1982
to 1986. Irvin Industries Inc. entered the competition and filed a
$100 million antitrust suit in 1986.
   Irvin allegedly turned up information about fraud against the
government that it used in another suit it filed in 1987. That suit
was filed on behalf of the government under a ``whistleblower'' law
that allows the government to take over a suit.
   The suit filed Monday asks for at least $21 million in damages
under the False Claims Act and common law theories. In addition,
the government is seeking $10,000 for each unspecified false claim.
   A spokesman for Loral, who asked not to be identified, said that
those alleged practices would have occurred before Loral bought the
company and the potential for a lawsuit was known before the
purchase.
   He added, however, that ``Loral is confident the appropriate
management practices are in place that are consistent with
government procurement practices.''

   Mazda Motor Corp. said it is recalling 11,889 of
its 1988 Mazda 929 upscale sedans for possible improper positioning
of an emissions-control hose.
   In a statement issued Monday from Los Angeles, the Japanese
automaker said improper routing of a short section of the hose may
put it in contact with the car's air-conditioning piping, leading
eventually to a failure of the emissions-control system.
   Owners are being notified by mail to take their cars to a Mazda
dealer for free inspection and repositioning of the hose if
necessary. Mazda said the procedure takes about 15 minutes.

   J.C. Penney Co., which is relocating to Texas,
has decided to sell its midtown Manhattan headquarters rather than
lease the skyscraper as originally planned.
   The 45-story building could sell for up to $480 million, or $300
a square foot, according to real estate analysts.
   The expected price is well below the record $500 per square foot
commanded by similar buildings in the area sold before the Oct. 19
stock market crash.
   Penney plans to move its headquarters to Plano, Texas, near
Dallas, by the end of June and had been trying to lease the
building since last September.
   Harvey McCormick, a spokesman for the giant retailer, said
Monday that Penney already has received bids from prospective
buyers, but he refused to name them.
   Penney bought the building in 1977 for $55 million.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William H. Spoor, formerly at the helm of of
Pillsbury Co., is coming out of retirement to take over his old job.
   The company announced Monday that its board of directors at a
regular meeting in Naples, Fla., elected Spoor chairman and chief
exectuive officer to replace John M. Stafford, who resigned. It
didn't give a reason for the management shakeup.
   Contacted in Naples on Monday, Spoor told the St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch that other management changes will be announced
today. ``There won't be any firings, but we will be changing people
and responsibilities,'' Spoor said.
   Spoor described himself as a ``very interim'' CEO, adding,
``This doesn't please me at all.''
   ``The one thing this isn't is power plays and politics,'' he
said. ``Jack (Stafford) and I are good friends. I chose him to
succeed me.''
   Asked why Stafford quit, Spoor said, ``You'll have to ask him.
It just reached a point where it was no longer worth it to him.''
   Johnny Thompson, company spokesman, said Stafford was
unavailable for comment. He said his departure was voluntary and
that he left with no ties to Pillsbury.
   Pillsbury also said the board of directors appointed a search
committee to seek a chief executive for the company to succeed
Spoor.
   Stafford, 51, presided in fiscal 1987 over the company's first
earnings decline in 16 years. Earnings were $1.82 million, or $2.10
a share, down from $2.08 million, or $2.38 a share, in fiscal 1986.
   Stock analysts who were projecting fiscal 1988 earnings of about
$2.80 a share were told by Stafford in February to lower the
projections by about 30 cents a share, Thompson said.
   ``That may have been the straw that broke the camel's back,''
said Craig Carver, a food industry analyst with Minneapolis-based
Piper Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. ``He has been under increasing
pressure by the board. That may have been what did him in.''
   Carver said declining performance in Pillsbury's restaurant
division led to the the sharp earnings decline in fiscal 1987. But
when Stafford told analysts to lower their projections for fiscal
1988 earnings, he said it was because of an expected earnings
decline in the consumer foods division, which includes frozen
pizza, desserts and mixes.
   The announcement came as a surprise, Carver said.
   Spoor, 65, remained on the company's board of directors after
retiring as chairman and chief executive in 1985. In September his
involvement in the company increased when he was selected chairman
of the executive committee.

   The stock market stuttered at the start today
after zooming to a new post-crash high on Monday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks slipped
0.50, or 0.02 percent, to 2,071.12 in the first half hour of
trading.
   But in the broader market, stocks gaining in price slightly
outnumbered losers in the early going by 397 to 372 with 432 issues
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 29.88 million as of 10 a.m. on
Wall Street, down markedly from Monday when early dividend plays on
utility stocks touched off heavy trading.
   Analysts said traders received mixed signals from economic data
released this morning. The government said its chief economic
forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an
upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession.
   The Commerce Department reported a month ago that the index had
declined 0.2 percent in December after falling in October and
November. Today's report, however, revised the December calculation
to show an increase of 0.3 percent.
   Three consecutive monthly declines in the index is the
traditional, but not infallible, signal of an impending recession.
   Also today, the Commerce Department said construction spending
tumbeld 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months.
The drop followd a 0.4 percent increase in December and evidenced
weakness in both housing and non-residential building, economists
said.
   Aside from the inconclusive economic signals, market traders
were expected to focus on the latest rash of takeover deals, which
helped propel Monday's advance. Analysts said they did not expect
any sharp reversals like the one that followed the market's brief
January rally.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
0.27 to 150.19 in early trading. At the American Stock Exchange,
the market value index was up 0.44 to 288.90.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41
to 2,071.62, reaching its highest point since the October crash.
The run left the Dow average 20 points higher than the previous
post-crash peak of 2,051.89 on Jan. 7.
   The January advance ended abruptly with a 140-point plunge in
the Dow the next day.
   Advancing issues on Monday outnumbered declines by about 7 to 2
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,257 up, 353 down and 357
unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 236.05 million shares, against 191.09
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index gained
2.76 to 150.46.

<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens is prospecting for
another big gold strike, this time making a $1.9 billion cash offer
for Homestake Mining Co., the nation's biggest gold producer.
   The offer disclosed Monday came about three months after the
noted raider aborted an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for
Newmont Mining Corp., another major gold producer, and as Pickens
is engaged in battles at Texaco Inc. and KN Energy Inc.
   The Pickens-controlled Mesa Limited Partnership offered to pay
$20 a share for the 93 million outstanding common shares of
Homestake in a negotiated agreement. Mesa already controls about
3.8 percent of Homestake's stock.
   Homestake said it would consider the unsolicited proposal and
reply ``in due course,'' but declined to elaborate.
   The company's stock shot up $3.50 to $18 a share Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange, but backtracked to $17.75 in early trading
today.
   Based in San Francisco, Homestake holds interests in oil and
natural gas and mines uranium, silver and gold, as does Newmont.
Founded in 1877, Homestake has an estimated 10 million ounces of
reserves, worth roughly $4.3 billion based on the current gold
price of about $430 an ounce. It reportedly produced 678,000 ounces
last year.
   New York-based Newmont last year was the target of Ivanhoe
Partners, a group led by Pickens, which made a $2 billion hostile
bid for control of the company.
   That move was blocked in October when a Delaware court upheld a
``market sweep'' in which Newmont's biggest shareholder, Britain's
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, snapped up enough shares in a two-day
buying binge to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of Newmont
and thwart the hostile bid.
   Pickens made his reputation with high-profile bids for several
major oil companies in the early 1980s, including Gulf Corp.,
Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal Corp.
   Mesa launched hostile bids for such companies and then pocketed
millions of dollars in profit when the target company either was
bought out by a higher bidder or repurchased its own stock.
   Last year, in addition to the move against Newmont, Pickens
triggered takeover speculation by acquiring significant stakes in
Singer Co. and Boeing Co., but no actual offer for either company
ever was disclosed. Singer later was taken private by investor Paul
Bilzerian in a $1.06 billion buyout, in which Mesa participated.
   Recently, Pickens announced his intention to seek federal
approval to acquire up to 15 percent of Texaco, and said he would
support actions by fellow takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn to gain
seats on the oil giant's board of directors and strip the company's
takeover defenses.
   In addition, Pickens earlier this month extended a prolonged
campaign against KN Energy Inc., disclosing he would seek a seat on
the Lakewood, Colo.-based gas pipeline company's board of directors.
   Mesa said it owns 400,000 Homestake shares directly and also
holds a 45 percent interest in a partnership that owns about 3.1
million Homestake shares. Mesa has entered into an agreement to
purchase the remaining 55 percent of the partnership, which would
leave Mesa with a 3.8 percent share in Homestake, the company's
statement said.
   In a letter to Homestake chairman Harry Conger, Pickens said
Mesa was prepared to proceed promptly with the purchase and was
confident it could arrange financing for the acquisition.
   Pickens also offered to allow key personnel at Homestake to
acquire equity stakes in the merged company, ``and thereby be
positioned to benefit directly from the success of their efforts.''
   Homestake posted a profit last year of $146.4 million, or $1.51
per share, compared with net income of $22.6 million, or 23 cents a
share, in 1986. Revenue rose to $516.2 million from $347.6 million.
   The 1987 profit included gains of $95 million on the sale of 20
percent of Homestake Gold of Australia Ltd., and $5.7 million from
the sale of exploration properties in South Dakota and New Zealand.
   Homestake is incorporated in Delaware, which recently enacted a
law aimed at hindering hostile corporate takeovers.

   The government reported today that its main
economic forecasting gauge tumbled 0.6 percent in January, but an
upward revision in the index of leading economic indicators for
December eased fears of a recession this year.
   In a separate report, the government said construction spending
fell 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline since a 3.3
percent drop in March 1987.
   The Commerce Department said that construction spending fell to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $395.2 billion in January
following a 0.4 percent increase in December.
   In the report on leading indicators, the Commerce Department
revised its report for December to reflect a 0.3 percent increase
in the index rather than the 0.2 percent decline it initially
reported. The index had fallen in October and November.
   Three consecutive monthly declines in the index is the
traditional, but not infallible, signal of an impending recession.
Thus, the revision in the December index was taken by economists as
a heartening sign that the country is unlikely to suffer a downturn
this year.
   On Monday, the stock market jumped to its highest level since
the Oct. 19 market meltdown amid new signs of economic optimism.
   Analysts said there was no major economic news to account for
the burst of stock-buying on Monday, which sent the widely-watched
Dow Jones industrial average up by 48.41 points to 2,071.62.
   But traders were heartened to see the Dow industrials vault past
the 2,051.89 level after failing to do so last week. The average
stood at that point on Jan. 7 for its previous highest closing
reading since the crash.
   In late-morning trading today, however, the closely watched
indicator stood at 2,068.80, down 2.82.
   Separately, a survey released Monday indicated that economists
for major corporations have become more upbeat about the economy
than they were three months ago, not long after the Oct. 19 stock
collapse that wiped out half a trillion dollars in stock wealth.
   The National Association of Business Economists said its latest
member survey that only one-fourth of its members predicted a
recession in 1988, down from more than half in the previous survey.
   But an overwhelming 83 percent of the analysts said a downturn
was very likely before the end of the next president's first year
in office.
   In other economic news on Monday:
   _Prices farmers got for raw products in February declined an
average of 0.8 percent from January but still were 6.6 percent
above those a year earlier, the Agriculture Department said.
   _Gold prices tumbled in Europe but rebounded sharply in New
York, based on a stunning rally in platinum that traders ascribed
to fear of unrest in South Africa, a leading producer of precious
metals.
   At midmorning in London today, dealers fixed a recommended gold
price of $429.15 a troy ounce, down from an opening bid of $431.30
but up from Monday's late bid of $425.

   The stock market stumbled to a small loss today
after zooming to a new post-crash high on Monday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks was down
2.82, or 0.14 percent, to 2,068.80 in the first 90 minutes of
trading.
   Analysts said they expected to see the market follow through on
Monday's advance, but results in the broader market were
disappointing in the early going. Stocks losing ground outnumbered
gainers by 708 to 595 with 450 issues unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 75.04 million as of 11 a.m. on
Wall Street, down markedly from Monday when dividend plays on
utility stocks touched off heavy trading.
   Analysts said traders received mixed signals from economic data
released this morning. The government said its chief economic
forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an
upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession.
   Also today, the Commerce Department said construction spending
tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months.
But as in the case of the leading index, the drop followed a
revised 0.4 percent increase in December.
   Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations and had
little impact on trading.
   Aside from the economic data, market traders were expected to
focus on the latest rash of takeover deals, which helped propel
Monday's surge.
   Among the most active stocks on the NYSE, Federated Department
Stores gained 1\ to 67} following R.H. Macy's offer of
$73.80-per-share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding
shares. Campeau Corp., which has been chasing Federated with a bid
of $68 per share, said Macy's offer was ``simply not competitive.''
   General Electric was down [ to 45], Pillsbury was up ~ to 37|,
Wendy's was down [ to 7]; International Business Machines Corp. was
up [ to 117|; and Wal-Mart was down \ to 29[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
0.50 to 149.96 at mid-morning. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index was up 0.67 to 289.13.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41
to 2,071.62, reaching its highest point since the October crash.
The run left the Dow average 20 points higher than the previous
post-crash peak of 2,051.89 on Jan. 7.
   The January advance ended abruptly with a 140-point plunge in
the Dow the next day.

   Script writers and entertainment producers,
trying to hammer out a strike-averting contract settlement, called
a recess today after a 21-hour bargaining session.
   The Writers Guild of America said in a brief statement that
negotiators recessed at 7:15 a.m. and agreed to return at noon.
   Both sides declined to say if an agreement was near, but
alliance and union officials earlier expressed pessimism.
   The old contract for the 9,000 members expired at midnight
Monday with no resolution to the union's demands for greater
creative control on the set and more money from television
residuals.
   ``It doesn't look optimistic,'' said Cheryl Rhoden, spokeswoman
for the WGA, which represents about 6,500 writers on the West Coast
and 2,500 on the East Coast.
   ``The situation is not good,'' agreed Herb Steinberg, spokesman
for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
   The writers produce scripts for productions ranging from daytime
soap operas and talk shows to prime-time dramas and feature films.
   A strike would be felt first by daily daytime programs and talk
shows, Ms. Rhoden said. She said it would take longer for the
effects of a walkout to become visible on shows produced in advance
that need fewer scripts.
   Negotiators were still at the bargaining table at 5 a.m. this
morning and were expected to wrap up today.
   West Coast union members would vote tonight on whether to
approve the producers' final offer or strike. East Coast members
will vote Wednesday, and results of the two votes aren't expected
to be available until about noon Wednesday.
   Brian Walton, the guild's chief negotiator, said going into the
final round of talks Monday evening that the WGA would stay at the
bargaining table as long as possible.
   But he criticized the producers' alliance for allegedly
spreading stories of widespread financial problems in the industry.
   Steinberg responded that the industry as a whole was doing well
but makers of one-hour television series are suffering because of
difficulty selling their products into syndication.
   Main issues separating the two sides were disputes over creative
rights, residuals from foreign markets and residuals for one-hour
programs.
   The median annual income for writers is $40,000, but about half
of the WGA's members are unemployed at any given time, Ms. Rhoden
said.
   The entertainment arm of the writers' union, which has a
reputation as one of Hollywood's most militant, last went on strike
three years ago. That walkout lasted two weeks before writers voted
to accept a package offering them essentially the same terms as the
one they had earlier voted down.
   Ms. Rhoden said the guild also represents about 600 television
news writers, who struck ABC and CBS last spring, but they operate
under a different agreement and weren't affected by the
negotiations.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mixed To Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened steady to lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A late rally Monday sparked some overnight farmer selling of
corn and soybeans, and that helped limit further gains on the
opening today, analysts said.
   Wheat traders were encouraged by news of new purchases by the
Soviet Union and by the Agriculture Department's announcement that
it had sold less than 16 million bushels in last Friday's weekly
auction of surplus wheat.
   But advances in wheat futures were limited by concerns about
this afternoon's USDA auction, the first in a series of three
weekly auctions that will replace the once-a-week sales, analysts
said.
   ``That's taking a little edge off the enthusiam over the Soviets
buying wheat overnight,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago
for G.H. Miller & Co.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.14{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $2.03} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent higher with March at $1.95 a bushel; soybeans
were \ cent to } cent lower with March at $6.35\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .30 cent to .55 cent higher with April at 71.80
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .28 cent to .60 cent higher with
March at 80.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .30 cent
higher with April at 43.27 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.05 cent to .28 cent higher with March at 51.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Monday.

   Farmers who received some government
information late have been given additional time to file their 1987
federal income-tax returns.
   The Internal Revenue Service said Monday it was granting special
relief to farmers who did not receive Agriculture Department
documents by the Feb. 15 scheduled date. Those documents are Form
1099-G, which reflects certain government payments, and Form
1099-A, on which acquisitions or abandonments of secured property
are reported.
   Farmers generally are not subject to penalties for underpayments
if they file their returns by March 1. The IRS concluded that
farmers who failed to receive required information from the
Agriculture Department by Feb. 15 might be unable to meet the March
1 deadline.
   The IRS said farmers affected by the delay should attach to
their tax return a Form 2210F on which they have written their name
and Social Security number and, on the bottom right, the words
``farm waiver.''
   With the extension, farmers will have to file returns and pay
any tax owed by April 15, the deadline for most taxpayers.

   Most mornings Angel Salazar can be found
standing at the side of the city's majestic Metropolitan Cathedral,
waiting with dozens of other unemployed tradesmen for a lucky break
_ a day's earnings as a plumber.
   Salazar, 25, has been coming for about a decade to this spot in
downtown Mexico City, a traditional gathering point for tradesmen
looking for work.
   Jobs this year, he says, are harder than ever to get.
   ``It's more difficult,'' he said, wearing a worn beige sweater
against the chill of the morning air in this mountainous capital.
``There's less work and everything is more expensive.''
   Hundreds of tradesmen use this spot, within sight of the
president's office at the National Palace, to advertise their
skills to prospective employers.
   An electrician sets a light bulb on top of his metal tool box,
while a painter drapes brightly colored paint chips over his
khaki-colored canvas bag, bulging with the tools of his trade.
Others list their varied skills on small pieces of wood.
   But this morning, there is little demand for their talents.
   Mexico has entered yet another year of economic crisis, a year
of uncertainty as the government embarks on a new, untested and so
far unpopular economic program designed to halt the inflationary
spiral.
   ``It will be a very difficult year,'' cautioned Jonathan Heath,
senior economist at the forecasting firm of Macro Asesoria
Economica in Mexico City.
   1988 may well be a watershed year, said Abel Beltran del Rio,
executive director of the Ciemex-Wefa Mexico forecasting group in
Philadelphia.
   ``It is a very crucial year in a sense on the economic front,''
he said. ``We will know if we are going to conquer inflation.''
   The answer hinges on the government's risky new program, called
the Economic Solidarity Pact, which was introduced late last year
in an effort to rein in the worrisome inflation rate.
   ``The plan has logic and everyone wants to have the pact succeed
because if it doesn't, we'll be in a mess because inflation is so
high,'' said a high-ranking government official in a recent
interview.
   ``We feel we can reduce inflation very quickly without the
social costs of having a huge recession,'' said the official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Overshadowing the program is the July presidential election.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the nominee of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, is virtually certain to be sworn
in as the next president on Dec. 1.
   But voter unhappiness over his role as a key architect of the
government's policy during the nation's 6-year-old economic crisis
may cripple his ability to govern.
   Heath predicts the anti-inflation program will show results in
time for the presidential balloting.
   ``The government will make sure,'' he said, ``that inflation
comes down at all costs by the elections. ...''
   ``What happens with inflation and growth will help determine
what happens with the election,'' he said.
   Government officials say the program should quickly bring down
the inflation rate to 1 percent to 2 percent a month by year's end
so that the yearly pace is 65 percent to 75 percent, less than half
the record 159.2 percent of 1987.
   In December, alone, consumer prices soared 14.8 percent, which
at the time was the biggest monthly gain since the government began
collecting those statistics in 1968. The record was broken again in
January, with a 15.5 percent increase recorded in consumer prices.
   A key part of the program was to have been an indexation plan,
slated to go into effect this month to regulate increases in wages
and prices. This past week, the government decided to postpone the
implementation of that plan until April and instead announced a 3
percent increase in the minimum daily wage and a freeze on
regulated prices of such things as gasoline, telephones and
electricity.
   The government also urged private companies to join in the
freeze and said the exchange rate for the peso would be held steady
in March.
   ``We are going to reduce the increase in prices according to
some guidelines,'' said one government official.
   Several major stores, showing their support for the inflation
fight, already have announced special sales or given cash refunds
of the 15 percent sales tax imposed on consumer goods.
   Moreover, the government has taken additional steps to open the
economy to more imported goods, reasoning that foreign competition
will over the long run force Mexican manufacturers to produce
better, cheaper products.
   It also sharply devalued the peso currency and promised to cut
its deficit spending.
   Despite the government's confidence in its handiwork, some
private analysts remain skeptical.
   ``I certainly don't see anything good coming up for the next
year and a half,'' said Patricia Nelson, financial editor of the
English-language Mexico City News and a frequent critic of
government economic policies.
   ``They're not going to get inflation down ...'' she said. ``I
really don't think there's much hope of getting it under 200
percent (in 1988).''
   Heath predicts an inflation rate of 151 percent this year and
worries the inflation-fighting program will plunge the economy into
a steep recession. Others forecast a mild recession or a no-growth
year.
   Government officials acknowledge the program will brake the
economy into a slight downturn in the first half of the year. But
they predict a robust rebound by the end of the year for a final
growth rate of 2 percent.
   The economy likely grew at an inflation-adjusted 1 percent in
1987 after a decline of 3.8 percent in the previous year.
   In the public's mind, the program has gotten off to a poor start.
   In unveiling the Solidarity Pact in mid-December, the government
put into effect a series of hefty price increases on a variety of
basic goods and services. Most of the gains outstripped boosts in
the minimum daily wage, which now stands at about $3.50.
   ``Everyday we spend more,'' said Gabino Lara, 62, a plumber
waiting for work near the Metropolitan Cathedral. He complained the
minimum wage covers ``nothing ... absolutely nothing.''
   ``Intended to pull together people from all walks of life into a
common front against inflation, the pact is proving an effective
rallying point _ practically everybody seems to be against it. Or
at least not enthusiastically behind it,'' wrote the weekly
magazine Mexico Journal.
   But officials contend the program will overcome its initial
unpopularity.
   ``What would really worry me is not to take them (the economic
measures). There's nothing free,'' said one high-ranking official.

<HEAD>Sunflower Seeds More Than A Symbol in Kansas</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By SALLY STREFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For some Kansas farmers, sunflowers have
become more than a state symbol.
   Wild sunflowers have always flourished here _ hence Kansas'
reputation as the Sunflower State _ but now, farmers in the
northwest and north central part of the state are making money by
growing the tall, green and yellow plants for sale to snack-food
processing plants.
   ``We're the newest crop in the state, and the fastest-growing,''
said John Featherstone, one of two California men who opened the Ag
Dynamics sunflower seed processing plant in Goodland, Kan., in
October 1986.
   The two sought to locate their plant at Goodland, a small
farming community near the state's border with Colorado, because
its high altitude, low humidity, long growing season and irrigation
are perfect for cultivating the high-quality sunflowers used in
snack foods, Featherstone said.
   Although most of the sunflower processing has been done in
Minnesota and North Dakota, the prime growing area is shifting
southward to Kansas, officials said.
   According to an informal survey by the state Department of
Agriculture, the total number of Kansas acres planted in sunflowers
increased from about 60,000 acres in 1982 to about 200,000 in 1987.
Farmers yield about 2,000 pounds of sunflower seeds an acre.
   From 1985 to 1987, the number of acres planted in non-oil seeds
in Kansas increased by about 41,000.
   Sunflower seeds are used to produce oil and bird seed, in
addition to snack foods.
   ``It's not ever going to take over wheat,'' said Agriculture
Secretary Sam Brownback, ``but it does bring in some money for
these people.''
   It wasn't always that way. Kansas has been strong in growing
basic crops with stable markets, but has lagged behind other states
in growing and marketing specialty crops.
   ``They can grow the stuff but the problem has always been
marketing,'' Featherstone said. ``Marketing is more than just
taking orders.''
   When Ag Dynamics first moved into the Goodland area, for
example, some farmers were growing sunflowers for use in sunflower
oil and bird seed. But growers were reluctant to venture into the
snack-food market because they were unfamiliar with the crop and
skeptical of its money-making potential.
   Depressed prices for traditional money-makers, such as corn and
wheat, convinced many to take the plunge into the sunflower
business. Ag Dynamics helped ease the transition for some by
guaranteeing a market their specialty crop.
   ``We cover his (the farmer's) product by selling contracts to
roasters on the other end,'' Featherstone said.
   But Brownback cautions that each farmer must decide whether
alternative crops such as sunflowers are right for his or her
situation.
   Many established farmers have no incentive to try alternative
crops, Brownback said, but smaller farmers with less capital or
those with debts receive needed cash when they grow on contract.
   At the Goodland plant, seeds are dehulled, cleaned, sorted and
bagged and then shipped out of state to several nut companies,
where they are roasted, bagged and distributed, Brownback said.
   Ag Dynamics sells its sunflower seeds to about 40 nut companies,
including Planters. They also export about 25 percent of the crop
to other countries, such as Mexico.
   For the 1988 crop, they will contract with farmers to grow about
30,000 acres, Featherstone said. Their first year, they contracted
for about 350 acres.
   Improving the field-to-market organization has brightened the
future for Kansas sunflower growers considerably. Processing plants
in North Dakota and Minnesota also are beginning to contract with
Kansas farmers for the sunflower seeds they use to produce snacks.
   ``A major portion of the crop is now swinging down into
Kansas,'' Featherstone said.
   And the quality of the seeds grown in northwest Kansas is so
good, Brownback said, ``We're getting some people requesting Kansas
sunflowers.''

   Cesar Nava has a small and prosperous
tool business in this bustling provincial city. But like most
businessmen throughout Mexico, he complains that inflation is
eating him up.
   It is chewing up his profits, his capital, and his working
money. Worst of all, he says he's even getting used to it.
   Like most others _ rich and poor _ he is becoming ``confused,
losing confidence in the system and I don't know what lies in store
tomorrow.''
   Nava's trials and tribulations are typical of those afflicting
business people in Mexico.
   When the economic crisis hit Mexico back in 1982, Nava's
dealership sold mostly electric motors of up to 3 horsepower and
mills for grinding ``nixtamal,'' the corn dough out of which
tortillas are made. Ribbon-saws and other carpentry tools were a
sideline.
   As inflation grew, sales slumped and credit began to dry up,
Nava quickly made carpentry tools his main line, which he sold to
colonial furniture-makers throughout Michoacan state.
   Nava, 45, a mechanical engineer by profession, got rid of the
many salesmen he had on commission, keeping four of the best. He
gave them a salary plus commission, but also made them double as
drivers, deliverers, bill collectors and service men.
   He also gave his customers credit, on easy payment terms.
   ``Not one of them welshed. Some were late with their payments,
but overall my collection rate averaged 98 percent, far better than
any bank in the state,'' Nava said.
   ``I'd give them up to 10 months credit, at about 6 percent when
the banks were charging more than 11 percent monthly,'' he added.
   By late October 1987, Nava's business was thriving. The salesmen
alone were earning an average of 600,000 pesos monthly, the
equivalent of $351, a good wage at the time and about one-quarter
more than their rivals were making.
   But last November, the government suddenly devalued the peso
currency from around 1,708 to around 2,025 to the U.S. dollar in
order to keep the price of Mexico's exports competitive. Nava's
working capital of 40 million pesos shrank overnight in dollar
terms from the equivalent of $23,400 to $19,700.
   The devaluation set off another huge round of inflation, so
President Miguel de la Madrid's lame-duck administration announced
an Economic Solidarity Pact to keep worker's purchasing power _ and
sales _ from shrinking even further.
   The de la Madrid administration has said its main aim is to keep
things relatively stable until Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party's shoo-in candidate, is elected
next July 6 and takes over as president Dec. 1 for a six-year term.
   Salinas de Gortari, who was the current president's budget and
planning secretary, has promised to ``modernize'' the country,
closing or selling hundreds of money-losing state companies,
slashing the budget deficit, reducing unnecessary subsidies.
   ``If Salinas accomplishes even half of what he has promised we
will all be in good shape. The trouble is that they (candidates)
have made promises and promises over the years, but have not
fulfilled them,'' said Nava.
   ``So people believe less every day,'' he said, describing
himself as neither a supporter of nor an indiscriminate critic of
the ruling party.
   Meanwhile, he complains that in real terms his business is
shrinking.
   ``I have raised interest rates to my clients to 8 percent
monthly and reduced payment deadlines to a seven months, maximum,''
he said. ``Even so, we have had to absorb a lot of the added costs
(caused by inflation).
   As a result, he said that, ``while the volume of sales in peso
terms has gone up, the number of units sold has dropped.'' Overall
his net profits have dropped 10 percent since late October.
   ``It's psychological to a great degree. Inflation is in part due
to a lack of confidence,'' he said.

   The stock market stumbled today after vaulting
to a new post-crash high on Monday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks was down
1.33, or 0.06 percent, to 2,070.29 at noon on Wall Street.
   Analysts had expected to see the market follow through on
Monday's advance, but the move failed to materialize in the early
going. Some said the morning's activity was highlighted by big
investors cashing in their gains.
   Stocks losing ground outnumbered gainers by 775 to 602 with 461
issues unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 103.25 million at noon, off from
133.99 million at the same time Monday when dividend plays on
utility stocks ignited an early trading burst.
   ``It's sort of a pause to take profits and see where we go
next,'' observed Eldon Grimm, senior vice president for Birr,
Wilson Securities.
   Analysts said traders found little to inspire them in the
economic data released this morning. The government said its chief
economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January,
but an upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent
recession.
   Also today, the Commerce Department said construction spending
tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months.
But as in the case of the leading index, the drop followed a
revised 0.4 percent increase in December.
   Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations and had
little impact on trading.
   Aside from the economic data, market traders were expected to
focus on the latest rash of takeover deals, which helped propel
Monday's surge.
   Among the most active stocks on the NYSE, Federated Department
Stores gained 1] to 67~ following R.H. Macy's offer of
$73.80-per-share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding
shares. Campeau Corp., which has been chasing Federated with a bid
of $68 per share, said Macy's offer was ``simply not competitive.''
   But other results were mixed. Sears, Roebuck was up \ to 38;
General Electric was down \ to 45\, Pillsbury was up 1 to 37},
Wendy's was down [ to 7]; and International Business Machines Corp.
was up ] to 117~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.51 to 149.95 at mid-day. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index was up 0.65 to 289.11.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41
to 2,071.62, reaching its highest point since the October crash.
The run left the Dow average 20 points higher than the previous
post-crash peak of 2,051.89 on Jan. 7.
   Analysts noted that while today's early performance was
disappointing, the market appeared firm enough to avoid the kind of
slide that followed the January advance. The day after hitting that
peak, the Dow plunged 140 points.

   Texas International Co. has suspended
payment of interest and principal on subordinated debts totaling
$155 million.
   The Oklahoma City-based oil and gas company announced Monday
that interest payments on the $155 million subordinated debt had
become more than the company can handle.
   Payments on other debt obligations will continue, said James
Gregory, director of investor relations for the company.
   ``Our business environment has simply come to the point where it
is presently not in the best interests of either our shareholders
or our subordinated debt holders for us to remain current on our
subordinated debt as it is currently structured,'' said James A.
Kishpaugh, president and chief executive officer.
   The first payment suspended was a biannual interest payment of
$869,000 due Monday on the company's 10 percent Second Delayed
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due Dec. 31, 1993, Gregory
said. Principal on those notes is about $32 million, he said. The
company has about 11 other issues of subordinated notes, he said.
   ``The problem is we're not generating enough cash flow from our
Egyptian assets'' to be able to handle both current debt and move
ahead in the company's exploration plans, Gregory said.
   By the end of 1987, Texas International had expected crude oil
production to be between 3overy on the Khalda concession
in the Egyptian western desert, Gregory said.
   Instead, the concession is producing 20,000 barrels daily, with
Texas International receiving about 10 percent of that, he said.
   Gregory said the company plans to meet with creditors and
establish a plan to allow it to continue its exploration activities
in Egypt and elsewhere.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but an upward
revision for December eased fears of an imminent recession.
   The Commerce Department reported a month ago that the index had
declined 0.2 percent in December after falling in October and
November.
   Three consecutive monthly declines in the index is the
traditional, but not infallible, signal of an impending recession.
   In today's report, however, the December calculation was revised
to show an increase of 0.3 percent.
   Since it was created in 1948, the index has correctly forecast
every recession the country has had with declines for at least
three consecutive months. Thus, the revision to December was taken
by economists as a heartening sign that the country is unlikely to
suffer a downturn this year.
   ``The leading index shows that this is a no-recession year for
the U.S. economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the
Boston Co. ``We will have a slower economy but no recession.''
   Sinai predicted that overall economic growth, as measured by the
gross national product, could dip as low as 0.5 percent in the
current January-March quarter as factories cut back production to
work off a backlog of unsold goods. But he said growth will
gradually strengthen as the year progresses, aided by continued
strong demand for U.S. exports.
   ``The economy will have a reasonably good year for an election
year, especially in view of the mine field of risks that are
around, ranging from the old age of the expansion to the effects of
the stock market crash,'' Sinai said.
   In a second report today, the government said construction
spending dropped a sharp 2.9 percent in January, the biggest
setback in 10 months, as widespread weakness in all categories from
housing to non-residential construction and government building
posted declines.
   The leading index has taken on added significance since Oct. 19,
when stock prices plunged a record 508 points, eclipsing the 1929
market crash, which preceded the Great Depression.
   Since October's steep decline, however, a number of business
barometers have shown strength, including continued declines in the
unemployment rate. Even the stock market has rallied in recent
weeks, climbing more than 48 points on Monday to close at its
highest level since the October collapse.
   Economists are looking for the economy to slow in the first half
of 1988, but they now believe that the sluggish growth will not
worsen into a recession.
   The National Association of Business Economists said Monday that
while more than half of its members responding to a November survey
believed the country would suffer a recession this year, that
figure had now dropped to about one-fourth.
   The 0.6 percent January decline was led by a big increase in new
claims for unemployment benefits, which averaged 351,000 a week in
January, up 12.5 percent from the December level. Since January,
however, the weekly unemployment claims figures have been falling,
further easing recession fears.
   In all, five of the nine available indicators showed weakness
during January. After unemployment claims, the negative factors
were a drop in building permits, a decline in manufacturers' orders
for consumer goods, changes in raw materials prices and a drop in
business delivery times.
   Four indicators showed strength during the month, with a rise in
stock prices making the biggest gain. Other positive forces were
the growth of the money supply, increases in the length of the
average workweek and a rise in orders for plant and equipment.
   The various changes left the index at 190.2 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, until
recently had been expecting a recession in the early part of 1988.
But he said he was now less pessimistic because a variety of
business barometers have rebounded after an initial shock from the
stock market decline.
   ``The economy isn't out of the woods yet, but a recession
forecast is a diminished probability now,'' he said.
   The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
raced ahead at a 4.5 percent rate in the final three months of
1987. But almost all of that increase came from a big buildup of
unsold products.
   Analysts said production will be cut back in the current quarter
while those high inventory levels are worked down. Many economists
think growth will slow to below 1 percent with some even expecting
a negative GNP growth figure from January through March.
   But economists think growth will then slowly improve, allowing
the economy to expand at around 2 percent for all of 1988, about
half of the 1987 level.
   ``Most of the growth in the economy is going to come from
exports with consumer spending and home building continuing to be
depressed,'' said John O. Wilson, chief economist at Bank of
America in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Italy's Opposition to 1988 Budget Endangers EEC Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial reforms agreed to by leaders
of the European Economic Community two weeks ago appeared
threatened Tuesday by Italy's refusal to pay its share into the
1988 budget.
   Sources within the 12-nation Common Market said Italy's
objections to the budget draft could lead other EEC states to
disavow their earlier consent to the reforms. ``Once one country
begins to question the agreement, all others will want to do the
same,'' one official said.
   The official, who asked to remain anonymous in keeping with
established practice, said the problem is likely to be sent to a
meeting of EEC foreign ministers to be held March 5 at Konstanz,
West Germany.
   ``Of course, we are very disappointed that we have to deal with
this problem at this stage,'' said a German official who asked not
to be named. ``The whole situation endangers the 1988 budget ...
everything is blocked,'' he said.
   The much-heralded reforms, agreed in Brussels Feb. 13, were
designed to rein in the EEC's skyrocketing farm spending and give
the trading bloc a sound financial footing for the next five years.
   But Italy's objections had forced Common Market budget ministers
last Wednesday to suspend efforts to adopt the overdue spending
plan.
   In a letter Monday to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Prime
Minister Giovanni Goria rejected the formula as offending ``the
principles'' on which the reforms stand.
   An official message from Rome Tuesday said Italy's contribution
to the fund was at least $143 million higher than agreed at the
summit.
   West Germany, which currently holds the EEC presidency, gave
Italy until noon Tuesday to change its mind.
   But the deadline passed and the Italian government remained
adamant in opposing the new formula for calculating national
contributions to a budget supplement set at 7.6 billion European
currency units, or $8.2 billion.
   That amount is needed to bridge the gap between anticipated
spending needs totaling the equivalent of $54.6 billion and revenue
available under current EEC rules.

<HEAD>Texan Moves to Buy Control of Huge Aluminum Producer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas financier Charles Hurwitz has moved
to gain control of KaiserTech, the world's fifth largest aluminum
producer, with an agreement to pay up to $230 million for a 32.1
percent voting share.
   Hurwitz' bid to KaiserTech Chairman Alan E. Clore competed with
a bid by Marc Rich, a Swiss aluminum business owner. Hurwitz, like
Clore, has no experience in the aluminum industry.
   The announcement Monday said the company would have preferred
that the British industrialist's' holdings be sold more broadly.
Clore was under intense pressure to sell from creditors.
   If Clore hadn't found a buyer by a Monday deadline, he could
have faced default on loans he had obtained using Kaiser stock as
collateral. After the stock plunged because of the October market
crash, lenders wanted repayment.
   The Oakland-based company's stock rose $1.125 a share Monday to
close at $11.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Under the deal, Los Angeles-based Maxxam Group Inc., a company
controlled by Hurwitz, agreed to buy from Clore and his lenders 6.2
million shares of KaiserTech stock for $12 a share.
   Once Maxxam purchases the stock, it has an option to acquire 8.2
million shares of KaiserTech convertible preferred stock at $13.75
to $14 a share. Maxxam also must pay $8 million to $10 million in
expenses, the nature of which was undisclosed.
   In addition, Maxxam is negotiating agreements with other parties
to buy an additional 2.8 million shares of KaiserTech common stock
for $12 a share.
   It was not clear what effect Maxxam's purchase would have
immediately on the KaiserTech board. All 14 seats are up for
election shortly. Included are eight board members appointed by
Clore, including Clore and James Pasman, Kaiser's chief executive
officer.
   The probable changes in KaiserTech's executive suite and
boardroom come as the company is rebounding from six straight years
of losses. Kaiser has sold its chemicals, oil and gas businesses,
has slashed debt, and is concentrating on its core aluminum
business.

<HEAD>British Aerospace Interested in Buying Rover Group From Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Aerospace PLC has expressed interest in
acquiring state-owned Rover Group PLC, the moneylosing automaker
that the government previously said it intended to sell.
   Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said Tuesday that the
government would negotiate until April 30 with British Aerospace,
which was privatized in 1985. If the negotations fail, Lord Young
said the government would explore other options for divesting its
99.8 percent stake in the automaker.
   Rover Group Chairman Graham Day said he welcomed British
Aerospace's interest.
   ``For Rover Group we see this as a very exciting opportunity.
The two groups are complementary and not competitive,'' he said.
``In addition, it offers a speedy route to privatization, with the
minimum disruption to our management, work force, dealer network
and suppliers.''
   The government had said it would sell the Rover Group, makers of
the Land Rover vehicle and Sterling cars, by 1992.
   Rover Group is comprised of the Austin Rover carmaker and the
Land Rover utility vehicle maker. It sold the Leyland trucks unit
last year.
   In Rover's most recent earnings report, the group said it lost
$74 million on revenue of $2.8 billion in the first six months of
1987. But the loss was 80 percent less than in the year-earlier
period.
   The government took over the automaker, formerly called British
Leyland, in 1975 to prevent its collapse.

<HEAD>GM To Sell Fairfield Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has announced an
agreement in principle to sell its Fairfield auto parts stamping
plant to Cynba International Inc.
   Cynba, headed by automotive executive Anthony Barclae, proposes
to continue operating the stamping plant, GM officials said at a
news conference Tuesday.
   GM declined to reveal the sale price. It is one of two plants in
southwest Ohio that GM is closing as part of a nationwide program
to cut operating costs and stay competitive.
   GM shut down its Norwood auto assembly plant last Aug. 26,
eliminating 4,300 jobs there, and plans to close the Fairfield
operation in August.
   Barclae proposes to buy the Fairfield plant and equipment. He
also promises to try to hire laid-off GM employees, GM officials
said.
   The deal is contingent on a feasibility assessment. Barclae has
90 days to explore business opportunities and talk with city, state
and United Auto Workers union officials and to decide whether to
buy the plant.
   About 2,500 people once worked at the Fairfield plant. Current
employment stands at 971.
   Barclae owns and operates two sheet metal stamping and assembly
plants _ Shadyside Stamping Corp., in Shadyside, Ohio, and Pigeon
Manufacturing Corp., in Pigeon, Mich. He also operates Cameo Color
Coat Inc., a Detroit-based automotive corrosion resistance painting
company.

<TEXT>
   Peter Konzak of Devils Lake rummaged
through the clutter of his briefcase and found a letter as proof
that his invention, a ``pop-up scarecrow,'' has already earned him
some attention, if not wealth.
   ``I am still invited to the Johnny Carson show. It is a standing
invitation,'' the 66-year-old retired farmer said, answering
questions about his scarecrow at the second annual North Dakota
Inventors Congress.
   Forty inventors and manufacturers, most of them from North
Dakota, showed off gizmos, gadgets and thingamajigs at the show
that ended Tuesday.
   Spokesman Scot Nething said only four of them had displayed
their wares in last year's show. ``It's a whole new crop.''
   The inventions showcased this year ranged from an ultralight
airplane manufactured in Edgeley to a swinging mailbox that a Minot
man devised after a neighbor complained about his mailbox getting
knocked down by snowplows each winter.
   And then there was a lawnmower doubling as a fertilizer
spreader, a clothes dryer vent closure, a crayon holder, a
retractable engine heater cord and a wheel bearing packer.
   Konzak's pride and joy stood at one side of his booth on the
floor of the Jamestown Civic Center.
   It was a steel contraption wearing fluorescent work gloves,
decked out in red and yellow ribbons and sporting a dummy's head
adorned with a cowboy hat.
   In a sunflower field, the clumsy-looking ``pest-scaring device''
jumps up from among the plants, twirls and whistles to startle
blackbirds and keep them from feasting on the seeds, Konzak said
Monday.
   ``All you need is one on 40 acres,'' he said. ``With the buzzer
in here and all the stuff, it can pay for itself in one year.'' A
battery and propane tank give the scarecrow its life.
   Since getting his mechanical scarecrow patented in April 1986,
Konzak has made about 30 of them and sold them all at about $500
apiece, he said.
   But he said he hasn't made any money yet. ``I've just made my
expenses. I put $20,000 into patenting this thing.''
   Business hasn't even been that brisk for the ultralight maker,
Jackson Manufacturing Co. of Edgeley, which built its first
ultralight airplane a year ago and has sold two so far, sales
manager Gene Hanson said. A yellow one displayed at the Inventors
Congress costs $7,450, not including options.
   ``Ranchers can use them. Retired people. Anybody who likes to
fly can use them. It isn't any different than boating, motorcycling
and snowmobiling,'' Hanson said. Ultralights don't require pilots'
licenses.
   Gordon Johnson of Cando displayed his ``Garda-A-Lok,'' which he
patented a year ago. It clamps around the outside door handle of
motels or apartments, a lock over a lock. ``Nobody gets into that
room,'' he said.
   ``Tonight, there will be one on our motel room when we leave
it,'' he said.
   Walt Behrens of Minot developed his damage-proof mailbox last
fall and sold 16 so far at $46.90 each.
   The idea is simple _ a mailbox that swings back into place if a
snowplow or other vehicle gets off the side of the road and bashes
it.
   Behrens, who retired after 28 years as an assistant airport
manager, came up with the idea after a neighbor complained about
how difficult it was replanting an uprooted mailbox when the ground
was frozen.
   Behrens said he provides his own testing laboratory: ``I got my
own out by the road, of course, and I give it a bat and a swing to
see how it's working.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly lower against major
foreign currencies Tuesday after another sluggish trading session
in Europe. Gold prices rose.
   Traders said the dollar came under some mild selling pressure
late in the day, possibly because of a slightly worse-than-expected
U.S. leading indicators statistic for January.
   The Commerce Department said the index fell 0.6 percent in
January, but the decline was partly offset by a revision in the
December index to a 0.3 percent rise from a previously announced
0.2 percent fall.
   Many dealers discounted the dollar's slight decline Tuesday and
said the market remains stagnant.
   The British pound, meanwhile, was boosted by higher interest
rates in Britain. Sterling rose to $1.7775 from $1.7725 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday
included: 1.6855 West German marks, down from 1.6875; 1.3915 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3903; 5.7065 French francs, down from 5.7150;
1.8940 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8945; 1,244.35 Italian lire, up
from 1,244.25; 1.2570 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2622.
   The dollar rose in Tokyo, closing at 128.63 Japanese yen, up

<TEXT>
   Looking at Japan's trade figures for the past year
is like looking at a glass of water _ the glass is either half
empty or half full, depending on one's perspective.
   From the Japanese side, the figures show improvement, with
exports beginning to decline in volume terms after years of growth
that provoked resentment among its trading partners.
   From the American side, the trade deficit with Japan rose again,
mainly because the soaring yen inflated the cost of Japanese
imports.
   In Tokyo, government officials are optimistic that recent trade
statistics show a trend toward reducing Japan's huge trade surplus.
But independent economists are voicing reservations over long-term
trade prospects.
   Referring to the latest U.S. trade figures, a Ministry of
International Trade and Industry official said the tide is slowly
turning and that, although the figures showed the biggest deficit
in history, the imbalance with Japan actually decreased.
   ``It depends on whether you look at trade in yen or dollar
terms,'' he said.
   Japan's exports rose 5.6 percent in dollar terms but fell 8.2
percent in yen terms in the last three months of 1987, compared to
a year earlier. At the same time, imports rose in terms of both
dollars and yen.
   ``As for volume, Japan's imports are growing, with a big
increase from the newly industrialized countries and Europe, though
the increase with the United States was not so large,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to U.S. figures, the trade deficit last year was a
record $171.2 billion, up from $156.2 billion in 1986. The United
States' largest bilateral deficit again was with Japan _ a record
$59.8 billion, up from $58.6 billion in 1986 and $49.7 billion in
1985.
   Ron Napier, vice president and Japan economist with the
investment firm of Salomon Brothers Inc., does see a short-term
easing in the trade imbalance, but warns that good figures in the
short term may be misleading.
   ``The first quarter looks good, and we will see a brief lull
because Japanese automakers have too much inventory already in the
United States,'' he said. ``But I don't really think the figures
for the final quarter of 1987 signal that Japan's trade surplus has
topped out. There were basically no trends in 1987.''
   Barriers keeping U.S. exporters out of certain Japanese markets,
such as highly controversial restrictions on imported beef, citrus
fruits and rice, add to the trade imbalance problem and have come
under heavy fire from the U.S. government.
   But the most pressing question now may not be barriers or
exchange rates, Napier said.
   ``I think that the yen-dollar rate is no longer a problem for
U.S. exporters. More marketing focus is needed in this country,
which traditionally has not been a target,'' he said.
   Napier said the United States lags behind Europe and the newly
industrialized countries in expanding exports to Japan because of a
lack of distribution facilities, an insufficient sales force and
scanty product representation.
   ``It was interesting to hear that U.S. Steel would be exporting
again, but that they chose Europe as their market,'' he said.
   The official at the Japanese trade ministry agreed.
   ``Success depends on exporters' efforts,'' he said. ``Exporters
in the U.S. now have the chance to compete. Japanese consumers are
changing and there are more and more foreign products for sale in
supermarkets here.
   ``Domestic demand for foreign goods is increasing, so now is the
time for the U.S. to try to expand in the Japanese market.
Exporters should act immediately to take advantage of developments
here,'' he added.
   ``As for the future prospects of Japan's trade with the U.S., I
think that with the yen-dollar rate our imports will continue to
steadily increase.''
   Napier also offers some comfort to Americans wondering if the
trade imbalance with Japan will ever end.
   ``The marketing focus is starting to change, with more attention
being given to Japan,'' he said. ``It may take awhile, but this
will eventually have an impact.''

<HEAD>Pittsburg & Midway To Buy New Mexico Mines In $97.7 Million
Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved
the sale of Kaiser Coal Corp.'s two northern New Mexico coal mines
to Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co. for $97.7 million, a company
official said.
   But the deal's consummation hinges on the resolution of a
dispute over a coal delivery contract with Arizona's Salt River
Project, said Fred Meurer, Pittsburg & Midway manager of public
affairs, on Tuesday.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Charles E. Matheson on Monday approved
Pittsburg & Midway's purchase of the York Canyon Complex _ two coal
mines 35 miles west of Raton, N.M. _ for $88.1 million in cash and
the assumption of $9.6 million in Kaiser's liabilities, said Meurer.
   ``We're gratified at the ruling, and we'd like to close on the
deal as soon as possible,'' Meurer said.
   The bankruptcy judge's ruling was required because Kaiser Coal
Corp. and its parent company, Kaiser Steel Corp., have been
operating under Chapter 11 reorganization since February 1987, said
Meurer.
   But he said that part of the agreement calls for his company's
assumption of Kaiser's 25-year agreement to supply 475,000 tons of
coal per year from the York mines to the Salt River Project _ while
the Salt River Project is trying to end the agreement through a
petition to the bankruptcy court.
   ``Prior to closure of this sale, this litigation must be
favorably resolved,'' said Meurer. He said Matheson was scheduled
to hear arguments March 22 and 23.
   When the deal is made final, Pittsburg & Midway, a Chevron Corp.
subsidiary, will gain control of a surface mine and an underground
mine that together employ 275 hourly employees and 75 salaried
workers, said Meurer.
   He said the Pittsburg & Midway has been managing the mines since
January and laid off 74 employees on Feb. 22.
   The mines produced 1.75 million tons of coal last year, Meurer
said.

<TEXT>
   Archer Daniels Midland Co., a major processor
of raw agricultural commodities, has signed a letter of intent to
buy CLC of America Inc., a St. Louis-based barge line, the
companies have announced.
   The barge company emerged in December from a complex Chapter 11
bankruptcy, during which it fended off several buy-out offers. ADM
agreed to pay about $60 million in common stock for the company in
a transaction to be completed by June, company officials said.
   The acquisition will substantially increase Archer Daniels
Midland's ability to to transport grain and finished products, ADM
vice-president Richard E. Burket said Monday.
   ``We've been doing a greater volume and have greater needs for
river transportation,'' Burket said.
   CLC has a fleet of 515 barges, 13 line haul towboats, 12
switching boats and barge fleeting facilities in Wisconsin, Iowa,
New Orleans and St. Louis.
   The transaction does not include Morgan Drive Away Inc., a
subsidiary of CLC that provides highway transportation of mobile
homes, recreational vehicles and other commodities, CLC officials
said.
   Industry observers view the merger as a mark of confidence in a
barge industry slowly recovering from years of financial turmoil.
CLC faced a staggering pile of debts when it filed for bankruptcy
in January 1986, but in the last two years, barge shipments have
increased and barge rates have risen.

   The stock market crept ahead today after
vaulting to a new post-crash high Monday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks
recovered from a small loss earlier in the day to stand at
2,071.95, up 0.33, or 0.02 percent, at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts had expected to see the market follow through on
Monday's strong advance, but the trend was mostly disappointing
with two hours of trading to go. Some said the morning's activity
was highlighted by big investors cashing in their gains.
   Stocks losing ground outnumbered gainers by 802 to 688 with 424
issues unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 147.54 million at 2 p.m., well
behind the levels reached at the same time Monday when dividend
plays on utility stocks ignited an early trading burst.
   ``It's sort of a pause to take profits and see where we go
next,'' observed Eldon Grimm, senior vice president for Birr,
Wilson Securities.
   Analysts said traders found little to inspire them in the
economic data released this morning. The government said its chief
economic forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January,
but an upward revision for December eased fears of an imminent
recession.
   Also today, the Commerce Department said construction spending
tumbled 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months.
But like the leading index, the drop followed a revised 0.4 percent
increase in December.
   Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations and had
little impact on trading.
   Aside from the economic data, traders focused on issues swept up
in the latest rash of takeover deals, which had powered Monday's
surge.
   Among the most active stocks on the NYSE, Federated Department
Stores gained 1[ to 67| following R.H. Macy's offer of
$73.80-per-share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding

<HEAD>Airbus Told to Negotiate with American McDonnell Douglas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior officials from Britain, France, West Germany
and Spain on Tuesday ordered Europe's Airbus Industrie to try to
reach an agreement on industrial and commercial cooperation with
McDonnell Douglas Corp. by mid-1988.
   The decision emerged at the end of a one-day meeting of
transport ministers and chief executives of the industrial partners
in the European commercial aircraft group.
   Aviation industry observers said it was the latest display of
Europe's eagerness to penetrate the lucrative U.S. market while
trying to reduce trade friction over American claims of unfair
competition by Airbus.
   Trade negotiators from the United States, the European Community
Commission and the four Airbus partner-countries are scheduled to
meet in Konstanz, West Germany, March 18 to discuss U.S. claims
that the Europeans unfairly subsidize the consortium.
   French Transport Minister Jacques Douffiagues told reporters
after the ministers' meeting that Airbus' mandate is ''unlimited,''
although the negotiations would tend to focus more on planned
aircraft than on existing programs.
   A cooperation accord with McDonnell could take the form of a
joint venture or co-production scheme, he said.
   Douffiagues suggested that possible areas of useful cooperation
between Airbus and Mcdonnell could include small short-range jets
with between 100-150 seats as well as large aircraft with 350 seats
or more. ''There is no upper limit,'' he said.
   ''Any agreement with Mcdonnell must be balanced, taking account
of the advantages and constraints for both sides,'' Douffiagues
said.
   Douffiagues said part of the interest in an agreement is that it
would ease Airbus's access to the U.S. market, where the group has
only three customers.
   A statement released after the meeting said Airbus' mandate is
to negotiate ''diligently'' and ''with a will to reaching a
balanced agreement that is beneficial to the two parties.''
   The industrial partners of the Airbus consortium _ France's
Aerospatiale, Britain's Aerospace, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm of
West Germany and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas _ have had
contacts with Mcdonnell for almost two years now on eventual
cooperation.
   Previous talks with McDonnell Douglas on possible cooperation
collapsed in 1986.

   W.T. Grimm & Co., a firm that specializes in the

statistics.
   Wall Street giant Merrill Lynch & Co. said Tuesday it had

   ``The acquisition of W. T. Grimm further enhances our ability to

of the Merrill Lynch Consumer Markets, a subsidiary of the parent
company, said in a press statement.
   The statement also announced the appointment of Jeffrey S.
Feldman, a director of Merrill Lynch's business financial services
unit, as president of Grimm, which will remain headquartered in
Chicago. James J. Kelly, Grimm's principal shareholder, will become
a senior vice president, the statement said.

   A management group led by GAF Corp.'s
chairman has raised its bid for the company to $1.4 billion, and
the board of directors agreed to submit the offer to shareholders
``without endorsement,'' GAF said Tuesday.
   The deal, now valued at $1.4 billion, would provide $46 in cash
and junior securities with a face value of $6.50 for each share.
   In December, the group led by Chairman Samuel J. Heyman had
offered $1.35 billion, or $40 in cash and $8.50 in securities per
share.
   That represented a downward revision from its $2.3 billion first
offer, made in September, of $64 in cash and $2.50 face value in
debt securities. Heyman said rising interest rates made it
impossible for the group to continue the original bid.
   A special committee of the board of the specialty chemicals and
building materials company has agreed to submit the new proposal
``without endorsement'' to shareholders, GAF said.
   To permit that, shareholders must first vote on an amendment to
the company charter.
   The amendment would allow shareholders to act in place of the
board in considering a merger offer, as the Heyman-led proposal has
been presented.
   The committee had earlier rejected the $64-a-share proposal as
being inadequate. GAF said it had decided to let stockholders
decide based on the favorable opinion of the offer by Salomon
Brothers Inc., retained by the committee as financial advisers.
   The decision was also made following the committee's
instructions to Salomon Brothers to solicit other possible
purchasers, GAF said.
   The committee said that if it receives an ``economically
superior alternative proposal'' for GAF, it could cancel its
agreement with the buyout group.
   ``We think the price is a fare and full price,'' Heyman said.
``It's seven times the price of the stock only four years ago.''
   GAF stock, which reached a low of $31.50 after the Oct. 19 stock
market crash, has traded around $50 with speculation about an
agreement.
   It was $49.75, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange in
afternoon trading Tuesday.
   The agreement will put the management offer ``to the test of the
marketplace,'' said Heyman, who wrested control of GAF in 1983
after a bitter proxy fight to oust former Chairman Jesse Werner.
   During his tenure, GAF has made hundreds of millions of dollars
in unsuccessful buyout attempts of Union Carbide Corp. and
Borg-Warner Corp.
   ``We're primarily an operating company, but we're not retiring
from the takeover arena,'' the 48-year-old executive said Tuesday.
   Heyman owns 2.8 million shares of GAF, or about 10 percent of
its outstanding stock.
   He said the takeover would be financed by loans from a bank
syndicate led by Chase Manhattan, a limited debt offering and the
group's own money.
   GAF also said it had reached tentative settlements of lawsuits
brought in connection with the buyout offer.

   Du Pont Co. will pay $39
million to clean up ditches, lagoons and other groundwater sites
contaminated by hazardous waste that seeped from its Chamber Works
plant here, a company official said Tuesday.
   The cleanup is part of an administrative consent order with the
state Department of Environmental Protection and represents the
largest settlement by a single company for one location to date in
the United States, said Commissioner Richard T. Dewling.
   The company will construct a 2{-mile pipeline that will
transport waste water from the plant to Du Pont's on-site water
treatment plant, assistant plant manager Stuart Schenk said.
Construction is expected to be completed in 1991.
   In addition, three water basins and about six miles of unlined
ditches on the 1,600-acre site will be cleaned up and no longer
used to store waste water, Schenk said.
   The company makes about 750 chemical products at the facility in
the Deepwater section of this Salem County community. The waste
water is generated by the manufacture of those products.
   The plant is also the state's largest commercial hazardous waste
disposal facility and one of three existing industrial facilities
seeking state approval to build an incinerator to burn hazardous
wastes generated elsewhere in the state.

<HEAD>BP America Returns To Profitability</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BP America Inc., enjoying higher oil prices in
1987, reported a return to profitability.
   The former Standard Oil Co., now a segment of British Petroleum
Co. PLC, earned $564 million in 1987. Standard Oil incurred a $188
million loss in 1986, its final full year not under BP's control.
   Due to tax accounting requirements of the United Kingdom, BP
America could not report fourth-quarter net earnings, spokesman
John Andes said Tuesday. The company's results were released Monday.
   Income from operations in the fourth quarter was $613 million,
compared with $109 million in Standard Oil's fourth quarter of
1986. In all of 1987, operating income totaled $2.26 billion,
compared with an operating loss of $242 million in 1986.
   The 1986 annual loss included $1.13 billion for writedowns and
restructuring charges.
   Operating income reflects what BP America contributed to its
parent company's results. Operating income does not include regular
tax charges or interest payments on debt.
   The report was the first release of financial results by BP
America since June, when British Petroleum bought the 45 percent of
common stock of Standard Oil Co. that it did not already own.
   BP America sales were $15.4 billion, compared with $13.9 billion
in 1986. For the fourth quarter, sales were $4.01 billion, up from
$3.35 billion for the year-ago period.
   ``As these results show, BP America's performance is highly
dependent on crude oil prices,'' said Robert B. Horton, chief
executive officer of the company.
   ``In 1987, higher crude oil prices, lower costs and increased
production have significantly improved the contribution made by the
exploration and production segment,'' he continued. ``We also
benefited from the resumption of activity at the Bingham Canyon
mine (in Utah) at a time of higher copper prices.''

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Concerns about increased supplies offset bullish expectations of
new export business, analysts said.
   ``It really turned into a quiet affair here after we were down

   Wheat posted the greatest losses, with pressure stemming from
the Agriculture Department's auction of surplus wheat scheduled for
later in the afternoon, Gidel said.
   The auction marks the beginning of a series of thrice-weekly
auctions which will replace the weekly Friday sales the USDA began
in November.
   The agency has said it hopes to sell 10 million bushels of wheat
in each of the new auctions compared to targets of about 25 million
bushels for the old weekly auctions.
   At the close, wheat was 3} cents to 4{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.11 a bushel; corn was

<HEAD>Net Profit Flat at Consumer Product Giant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch home products giant,
reported Tuesday that its fourth-quarter net profit was flat as
revenue slipped a bit.
   The company, which is made up of Unilever PLC of Britain and
Unilever NV of the Netherlands, said its after-tax profit was
unchanged at 186 million pounds, which is the equivalent of about
$331 million. Sales dipped 0.7 percent to 4.45 billion pounds, or
about $7.92 billion, from 4.48 billion pounds.
   Unilever said pre-tax profit on its North American activities
doubled to the equivalent of $178 million.
   For all of 1987, Unilever reported a net profit of 756 million
pounds, or about $1.35 billion. That was up 14 percent from
earnings of 664 million pounds the previous year.
   Sales for the year fell 3 percent to 16.55 billion pounds, or
about $29.5 billion, from 17.14 billion pounds in 1986.
   Pre-tax profit on North American activities also doubled for the
year, rising to the equivalent of $425 million.
   Unilever said that for the full year, sales gains were recorded
in most product groups and substantial contributions were made by
recent acquisitions, including the U.S.-based Chesebrough-Pond's
Inc., which was purchased in December 1986 for $3.15 billion.

<HEAD>Court Clears New Share Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Brussels court on Tuesday approved
Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.'s issuance of 12 million new
shares in a ruling that could intensify the battle for control of
Belgium's biggest holding company.
   Societe Generale announced in January it was raising its capital
to 40.2 million shares from 28.2 million shares, shortly after
Italian investor Carlo De Benedetti indicated he wanted to gain
control of the company.
   De Benedetti raised questions about the new capital issue in
court, and the courts stripped the shares of voting rights in two
previous decisions.
   Tuesday's ruling would retore voting rights for those shares
temporarily and if approved by a higher court, the issue would
dilute the stake of all shareholders.
   Belgian industrialist Andre Leysen, who is aligned with De
Benedetti, said he has an option on 10 million of the 12 million
new shares.
   But the management of Societe Generale, which opposes De
Benedetti's bid, has said the option is no longer valid because
Leysen failed to form an alliance in support of Societe Generale
early last month.
   Societe Generale Director Etienne Davignon said the new shares
are owned by seven companies from Belgium, Luxembourg and France
that have formed an alliance which is siding with the 166-year-old
company.
   The alliance claims to hold 52 percent of Societe Generale's
original 28.2 million shares.
   De Benedetti has claimed he and his allies control 47.2 percent
of Societe Generale's shares, but Davignon said it was only 43
percent.
   If a higher court confirms the capital increase, Davignon said
it would reduce De Benedetti's stake to about 28.5 percent.
   Meanwhile, De Benedetti said in a statement from Milan he
intends to call a shareholders meeting to decide the future of the
company after its public offer to buy more Societe Generale shares
ends March 4.
   A source close to De Benedetti said ``we are fully confident we
will have a majority of shares at the meeting.''
   Leysen's holding company Gevaert N.V said in a statement it was
``now in a position'' to buy the new shares as it had agreed to do
on Feb. 3.
   The shares were initially placed with a Societe Generale
subsidiary but have since been sold to the seven companies allied
with it, Davignon said.
   The top official of Societe Generale, Rene Lamy, said last week
the agreement with Leysen was no longer valid ``since Leysen has
failed to cement a Belgian federation'' in support of Societe
Generale.
   Leysen could not get a deal with several Belgian and European
groups to keep the company anchored in Belgium earlier this month.
   Instead, he reached a partnership agreement with De Benedetti
and the Copeba holding company, the Belgian subsidiary of the
French Paribas group.
   Together they founded a new holding company called Europa 92.
   The management of Societe Generale first announced the capital
increase Jan. 18, just after De Benedetti said he wanted to take
control and turn it into a holding company with interests across
Europe.
   Societe Generale has interests in about 1,400 companies
worldwide and in about half of Belgium's top 50 companies. It has
an important stake in Belgium's gas, electricity and petroleum
sector and in Belgium's largest bank.

   ``Although the energy issue has been resolved, the second issue

<HEAD>More Sold To Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An additional 500,000 metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat has been sold to the Soviet Union, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The sale, equal to about 18.3 million bushels, was handled by
Continental Grain Co., 100,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 375,000 tons;
and Mitsui Grain Corp., 25,000 tons.
   At recent prices averaging $2.75 per bushel, the wheat would
have a farm value of about $50 million.
   More than 6.8 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to
the Soviet Union under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP, for delivery in the year that began last Oct. 1.
   George J. Pope, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said that only 200 tons
of wheat are still available to the Soviet Union under current EEP
authorization. There has been no official indication that a new
line of subsidy may be approved.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   Pope said the subsidies, or bonuses, averaged $27 per ton on the
latest sales, or about 74 cents per bushel. The subsidies for the
Soviet Union have been available only for wheat.
   The sales also are part of the grain the Soviet Union is
committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term
agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9
million tons of U.S. grain. The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases include a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have
the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or
soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _
up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans, or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   In addition, 2.62 million tons of U.S. corn, 813,300 tons of
soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by
the Soviets for delivery this year.

   The stock market finished lower today after
fighting to hold the gains that propelled it to a post-crash high
Monday.
   Analysts had expected to see the market follow through on
Monday's strong advance, but the trend was mostly disappointing.
Some said the day's activity was highlighted by big investors
cashing in their gains.
   ``It's sort of a pause to take profits and see where we go
next,'' observed Eldon Grimm, senior vice president for Birr,
Wilson Securities.
   Traders found little evidence in the government's latest batch
of statistics to satisfy their curiosity about the health of the
economy. The Commerce Department said its chief economic
forecasting gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but
December's Index of Leading Economic Indicators was revised upward,
easing fears of an imminent recession.
   Also today, the government said construction spending tumbled
2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. But as
was the case with the leading index, the drop followed a revised
0.4 percent increase in December.
   Because the figures were inconclusive, they had little impact on
trading, analysts said.
   Aside from the economic data, traders focused on issues swept up
in the latest rash of takeover deals, which had powered Monday's
surge.

<DATELINE>MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lionel Trains Inc. will keep 1988
sales rolling with a tiny video camera that almost lets model
railroaders feel like part of their prized layouts, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
   And in an effort to establish itself in other areas, Lionel is
making plastic parts for a new board game for would-be rail
tycoons, Marketing Director John Brady said.
   Lionel hopes the high-tech, miniaturized ``Railscope'' video
camera, expected to be in stores in time for Christmas, will be the
ticket to higher sales.
   The camera is small enough to mount in a locomotive for an
engineer's eye view of a model railroader's prized layout.
   ``It's just like getting small and becoming part of that
layout,'' Brady said. ``It's a simple idea that was not doable
until this year.''
   Lionel developed the tiny black-and-white electronic camera with
the help of James Wickstead Design in New Jersey. The picture can
be displayed on a standard television or even larger screen,
although Lionel will sell a 4{-inch monitor, Brady said.
   Railscope was introduced at the annual Toy Fair trade show in
February in New York, he said, adding, ``I had people asking to buy
the prototype.''
   It will sell for about $300 in a model-train collectors market
in which Lionel's prices, for example, range from less than $75 for
a train set to more than $1,000 for a locomoti
   Attached to each bomb were about 300 sticks of dynamite,
according to a communique issued by the civil aviation office. The
bombs and the dynamite were buried at the western end of the
runway, and were connected to a 2,000-foot-long detonating cable
that ran to a secluded ravine nearby, it said.
   The explosives were discovered on Saturday, the communique said.
   According to La Nacion, a government-owned and -operated daily
published in Santiago, the bombs represented ``a new extremist plot
against the head of state's life.''
   It cited unidentified security sources as saying the bombs were
planted in late January, after it was announced that Pinochet would
attend an agricultural fair in La Serena on Jan. 29. The president
later canceled the visit.
   In September 1986, Pinochet survived an ambush of his motorcade
by the pro-communist Manuel Rodriguez Front, the country's
principal leftist guerrilla organization. Five of his bodyguards
were killed in the attack by machine-gun and rocket fire.
   Pinochet on Tuesday credited providence with foiling the
reported plot in La Serena.
   ``God doesn't want to carry me off, so he helps me,'' Pinochet
told reporters in the southern city of Puerto Montt, where he was
inspecting public works projects. His remarks were broadcast by
Santiago radio stations.
   ``It give me more enthusiasm to fight for my country, as I am
doing,'' he said. ``I'm a lot luckier than they (extremists)
think.''
   He said it was only ``by chance'' that he did not travel to La
Serena as planned. ``There were a series of problems that obliged
me to stay in Santiago,'' he said without elaboration.

   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported Tuesday its fourth
quarter-earnings jumped 34 percent as sales at the
rapidly-expanding discount store chain rose 30 percent.
   Wal-Mart said that for the quarter ended Jan. 31., it earned
$247.1 million, or 44 cents per share, up from $184.3 million, or
32 cents per share, in the final three months of fiscal 1986.
   Sales for the 1987 quarter rose to $5 billion from $3.85 billion.
   For the full year, Wal-Mart said its earnings were up 39 percent
to $627.6 million, or $1.11 a share, from $450.1 million, or 79
cents a share, in all of 1986.
   Sales for the year totaled $15.96 billion, up from $11.91
billion in 1986.
   Wal-Mart continued its explosive growth throughout 1987. As of
Jan. 31, 1988, the company had 1,211 stores, including Wal-Mart,
Dot Drugs, Sam's Wholesale Club and Hypermart USA stores. On Jan.

<HEAD>Dollar Down Slightly, Gold Mixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell marginally against most key
currencies Tuesday, reflecting what dealers called a narrow trading
range that has emerged over the past several days.
   Gold prices rose overseas but were mixed in the United States.
As of 4 p.m. EST, Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at
$430.45 a troy ounce, down 15 cents from the price late Monday.
   Currency dealers said there was little news to influence the
behavior of the dollar. They said a Commerce Department report on
the index of leading indicators, an important economic barometer,
failed to convey a definite trend.
   The department said the index fell 0.6 percent in January but it
revised the December figure from a 0.2 percent drop to a 0.3
percent increase. That revision snapped a string of three straight
monthly declines, which has often signaled an impending recession.
   ``We need something more specific to set the market one way or
another,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at the New
York branch of the Italian bank Banco di Sicilia.
   Gary Dorsch, senior money market economist at LNS Financial
Group Inc. in Chicago, said ``there appears to be very little
impetus for traders to move out of the dollar's range, at least in
the near term.''
   By contrast, he said, currencies such as the British pound and
Canadian dollar seemed to be appreciating because of relatively
high interest rates in Britain and Canada.
   ``We're seeing a lot of deflation in commodity markets and
weakness in gold prices, which supports the idea that global
interest rates will be steady to lower,'' Dorsch said. ``So
international money managers are searching for higher yields.''
   The dollar rose in Tokyo, closing at 128.63 Japanese yen, up
from the Monday close of 128.12 yen. Later in London, the dollar
was lower at 128.30 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York,
the dollar was trading at 128.32 yen, marginally higher than 128.24
rate late Monday.
   The British pound rose to $1.7775 from $1.7725 Monday on the
London market. Later in New York, sterling was quoted at $1.7766,
more than the $1.7742 quoted late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Monday
levels included: 1.6864 West German marks, down from 1.6874; 1.3916
Swiss francs, down from 1.3931; 1.2578 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2592; 5.7100 French francs, down from 5.7155; 1,243.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,243.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday included:
1.6855 West German marks, down from 1.6875; 1.3915 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3903; 5.7065 French francs, down from 5.7150; 1.8940 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8945; 1,244.35 Italian lire, up from
1,244.25; 1.2570 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2622.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $428.70 a troy ounce,
compared with $425 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $429.50 vs.
$426, and in Hong Kong gold closed at $433.80 vs. $430.19.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
rose 50 cents a troy ounce to $431.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to $6.29 a troy ounce,
compared with $6.14 Monday. On the New York Comex, silver for
current delivery fell 1.7 cents an ounce to $6.222.

<HEAD>Says It Might Sweeten Cash Portion of Anti-Takeover
Recapitalization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc., target of a hostile
$2.12 billion takeover attempt by Black & Decker Corp., said
Tuesday it was taking steps to sweeten the cash portion of a
recapitalization designed to foil the bid.
   The company said it had begun talks with unidentified third
parties regarding the possible sale of debt securities as a means
of increasing the cash part of the recapitalization, which would
pay shareholders $1.9 billion plus give them a stake in the
recapitalized company.
   A recapitalization, in which a company restructures its amount
of debt and equity, is used often to thwart unwelcome takeovers.
The strategy usually plunges a company into debt, making it less
attractive as an acquisition.
   Under the American Standard recapitalization plan, which would
raise the company's long-term debt from $412 million to $2.3
billion, stockholders would receive $59 in cash, $5 worth of
high-yielding debt securities and one new share of stock in the
recapitalized company for each share of old stock.
   The company's announcement Tuesday did not elaborate on how much
it intended to raise the cash portion of the recapitalization but
said there was no assurance that any change would be made in the
existing proposal.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, American Standard
stock rose 12{ cents a share to $68.62{. Black and Decker stock
rose 62{ cents a share to $19.12{.
   Black & Decker, a tool and appliance maker based in Towson, Md.,
has been attempting since late January to acquire American
Standard, a New York-based maker of plumbing, air conditioning and
auto equipment.

   The stock market slipped off its post-crash peak
Tuesday but showed enough spunk to hold most of its recent gains.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks bounced off its
lows late in the day, closing down 1.16 points, or a scant 0.06
percent, at 2,070.46.
   With an hour to go, the blue-chip average had been down more
than 13 points, but traders took the opportunity to buy stocks,
pushing the Dow near Monday's close of 2,071.62, its high-water
mark since the Oct. 19 collapse.
   Stocks declining in price outpaced gainers by 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 811 issues declining, 696 gaining and 457
unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 199.99 million shares, against 236.05
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index dipped
0.28 to 150.18.
   The market's lackluster numbers belied its resilience, some
analysts said. They noted that the market's previous post-crash
high, reached on Jan. 7, was followed the next day by a drop of
more than 140 points.
   The relative firmness of prices Tuesday suggested to some that
the market had finally found its sealegs.
   ``The market had every reason to go down and it didn't,'' said
Michael Metz, a technical analyst for Oppenheimer & Co.
   ``Traders are no longer afraid of a crash; they're afraid of
missing a buying opportunity,'' said Metz.
   Others were not so sure. Hugh Johson, chief investment officer
for First Albany Corp., characterized the market as ``almost
lifeless,'' adding that uncertainty about the economy was still a
drag on trading.
   A batch of government statistics released Tuesday failed to
satisfy the market's curiosity about the economy's health.
   The Commerce Department said its chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped a sharp 0.6 percent in January, but the December
reading for the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was revised
from a 0.2 percent drop to a 0.3 percent gain.
   The government also said construction spending tumbled 2.9
percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months. But as was
the case with the leading index, the drop followed a revised 0.4
percent increase in December.
   ``It was a little frustrating,'' said Johnson. ``We had hoped to
resolve some of the uncertainty (about the economy) and we didn't.''
   ``The only conclusion is ... we'll miss a recession (in 1988),
but not by much,'' he said.
   Aside from the economic data, issues swept up in the latest rash
of takeover deals dominated interest as they had Monday when the
Dow jumped more than 48 points.
   Among the most active stocks on the NYSE, Federated Department
Stores gained 1\ to a new high of 67} following R.H. Macy's offer
of $73.80 a share for about 80 percent of the company's outstanding
shares.
   J.P. Stevens, which received a revised buyout offer from a
management group and said other parties had expressed interest in
the company, jumped 6\ to 54{, also a new high.
   Other results were mixed. Sears, Roebuck was up { to 38\;
General Electric was down { to 45; Pillsbury rose \ to 37;
Bethlehem Steel rose ~ to 21]; Atlantic Richfield dropped ~ to 76;
and International Business Machines Corp. was down { to 117.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 230.18 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials dropped 0.62 to
308.81, and S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.60 to 267.22.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Prices Slip Amid USDA Auction Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices slipped substantially lower Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as the Agriculture Department launched a new
series of auctions aimed at reducing government stockpiles of
surplus wheat.
   On other markets, other grains and soybeans ended mostly lower;
energy futures retreated; most livestock and meat futures advanced;
precious metals were mixed; and stock-index futures were higher.

   The USDA's weekly auctions of suplus wheat, begun in November,
have gradually lost steam. So on Tuesday the agency launched a new
series of sales to be held three times a week.
   The agency has set targets of 10 million bushels for each of the
new auctions during the first two weeks, which creates the
potential for adding 30 million bushels a week to the open market.
   The old weekly auctions usually had targets of 25 million
bushels. Sales in recent weeks had fallen well short of that goal,
however, with less than 16 million bushels sold last Friday.
   Traders fear the new auctions, which divide the sales by regions
of the country, will be more successful and depress cash prices by
adding to available supplies of wheat, analysts said.
   ``The possibility of selling 10 milllion bushels the first time
out is probably going to be a little tough,'' said Jerry Gidel of
Chicago-based G.H. Miller & Co. ``But it's the fact that they're
coming right back tomorrow, then on Friday again, that has the
market a little on edge.''
   However, analyst Jim Quinton of Agri-Visor Services Inc. in
Bloomington, Ill., said the new auctions probably would have little
long-term impact on futures prices.
   Quinton attributed Tuesday's wheat losses of up to 5 cents a
bushel to profit-taking by speculators.
   Results from Tuesday's auction will likely be released on
Wednesday.
   Wheat settled 4{ cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in March at $3.11 a bushel; corn was unchanged to } cent
lower with March at $2.03} a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent
higher with March at $1.94{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to
1{ cents higher with March at $6.35 a bushel.
   Energy futures prices, particularly for refined products, fell
sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where analysts said
bulls and bears have been waging a technical tug-of-war.
   ``This market seems to be moving briskly within a range, which
is what it probably will continue to do before it decides which way
it wants to go,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York for
Elders Futures Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded as much as .46 cent
lower, but settled .11 cent to .29 cent lower with April at $15.72
a barrel; heating oil was .82 cent to 1.15 cents lower with April
at 43.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .93 cent to 1.10
cents lower with April at 45.29 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures moved higher in mostly technical trading,
analysts said.
   Hog futures advanced on bargain buying after Monday's sharp
decline, said Tom Price, vice president of Linnco Futures Inc. in
Chicago.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .52 cent higher with April at
71.95 a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .85 cent higher with
March at 80.42 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .40 cent higher
with April at 43.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
unchanged to .42 cent lower with March at 51.60 cents a pound.
   Gold moved slightly higher while silver futures retreated a bit
on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold for April delivery sank to $425 a troy ounce during the
session, but rebounded to settle at $432.40.
   Richard Levine, vice president of Elders' precious metals
divison, noted that gold had touched $425 on Monday as well, and
predicted it would bounce off that level once more before falling
to $400 a troy ounce in the next three or four weeks.
   Silver drifted lower in featureless trading, he said.
   Gold settled 50 cents to 60 cents higher with April at $432.40 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.7 cents to 2 cents lower with March at
$6.222 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures inched higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index setttled .35 point higher at 267.65. The
underlying spot index was .59 point lower at 267.23.

<HEAD>Government Reports Paint Confusing Picture Of Economy's Health</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Government reports Tuesday painted a confusing picture about the
health of the economy and led to indecision in the financial
markets.
   The government said its chief barometer of future economic
activity fell again in January, although an upward revision in
December eased fears that the nation was headed for a recession.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1.16 points
to 2,070.46. It was equally quiet in the bond market, where the
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell a slim [ point. The dollar
was narrowly mixed.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
dropped 0.6 percent in January. Analysts discounted the sharp
decline and instead focused on a revision that changed the index's
showing in December from a 0.2 percent decline to a 0.3 percent
increase.
   The leading index has taken on added importance since last Oct.
19, when stock prices plunged a record 508 points, eclipsing the
1929 market crash that preceded the Great Depression.
   The upward revision for December broke a string of three
consecutive monthly declines, which has often in the past been the
signal of an impending recession. The index had fallen 0.1 percent
in October and 1.1 percent in November.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending
fell 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months,
reflecting widespread weakness in all sectors of the building
industry.
   Economists said the decline was bigger than expected and will
likely mean that construction will be a drag on overall economic
growth in the first quarter of 1988.
   ``What was surprising about the figures was how widespread and
pervasive the weakness was. Virtually every category from housing
to industrial to hotels and motels did poorly in January,'' said
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co.
   Economists said the December revision in the leading index and
other positive signs provided evidence that the country is
suffering few adverse effects from the market turmoil.
   Sinai said it showed that ``this is a no-recession year for the
U.S. economy.''
   Since it was created in 1948, the leading index has fallen three
or more months during an expansion on 12 different occasions. On
eight of those instances, a recession did follow. But four times
the index gave a false signal of a downturn and the recovery kept
going, although at a slower pace.
   Analysts said the index is indeed sending a signal of slower
growth for the first half of 1988, but they predicted that rising
export sales would be enough to offset expected weakness in
consumer spending and construction.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, raced
ahead at a 4.5 percent rate in the final three months of 1987, but
the bulk of that increase came from a buildup of unsold products.
Economists predict that production cutbacks will slash growth to a
rate of 1 percent or less in the first three months of the year.
   For 1988 as a whole, many economists are forecasting growth of
around 2 percent, just about half the 3.9 percent GNP increase
registered last year.
   Analysts said various business barometers have eased their fears
of an end to the current recovery.
   ``Industrial production and export sales are still rising,
orders and employment continue to grow and the stock market is
regaining its balance,'' said Richard Rahn, chief economist for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Absent any policy blunders by Congress
or the Federal Reserve, I anticipate a strong second half.''

   The government said Tuesday that its chief
barometer of future economic activity fell again in January, but an
upward revision in December eased fears that the nation was headed
for a recession.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
dropped 0.6 percent in January. Analysts discounted the sharp
decline and instead focused on a revision that changed the index's
showing in December from a 0.2 percent decline to a 0.3 percent
increase.
   The upward revision for December broke a string of three
consecutive monthly declines, which has often in the past been the
signal of an impending recession. The index had fallen 0.1 percent
in October and 1.1 percent in November.
   The leading index has taken on added importance since last Oct.
19, when stock prices plunged a record 508 points, eclipsing the
1929 market crash that preceded the Great Depression.
   Economists said the December revision in the leading index and
other positive signs provided evidence that the country is
suffering few adverse effects from the market turmoil.
   ``The leading index shows that this is a no-recession year for
the U.S. economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the
Boston Co. ``The magic string of three or more declines which has
often suggested a recession was broken.''
   Since it was created in 1948, the leading index has fallen three
or more months during an expansion on 12 different occasions. On
eight of those instances, a recession did follow. But four times
the index gave a false signal of a downturn and the recovery kept
going, although at a slower pace.
   Analysts said the index is indeed sending a signal of slower
growth for the first half of 1988, but they predicted that rising
export sales would be enough to offset expected weakness in
consumer spending and construction.
   The stock market, which closed Monday at its highest level since
the Oct. 19 collapse, edged down a bit Wednesday, with the Dow
Jones industrial average dipping 1.16 points to 2,070.46. Analysts
said the signal from the leading index that the country would
escape a recession this year was not forceful enough to prompt
another wave of buying.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said he
believed the three declines in the leading index in the past four
months was accurately signaling slower but continued growth in the
economy.
   ``The good news is that there is no series of three running''
declines, which could mean a recession, he said in answer to
questions. He noted that the administration's own economic forecast
calls for slower growth this year.
   In one indication that the economy has slowed, the Commerce
Department said in a second report Tuesday that construction
spending fell a steep 2.9 percent in January to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $395.2 billion. It was the biggest drop in
10 months and reflected widespread weakness in all categories of
construction.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, raced
ahead at a 4.5 percent rate in the final three months of 1987, but
the bulk of that increase came from a buildup of unsold products.
Economists predict that production cutbacks will slash growth to a
rate of 1 percent or less in the first three months of the year.
   For 1988 as a whole, many economists are forecasting growth of
around 2 percent, just about half the 3.9 percent GNP increase
registered last year.
   But where half of the country's business economists in November
were predicting a recession in 1988, that figure has now declined
to 25 percent, according to the latest survey of the National
Association of Business Economists.
   Analysts said various business barometers have eased their fears
of an end to the current recovery.
   ``Industrial production and export sales are still rising,
orders and employment continue to grow and the stock market is
regaining its balance,'' said Richard Rahn, chief economist for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Absent any policy blunders by Congress
or the Federal Reserve, I anticipate a strong second half.''
   Three-fourths of the decline in the January leading index came
from a big jump in new claims for unemployment benefits, which
averaged 351,000 a week in January, an increase of 39,000 weekly
claims from December. Since January, however, weekly unemployment
claims have been falling, further easing recession fears.
   In all, five of the nine available indicators showed weakness
during January. After unemployment claims, the biggest negative
factors were a drop in building permits, a decline in
manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, changes in raw materials
prices and changes in business delivery times.
   Four indicators showed strength during the month, with a rise in
stock prices making the biggest gain. Other positive forces were
the growth of the money supply, increases in the length of the
average workweek and a rise in orders for plant and equipment.
   The various changes left the index at 190.2 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   Many analysts predicted that the January decline in the leading
index would be followed by significant advance in the leading index
for February, based on already known information about the economy.

   Ford Motor Co. said it reached separate
agreements early Tuesday with bargainers representing workers at
two plants in Mexico, including one idled since Feb. 8 by a strike.
   Two-year agreements were reached with the Council of Automotive
Workers of Ford Motor Co., representing about 1,000 hourly
employees at the Chihuahua Engine Plant and another 1,100 at the
Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly Plant, Ford said in a statement.
   Chihuahua workers went on strike Feb. 8, eight days after their
previous two-year contract was extended, the statement said.
Production of 2.3-liter, four-cylinder engines for the domestic
market and export to the United States and Canada was to resume
Wednesday, it said.
   The Hermosillo workers' contract expired at midnight Monday. But
Ford did not indicate whether production of two- and four-door
Mercury Tracers for export to the U.S. and Tracer station wagons
for export to the U.S. and Canada was interrupted.

<HEAD>Pillsbury CEO Says Company Plans To Keep Burger King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William H. Spoor, returning as chief
executive officer of the Pillsbury Co., said Tuesday the company
has no intention of selling its Burger King subsidiary despite the
chain's flat performance in recent months.
   Spoor, named Monday to replace John M. Stafford as Pillsbury's
chairman and chief executive officer, also announced several
management changes at the Minneapolis-based parent company.
   On Wall Street, Pillsbury stock rose 25 cents a share to $37 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Burger King, which generates 40 percent of Pillsbury's sales,
reportedly has seen its share of the hamburger chain market fall in
recent months after rapid growth in the mid-1980s.
   Burger King's share fell to about 16.8 percent in early 1987
from a 1986 high of 17.4 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported
in December.
   The company has said its average sales per store have been flat
at about $1 million for the past two years.
   ``I want to say without qualification that Burger King is
central to Pillsbury,'' Spoor said in a statement at the conclusion
of a two-day meeting of Pillsbury's board of directors.
   ``That was true yesterday, it is true today, and it remains true
for the company's strategic future,'' he said.
   Spoor's statement made no mention of Pillsbury's other
restaurant businesses _ Steak & Ale, Godfather's and Bennigan's _
and a spokesman said neither he nor Stafford was available for
comment Tuesday afternoon.
   Spoor had retired from Pillsbury in 1985, but remained on the
company's board of directors. His return as CEO was announced
Monday in a statement that gave no reasons for Stafford's
resignation.
   ``I pledge to take whatever steps are necessary in the next
three months so that we will enter fiscal 1989 with momentum and a
solid portfolio of businesses capable of returning superior
shareholder value,'' Spoor said in his statement.
   ``We have a clear strategy that will lead us successfully into
the 1990s. fiscal 1988 is a disappointment in many ways, but our
future is bright and fiscal 1989, which begins June 1, will be an
excellent year and gratifying to our shareholders.''
   Pillsbury in fiscal 1987 reported its first earnings decline in
16 years: $182 million, or $2.10 a share, down from $208 million,
or $2.38 a share, in fiscal 1986.
   Stock analysts who were projecting fiscal 1988 earnings of about
$2.80 a share were told by Stafford in February to lower the
projections by about 30 cents a share, a Pillsbury spokesman said.
   Spoor on Tuesday announced four promotions in the top management
of the company:
   _John L. Morrison, was elected a Pillsbury executive vice
president and was named chairman, U.S. Foods. He was formerly a
Pillsbury vice president and president, International Foods.
   _Thomas R. McBurney, executive vice president, was named
chairman, International Foods. McBurney served previously as
chairman, U.S. Foods.
   _Jerry W. Levin, executive vice president, corporate development
and chairman of The Haagen-Dazs Co., was given the additional
responsibility for Pillsbury's Industrial Foods Business.
Industrial Foods was previously a part of U.S. Foods.
   _James R. Behnke, senior vice president for technology, was made
responsible for Pillsbury's research and development activities
worldwide.

<TEXT>
   A walkout by 9,000 movie and television
script writers seemed likely Tuesday as last-ditch contract talks
ended with major issues unresolved and the union saying the
producers' last offer appeared designed ``to force a strike.''
   Negotiators for the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers met for just two hours
before calling it quits Tuesday afternoon.
   The brief meeting followed a marathon, 21-hour session that
lasted until 7:15 a.m. Tuesday and made progress on ``25 to 30
lesser issues,'' said Herb Steinberg, spokesman for the producers.
   But the two sides remained far apart on the three major
stumbling blocks _ a ``creative rights'' issue that would give
original writers more control over the product, higher residual
payments when programs are distributed in foreign markets, and a
revision of residuals for domestic syndication in the stagnant
market for one-hour programs.
   Both Steinberg and union spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden confirmed
there was no significant movement on those issues in the afternoon
session.
   ``It (the producers' final offer) appears to be a
company-generated package designed to force a strike,'' Ms. Rhoden
said.
   She said the union will study the proposal but declined to say
if union leaders would recommend that it be rejected until it is
presented to members.
   The union's 6,500 West Coast members were to vote Tuesday night
on the latest proposal from management, while the 2,500 East Coast
members are to vote Wednesday afternoon.
   Results from both votes are to be released Wednesday evening,
and a strike could come as early as Thursday if the producers'
offer is rejected. The union's old contract expired at 12:01 a.m.
Tuesday.
   First to feel the impact of a walkout would be daily daytime TV
programs and talk shows that have a short lead time for scripts.
The effects on prime-time programs and feature films wouldn't be
visible unless a strike was protracted.
   For producers, the key issue has been obtaining relief on the
payment of residuals for syndication of one-hour television
programs. The market for such programs has dried up significantly,
producers say.
   They are asking the writers to adopt a revised residual plan
similar to one already approved by directors. Under that plan,
writers would 50 percent of the normal residuals if a program is
put out in only limited syndication. If it is later put out in full
national syndication, they get another 100 percent, making it
possible for them to receive 150 percent of their normal payments.
   On the creative-rights issue, the union is seeking to get
original writers the power to do the first rewrite of any material,
plus the right to be on the set when the program is produced.
   The producers say such issues must be negotiated individually.
   On foreign residuals, the union claims writers haven't had a
change in their payment schedule in 17 years. That schedule now is
based on a single lump sum payment and varies widely based on
individual negotiations.
   The entertainment arm of the writers' union, which has a
reputation as one of Hollywood's most militant, last went on strike
three years ago. That walkout lasted for two weeks before writers
voted to accept essentially the same terms they had rejected
earlier.
   The median annual income for writers is $40,000, but about half
of the WGA's members are unemployed at any given time, the union
says.

<HEAD>Affiliated Reports Fourth Quarter Net Loss; Annual Profit Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Affiliated Publications Inc., owner of the Boston
Globe, said Tuesday it had a net loss in its fourth quarter, partly
due to its equity share of the loss suffered by its McCaw
Communications Cos. affiliate.
   Affiliated posted a net loss of $3.62 million in the quarter
ended Dec. 27, compared with a profit of $40.1 million, or $1.14
per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue during the quarter rose to $135.6 million from $110.3
million a year earlier.
   Affiliated said its equity share of McCaw's losses from
continuing operations during the quarter was $19.2 million.
Affiliated said the operating loss stemmed from expansion of
McCaw's McCaw Cellular Communications subsidiary and accounting
changes relating to the unit.
   For the year, Affiliated posted a profit of $201.1 million, or
$5.73 per share, compared with $66.1 million, or $1.85 per share, a
yer earlier. Revenue rose to $490.1 million from $401.1 million in
1986.
   Gains from the sale of discontinued operations and results from
discontinued operations in 1987 came to $40 million against $26.3
million in 1986. Earnings for 1987 included equity in an
extraordinary $17.9 million credit from McCaw Communications.
   McCaw, based in Kirkland, Wash., is the parent of McCaw Cellular
Communications, the country's largest operator of cellular
telephone systems.
   In addition to a major interest in McCaw, Affiliated owns Globe
Newspaper Co., publisher of the Globe; Billboard Publications Inc.,
and The Globe Pequot Press Inc.

   Gov. Bob Martinez joined a court action
to block Texas from banning fresh Florida citrus on Tuesday, the
same day a federal judge in Texas overturned the ban.
   The ban was imposed last month after the U.S. Department of
Agriculture lifted a 3{-year-old federal quarantine on Florida
citrus that was prompted by outbreaks of citrus canker in Florida.
   U.S. District Judge James Nowlin said Tuesday in Austin, Texas
that he lifted the state ban because federal rules allowing the
shipments took precedence over the state rule.
   Martinez had notified Texas Gov. William P. Clements that he was
joining a court petition to be filed by Florida Agriculture
Commissioner Doyle Conner supporting a court action brought by
Florida citrus growers.
   Texas officials had refused to allow Florida citrus into their
state despite the lifting of the federal quarantine on shipments of
Florida fruit to other citrus-producing states. Florida producers
must take a number of actions to ensure their fruit does not
introduce citrus canker into other states.

<HEAD>Traders' Group Demands Slower Korean Currency Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>

   A major foreign trade group asked the
government Wednesday to slow the South Korean currency's
appreciation against the U.S. dollar.
   In a report to the government, the Korea Foreign Trade
Association said the recent sharp rise of the won against the
dollar could lead to a series of collapses among exporting firms.
   A stronger won _ and conversely, a weaker dollar _ raises the
costs of Korean products in the United States, a major export
market.
   The United States has been pressuring South Korea to revalue its
currency at a faster pace to help reduce the nation's growing U.S.
trade surplus, which soared to $9.5 billion last year.
   The association said if the won's value rises 10 percent against
the dollar, the average export profitability of South Korean-made
products would fall by 3.7 percent.
   The won has appreciated by 4.13 percent against the dollar so
far this year, accounting for about half the range registered for
all of 1987. As of Wednesday, the won was quoted at 760.90 to the
dollar, down 31.30 won from year-end 1987.
   If the won continues rising at that pace, its appreciation rate
for all of this year could surpass 24 percent, the association said.
