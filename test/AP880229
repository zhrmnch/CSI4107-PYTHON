<HEAD>Diplomat's Son Returned to Zimbabwe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 9-year-old son of a Zimbabwean diplomat
who had been accused of abusing the boy has been returned to his
native land, according to a published report.
   U.S. officials said Terence Karamba left New York for Zimbabwe
on Sunday, accompanied by a Zimbabwean social worker, but was not
to be returned to his father's custody, The Washington Post
reported in Tuesday's editions.
   The boy was to be placed in foster care under the auspices of
the courts and the Zimbabwean Ministry of Social Welfare, said
Robert J. McMahon, director of the social services agency that had
cared for the boy for the past two months.
   McMahon, executive director of St. Christopher-Ottile Services
for Children and Families, said the Karamba family would undergo
counseling in hopes of eventually being reunited with Terence.
   ``With any of these cases, there's always a lump at the bottom
of your stomach, but I think the level of risk is as low as you can
possibly get it,'' McMahon told the newspaper.
   A city agency had charged that the boy's father, Floyd, had
beaten the boy and the child in December was removed from his home
and placed in foster care.
   The father, who served for more than a year as a member of
Zimbabwe's delegation to the United Nations, was ordered to leave
the United States because of what State Department officials called
``clear evidence of child abuse.''
   In January, the Supreme Court refused to block the U.S.
government from sending the boy home after the Legal Aid Society's
Juvenile Rights Division had argued that the boy was afraid to go
home.
   McMahon said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., interceded
and persuaded the State Department that the boy should not be
returned immediately.
   ``We received what we asked for, which was time to work with the
boy, said Gary Kipling, a St. Christopher-Ottilie official who
served as Terence's foster father part of the time.
   The State Department had a psychiatric consultant accompany the
boy on his trip home and also engaged a law firm in Zimbabwe to
monitor his case, the Post reported.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat met Monday with
five Western diplomats and delivered messages about the ``dangers''
of the U.S. plan for a Middle East peace settlement, the
Palestinian WAFA news agency reported.
   It said Arafat met with the ambassadors of France, Britain,
Greece, Spain and Turkey in Tunis, the headquarters of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   WAFA said Arafat asked the diplomats to transmit to their
nations his concern about ``the dangers to the Palestinian people
of the new American demarche.''
   A two-day summit conference of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization is to open Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, with
President Reagan among the leaders scheduled to attend.
   According to WAFA, Arafat's messages said the U.S. plan proposed
by Secretary of State George Shultz on his Mideast tour ``ignores
the national rights of the Palestinian people, notably their right
to self-determination and the creation of an independent state on
their own territory under the PLO, the sole, legitimate
representative.''
   Shultz has called for a Palestinian role in negotiations, but
not participation by the PLO.

   Prince Andrew and his pregnant wife, Sarah,
lingered over a museum incubator but declined to cuddle the kicking
mechanical infant inside Monday, the fourth day of a 10-day trade
trip by the royal entourage.
   The couple awoke aboard the 416-foot royal yacht Britannia
beneath typically British gray skies with rain stalking their
motorcade to a museum, department store and a supermarket sojourn
described as a first royal visit to an American supermarket.
   It was retail day for the Duke and Duchess of York.
   The day began with Andrew welcoming top U.S executives for an
investment seminar on the royal yacht, aimed at attracting American
money to Britain. The couple then went ashore.
   The incubator was the final stop on the royal couple's walk
through the Los Angeles County Museum of Science and Industry,
which also included a tour of an exhibit on British technology.
Despite repeated entreaties from a British photographer, Sarah
wouldn't pick up the kicking pink babe, dubbed Samantha by the
exhibitors.
   ``Can you believe them?'' she asked her guides, laughing at the
jostling crowd of newsmen kept in check by a chain barrier and U.S.
State Department security guards. The duchess is expecting a child
in August.
   At the Vons Pavilions market, a deluxe, high-tech supermarket in
suburban Arcadia, the duchess tasted coffee-toffee-chip ice cream
and turned up her nose at a corn dog, and both she and the prince
tried their hand at cake decorating as they cruised the aisles.
   Earlier, Andrew told U.S. executives that Anglo-American
business bonds are as important as historical and cultural ties.
   Britain wants American investments, the Duke of York said during
a brief appearance before 80 delegates attending a daylong
investment seminar aboard the royal yacht Britannia, which included
a five-hour luncheon cruise.
   Greetings from Queen Elizabeth II were relayed by Sir Paul
Greening, chairman of the royal household.
   ``The queen says she hopes you have a worthwhile day. The queen
has personally chosen what you'll have for lunch today,'' said
Greening, who didn't divulge the menu.
   ``The economic ties between our two nations are no less
important than our cultural ones,'' Andrew said.
   There were delegates from such companies as Hewlett-Packard,
Hughes Aircraft, Ford Motor Co., Apple Computers and Lockheed
Aircraft. Among them was Henry Termeer of Boston-based Genzyme, a
biotechnology firm.
   ``It's definitely a public relations ploy to create good will. I
think it's an excellent idea. Every European country does this sort
of thing, but not every country has a royal family with a ship like
this,'' said Termeer.
   The day's events also included a visit to Bullocks Wilshire
department store, which was touting British goods.
   Celebrities Michael York, Morgan Fairchild and Roddy McDowell
and hundreds of store employees were among those who greeted the
royal couple's arrival at the posh art deco landmark.
   At one point during the tour, the duchess scanned the first
floor vestibule and was asked by a guest if she was looking for her
husband, who had gone ahead. ``No, I see him every day,'' Sarah
replied.
   Monday evening, the royal couple took a moonlit stroll through
the lush Wetherly Gardens at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.
   The cocktail party was tossed by British Consul General Donald
Ballentyne, and guests who noshed on hors d'oeuvres and sipped
champagne included ``Dynasty'' actress Emma Samms and actor Vincent
Price.

   When Cara Dunne listened to broadcasters narrate
the Olympic skiing events, she recalled the thrill of winning her
own medals last month at international games for the disabled.
   The 17-year-old Chicagoan was blinded by cancer as a baby. After
years of training, she won two silver medals in the 1988 Winter
Olympic Games for the Disabled in Innsbruck, Austria.
   Miss Dunne, a senior at William Howard Taft High School on the
Northwest Side, said she feels every bit an Olympian.
   ``In the opening ceremonies, when you march in with your
teammates, you feel so proud because you are representing your
country,'' she said.
   Miss Dunne said the Olympic coverage from Calgary reminded her
of her own triumphs and defeats.
   ``When people are falling, you can relate to them,'' said Miss
Dunne. She said she lost the gold in Austria because she slipped in
the second run of the giant slalom.
   ``Basically you work all your life for the goals you set. When
you are competing you feel an enormous amount of pressure,'' she
said.
   ``But when the race is over you feel this great spirit. I think
that is what the Olympics _ whether able-bodied or disabled _ is
all about.''
   Miss Dunne's parents started teaching her to ski when she was 7.
   ``When we got into skiing ... I looked at it as a chance for
Cara to prove to her friends and her schoolmates that she is just
as capable as they are,'' said her stepfather, Richard Zabelski.
   Zabelski, a lawyer, has been her guide, skiing in front of Miss
Dunne, yelling directions.
   ``Initially I was trying to get the attention of a new
step-child,'' he said. ``Now we are strictly training for success.''
   Prior to the latest competition, Miss Dunne and Zabelski trained
full time for about six weeks. He pays for most of the training
because disabled athletes are not sponsored by the government and
landing corporate sponsors is tough.
   Miss Dunne, the youngest member of the disabled Olympic ski
team, said she has won nine medals in international competition.
   She said she received an acceptance letter from Harvard
University last week, ``so I don't know how much time I'll have for
training.''
   But she is already looking forward to the 1992 games, when the
disabled and able-bodied Winter Olympics will be held
simultaneously in Albertville, France.

   A Roman Catholic high school wrestling
team is traveling to the Soviet Union this week to compete against
Soviet athletes in what school officials have dubbed an
``experiment in glasnost.''
   The Sacred Heart High School team is apparently the first Roman
Catholic group officially welcomed to the Soviet Union to compete,
said the Rev. Philip J. Cascia, the school's chaplain and wrestling
coach.
   ``The Soviets are very conscious of their image,'' he said.
``This could be a very positive statement from them that they are
willing to take steps toward more openness.''
   One team member is Gary Shvartsbeyn, a 16-year-old Soviet Jew
who immigrated to the United States in 1980. Shvartsbeyn says the
trip will be a chance for him to avoid the severe travel
restrictions he faced when he lived in the Soviet Union.
   ``I'd just like to see something in Russia I never saw before,''
said Shvartsbeyn, a native of the village of Donetzk in the Ukraine.
   The 30 wrestlers are set to leave Wednesday. The team, which had
a disappointing 2-22 record this season, has scheduled three
matches with Soviet wrestling clubs _ one at the Olympic Village in
Moscow and two at the Sports Complex in Leningrad.
   Also making the trip are 20 honor students from Sacred Heart
along with 37 coaches, teachers and parents who will act as
chaperones.
   Cascia said he wants to make sure the energetic teen-agers are
on their best behavior, because they will be acting as goodwill
ambassadors not only for the United States but for the Roman
Catholic Church as well.
   Cascia hatched the idea for the trip seven months ago. Formal
approval came from the Soviet government the day that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev headed home after his summit meeting with President
Reagan in December.
   Cascia thinks the timing was evidence that the school's trip is
another ``experiment in glasnost,'' the Soviet leader's much-touted
policy of openness.
   ``The fact that they've given us the Olympic Village, which is
their showpiece ... indicated right away they are going to give us
a lot of attention,'' he said.
   The students are paying just $200 apiece, with the rest being
financed by a $25,000 grant from the U.S. government, $5,000 from
the Waterbury tourism council, and the sale of T-shirts bearing the
message in English and Russian that ``Glasnost Is Real.''
   The Soviet government is donating $5,000 in services, the school
said.

   The CIA and the Agriculture Department have
teamed up to report that the cabbage is king in the Soviet Union,
while Americans bow to the tomato.
   The study of food supplies in the United States and the Soviet
Union says that radish and carrot tops are common fare among Soviet
consumers but are rarely found on American grocery lists. But then,
the United States has the sweet potato while the Soviet Union
doesn't.
   On the other hand, the overall nutrient levels in the two
nations are not too far apart. On the average, the Soviet Union
supplies about 3,200 calories per day to each citizen, compared
with 3,500 for the average American.
   Protein availability, at an average of 100 grams per day, is a
tossup. But Americans have more fat and cholesterol in their food
supply, while Soviet people get more carbohydrates.
   The study was conducted jointly by the CIA and the Agriculture
Department's Human Nutrition Information Service. The report by CIA
and HNIS analysts was published in the latest National Food Review,
a quarterly magazine of the department's Economic Research Service.
   A 16-year period, 1965 to 1981, was used in the study.
Information about Soviet per capita food use was supplied by the
CIA's Office of Soviet Analysis from ``various published and
unpublished sources,'' the report said. The USDA agency drew on
extensive food statistics kept on Americans.
   The report cautioned that the food use statistics for both
countries were derived mathematically from production, exports,
imports, year-end inventories and other annual figures.
   But within those limitations, analysts said the study ``reveals
some interesting differences and similarities'' between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   ``For instance, sources of food energy differed,'' the report
said. ``Carbohydrate provided most of the energy in the Soviet food
supply, while carbohydrate and fat provided almost equal
proportions in the U.S. supply. Protein provided the same
proportion in both countries.''
   ``Among the Soviet vegetables, cabbage ranked number one,'' the
report said. ``Soviet use reached 66 pounds per capita in 1981,
compared with 55 pounds 16 years earlier. U.S. use stayed at about
10 or 12 pounds.''
   Cabbages accounted for 34 percent of all vegetables used in the
Soviet Union in 1981, while providing only 6 percent of the U.S.
vegetable menu.
   Tomatoes led the U.S. list, accounting for 24 percent of all
vegetables, while ranking second in the Soviet Union at 28 percent.
Carrots and beets were next among Soviet vegetables, while lettuce
was second in the United States, followed by cucumbers.
   The per capita use of foods in nine major categories increased
between 1965 and 1981 in the Soviet Union. Those included poultry,
eggs, fruit, fish, vegetable fats, dairy products, vegetables,
sugars and sweeteners, and meat.
   At the same time, the United States gained in the use of meat,
poultry, vegetable fats, and sugars and sweeteners, the report
said. Potato and grain use declined in the Soviet Union, while the
use of animal fats, eggs, dairy products and potatoes dropped in
the United States.
   One of the reasons behind huge Soviet grain imports of recent
years is a drive by Moscow to increase the production of livestock
and poultry to help upgrade the diets of Soviet consumers. The
report shows how the situation has changed.
   In 1965, the Soviet Union's per capita use of dairy products was
244 pounds, compared with 453 pounds in the United States. By 1981,
Soviet use rose to 347 pounds, while the U.S. average dropped to
405 pounds.
   Meat use by the Soviets in 1965 was 78 pounds per capita against
the U.S. average of 146 pounds. In 1981, the averages,
respectively, were 98 and 154 pounds.
   The Soviet per capita use of potatoes in 1965 was reported at
313 pounds, compared with 86 pounds in the United States. In 1981,
potato use had dropped to 232 and 78 pounds, respectively.
   ``Although Soviet use of grain products declined from 343 pounds
per capita in 1965 to 304 pounds in 1981, it was still
approximately twice as much as in the United States (145 pounds in
1965 and 151 pounds in 1981),'' the report said.
   ``Wheat accounted for the largest share in both countries, but
rye, rice, barley, corn, buckwheat and oats were also used.''
   Grain products in the Soviet Union were primarily in the form of
whole grains and groats, or coarsely ground, hulled grain, the
report said. White flour was the major grain product used in the
United States.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Simon's Skip-the-South Strategy Defies Arithmetic</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN WOLMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may be the most implausible gambit of the
year, or the most naive, or just the dumbest _ but there isn't any
doubt that Paul Simon's decision to skip the South on Super Tuesday
turns 1988 political theology on its head.
   ``We urged him to take a Midwestern industrial strategy,'' said
Illinois Democratic Chairman Vince Demuzio, perhaps with a straight
face.
   The accepted dogma is that no Democrat in this lifetime will
grace the White House without winning a fair share of states in the
South.
   It's simple arithmetic. The Republicans have had a lock on the
West; they've done whatever it takes to win California and they've
added support from the farm belt and the upper reaches of New
England.
   Democrats _ who won ``Hubert Humphreyland'' in 1984, but little
else _ generally can rely on some industrial states, the islands of
Hawaii and the four corners of the District of Columbia.
   Of course that doesn't add up to a Democratic victory in the
Electoral College and during a 20-year stretch, the Republicans
have lost the White House just once, to Georgia's Jimmy Carter.
   And so party leaders agree the Democrats must work the South;
the need for a Southern strategy was an underlying rationale for
creating next week's Super Tuesday primaries and is one explanation
for the tremendous effort being poured into the region this week by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson, Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee.
   But not Paul Simon.
   Simon is the senator from Illinois whose campaign is
floundering, to be polite. After a second-place finish in Iowa,
third-place finishes in New Hampshire and Minnesota and a complete
collapse in South Dakota, he is out of money and out of the running.
   The book of campaign etiquette says this is where Simon thanks
his staff, thanks his supporters and gets out of the race _ perhaps
throwing his endorsement to a candidate who shares his values.
Maybe Dukakis, or maybe a dramatic, home-state boost for Jackson.
   Yes, that's the way it's generally done.
   Simon embraced the etiquette just after New Hampshire.
   ``If I don't win either Minnesota or South Dakota, I'm going to
drop out of the race,'' he said. ``I don't want to just continue
indefinitely running second or third.''
   He expressed high hopes for victory, declaring, ``The place
where my natural roots are is right here in Hubert Humphreyland.''
   The logic was unassailable but his resolve didn't last.
   Before 24 hours, Simon was hedging ``because of the reaction
we've been getting from around the country.'' (Whose reaction was
he talking about? Certainly not the reaction of the voters in
Hubert Humphreyland; he finished just behind uncommitted, just
behind Jackson and way behind Dukakis.)
   And so Simon announced that he's going to skip the South and
pick up in Illinois on March 15, in Michigan on March 26, and so
on. He says the Southern vote will be ``scattered'' and that,
``We're not going to have a first-ballot nominee. We're going to
have a very open convention.''
   Fair enough. But will the convention turn to Paul Simon?
   The dogma of 1988 says the last thing the Democrats will do is
nominate a candidate who bypassed the South. He could put Minnie
Pearl on his ticket and it wouldn't keep the Republicans from
rubbing their hands together in excitement.
   Not that Simon is talking about a Southerner for his ticket. No,
he's got a ``Midwestern industrial strategy.'' In Michigan the
other day he said he'd want to consider Lee Iacocca as a running
mate.
   It's possible that Simon, blinded by presidential ambition,
simply does not see this strategy as futile. But Simon didn't enter
the race until failing to draft Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, so
blind ambition doesn't ring true. And naive, or stupid, he is not.
   Instead, this skip-the-South gambit is probably a reluctant
deference to local pols who want to ride his home-state coattails
into Atlanta.
   ``There are people in Illinois who want to go to the convention
and who are Simon delegates,'' Simon said last week.
   That's all well and good for them, but Simon himself stands to
become a quintessential spoiler, draining votes from compatible
liberal candidates without a prayer of winning himself. In return,
he might hope to amass the kind of good will in Illinois Democratic
clubrooms that provides an uncontested primary for re-election in
1990.

   If lawyer E. Robert Wallach had stayed with
his original plan, Attorney General Edwin Meese III's files would
never have contained a 1985 memo outlining a plan to pay the
Israeli Labor Party to ensure the safety of a proposed $1 billion
Iraqi oil pipeline.
   The memo to Meese is part of a three-document package that
Wallach gave to the attorney general on the same day in September
1985 in an attempt to revive the project, which was foundering over
Iraq's demand for an insurance package against Israeli bombing.
   The documents, now part of special prosecutor James McKay's
criminal investigation into Meese's activities, were released last
week by the attorney general's lawyers. In addition, three telex
messages from Wallach to a Swiss oilman who was a partner in the
pipeline project surfaced last week and showed that Wallach and
other project backers attempted to have Pentagon budget money paid
to the Israelis not to bomb the pipeline.
   The pipeline memos also have drawn the attention of Iran-Contra
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh because they draw the first link
between the pipeline project and the trade of arms for hostages.
   The burgeoning paper trail in the Meese-pipeline episode
includes a Sept. 19, 1985 handwritten letter from then-Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres expressing support for the proposed
pipeline.
   But McKay, who is investigating Meese's role in the pipeline
project, is focusing on two memos, both dated Sept. 25, 1985, from
Wallach to Meese. The Peres letter was attached to the first memo,
a four-page explanation of the problems surrounding the project. In
it, Wallach urged Meese to help round up support from top U.S.
officials.
   One problem, Wallach wrote, was that seeking the insurance
package required disclosing to a number of bankers and others the
nature of the ``security package'' guaranteeing that Israel
wouldn't destroy the line.
   Wallach said this package involved the ``never-to-be-stated but
fully understood quid pro quo.''
   Meese's lawyers say the quid pro quo was a reference to plans by
Wallach's client, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, to make available
to Israel substantial amounts of oil from the pipeline. Discounts
on the oil were to amount to $650 million to $700 million over 10
years.
   However, government sources familiar with the investigation of
Meese say McKay is trying to determine whether the ``quid pro quo''
memo is related to the second memo that Wallach handed over to
Meese at the same time.
   The second memo, marked ``personal & confidential _ for your
eyes, only,'' contains a paragraph which says that Rappaport
confirmed with Peres the ``arrangement'' in which Israel was to
receive up to $700 million over 10 years from the pipeline. The
next sentence says: ``What was also indicated to me, and which
would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will
go directly to Labor.''
   McKay wants to know whether the money for the Israeli Labor
Party headed by Peres is the ``quid pro quo'' mentioned in the
first memo.
   If it is, the two memos suggest that Meese may have known about
a plan to bribe Israeli politicians as a way to assure the safety
of the planned pipeline. If Meese knew about such a proposed
payoff, he might be charged with violating or conspiring to violate
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law bars bribes to foreign
officials and gives the attorney general authority to file civil
suits to stop U.S. companies from bribing potential foreign
customers.
   In the ``quid pro quo'' memo, Wallach was trying to explain to
Meese the importance of Rappaport to the pipeline project. To
demonstrate the ``credibility and relationship'' of Rappaport to
Israel, Wallach, a longtime friend of the attorney general, also
said that he was ``preparing ... a memorandum for my own files'' on
other matters Wallach said he had discussed with the Swiss oilman.
   ``I will communicate orally the contents of that memorandum,''
Wallach said.
   But he changed his mind _ for reasons as yet undisclosed.
   Instead of giving Meese a verbal summary of that memo, Wallach
gave the document to Meese, thus allowing the special prosecutor
and the public to see what Wallach said were Rappaport's thoughts
about money for the Israeli Labor Party.
   Was this a planned bribe?
   Peres, who is now Israel's foreign minister, denies receiving
any bribe offer; a Peres aide is quoted as saying the then-prime
minister was told Israel would get oil discounts but Peres didn't
take that seriously. Rappaport denies making any payoffs. And Meese
says he doesn't recall reading the portion of the second memo
mentioning Labor Party payments.

   Republican Jack Kemp, trying to breathe life into
his lagging presidential campaign, blasted George Bush and Bob Dole
as tax-raising twins in a Southern debate and said if either is
nominated, ``the Reagan revolution is over, gone, dead.''
   And Bush and Dole tangled repeatedly at a debate Sunday
afternoon on their differing calls for a budget freeze, on the
Iran-Contra affair and on protecting the South's textile industry
from foreign competition.
   The GOP debate may be the last confrontation of the four GOP
candidates before the big round of primaries across the South on
March 8, Super Tuesday.
   Bush forces, confident that the vice president commands the
field in Dixie, said after the debate that Bush had no plans to
attend the next scheduled debate, set Sunday in Nashville and
sponsored by the League of Women Voters. His move could scrap the
final GOP debate of the Southern campaign.
   ``We're simply at a point where we've got 20 states,'' Bush
campaign manager Lee Atwater said. ``We've got a pretty busy
schedule.''
   Only a week ago, the Bush forces expressed shock that Sen. Dole
of Kansas and the fourth contender, Pat Robertson, backed out of a
similar debate in Dallas.
   Rep. Kemp of New York, whose White House aspirations are on the
ropes after a series of poor showings in the earlier primaries and
caucuses, tried to depict himself as the true conservative in the
race and lumped Bush and Dole together as moderates who would raise
taxes and turn their backs on the legacy of President Reagan.
   ``Frankly under Bob Dole or George Bush you're going to get
exactly the same thing,'' Kemp said in the debate sponsored by the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspapers.
   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. And they have supported
together every single tax increase in the last eight years.
   ``If they're nominated, I want you folks to know, the Reagan
revolution is over, gone, dead,'' he said.
   Bush and Dole both objected, saying they have fought against tax
increases and for the Reagan administration's agenda for the past
seven years. They charged that Kemp wasn't willing to take steps to
solve the federal budget deficit, even as both said raising taxes
wasn't the way they would do it.
   ``Jack's never met a deficit he didn't like,'' Dole said.
   Bush told Kemp: ``You don't care about deficits. You never have,
and they're public enemy No. 1.''
   Dole raised the Iran-Contra subject and, holding a copy of a
report by a commission Bush headed that recommended no deals with
terrorists, charged that Bush had condoned selling weapons to Iran
in exchange for hostages.
   ``We should never trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issue
these reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ the
vice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and say
it's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said.
   Bush, who contends he did not know the arms were being exchanged
for hostages, said only that ``mistakes were made'' in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Asked later if the affair had occurred on ``his watch,'' Bush
replied: ``I think when the president found out what happened, he
took the proper steps.''
   Robertson, the former television preacher, offered a defense of
embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III, saying intense scrutiny
has made it difficult to attract people to government. Meese is
under investigation by an independent counsel.
   After spending the last two weeks explaning his own remarks _
that nuclear missiles are in Cuba, that Bush forces have engaged in
dirty tricks and that his Christian Broadcasting Network knew where
American hostages were held in Lebanon _ Robertson criticized the
press.
   ``I know it's very difficult dealing with the press of America
to get the truth out. They love to distort our words,'' Robertson
said.
   Kemp accused Dole and Robertson of changing positions to please
Southern voters with their support for legislation limiting textile
imports. The textile industry is particularly large in South
Carolina, which holds a key Southern test on Saturday, two days
before primaries across the rest of the South.
   He referred to Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a Democratic
candidate who has called for tough trade sanctions against unfair
trading partners, when he said after the debate, ``Pat Robertson
and Bob Dole sound like Dick Gephardt to me on trade.''
   Robertson said that foreign imports now make up a large portion
of the domestic textile market and asked, ``How much do you want to
give them, communist China and communist Russia?''
   Bush and Dole attacked each other's proposals for a federal
budget freeze as a way to deal with the deficit. Bush said his was
more flexible, and that Dole's plan would cut defense spending.
   Dole countered that Bush's plan was a ``four-year cop-out.''
   The confrontations of the two GOP leaders _ Bush and Dole _ so
dominated the first part of the gathering that Kemp protested,
``This is a four-man debate.''

   Actor Sean Penn says being married to a star like
Madonna is a strain, but that recent reports the couple was close
to divorce were created by the press.
   Penn discussed his marriage in a story published in Sunday's
Chicago Tribune, which said it was the first interview with
filmdom's bad boy since he was jailed for 32 days after striking a
movie extra.
   Penn, 27, vowed to ``refocus'' himself to avoid outbursts. He
said reports of his marital problems with Madonna, 29, stem from
her fans' possessiveness of her and their view of him as
less-than-ideal marriage material.
   ``She belonged to them, to the public,'' Penn said. ``And if
anybody took her, I think they thought it should have been someone
more acceptable, like Donald Trump.''
   Madonna filed divorce papers in Santa Monica, Calif., on Dec. 4,
citing irreconcilable differences. Two weeks later, she asked to
withdraw the petition and the court granted the request the same
day, court records show. No reason was given in the court papers
for her change of heart.
   But Penn said the divorce story ``was more People magazine than
reality. My attitude with the press right now is that I hope
they've had their share of me. They've been very busy trying to
find or make dirt. I'd like to get back to acting.''

   Betty Friedan, author of the women's
liberation classic ``The Feminine Mystique,'' says women working in
the media face ``the threat of a new feminine mystique to send them
home again.''
   ``There are patterns here. A pattern where disproportionately in
the restructuring of networks and movie studios, women are being
dislocated,'' Friedan said Sunday at Women, Men and Media, a
conference she chaired at the University of Southern California.
   Marlene Sanders, a former correspondent and news executive at
ABC, said the setbacks resulted from cutbacks caused by takeovers
and mergers of media corporations and reduced federal regulation of
broadcasting.
   Los Angeles Times television critic Howard Rosenberg told the
conference male media executives were less likely to take women
seriously in entertainment shows. He said a study found that men
were the central characters in 42 TV series and women in only 17,
and in dramas the ratio was 23 men to 3 women.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is paying about $203
million a year in irrigation subsidies in the West for crops that
also receive price supports or other farm subsidies, according to
the first estimate of the double subsidy ever made by the Bureau of
Reclamation.
   The bureau also calculated its total 1986 subsidy to farmers as
$534 million, about $54 an acre.
   The calculations have been given to Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., chairman of the water and power subcommittee of the House
Interior Committee, who conducted hearings on the double-subsidy
issue last May and October.
   Miller has been a skeptic of reclamation projects and has
sponsored legislation, opposed by the bureau, to make farmers
eventually pay the full cost of water used to irrigate crops that
get other subsidies.
   In a letter to Miller, Wayne Marchant, deputy assistant
secretary of interior for water and science, defended the
irrigation subsidies.
   ``The irrigation subsidy reported here is responsible for much
of the current character of the western United States,'' Marchant
said. ``Without the support for development of irrigation
established by Congress, much of the agricultural development in
the West, especially in California, would not have occurred.''
   He said the projects also have provided important electricity
and recreational benefits.
   But the bureau's own calculations also show that those benefits
have come at a substantial price.
   The bureau provides all or part of the irrigation of 9.9 million
acres on 150,300 farms in 17 states. Crops subsidized in the farm
program were grown on 5.7 million acres.
   Overall water revenues averaged only $19 million a year for
1983, 1984 and 1985, while irrigation subsidies just on the
subsidized crops were estimated at $203 million a year.
   Since the bureau was created in 1902 through 1986, the total
irrigation subsidy was estimated at $9.8 billion, calculated in
1986 dollars.
   Farmers are supposed to pay for construction, operation and
maintenance of the irrigation systems. But Congress often has
specified that construction repayments be made at zero interest or
a rate well below the Treasury rate _ what it costs the government
to borrow.
   Critics say the bureau has devised other subsidies as well,
persuading Congress to allocate a too-small share of a project's
cost to irrigation, and allowing farmers to postpone capital
repayments until a project is complete even though their part may
be delivering water.
   The bureau calculated the double subsidy indirectly. In the
previous 10 years, an average of 38 percent of the land irrigated
by the bureau was used to produce crops with farm subsidies, so the
bureau estimated the value of the irrigation subsidy as 38 percent
of its total 1986 subsidy of $534 million.
   The bureau said it could not answer three questions from Miller
_ how much the water might have been worth in alternate uses, how
much would have been collected if it had charged full cost, and how
much it would collect if it had to charge full cost in 1995.
   Miller's bill would apply as contracts came up for renewal, but
Marchant said the bureau thought it unfair to farmers who had
invested under a promise of subsidy.
   The effect of the bill ``may vary from area to area. The
Westlands Water District (in California's San Joaquin Valley) could
probably afford to pay full cost. But in our view a lot of farmers
could be driven out of business, with all the attendant social
costs,'' Marchant said.
   He said he was disappointed that Congress last year forbade a
change in administration policy that would require agriculture
subsidies to be disregarded when project costs and benefits are
calculated. ``This would have been the right thing to do,'' he
said. ``I do not think we should be piling one subsidy on top of
another.''
   Westlands is served by one of two projects for which Miller
requested subsidy costs, the Central Valley Project and the
Columbia Basin Project in Washington State. The bureau said Central
Valley got an annual subsidy of $135 million, $60 per acre, and
Columbia Basin got $54 million or $102 per acre.
   Annual subsidies for some uncompleted projects will be larger,
up to $719 per acre for the Garrison Diversion Project in North
Dakota, where 52 percent of the crops are in the farm program.
   ``These are outrageous subsidies,'' said Ed Osann, water
specialist for the National Wildlife Federation and longtime critic
of water projects.

   Third-graders in Mary Alice Blanton's
class look at each other knowingly these days whenever she takes an
unruly child out into the hall.
   ``They say Mrs. Blanton is going to give the kid the same thing
she gave that gunman who came into our school three weeks ago,''
said West End Christian School Headmaster Dan Carden. ``It's become
a sort of standing joke.''
   Carden was referring to the morning of Feb. 2, when Mrs.
Blanton, 57, whacked one of two intruders with a book of Bible
stories. The man she struck, James L. Harvey, fended off the blow
and went on to hold Mrs. Blanton and her pupils hostage for the
next 12 hours.
   Harvey, a 43-year-old Tuscaloosa native, was wrestled to the
ground after he was lured out by a phony pardon from Gov. Guy Hunt
and a false promise that he would be able to air his complaints
about poverty and homelessness at a news conference. He has
undergone psychiatric evaluation, authorities said. A preliminary
hearing on the kidnapping charges against him is set for Wednesday.
   Carden, whose two sons were in school during the takeover, said
his children and the other pupils seem to have survived the episode
in remarkable fashion.
   ``Everything is going very smoothly here,'' he said last week.
``I can honestly say I don't know of any serious repercussions
among our staff, students or their parents.''
   Allan Goodwin, a psychologist who helped out during and after
the hostage taking, which involved 80 of the Baptist school's 280
students, said he is amazed by the lack of psychological fallout.
   ``It's hard to believe but it's true that everything has
returned to normal at the school,'' said Goodwin, director of the
Indian Rivers Community Health Center here. ``I don't detect any
malice _ even the parents have been able to forgive and forget. I
think this may have something to do with the fatalism that goes
along with their fundamentalist faith, a feeling that such events
are out of our hands.''
   John Rhodes Jr., who accompanied Harvey during the school
invasion, apparently was duped by Harvey. All charges against
Rhodes, an unemployed laborer who first met Harvey only minutes
before they went to the school, were dropped.
   As for Harvey, Goodwin said, the children apparently viewed him
as a harmless blowhard.
   ``I think they see Harvey as someone who was strange, but not as
a menacing figure,'' Goodwin said. ``I don't think the children
inside the room with him ever picked up the degree of tension that
existed among the law enforcement officers and parents outside the
school.''
   Mrs. Blanton, who spent 12 hours as a hostage, said much the
same thing.
   ``After the first few minutes I don't think the children really
felt threatened,'' she said last week. ``Frankly, the biggest
adjustment problem we've had has been adjusting to the flu. It has
really been going around.''
   However, she said she did have the class write about the episode.
   ``A couple of the kids who were released early in return for
pizzas seemed a little indignant,'' she said. ``They thought they
were worth more than a pizza.''
   As for her own role, and her brief attempt to disarm Harvey with
her book, she said, ``I never thought about being a hero, I was
just acting on instinct. In retrospect, it was probably a pretty
dangerous thing to do.''
   Carden is still confused by one aspect of the case.
   ``I still don't know why Harvey picked our school,'' he said.
``I'll be interested to hear what he has to say about that at his
trial.''

   Wyoming this week becomes the first state
in the West to allocate presidential delegates, but the contest has
gotten relatively little attention in the rush to the Super Tuesday
states.
   Still, state officials and Wyoming political leaders are touting
their caucuses this Saturday as the kickoff contest in the region,
saying results in the state will help set the stage for larger
contests to come.
   ``We have a real potential to influence the process, especially
since we're the first Western state'' to assign delegates, said
Muffy Moore, state Democratic Party chairman.
   ``It's not our numbers that are important. It's our position on
the calendar,'' she added.
   The Wyoming caucuses are three days before Super Tuesday, March
8, when 20 states, mainly Southern and border states, will hold
caucuses and primaries.
   Wyoming's caucus process, according to Republican and Democratic
campaign directors, calls for little in the way of media
advertising. Instead, campaign staffers spend most of their days on
the phones to individuals who will attend the county conventions.
   ``You make the calls. You make the personal contacts. This is a
retail state,'' said Mickey Munley, a co-director for Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s Wyoming campaign. ``Down South, there are so
many people all the candidates are buying TV. ... In Wyoming, it's
more personal. People want a phone call.''
   State GOP chairman Mark Hughes said he expected the Republican
race to come down to Sen. Bob Dole and Vice President George Bush,
who have spent more time and effort in Wyoming than Rep. Jack Kemp
and Pat Robertson.
   ``My opinion is that Bush and Dole are far more organized and
have been in the state a much longer period of time,'' said Hughes.
   ``I don't believe Jack Kemp has campaigned extensively here and
don't think his campaign has been that strong here,'' he said,
adding that Robertson also has been weak in Wyoming.
   On the Democratic side, leaders are reluctant to make
predictions. .
   ``It's hard to tell how people are going to vote at this
point,'' Moore said late last week. ``I still think we have a very
large portion of our Democrats who haven't made up their minds
yet.''
   Twenty-eight years ago it was Wyoming's position in the alphabet
that brought it glory as the state's Democratic delegation cast the
deciding vote in Los Angeles that gave John F. Kennedy the party's
presidential nomination.
   Some state and party officials believe that with that in mind,
it might be in Wyoming's best interest to send an uncommitted
delegation to the convention.
   Gov. Mike Sullivan holds that belief, at least for the time
being. One of Wyoming's five ``super delegates'' to the Democratic
national convention, Sullivan does not have to commit himself to
any candidate prior to the convention.
   So far he has remained uncommitted, although he's been lobbied
by the candidates to cast his support prior to Super Tuesday.
   Not all Democratic leaders are taking that tack, however.
   Former Gov. Ed Herschler, the state's chief executive officer
for 12 years before Sullivan took over in 1987, will get an idea
this Saturday of how much political clout he carries. He endorsed
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee last month.
   Mike Beson, deputy campaign director for Rep. Richard Gephardt,
said endorsements aren't the only thing that count.
   ``We're not going to let that hinder our campaign,'' he said.
``We have a grassroots, aggressive campaign.''
   On the Democratic side, each of the 23 counties will hold party
conventions Saturday at which a secret ballot will determine the
allocation of 13 delegates. Once the results are known, nominees
for delegates to the state party convention on May 7 in Sheridan
will campaign on behalf of a certain candidate, or perhaps as an
uncommitted delegate.
   Later in the day, delegates to the state convention will be
selected, and at the convention the 13 delegates to the national
convention will be chosen.
   On the Republican side, things are not so simple.
   Precinct caucuses started earlier this month at which delegates
to the county conventions were selected. At the county conventions,
which start Tuesday and end the following Saturday, there will be
no formal presidential preference poll taken to base delegate
selection, said Mary Ann Collins, state GOP executive director.
   Twelve counties are considered delegate counties and will send
12 presidential delegates to the state GOP convention on May 7 in
Cheyenne. The nominees for these positions must declare which
candidate they are supporting, according to party bylaws.
   The remaining counties, plus one, will send alternate delegates
to the state convention. At the state convention the remaining six
delegates will be selected.

   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah,
went to church with everyday Americans on Sunday morning and later
dined with Hollywood elite in the evening at a gala that included a
British celebrity entourage.
   The Duke and Duchess of York, who are on a tour to promote
British trade, arrived at St. Luke's Episcopal Church shortly after
11 a.m. after a motorcade from the royal yacht Britannia, which is
docked at Long Beach Naval Station.
   Unknown to the royal retinue and the press, police officers
sweeping the motorcade route had detained a man they spotted
carrying a rifle. But it turned out that the man's presence had
nothing to do with the royal visit and the rifle was unloaded,
police said.
   Later in the evening, the duke and duchess were the guests of
honor at a star-studded dinner at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown
Los Angeles.
   Among the 700 guests paying $1,000 apiece to dine with British
royalty were Zsa Zsa Gabor, her husband Prince Frederick von
Anhalt, British-born ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins, her date George
Hamilton, and British actors Michael York and Roger Moore. Moore
served as master of ceremonies.
   Money raised by the event benefits the three-month UK-LA '88 art
festival and a fund to salvage books damaged in disastrous 1986
fires at the Los Angeles Central Library.
   Earlier, the couple were greeted by a cheering crowd waving
miniature Union Jacks as they went to church under British-style
drizzly skies.
   The Rev. A. LeRoy Young, rector of St. Luke's, officated over
matins, a morning service of prayer and song. Andrew read the day's
lesson from Romans 8:31.
   In his sermon, Young noted the presence of the couple.
   ``I think the majority will agree with me that their presence
here today is the biggest thing that has happened in this city
since the Richfield oil refinery exploded, and that was in 1933,''
he said.
   Ten minutes before the royal couple arrived, British Ambassador
Anthony Acland, Consul General Donald Ballentyne and their wives,
pulled up in a limousine that had been smashed on one side. The
accident, which caused no injuries, was blamed on a driver who ran
a red light a few blocks from the church, said British consulate
official Stewart Granger.
   About 300 people lined the sidewalk across from the church, some
packed under a bus shelter to avoid the occasional showers.
   Blanche Schulman, a war bride originally from London who sported
a British-made umbrella, said the event reminded her of damp
monarch-watching excursions of her youth.
   ``I'm very excited. ... The rain to me is part of everything.
It's just like home,'' said Mrs. Schulman, 64.
   Elaine Tuttle, 73, and Myrna Dillon, 48, both of Long Beach,
perched on stepladders in hopes of catching a glimpse.
   ``We love them, we really do. We follow their every move,'' said
Ms. Dillon.
   Asked if she had watched the weddings of Andrew and Sarah and
Charles and Diana on television, she replied, ``We didn't just
watch them, we watch them all the time. We have them on tape.''
   The incident with the man with a gun did not change the royal
couple's itinerary Sunday morning.
   John Kasser of Long Beach had retrieved a .22-caliber rifle from
the police station there and was headed to his car when Los Angeles
city police officers spotted him, said Long Beach Lt. Rod
Mickelson. The gun had been held by police for safekeeping for
several days after officers confiscated it during a domestic
dispute, Mickelson said.
   Kasser was later freed and allowed to keep his gun, police said.
He was not charged Sunday, nor had he been charged in the domestic
dispute, Mickelson said.
   ``There's absolutely no relation between him and the
motorcade,'' he said.

<HEAD>Drunken Driving Arrests Up 220 Percent Since 1970</HEAD>

   Arrests for driving under the influence of
alcohol rose more than 220 percent from 1970 to 1986, while the
number of licensed drivers increased by just 42 percent in that
period, a government report says.
   In 1986, some 1.8 million people were arrested for driving under
the influence, compared to 556,000 in 1970, said a report issued
Sunday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In 1983, the peak year,
there were 1.9 million such arrests, one for every 80 drivers.
   The study also found that rates for driving under the influence
were highest among 21-year-olds, reaching a peak in 1983 with a
rate of one arrest for every 39 licensed drivers of that age.
   Since 1983, most states have phased in new laws raising the
minimum age for buying or selling alcohol to 21. Arrest rates for
DUI for the ages 18 to 20 have declined by 14 percent since then,
more than twice the rate of decrease for those aged 21-24.
   Another portion of the study found that half the jail inmates
convicted of drunken driving had consumed the equivalent of at
least 12 bottles of beer or eight mixed drinks before their arrests.
   Almost half of the people jailed on drunken driving charges or
serving a sentence for that offense had been sentenced for the same
offense previously.
   The jail portion of the study, based on a 1983 survey of inmates
in 407 locations, also found that one in five of the convicted
drunken drivers had been consuming two or more kinds of alcoholic
beverages when arrested.
   The median age for those in jail for drunken driving was 32,
about 5 years older than the median age for all jail inmates. Some
95 percent of the jailed drunken drivers were men and nearly 80
percent were unmarried, separated, divorced or were widows or
widowers.

   Telephone credit cards make it easier to
charge calls but they're also making it easier for thieves to steal
the numbers and run up huge long-distance bills.
   The thieves are not necessarily the users. They often sell the
stolen numbers to others who use them to dial around the world.
   Toll fraud costs the long-distance companies about half a
billion dollars a year, about 1 percent of the industry's revenues,
according to the industry-sponsored Communications Fraud Control
Association.
   Despite phone companies' security efforts, thieves are coming up
with bold new deceptions aimed at the unsuspecting.
   Officials at the Mexico (Mo.) Ledger fell into such a trap with
a Southwestern Bell calling card, which the newspaper used to make
long-distance calls on American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s
network, according to Editor Robert M. White II.
   Southwestern Bell, using a computer to monitor calling-card use
by its customers, detected unusually high use by the newspaper one
weekend in January. After consulting the newspaper, it canceled the
card and issued a new one.
   Publisher Max Thomson says that on the same day the new code was
issued, he got a call from a man who said he was from AT&T and
needed to verify the new credit card number assigned to the
newspaper because someone was trying to use it. Unsuspecting,
Thomson gave the caller the new number.
   Within days, the card again was being used to charge calls
around the world, and by the time Southwestern Bell's computer sent
up another red flag, the newspaper's card had run up charges of
more than $4,500.
   The calls included one for $155.46 from a New York pay phone to
Mali and another costing $105.27 from the same phone to the same
number in Mali 12 hours later; a $144.15 call that lasted two and a
half hours between a Jersey City, N.J., phone booth and China.
Others calls went to Kuwait, Bangladesh, Gambia, Senegal, Spain,
Taiwan and the Dominican Republic, among other places.
   As is the practice of most phone companies, Southwestern Bell
didn't charge the newspaper for the unauthorized calls.
   But the Ledger has ensured that it won't happen again: ``We no
longer have credit cards,'' Thomson said.
   Southwestern Bell officials aren't sure how the newspaper's card
number was stolen initially. Some codes are obtained by computer
hackers who dial into a long-distance company's electronic files
and find secret billing codes.
   Long-distance companies are improving their network software to
help detect unauthorized access quickly, and they are phasing out
their shorter codes and adopting 14-digit replacements, which are
harder for hackers to crack.
   But thieves don't need a computer to get a code. Some hang
around phone booths where callers are dialing from cards and
``they'll use binoculars, mirrors, anything they possibly can'' to
read the numbers off the cards or even memorize the numbers as the
caller is punching them into the phone, said Everick Bowens,
president of the fraud control association.
   With codes in hand, hustlers and hackers then look for customers.
   At banks of pay phones in transit areas, the hustlers offer
domestic and international calls at deeply discounted rates, aware
that with frequent use the life of a code can be just a few hours.
   Bolder hustlers are passing themselves off as legitimate
resellers of long-distance service or even as a representative of a
long-distance company.
   US Sprint Communications Co., which lost $80 million to toll
fraud last year and is one of the most active long-distance
companies in going after code theft, recently uncovered a
``multi-level marketing operation'' that sold codes to about 200
people and businesses _ including insurance companies, accountants,
lawyers and retailers, said security director Robert F. Fox.
   ``A man walks in wearing a three-piece suit and says he's a
reseller with a contract with a major long-distance company and
that he can cut your long-distance phone bill,'' Fox said,
recounting the scam.
   ``He looks at a company's phone bill. Say it's $10,000 a month.
He says, `I can cut it to $5,000 a month,''' Fox said. ``He says
he'll give you authorization codes, and for your protection the
codes will be changed every few days.''
   Some of the buyers are caught unaware, Fox said, but ``some
people don't ask a lot of questions because they don't want a lot
of answers.''
   Sprint has been going after many of these buyers in civil court
actions and collecting restitution, he said.
   Fox advises: ``It may sound legitimate, but if it sounds too
good to be true, it probably is.''

<HEAD>Corporate Economists Predict no Recession This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy has shrugged off the worst
effects of the October stock market collapse and should be able to
escape a recession this election year, economists for top U.S.
corporations predicted today.
   The National Association of Business Economists said optimism
among its members has risen appreciably since the last survey
conducted in the month following the Oct. 19 plunge in stock prices.
   In November, more than half of the business economists were
predicting a recession would begin before the end of 1988, an
outlook that could have spelled bad news for Republican hopes of
holding onto the White House.
   Now, the number of economists expecting a recession this year
has dropped to about one-fourth.
   ``As we move farther away from October, we are a little less
nervous. We are seeing continued improvement in manufacturing and
other good signs that the expansion will keep going,'' said
Kathleen Cooper, chief economist for Security Pacific National Bank
of Los Angeles.
   The next president is likely to face a recession soon after
taking office, the analysts believe, with about 60 percent of them
picking 1989 as the most likely year the downturn will begin.
   But for 1988, the economists are projecting further growth at a
modest pace, stable interest rates and a slight drop in inflation.
   The analysts predicted that the economy, as measured by the
gross national product, will expand just 2 percent this year, down
from a 3.9 percent GNP increase in 1987, when measured from the
fourth quarter of 1986.
   This is more pessimistic than the Reagan administration, which
is calling for GNP growth this year of 2.4 percent.
   Ms. Cooper, who compiled the association's survey, said the
decline in the stock market caused the majority of economists to
reduce their growth forecasts for this year, but she said most of
them had cut back their projections by less than 1 percent.
   ``Economists see the largest effect of the market's plunge on
consumer spending for durable goods,'' she said, noting that they
are now expecting car sales to total only 9.8 million units this
year, down from an expectation of 10.5 million sales made before
the market decline. The forecast of housing starts also was trimmed
to 1.52 million units this year, compared to 1.62 million new
houses built in 1987.
   Ms. Cooper said the analysts expect growth to be most sluggish
in the first half of the year, as businesses cut back on production
to reduce high inventories. GNP growth will average 1.5 percent in
the first six months and then improve to 2.5 percent growth for the
rest of the year, the economists forecast.
   This sluggish growth rate will not be enough to keep the
unemployment rate from rising. The economists forecast that
unemployment, which now stands at 5.8 percent, will rise to 6.1
percent by the end of the year.
   But the slow growth will help to keep inflation from getting out
of control. The analysts predicted that consumer prices will rise
4.2 percent this year, slightly slower than the 4.4 percent
increase in 1987.
   In other predictions, the economists said:
   _Interest rates, as measured by the prime lending rate, will
stay steady. Banks cut their prime rate, used to set interest rates
on a variety of corporate and consumer loans, to 8.5 percent in
early February, and analysts forecast it will remain at this level
through the end of the year.
   _The federal budget deficit, which fell to $150.4 billion in
1987, will rise to $157 billion in the current fiscal year, but
then resume falling, dropping to $140 billion by 1990. This is more
pessimistic than the Reagan administration, which sees this year's
deficit falling to $146.7 billion and a further decline to $104.2
billion by 1990.
   _The country's foreign trade deficit, which hit a record $171
billion last year, will finally start to come down, dipping to $150
billion this year and $130 billion in 1989.
   The optimism on the trade deficit is based on a belief that the
dollar has finally fallen far enough to stem Americans' appetite
for imports while making U.S. products competitive once again on
overseas markets.
   Ms. Cooper said the economists are now less pessimistic about
the fate of the dollar with less than one-fifth of them thinking
the dollar will drop by 10 percent in value this year against other
major currencies. In November, more than 40 percent were looking
for a decline in the dollar that was at least that large.

<HEAD>IRS Says Mutual Fund Expenses Won't Count as Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has put out the
definitive word on a confusing new law affecting taxation of
investors in mutual funds.
   Investors will not have to report certain operating expenses of
their publicly offered mutual funds as 1987 income because the
funds will not pass along those expenses to shareholders, said IRS
spokesman Rod Young.
   ``People don't have to be concerned at all about those expenses
on the returns they are filing now,'' said Mike Delaney of the
Investment Company Institute, which represents most of the nation's
2,400 mutual funds.
   This means investors will have to do nothing on their 1987
returns to get a one-year reprieve from a new tax.
   However, unless Congress intervenes, about 20 million
shareholders will have to count such expenses as income on future
tax returns and then attempt to write them off as a miscellaneous
itemized deduction.
   The taxation of these expenses has been surrounded by confusion
because of the wording of a new provision affecting them that was
signed into law by President Reagan only last Dec. 22. That
provision delayed for one year implementation of a section of the
big tax overhaul enacted in 1986.
   Because of the December change, publicly offered mutual funds
will not allocate their 1987 operating expenses among shareholders.
Thus, shareholders will not have to mention such amounts on their
tax returns at all.
   But all that changes for 1988. Mutual funds will be required to
pass on operating expenses to shareholders. In turn, shareholders
will list that amount as income and hope they can deduct it as a
miscellaneous expense.
   That is, unless Congress intervenes again.
   Under the 1986 tax overhaul, the deduction for all kinds of
miscellaneous expenses is limited to those that exceed 2 percent of
adjusted gross income. A mutual-fund shareholder whose
miscellaneous expenses did not reach that threshold would have no
way of deducting the fund's expenses and, as a result, would be
taxed on income never received. The same would be true for a
taxpayer who did not itemize deductions.
   Reagan has asked Congress to grant shareholders permanent relief
from taxation on that ``phantom income'' at a cost of $400 million
a year.
   The lion's share of money invested in mutual funds is in those
that are regularly traded on securities markets. But there are
numerous non-public funds that are traded privately.
   The IRS notes those that are not publicly offered or owned by at
least 500 persons may have to allocate expenses among shareholders
for 1987. Any fund that is so affected should be advising
shareholders to report as income the expenses that are designated
in ``Box 2'' on Form 1099-DIV.
   ``If you are not sure that your fund qualifies as publicly
offered, you should contact your fund,'' advises Young of the IRS.

   A bitter, open debate marked by
charges that some prominent historians are trying to tone down the
horror of Nazi atrocities is capturing the attention of West
Germans.
   The controversy has been the topic of a best-selling book,
numerous newspaper articles and TV reports. It is known as the
``Historians' Dispute'' and has split prominent professors into
feuding camps.
   One group, represented chiefly by prominent Berlin historian
Ernst Nolte, is calling for a new perspective on the Third Reich
and German identity 43 years after World War II.
   Six million Jews were killed in Europe between 1933 and 1945 as
part of Adolf Hitler's ``Final Solution.''
   Nolte and his supporters tend to compare what happened under
Hitler to atrocities carried out by other governments, such as the
deaths of millions in the Soviet Union under Stalin.
   But their opponents, led by Frankfurt University philosophy
professor Juergen Habermas, say the conservative historians are
trying to lessen the magnitude of Nazi crimes through such
comparisons. Habermas, one of West Germany's best known
intellectuals, also says his opponents are paving the way for
nationalistic impulses.
   In December more than 300 historians, sociologists, and
philosophers met in Frankfurt to discuss the dispute's impact. No
resolutions were passed there, but lectures held at the meeting
will be published in a book scheduled for release in March.
   The debate, however, has moved far beyond academic circles.
   A book documenting the dispute made the best-seller list in the
news magazine Stern last year, and new arguments regularly make
headlines in leading newspapers. As recently as Jan. 20, regional
television in the state of Bavaria devoted a book-review show to
new history books associated with the dispute.
   Nolte told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
Wednesday that he stands by his arguments.
   ``Those who want to make the Nazis' mass murder stand alone by
forbidding every comparison with other events are guilty of having
an incredibly unhistorical attitude,'' Nolte said.
   Nolte sparked the historians' dispute with an essay called ``The
Past That Won't Go Away,'' published in the conservative
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper in June 1986.
   He suggested that Stalin's infamous forced labor camps and the
Communists' murder of millions of peasants were in a sense a
forerunner of the Nazi death camp Auschwitz and Hitler's genocide
program.
   ``Wasn't the Bolsheviks' `class murder' the logical and actual
precursor of the National Socialists' `racial murder'?'' Nolte
asked in the essay.
   Nolte's opponents have frequently called his phrasing unclear
and open to many interpretations.
   His critics also say he tries to justify Hitler's motives for
attacking the Soviet Union in World War II by arguing that the
dictator was mainly responding to the Soviets' goal of spreading
communism.
   ``To Nolte, Hitler is a European citizen who was historically in
the right in that he unwillingly went to war for democracy,'' the
Bayerischen Rundfunk television show ``Lesezeichen'' said in
reviewing Nolte's new book.
   Nolte and his supporters, however, say their arguments raise
valid questions in historical interpretation.
   Other Nolte arguments include comparing Nazi atrocities with
those of Cambodia's Pol Pot regime in the 1970s.
   Nolte says that he does not adhere to any one political party,
but many historians call him a conservative.
   ``I would say Nolte is a conservative,'' historian Christian
Meier of the University of Munich told the AP. ``Conservatives in
this dispute are those who see the horrible events of World War II
and the Holocaust as an instance of fascism, which also took hold
in other European countries, and not as a failure of German society
and values.''
   Habermas, in a newspaper essay, charged several conservative
historians with reinterpreting history to justify and minimize the
Nazi regime's crimes. The article appeared in the Hamburg-based
weekly newspaper, Die Zeit, in July 1986.
   The Nazi crimes ``lose their singularity'' in Nolte's arguments,
Habermas wrote in the article.
   Many historians hold that the Nazis' genocide cannot validly be
compared with other atrocities.
   ``Never before had a state, with the authority of its
responsible leader, decided and announced it would completely kill
off a specific group of people'' and put the plan into aciton,
historian Eberhard Jaeckel of Stuttgart University wrote about the
Nazi genocide in a 1986 essay as a response to conservative
arguments.
   Some historians say that too much dwelling on the Nazi past
could cause West Germans today, particularly younger ones, to
resent what they may see as a steady stream of accusation.
   ``Many (West) Germans today are at least one generation removed
from the Nazi period,'' Meier said. ``But the (West) Germans are
constantly being reminded of past actions. If it goes too far, it
could even provoke a counter-reaction.''
   Some liberal historians attribute the airing of conservative
views to a new, conservative ``political climate'' in West Germany.
In 1982, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats
toppled the leftist Social Democrats.
   ``Ten years ago they (the conservative historians) wouldn't have
risked advancing such notions,'' historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler told
the AP. ``The conservative historians' arguments fit into today's
political climate.''

<HEAD>FDA Asks For Meeting With Aspirin Makers on Heart Attack Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it is
concerned about possibly misleading advertisements that describe
regular aspirin use as a way to prevent heart attacks.
   The agency has summoned the nation's aspirin makers to a meeting
this week to discuss to what degree they can make that claim in
their ads, an FDA official said Sunday.
   The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at the agency's
headquarters in Rockville, Md. It comes a month after The New
England Journal of Medicine published preliminary results of a
study showing that aspirin taken every other day could reduce the
risk of heart attacks in middle-aged men.
   ``We do have some concerns about this,'' said FDA spokesman
Donald McLearn. ``Even the study itself was accompanied by an
editorial saying, `Don't jump to conclusions, folks.'''
   Some aspirin makers have launched advertising campaigns
featuring young men who have suffered heart attacks.
   The study was conducted on physicians aged 40 to 65 years old.
   ``It was clear from the preliminary results that it could be
helpful for heart attacks for men between 40 and 65,'' McLearn
said. ``Our concern is people will read about the study and say,
`I'm a 20-year-old female, maybe I should take aspirin every day.'
That's not what the study was all about.''
   McLearn said that because the study's results are still
preliminary, doctors still may need to know more before prescribing
regular aspirin dosages to patients. One possible side effect is an
increased risk of strokes, he said.
   Also asked to participate in the meeting were associations
representing the prescription and over-the-counter drug industries.
Also likely to attend are officials of the Federal Trade
Commission, which oversees advertising of over-the-counter drugs.

   A survey suggests the mailing of Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop's report on AIDS to individual households
in Alaska was well received and helped those who read it understand
the disease.
   The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services mailed
217,000 copies of the report last November and had a professional
polling company assess the impact the following month.
   Officials believe it is the first followup study of a mass
mailing of AIDS material in the United States.
   That study by Dittman Research Corp. found 91 percent of the
people who read some or all of the booklet judged it ``appropriate,
well done and covered the topic adequately.'' Only 3 percent found
it ``inappropriate, too sexually explicit and offensive.''
   Among other things, the report says people who do not limit
themselves to one AIDS-free sexual partner should use condoms. It
contains a photograph of a condom and instructions on use.
   The report, issued in October 1986, also contains a brief
section calling for sex education in schools as one way to help
control spread of the deadly disease.
   ``Those who read the surgeon general's report had distinctly
different understanding of AIDS compared to those who hadn't read
the report,'' the research company wrote in its analysis.
   Dittman's scientific telephone survey of 521 residents from 51
communities found that 58 percent of those contacted reported
receiving the booklet and that 76 percent of those read at least
some of it.
   Moreover, 46 percent of those questioned said other household
members had read at least part of the report.
   Dr. John Middaugh, the Alaska state epidemiologist, said the
pollsters _ who did not include a margin of error in their summary
_ told him they considered the 58 percent who recalled receiving
the booklet unusually high for an unsolicited mailing.
   He said some copies probably did not reach their destination for
a variety of reasons, but that a majority of those who could not
recall the booklet probably discarded it without realizing what it
was.
   The significance of the study, he said, was the high ratio of
those who did recall getting the 36-page booklet, who then read it
and the even higher proportion who approved of it.
   ``This proves the acceptability of doing this and the
effectiveness of doing it,'' Middaugh said in a telephone
interview. ``This was an overwhelming response that should forever
lay to rest whether this is an appropriate step to take.''
   He referred to controversy at the federal level over whether to
mail AIDS information to every household, whether the surgeon
general's report or some other format.
   Middaugh said Republican state Sen. Tim Kelly pushed
authorization for the Alaska mailer through the legislature after
it became apparent the federal government was not going to do it
last year.
   U.S. Public Health Service spokesman Jim Brown said 12 million
copies of the report have been printed, including 9 million
supplied to members of Congress for mailing to their constituents.
   Congress allocated money for a national mailing last year _
although not necessarily the surgeon general's full report _ but it
was never done. The current PHS budget contains more explicit
language directing a national mailer and Health and Human Services
Department officials say a brochure now under preparation will be
in the mail by June.
   ``I'm delighted that the state of Alaska has chosen to educate
its people by using the surgeon general's report,'' said Koop.
``I'm even more thrilled that they did a followup survey to see the
reaction to it. We've had good general reaction to the surgeon
general's report, but this is the first real formal tracking that I
know of.''
   The Dittman survey included an analysis of different responses
from 345 ``readers'' and a 176-person non-reader ``control group''
on a variety of questions such as ``can you get AIDS by being
bitten by a mosquito?'' Twenty-three percent of the non-readers
said yes, compared to 17 percent of the readers. The report says
the answer is no.
   Twenty-two percent of non-readers said you can get AIDS from
donating blood, compared to 11 percent for readers.
   Eighty-two percent of the readers said they would let their
children attend school with an AIDS-infected child compared to 75
percent non-readers.

<HEAD>Northwest Flight Attendants Union Continue Strike Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The union representing 6,700 Northwest
Airlines flight attendants continued to threaten to strike Sunday
night although both sides in the labor talks said just one issue
divided them.
   Negotiators for the airline and the union met with a federal
mediator for four hours Sunday and agreed on all but one contract
issue, according to Northwest spokesman William Wren.
   William Genoese, international director of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters airline division, agreed that only one
issue separated the two sides _the issue of how long newly hired
workers will stay on a lower pay scale. But he declined to
characterize the rest of the day's discussions except to say ``we
talked around'' other issues.
   A strike was still a possibility, he said late Sunday.
   ``At this moment we're in strike position. It can happen two
minutes from now or any other time. Under the law, we have that
right,'' Genoese said about 9:30 p.m. CST Sunday.
   About two hours later, after meeting with other union
negotiators, Genoese said ``tomorrow (Monday) will be the really
big day.'' Monday is the first weekday since the contract expired
at midnight Friday.
   Northwest officials said Sunday the airline continued to operate
a normal flight schedule. No delays were reported at airports
served by the carrier.
   Genoese and Northwest agreed that the only sticking point in the
negotiations is Northwest's proposal to stretch from five to nine
years the time in which an employee advances from a ``B'' or lower
pay scale to the ``A'' pay rate. The union is resisting the
proposal.
   The airline issued a press release Sunday night saying that its
contract offered the union would make the flight attendants the
second-highest-paid in the airline industry.
   According to Northwest, the contract, which would run through
Dec. 31, 1992, also calls for two 2 percent wage increases for all
flight attendants through 1992 and lump sum bonus payments in 1988
and 1989.
   Earlier in the day, the two sides had been reported to be apart
on other issues such as the length of the contract and retroactive
pay.
   A strike deadline last Friday night was extended as the two
sides continued negotiations that began Wednesday. The two sides
resumed talks one day after the Teamsters airline division
announced that nearly 95 percent of the attendants had authorized a
strike.
   On Saturday, the talks broke off, but a union spokesman said
strike preparations had been ``put on hold.''
   Genoese said late Saturday that a request by the federal
mediator to delay a strike helped avert a walkout Saturday morning.
   Meanwhile, there was no word on whether flight attendant picket
lines would be honored by pilots or machinists if there is a strike.
   Spokesmen for the pilots' union were in a meeting Sunday morning
to discuss the flight attendants' matter and were unavailable for
comment.
   If flight attendants do strike, the airline has said it will
keep flying.
   About 2,000 managers trained as flight attendants were posted
throughout the Northwest system with 200 newly hired replacement
flight attendants also ready to move, Terry Erskine, the airline's
vice president for law and labor relations, said Saturday.

<HEAD>Justice Changes Account Of Meese's Role In Israeli Spy Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it made an
``honest error'' by erroneously giving the impression for nine
months that Attorney General Edwin Meese removed himself from the
Pollard spy case.
   It now acknowledges he was briefed twice about the case and he
never was excluded.
   In what chief department spokesman Terry Eastland called a
correction, he said Meese is only excluded from the espionage case
against the Israeli Air Force officer who recruited Jonathan
Pollard, a Navy counterterrorism analyst, to spy for Israel.
   Meese is free to be briefed and even to make decisions in the
still-open Pollard case to the extent that they don't involve the
case against Israeli Brig. Gen. Aviem Sella, Eastland said.
   ``We were confused about the Sella case,'' Eastland said. ``It
was an honest error.''
   Eastland acknowledged that last month and on one previously
undisclosed occasion Assistant Attorney General William Weld, head
of the criminal division, had briefed Meese about the Pollard case
``without touching on Sella.''
   Meese's own lawyer, Nathan Lewin, was unaware of the situation
as recently as last week even though it was Lewin's work for Meese
and Sella in separate cases that triggered the exclusion, known as
a recusal.
   The turnabout comes as a government source said independent
counsel James McKay is examining another Meese recusal for clues
about his motives in dealing with a Mideast oil pipeline proposal
in 1985.
   Meese hired Lewin last May to represent him in McKay's
investigation of whether the attorney general and his attorney, E.
Robert Wallach, violated or conspired to violate a federal law
barring bribes to foreign officials.
   In May 1985, Meese was recused from all matters involving
Wallach, but arranged for Wallach to meet National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane to promote the pipeline. Investigators say that
examining that Meese recusal might help determine whether the
attorney general was aiding Wallach's plan or, as Lewin argues,
directing it to the proper official.
   At the Office of Government Ethics last week, General Counsel
Donald Campbell explained: ``If you're a federal official and
you've hired a law firm to represent you, you should recuse
yourself, that is, take no action in any matter involving that firm
_ just as a matter of appearances even if you have no financial
stake.''
   For that reason, Eastland said, Meese advised Justice officials
last May: ``I hereby recuse myself from participating in any matter
before the department in which the law firm (of Miller, Cassidy,
Larroca & Lewin) represents any party or is otherwise involved.''
   The Washington Post reported then that the recusal covered the
Pollard affair. The Justice Department did not dispute that.
   Pollard was sentenced last year to life in prison for giving
reams of secrets to Israeli agents. But Justice officials still
pursued the case, in part, because Sella had fled to Israel and has
not been brought to trial here.
   So there was surprise and consternation when the Post reported
Feb. 19: ``After being briefed on the case last month, ... Meese
ordered that the Pollard case be kept officially open so
investigators can pursue their inquiry.''
   Asked by The Associated Press last Monday for an explanation,
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said, ``I have problems
with that account because Meese is recused in Pollard.''
   Russell bucked the question to deputy chief spokesman Pat
Korten. Citing the same problem, Korten bucked it to Eastland, who
was with Meese in California until Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, Lewin said he'd never discussed Pollard with Meese
because ``I think he certainly has recused himself because I am
representing Sella.'' Expressing surprise at the Post account,
Lewin said, ``At the department, they have known all along that it
has been very much up front that he is not involved in Pollard.''
   While Eastland sought an answer, a senior department official,
demanding anonymity, said Wednesday there was no problem because
Meese merely was briefed and made no decisions.
   Some former department lawyers dispute that view. One, who once
worked in the attorney general's office, said, ``A recusal has
always meant a Chinese wall. You are not even kept up to date.''
   A former Justice career lawyer said that, to avoid making a
decision by ``a wink or a nod,'' briefings were restricted to
situations where the information was essential to decisions in
other areas.
   But Friday afternoon, Eastland provided an official explanation
that did not claim an exception for briefings.
   He said the client lists regularly provided by Lewin's firm
``have not included the Pollard case, and so the attorney general
is not recused from Pollard.''
   ``The lists do include the Sella case, and the attorney general
has been very careful to avoid taking any action in that case or in
any other related case where his action might at all affect the
Sella case.''
   Eastland denied Meese kept the Pollard case open. ``He didn't
have to, because it has been open for some time.''

   Stock prices declined moderately in quiet trading
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, ending 13 consecutive days of
gains in the market's key index, while the dollar remained steady
after opening lower against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which rose 119.69 points
during Saturday's half-day session, closed at 25,242.81, down 42.06
points or 0.2 percent.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at 128.08 yen,
down 0.27 yen from Friday's close of 128.35 yen. After declining at
one point in morning trading to 127.95 yen, its first trip below
the 128-yen level in about three weeks, the dollar ended the day at
128.12 yen, down 0.23 yen.
   Dealers said many stock market participants were staying on the
sidelines in anticipation of a slight correction in prices
following the recent gains.
   During the 13 previous trading days, the Nikkei index rose a
total of 1,622.60 points or 7 percent.
   ``The market is taking a respite, which many participants had
expected for some time,'' said an analyst at Nomura Securities,
Japan's largest brokerage, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A record 14 consecutive days of gains in the Nikkei average was
set in early 1961.
   Foreign exchange dealers said sentiment toward the dollar was
relatively weak, with the market still searching for the currency's
bottom level. But they said the dollar's decline was being tempered
by fears of possible market intervention by Japan's central bank
below the 128-yen level, profit-taking by speculators and light
activity by commercial dollar-sellers.
   Despite the fears of dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan, a
senior trader at a commercial bank, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the central bank was unlikely to intervene unless
the dollar began falling at a faster pace below the 127.5-yen level.

Strong Second</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Englanders Michael Dukakis and George
Bush claimed victories in the Maine caucuses, but Jesse Jackson's
unexpectedly strong second-place showing was the surprise of the
evening.
   ``Our message is winning,'' declared Jackson, who finished with
1 percent of the Democratic vote in Maine's caucuses four years ago
but gained 28 percent on Sunday.
   Anything but first place would have been a major setback for
Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor who was winning 42 percent of
the delegates to the state Democratic convention in Maine.
Twenty-one percent were uncommitted.
   The also-rans were Paul Simon with 4 percent, Richard Gephardt
with 3 percent, and Albert Gore and Gary Hart with 1 percent each.
   ```Today our message shone through again ... (and that) gives
our national campaign another push towards success on Super
Tuesday,'' Dukakis said Sunday from Cleveland.
   Bush too needed the ``overwhelming victory'' he claimed Sunday.
With no official tally, the Bush campaign cited its own reports
from 259 caucuses and said the vice president had the non-binding
support of 65 percent of the GOP state convention delegates chosen
over the weekend.
   That added up to a huge lead for Bush in the state where he has
a vacation home. Robertson garnered 147 delegates, or 14 percent;
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole 88, or 8 percent; and Rep. Jack
Kemp 14, or 1 percent, the Bush campaign said, adding that 123
delegates, or 12 percent, were uncommitted.
   ``I am delighted with what appears to be an overwhelming victory
in the Maine caucuses, assuring my campaign of all 22 national
delegates,'' Bush said from Washington.
   If the Democratic results held up at the state convention,
Dukakis would win 10 of the state's 23 pledged delegates to the
Democratic national convention. Jackson is in line for 8 delegates
and the uncommitted group 5.
   The numbers were unquestionably on the side of Dukakis, but the
runner-up emerged with a victory no less sweet.
   ``Maine has sent a message to America that we can win, that
America wants bold leadership and a new director with sound
ideas,'' Jackson said from the campaign trail in Texas.
   ``If it hadn't been for the strong grassroots organization that
we had, we would have been in trouble,'' acknowledged David
Villarino, manager of Dukakis' Maine campaign. Villarino asserted
that Jackson's victories in two of Maine's largest cities, Portland
and Bangor, reflected defections from the recently scaled-back
campaign of Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.
   Whatever the reason for their success, the Jackson forces were
ecstatic.
   ``What we're doing in Maine is building an electoral victory,
from the grass roots to the top of the blades,'' said Scott Nova of
the Jackson national campaign staff.
   Bush aides had worried earlier in the week that Robertson's
``invisible army'' of supporters would flood the caucuses here as
they did in Michigan, Iowa and other states. But Robertson's
supporters did not total the numbers feared by Bush aides, and
deals with Dole supporters diluted Robertson's impact.
   With the state party planning no count of results, the various
campaigns agreed in general that Bush was running well ahead.
   Jeff Nelson, a spokesman for Robertson in the state, said of the
Bush supporters: ``I don't think there's any question that they are
going to be able to claim victory.''
   A top Dole organizer, state Sen. Pamela Cahill, also conceded.
   ``This is Bush country up in New England, up in Maine and New
Hampshire,'' she said.
   In assessing the results in Maine, Dukakis and Jackson both
dutifully invoked Super Tuesday, the mega-primary next week in
which 20 states and one territory will hold primaries or caucuses.
At stake in the March 8 contests are 1,307 delegates to the
national convention.
   ``We're right where we want to be, and we're heading into the
final turn,'' said Villarino.
   Jackson spokesman Mel King said, ``People across the country,
when they find he came in second in Maine, are going to dispel the
notion that a person who is black can't do well.''
   Bush supporters acknowledged that they needed a big margin over
Robertson before the contests in the South, where the former
television evangelist has a strong core of support.
   ``We couldn't afford to have the national story out of Maine be
that Robertson comes in a close second,'' said Gov. John R.
McKernan Jr., one of Bush's strongest backers in the state.
   Maine's conservative GOP wing and fundamentalist churches were
fertile recruiting grounds for Robertson, and his forces mounted an
energetic challenge. But outmaneuvered, if not outmuscled, by Bush
backers in caucus brokering, Robertson's followers were unable to
turn their raw numbers into a matching proportion of delegates.
   ``The party and the procedures'' favored Bush over Robertson,
said Jeff Nelson, state spokesman for the Robertson campaign.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake in the Bering Sea
shook the Aleutian islands, but there were no immediate reports of
damage.
   Sunday night's quake struck about 100 miles east of Bering
Island and had a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 on the Richter scale,
said the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.
   Paul Whitmore of the tsunami center said the quake occurred at
8:32 p.m. Sunday.
   He said no alerts were issued for a tsunami, a fast-moving ocean
wave caused by sesimic action. ``It's too small for that area to
potentially cause a tsunami,'' Whitmore said.
   He said the center had no contact with the area and did not know
if there had been any damage.
   Bering Island is part of the Commander Islands just west of Attu
in the Aleutian chain.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion on a seismograph.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

   A rape-murder case nearly 13 years old
will be the focus Tuesday of a U.S. Supreme Court review that many
inmates see as a ticket off death row.
   ``In my opinion, it will affect everybody,'' said Jim
Vanderbilt, who has spent more than 11 years on Texas' death row
for the 1975 slaying of an Amarillo teen-ager. ``We will have
commutation of everybody.''
   Lawyers for the state and for Donald Gene Franklin will present
arguments to the high court on the constitutionality of a Texas
statute that limits consideration by a jury of mitigating
circumstances that could benefit a defendant.
   Since October, when the court agreed to hear the case, dozens of
death-row inmates in Texas, whose 27 executions in the last six
years are the most in any state since executions resumed in 1977,
have attached Franklin's arguments to their own in efforts to win
stays.
   ``It's an issue that could potentially affect everybody on death
(row) in Texas,'' said Richard H. Burr III, coordinator of the
death penalty project of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund Inc. in New York. ``I think probably everybody now is raising
the issue and if they're not, they should be.''
   Franklin, 36, who has had three trials and four execution dates,
blamed the abduction, rape and stabbing death of 27-year-old Mary
Margaret Moran on a friend who used his car.
   Franklin was arrested hours after the July 1975 abduction but
refused to say where the missing San Antonio nurse was. Search
parties combed San Antonio, but it took four days to find her
bleeding in a bed of insects, suffering from loss of blood and
irreversible shock. She died the next day.
   Mark Stevens, who is representing Franklin before the high
court, said jurors should have had doubt about Franklin's guilt
because of circumstantial evidence in the case.
   Stevens also said Franklin, at the time of the last trial, had
caused no disciplinary problems while in prison, ``which goes to
show among other things, he shouldn't be executed.''
   Stevens contends although such mitigating circumstances are
presented at the punishment phase of a trial, the jury is given no
guidance as to how heavily to weigh them.
   Franklin's trial attorneys suggested a jury charge that spelled
out ways to handle mitigating circumstances. The judge refused to
include it in his instructions to the jury, which determined
Franklin should die. He has been on death row since 1982.
   ``The state is real confident it will prevail,'' said Bob Walt,
an assistant state attorney general.
   A Texas jury now has these questions to consider before deciding
a person convicted of capital murder should be executed: whether
the defendant's act was deliberate and with the expectation death
would result; whether the defendant is likely to commit a future
violent act; whether the victim may have provoked the attack and
whether the response by the defendant was reasonable.
   ``What they're saying now is that the Constitution requires a
jury to consider mitigating evidence,'' Walt said. ``I can't think
of a case in Texas that has less mitigating evidence than Donald
Gene Franklin's.
   ``He was in custody on a prior rape. ... There ain't no doubt in
this case. They had the victim's clothes soaking in bloody water in
his house. All the victim's property was at his house.''
   Stevens and Walt agree one one thing: It is impossible to
predict what the Supreme Court will do.
   If the court rules in Franklin's favor, anyone who requested
similar jury instructions could be entitled to a new trial, Stevens
said.
   ``Even if you didn't request these instructions, you might be
entitled to raise that fundamental constitutional right,'' Stevens
added.
   ``It's real tough to speculate,'' Walt said. ``Of course, hope
springs eternal on death row.''
   Hope is indeed the prevailing word on death row, where more than
260 people await execution.
   ``There are a lot of options but (commutation) is the most
likely,'' said James Beathard, who arrived on death row in 1985 for
killing a 14-year-old boy.
   ``What could they do _ hold new trials for 250 people?
Everybody's real hopeful about it and figure it's their best
chance.''

   Friends and enemies of the Confederate flag say
they ain't just whistlin' Dixie when they promise a fight over
whether the rebel battle banner will keep waving from state
flagpoles in the South.
   The Confederate flag flies over the capitols of Alabama and
South Carolina along with state flags. The state flags of Georgia
and Mississippi incorporate the design.
   In Georgia, a bill to redesign the state flag languishes in a
legislative committee, and in Alabama black lawmakers who hoped to
remove the Confederate banner from atop the Capitol dome were
arrested.
   ``This is a very emotional, controversial issue. We knew that
when we took it on,'' said Earl Shinhoster, Southeastern regional
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. ``We think we deserve a vote on the issue.''
   South Carolina State Sen. Glenn McConnell said opponents are
being intolerant of differing views.
   ``It does not breed good relations ... to pull (the flag) down
and brand it as a symbol of racism and hate,'' McConnell said. ``If
we become a society that cannot bridge differences, then we ...
become a society built on extremes.''
   Shinhoster said the flag ``represents the heart and soul of a
defeated cause.''
   ``It represents state sovereignty, state rights, a rejection or
resistance to federal control, and it has an adverse effect on
basic issues of human need,'' he said.
   Georgia's Legislature voted to include the Confederate battle
emblem on the state flag in 1956, as a reaction to federal school
desegregation orders. A bill seeking to reinstate the former state
flag has been sent to a House committee, where it will likely die
quietly.
   Judith Damewood, president of the grass-roots lobbying group
Common Cause Georgia, said she is embarrassed whenever she looks at
the Georgia state flag.
   ``When the Democratic National Convention comes to Atlanta this
summer, this is not the flag I want those delegates to see,'' she
said.
   In Alabama, the battle flag has flown since 1961, when then-Gov.
John Patterson had it put up in commemoration of the Civil War's
100th anniversary.
   Since there is no law allowing the flag to fly, Gov. Guy Hunt
has said he will allow the Legislature to resolve the dispute.
   On Feb. 2, the House turned down a resolution to remove the
flag, so 13 black legislators, led by Rep. Thomas Reed of Tuskegee,
tried climbing a fence surrounding the Capitol to pull down the
flag. The group was arrested on trespassing charges. A March 11
court date has been set.
   Other states that made up the Confederacy _ Arkansas, Florida,
Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia _ do not
fly the battle flag officially.
   The Norfolk, Va., City Council, under pressure from the local
NAACP, recently voted to stop displaying the flag at meetings.
   While flag opponents hedge their bets on intense lobbying and
public outcry for action, flag supporters are preparing to talk the
issue down.
   ``If it takes a filibuster, I'm going to do it,'' McConnell
said. ``I hope we can reach a consensus where the NAACP ... will
decide that conciliation, rather than confrontation, is better for
all of us on this.''

   A jet that landed here slightly more than 36
hours after it took off unofficially broke the speed record for an
eastbound, around-the-world voyage, company officials said.
   The 19-seat, Gulfstream IV completed the route in 36 hours, 8
minutes and 34 seconds. The jet started and ended its flight at
Houston's Hobby Airport, taking off Friday and landing Saturday
with stops in Ireland, United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Hawaii,
said Gulfstream Aerospace Co.'s chairman.
   The flight time remains unofficial until further review by the
National Aeronautics Association, which sanctions such records. An
NAA representative was on the flight.
   Allen E. Paulson and his three co-pilots flew the jet 45
minutes, 41 seconds faster than a Boeing 747-SP last month. That
747, piloted by Clay Lacy, flew around the world in 36 hours, 54
minutes and 15 seconds.
   Paulson is chairman and chief executive officer of Savannah,
Ga.-based Gulfstream.
   Paulson said he attempted the trip as a test performance for the
new jet, which had logged just 12 hours flight time before its
worldwide trip and weighs less than 77,000 pounds.
   ``The winds were cooperative, the airplane worked flawlessly and
we had it red-lined all the way,'' Paulson said.
   The average speed was 636 mph for the trip, which covered 19,988
nautical miles _ 22,986 statute miles.
   Paulson, 65, established the westbound around-the-world speed
record last year aboard another Gulfstream aircraft.

<HEAD>Critics Say Local Coverage Of Arab Protests `Sanitized'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's state-run television and radio have
been accused of playing down the extent of Palestinian unrest in
the occupied lands.
   Since the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip began,
Israeli viewers only once saw troops beat protesters and rarely see
pictures of Arabs wounded by gunfire. TV anchors often refer to the
situation as ``relatively quiet.''
   By contrast, TV viewers in the United States often see soldiers
beating Arab protesters and Palestinians who have been wounded or
killed by gunfire.
   After nearly three months of violence, U.N. figures show 74
Arabs have died in rioting, mostly by Israeli gunfire.
   There appear to be three reasons for the low-key coverage in
Israel: concerns that too much publicity will encourage Arab
protesters and spark more violence; ``patriotic journalism,'' or
the reluctance to report stories that weaken the morale of
soldiers, and, in some cases, official censorship.
   ``If I compare the reports we are getting from around the world
to what the Israeli people are watching, it looks like we are
talking about two different places,'' said Israel Peleg, a former
member of the Israel Broadcast Authority's board of directors.
   The Israel Broadcast Authority which runs television and radio
barred this reporter from interviewing broadcast journalists.
   But Yair Stern, head of the TV's news division, said the
coverage was considered too critical by many Israelis. ``If the
action is tough, we get up to 100 calls a night, most from people
who say they don't want to see this or want us to be more favorable
to the government,'' he said.
   Stern rejected charges that TV intentionally soft-pedaled bad
news. He acknowledged the station had only once shown soldiers
beating Palestinians, but cited as the reason lack of footage, not
censorship.
   The footage of the only beating shown was provided by CBS
television and showed soldiers kicking and hitting with rocks two
bound Arabs in the West Bank city of Nablus last week.
   But Israeli editors cut the most gruesome scenes, including one
in which a soldier who seemed to be breaking the arms of one of the
Arabs.
   Israel radio quoted Uri Porat, the director-general of the
Israel Broadcast Authority, as saying the scenes were deleted
because of a television ban on showing atrocities and because some
viewers might not be mature enough to deal with such images.
   In defending the coverage, Stern said Israel TV tried to present
longer background pieces, while American networks ``collect the
highlight of action from here and there, and then wrap it up in 50
seconds. That's why the impression in America is of violence, and
only violence.''
   But several Israeli print journalists rejected those
explanations. Israeli newspapers cover the Arab protests much more
aggressively than television and radio, and have broken several
stories about army brutality, including an incident in which
soldiers allegedly buried alive four Arabs after a protest.
   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper described the television and radio
coverage as ``vegetarian, sterile.''
   ``They have this long-winded piece that there were disturbances,
and then you hear five people were badly wounded,'' said Ari Rath,
managing editor of the English-language Jerusalem Post.
   In an editorial, he complained of a ``new clean language by
Israel's radio and television that calls major clashes between
civilians and troops ... mere `disturbances.'''
   Rath said he didn't know of widespread official censorship but
said some broadcast journalists apparently held back on their own.
``In part, it could be a subconscious self-defense to an
increasingly embarrassing and painful situation,'' Rath said. ``You
try not to call a spade a spade.''
   Peleg, a former director of the government press office, added:
``The self-restraint in Israel TV has reached a point where there
is no need for censorship or political interference.''

<HEAD>Heimlich Uses Malaria To Treat Cancer, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Henry Heimlich, the physician who developed
a maneuver to save choking victims, is trying to treat cancer
patients in Mexico by deliberately giving them malaria, a newspaper
reported.
   Heimlich has treated three people at a Mexico City hospital
since December by infecting them with a non-lethal strain of
malaria on the belief that the 103- to 104-degree fever produced by
the disease kills cancer cells, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer said
Sunday.
   Heimlich, 67, believes that malaria, in addition to killing
cancer through fever, can stimulate the body's natural immune
system to fight cancer.
   Malaria is an infection caused by parasitic microorganisms and
is spread by mosquitoes. It causes high fevers, sweats and chills.
   Some medical researchers say Heimlich's procedures should be
tested first on laboratory animals and tissue cultures. They also
said they were skeptical about the quality of cancer research in
Mexico.
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials said Heimlich's
so-called ``malariatherapy'' was ``not an acceptable treatment or
therapy.''
   George Blatt, director of the health fraud unit in FDA's drug
evaluation and research center, said Mexico was more lenient than
the United States ``in what they allow in the practice of
medicine.''
   ``Most of what we call quack clinics are not prohibited in
Mexico,'' Blatt said.
   Heimlich, contacted Sunday at his home in Cincinnati, said that
describing his work as ``south-of-the-border research ... is
despicable.'' He said cancer research regulations in Mexico were
more stringent than those in the United States.
   ``We had conferences with the very highest levels of (Mexico's)
government and very careful protocol was laid out to protect the
rights, choice and selection of patients, much, much more than is
required in this country,'' said Heimlich, a professor at Xavier
University in Cincinnati and head of the Heimlich Institute.
   The first patient was given the non-lethal strain of malaria,
Plasmodium vivax, on Dec. 23. She was a 27-year-old woman dying of
rectal cancer. Two others, men in their 50s, were given malaria in
January, the newspaper reported.
   Heimlich said he developed his theories after he said studies
showed that Third World nations with high malaria rates had low
incidences of cancer.
   Officials of the American Cancer Society and the federal
government's National Cancer Institute said they had never heard of
the malaria therapy, according to the newspaper.

   Donald Kaschalk has had fewer birthdays than any
of his seven children.
   ``My youngest boy is 19, and I'm just going to celebrate my 14th
birthday,'' says the East Detroit milkman, who was born on Leap Day
in 1932.
   Like other folks born on Feb. 29, Kaschalk's actual birthday
rolls around only once every four years. It's a studder step in
time that compensates for the 365\ days it takes the Earth to orbit
the sun.
   The U.S. Census Bureau estimates about 9,600 babies were born in
the United States on Feb. 29, 1984, and a similar number of infants
should be born today.
   ``It's truly delightful,'' said Ypsilanti businessman Peter
Fletcher, who was born the same day as Kaschalk. ``The common
reaction is one of sympathy and lament because you don't have a
frequent natal commemoration.
   ``But that very streak of sympathy provokes people to make it
even more memorable. When I was in my callow youth, people would
try to compensate for it by having a veritable spate of shivarees
and celebrations for me.''
   Jason Weiner, who's celebrating birthday No. 3 though he turned
12 today, takes it all in stride.
   ``It's OK, I guess,'' said the sixth-grader at Maple Elementary
School in Walled Lake.
   ``This is his third birthday,'' said Jason's mom, Joyce Weiner.
``We used to celebrate it on the 28th (of February), but the last
few years he's said he wants to celebrate it on March 1.''
   The traditional observance of leap year began in 46 B.C. when
Julius Caesar adopted the Egyptian calendar and the Western world
began counting years with 365\ days each.
   The added day every fourth year keeps the Earth's calendar in
line with the sun's rotation.

<TEXT>
   Residents of the rural valley where
Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham grew up find it hard to believe he has
done anything wrong, no matter that he has been indicted and
impeached.
   The dairy farmer's son who left the Uintah Basin when he joined
the Army Air Corps in 1943 was industrious and studious, kind of
quiet and a model citizen, neighbors and relatives recall.
   ``We can't believe he isn't a good man and see no reason for
impeachment. I've not found anybody who couldn't praise Evan and
his integrity,'' said Birdie Swasey, a retired teacher who has
known the Mecham family since the Great Depression.
   Beverly Fieldsted, who was one year behind Evan in school and
whose brother-in-law lives in the former Mecham residence down the
road in Mount Emmons, agrees.
   ``They were not a crooked family. Evan didn't steal money,'' she
said. ``He worked hard on the farm, he went to school, he minded
his own business, he wasn't a smart-alecky, showy kid.''
   While defending Mecham's integrity, Mrs. Swasey acknowledged
that the governor, whose impeachment trial was scheduled to begin
today, may have spoken carelessly at times.
   ``I suppose he's not a politician. He may have spoken quickly.
You have to learn the rules of society, be sophisticated ... you
can't be naive like a child and say everything that pops into your
head,'' she said.
   Mecham and his family occasionally return to this expansive
valley along the south slope of the Uinta Mountains to visit
relatives, who remain supportive.
   ``I hate to see them treat him so badly,'' said Edith Burton,
Mecham's aunt. ``I just stopped listening to the news because it
made me feel bad. I knew much of it wasn't true.''
   Mecham said recently that his home country was ``the greatest
place to grow up. I always apologize to my children that I raised
them in the city and not in a place like that.''
   Mecham's father, Adelbert, settled in Mountain Home in 1908 and
married Ina Hanberg there in 1916. Evan, the fifth of six children,
was born May 12, 1924.
   When Evan was 12, the family moved to Mount Emmons, where they
had a ``humble home,'' a dairy, ran a store and raised a few crops,
the governor said. ``We didn't have much, but we weren't poor. I've
never felt poor in my life.''
   Being a dairy farmer's son during the Depression and early war
years forged Evan's character, including those traits responsible
for his current problems, friends said.
   ``He's never been a quitter,'' said his cousin, Ona Rust.
``That's why he's hanging in there now to clear his name.''
   In 1942, 18-year-old Evan took over most farm duties when his
father became incapacitated by rheumatoid arthritis. Evan was
forced to cut back on schoolwork, but kept up his grades and earned
an agricultural scholarship to Utah State University.
   He had a reputation of someone who always worked hard to get
what he got, said former neighbor Harry Fieldsted, adding, ``I
don't know if he was any smarter, but he seemed to apply himself
more.''
   Mecham sang and danced at Mormon Church functions and was
elected student body president his junior year at Altamont High
School, though he was kidded about his shyness in the 1941 yearbook.
   Mecham's date at the Altamont junior prom, Florence Lambert,
became his wife, and they later had seven children. The couple
settled in Arizona after World War II, when Mecham studied business
at Arizona State University and became an auto dealer.

   Smoke in the cockpit of a Chicago-bound
Midway Airlines jet forced its pilot to make an unscheduled landing
here, officials said.
   No injuries were reported among the 119 passengers and five crew
members aboard Flight 793, which originated in Tampa, authorities
said.
   Sunday's landing of the Boeing-737 was a precautionary measure,
said V.H. Steed of the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   The smoke was created by an electrical problem, said Sandra
Allen, director of corporate communications for the Chicago-based
Midway Airlines.
   Passenger Jon Klank, 24, of Glen Ellyn, Ill., said he was
sleeping when the plane started to descend to Gainesville Regional
Airport.
   ``I woke up when the ladies next to me started crying,'' he said.
   Midway treated the passengers to lunch while they awaited
another jet to take them to Chicago.

<HEAD>Dollar And Stocks Close Lower In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index ended 13
consecutive days of gains today, edging down in moderate trading,
while the dollar stayed within a narrow range after opening lower
against the Japanese yen.
   Dealers said many participants stayed away from the stock
exchange in anticipation of a market correction following the
string of gains. After rising 119.69 points during Saturday's
half-day session, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at
25,242.81, down 42.06 points or 0.2 percent.
   ``Such a small decline has almost no meaning,'' said Kunihiro
Ono of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage. ``It was just
a reaction to 13 straight days of increases.''
   ``The market is taking a respite which many participants had
expected for some time,'' said another analyst who spoke on
condtion of anonymity.
   During the previous 13 trading days, the Nikkei index had risen
a total of 1,622.60 points or 7 percent. It just missed matching a
record 14 consecutive days of gains set in early 1961.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at
128.08 yen, down 0.27 yen from Friday's close of 128.35 yen. It
edged down briefly to 127.95 yen, its first trip below the 128-yen
level in about three weeks, before ending the day at 128.12, down
0.23 yen. Spot volume was a light $4.1 billion.
   ``Sentiment toward the dollar is bearish, and the market is
still searching for its (the dollar's) down side,'' said a trader
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said speculators had tried
to sell the U.S. currency lower, but had bought back some dollars
in the afternoon to cover dollar-short positions.
   Traders said the dollar's decline was being slowed by fears of
possible market intervention by the Bank of Japan below the 128-yen
level, profit-taking by speculators, and light activity by
commercial dollar-sellers.
   But a senior trader at a commercial bank, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the Bank of Japan was unlikely to
intervene unless the dollar began falling at a faster pace below
the 127.5-yen level.
   Satoshi Sumita, Bank of Japan governor, said today the central
bank would continue to move ``flexibly'' in money markets.
   In a speech to businessmen, he cautioned against a further
decline in the dollar, which he said would have negative effects on
the U.S. economy, including possible inflation, stock market
instability and a slowdown in foreign money flowing to the United
States.

   Carbon monoxide fumes apparently
from a gas heater killed four children ranging from ages 6 to 12
and their teen-age baby sitter, police said.
   ``It's absolutely the worst multiple death case in one family
that we've had in Clay County,'' said Sheriff's Lt. Tim Martin.
   ``Ultimately, what has happened was, we feel, a faulty exhaust
on a gas furnace became clogged and the carbon monoxide fumes were
allowed to back up and disperse through the house,'' he said
Saturday.
   Ola Weerts and a friend had left the children with a baby sitter
and went to dinner. When they returned about midnight Friday, the
baby sitter and three of the children were dead, Martin said.
   The only survivor was Tanya Weerts, 12, who was taken
unconscious to Shands Hospital in nearby Gainesville. She died
Saturday evening.
   Pronounced dead at Mrs. Weerts' home here were two other
children, 10-year-old James and 6-year-old Sherri. Mrs. Weerts'
friend's granddaughter, Julie Meador, 10, and baby sitter Jennifer
Bias, 17, were also dead, Martin said.
   ``They were all in their beds, apparently sleeping except for
one 10-year-old on the kitchen floor,'' he said. Ms. Bias was found
on a living room sofa.
   Autopsies on the others showed they died of acute carbon
monoxide poisoning, according to the medical examiner.

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports that condoms were discovered in
some milk products of Steffen Dairy Foods Co. were a hoax to
defraud the company and not a case of tampering at the plant,
police say.
   Four people have been arrested on charges of felony theft and
conspiracy to commit felony theft, police Capt. John Dotson said
Saturday. More suspects were being sought, he said.
   ``Reports by four people of condoms in their milk was a hoax,''
Dotson said. ``There is no tampering of products at Steffen.''
   Steffen recalled about 10,000 quart and half-gallon cardboard
milk cartons Wednesday after four reports about unpackaged condoms
in the milk. The company received a fifth report last week, but
that was retracted, Dotson said.

   A law school graduate out to celebrate
after taking the Florida Bar examination was shot to death as he
drove along Interstate 95, police said.
   Friends following Irv Ribler's sports car told police the single
shot was fired from a van whose occupants had just thrown a small
object at the car, but that was unconfirmed, Broward County
Sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal said Sunday.
   ``Right now, we're just hoping someone will come forward who saw
what happened. Somebody had to. There was a lot of traffic out
there,'' Leljedal said of the shooting at dusk Saturday in
unincorporated Broward County.
   After Ribler, 26, was shot just below his left shoulder, his car
sped across the median, three lanes of oncoming traffic and then
plowed into a gully. He was pronounced dead within the hour at
Broward Medical Center.
   No other cars hit his and no other injuries were reported.
   Zaida Ribler, who cleaned houses and worked as a tailor seven
days a week to put her only child through Florida State University
and the University of Miami Law School, said her son was going to a
party in nearby Delray Beach.
   ``He left me a note before he left Saturday,'' she said Sunday
from her home here, about 15 miles north of Miami. ``It says, `Mom,
see you in the morning. I love you. Irv.'
   ``He was a good son. He studied so hard. He worked in the yard.
He cleaned the house. He didn't drink,'' his mother said. ``Now my
life has ended. Everything is over.''
   Ribler graduated from law school last May and had since failed
the bar exam. Since then, he had studied constantly. After taking
the test in Tampa on Wednesday, he was elated _ certain he had
passed, friends said.
   ``His whole life was centered on passing the bar and working as
a public defender,'' said classmate Manny Fernandez, 24. ``He had
some offers. He was almost there.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A journalist for more than 45 years, Newsday
columnist Murray Kempton was given a special citation as Long
Island University announced its George Polk Awards in Journalism.
   ``Kempton has represented the highest standards of the
profession,'' said the university as awards in 14 categories were
announced Sunday.
   ``Whether covering U.S. presidents, civil rights activists, or
even gangland figures, he has demonstrated the tough-mindedness,
courage, and sensitivity that are in the best tradition of the Long
Island University Polk Awards,'' the statement said.
   Kempton, 70, was given a career award, presented occasionally to
honor a body of work.
   Two Wall Street Journal reporters, James B. Stewart and Daniel
Hertzberg, were chosen to receive a financial reporting award for
coverage of the October stock market crash. A nominating committee
member praised the ``rigor, depth and range'' of their reporting.
   The Polk awards, among the nation's most coveted journalistic
prizes, are presented each year at a luncheon at the Hotel
Roosevelt in Manhattan. This year's awards will be presented March
30.
   Roger Rosenblatt of Time magazine won his second Polk award for
magazine reporting. Rosenblatt's ```Day in the Life of the Soviet
Union'' went beyond the commonplace accounts of the country's
political and military politics, treatment of political leaders,
and customary assessments of dissident movements, the university
said.
   In a departure from the norm, the committee selected two major
news organizations _ rather than an individual person or story _ as
its winners in political reporting and network television reporting.
   Knight-Ridder's Washington Bureau received the political
reporting award for what the university said was the general
excellence of its political coverage and its particularly effective
reporting on the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Cable News Network received the award for network television
reporting for the ``excellence of its around-the-clock,
seven-days-a-week, 52-weeks-a-year coverage of the news.''
   Other awards:
   _Foreign Reporting: Nora Boustany of The Washington Post for
coverage of the plight of Palestinian refugees and the trauma of
Beirut.
   _National Reporting: Mike Masterson, Chuck Cook and Mark N.
Trahant of the Arizona Republic for a 30-story series, ``Fraud in
Indian Country,'' on mismanagement and corruption involving the
Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.
   _Metropolitan Reporting: The Charlotte Observer for more than
500 stories, with repeated revelations, on the Jim Bakker and PTL
scandal.
   _Local Reporting: Ron Ridenhour of the New Orleans CityBusiness,
a biweekly newspaper, for a yearlong investigation of a city tax
scandal.
   _Sports Reporting: Chris Mortensen of the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution for ``Ignoring the Rules,'' a 110-story report on the
subversion of amateurism by sports agents and college athletes.
   _Science Reporting: Science News, published by Science Service
Inc., for comprehensive and reliable coverage of the latest
research in all branches of science.
   _Foreign Television Reporting: Gordon Manning of NBC for his
role in bringing to the network and public two major projects,
``Changing China'' and ``A Conversation with Mikhail Gorbachev.''
   _Local Television Reporting: Margie Nichols of WSMV-TV,
Nashville, Tenn., for ``A Premium Price'' and ``Little Assurance,''
an investigation of insurance fraud that preys on senior citizens.
   _Radio Reporting: Larry Bensky of Pacifica Radio for his
multiple roles as organizer, anchor and commentator for Pacifica's
gavel-to-gavel coverage of the Iran-Contra hearings.
   The awards were established by LIU in 1949, the year after Polk,
a CBS news correspondent, was slain while covering the Greek civil
war.

   The Winter Olympics' flame, which was
lighted in Greece and traversed some of the most rugged terrain by
helicopter, dogsled, snowshoes and skis, was extinguished beneath a
nearly full moon in Calgary.
   With 60,000 people present, athletes from 57 countries marched
in to McMahon Stadium for Sunday night's closing ceremonies
carrying miniature Olympic torches. Banners reading ``Until We Meet
Again'' in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands.
   About 250 skaters took to the world's largest temporary ice rink
in period costumes depicting the history of figure skating as a
high-tech array of thousands of lights glistened off sequined
costumes, flags and flame.
   The skaters included past and present medal winners as well as
young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992 Winter
Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer Games.
   ``These have been wonderful games,'' declared Frank King, whose
title is chief executive officer of Calgary games' organizing
committee.
   For the United States, however, the Winter Games was the worst
showing in 52 years. Two of the six U.S. medals were gold medals,
won by Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed
skating. Blair also won a bronze in speed skating, making her
America's only double winner.
   The Soviets finished first in number of gold medals, with 11,
and total medals, with 29, a record. East Germany's athletes won
nine golds, 25 overall; while Switzerland's team came in third in
gold medals, five, and overall medals, 15.
   Four other teams also did better than the United States in terms
of overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the
Netherlands.
   In 1936, the United States won just four medals, but only 51
were available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.

<TEXT>
   Take note of today, Monday _ there won't be
another like it until 1992.
   It's leap year, when a day which seems to come from nowhere is
added to February and the year is 366 days long instead of 365.
   The astronomers of Julius Caesar in 46 B.C. decided it.
   They said that as the solar year was 365 days and 6 hours, the
hours made an extra day every four years.
   Why leap?
   The Oxford English Dictionary says _ and you may have to read
this twice _ that the year probably got its name because any fixed
festival after February in such a year ``falls on the next weekday
but one to that on which it fell in the preceding year, not on the
next weekday as usual.''
   A leaping over day, you see.
   According to popular tradition in Britain, a woman on this day
has the right to ask a man to marry her, instead of the other way
round.
   English folklore has it that any woman having her Feb. 29
proposal rebuffed can claim a silk dress from the man.
   In 1288 a law was enacted in Scotland to give women the right to
propose on Feb. 29. It said any maiden lady ``shall hae liberte to
bespeke ye man she likes.''
   If the man refused, he had to pay the lady a pound _ a lot of
money in those days _ unless he could claim he was already
betrothed.
   A few years later, France passed a simliar law and it was also
legalized in the 15th century in the Italian cities of Genoa and
Florence.
   A British romantic fiction publisher named Silhouette, seeking
to find out modern manners of proposing, asked the Gallup Poll to
include a leap year question in its survey.
   The poll found that women who propose to the man of their dreams
on Feb. 29 have a 92 percent chance of success.
   But only 12 percent of the women questioned for the survey _ it
didn't say how many _ responded that they would seriously consider
popping the question on this day.
   Jane Ellison, a columnist on a London daily, The Independent,
asked today: ``How many men are worth waiting four years to propose
to these days?''
   Ms. Ellison suggested using leap year ``sensibly'' by relocating
those ``annual events you dread'' to Feb. 29.
   Among her choices: the University Boat Race, the next Andrew
Lloyd Webber musical and Christmas.

   To the state, John Gacy is a sex murderer many
times over who deserves to die. To Sue Terry, he's ``a real nice
person'' she'd like to marry.
   Ms. Terry came to this feeling by exchanging letters during the
last 16 months and through repeated visits to Gacy at Menard
Correctional Center, where he's on death row for murdering 33 young
men and boys.
   Most of the victims were buried in the crawl space under his
home northwest of Chicago.
   Excerpts of some of Gacy's 41 letters to the 43-year-old
Centralia woman from Oct. 5, 1986, to Feb. 16 were published Sunday
and today in the Chicago Sun-Times.
   She said Gacy, 45, expects to be paroled and she believes he's
innocent of the sex killings.
   Gacy is under 12 separate death sentences and 21 terms of
natural life in prison with no hope of parole.
   ``We're real close,'' she said. ``I like John, and he trusts me.
I guess I love him. Yes.''
   Ms. Terry, a divorced mother of eight children who is also
helping to raise two grandchildren, said Gacy has asked her to
marry him. She said she would.
   ``I was gullible and trusted others. That's how I got where I am
today,'' Gacy wrote in one letter published today. ``I could lay
back and say it's not my fault I am here, because I know I never
killed anyone. The facts will back me up. But I am guilty of being
gullible and trusting others, so I belong here for letting myself
down.''
   Gacy also wrote of how he cried watching the Olympics and the
devotion of the athletes; he scolded Ms. Terry for not selling any
of his oil paintings; and he told of how he was going to run a
strict household for Ms. Terry's children when he gets out of
prison and they all live together.
   However, attorney Terry Sullivan, who prosecuted Gacy, said he
``is more likely to be executed than paroled.''
   Ms. Terry said she first met Gacy at Menard in August 1986,
seven months after she first wrote him a brief note.
   ``I decided to go back because, well, he's real nice. ... He's a
real nice person and he seems to be really concerned about me and
my kids.''

<TEXT>
   Cardinal Bernard F. Law says the Roman Catholic
church has been guilty of racism and has put `horrendous
obstacles'' in the way of black Catholics.
   At a special Mass Sunday where more than 1,000 black Catholics
celebrated the past and future of blacks in the Boston Archdiocese,
the Boston archbishop said the ``faith of black Catholics has been
tremendously tested by the church, which put such horrendous
obstacles in their way. But the faith endured even under the most
extraordinarily difficult circumstances.''
   Following the Mass, which also marked Black History Month, Law
said, ``Racism is not conquered, not here or anywhere else. But
what we're seeing is a very positive sign.
   ``Racism is a sin. It offends God. The church is made up of
sinners, not saints, and one of the church's sins has been racism.
For that we are repentant.''
   There are an estimated 25,000 blacks among the 1.9 million
Catholics in the Boston Archdiocese.
   The Mass at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross featured the singing
of hymns by soloists Meyer Chambers, Philiss Baker and Denise
Graves.
   ``We're so accustomed to holding back in the Catholic church,
but today was a chance to live our own heritage, to open up,''
Chambers said. ``It's been a long time coming.''

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines' 6,700 flight
attendants continued to keep the carrier guessing today on whether
they will strike, three days after a union deadline for reaching a
new contract.
   Both sides in the labor talks said just one issue divided them.
But William Genoese, international director of the Teamsters
union's airline division, said late Sunday that no further
negotiations were scheduled.
   ``At this moment we're in strike position. It can happen two
minutes from now or any other time. Under the law, we have that
right,'' Genoese said.
   He said absenteeism had increased among flight attendants.
   ``They are calling in sick. It's on the increase,'' Genoese
said. But he declined to categorize the absences as a negotiating
tactic, saying, ``I'm not going to say that.''
   Representatives of the airline and the union met with a federal
mediator for four hours Sunday and agreed on all but one contract
issue, said Northwest spokesman William Wren. Wren and Genoese said
the issue is Northwest's proposal to increase from five to nine
years the period that newly hired workers stay on a lower pay scale.
   Genoese said he sent a telegram to Steven G. Rothmeier, chairman
and chief executive officer of NWA Inc., the parent company of
Northwest, requesting a meeting. Wren said late Sunday he did not
know if Rothmeier knew of the request.
   Northwest officials said Sunday the airline continued to operate
a normal flight schedule. No delays were reported at airports
served by the carrier.
   If flight attendants do strike, the airline said it will keep
flying, using about 2,000 managers trained as flight attendants
were and 200 newly hired replacements.
   Genoese said he planned to meet today with representatives of
the pilots and machinists on whether they would honor flight
attendant picket lines.
   A strike deadline late Friday was extended as the two sides
continued negotiations that began Wednesday. Genoese said Saturday
night that a request by the federal mediator to delay a strike
helped avert a walkout earlier in the day.
   Former Republic Airlines flight attendants have been working
under their old contract since Northwest acquired Republic in 1986,
and many of them are paid less than their Northwest counterparts.
   The company, the nation's fifth-largest airline, is trying to
bring the workers under one contract and offered to bring former
Republic employees up to the salary levels of Northwest employees.
But the union claimed the airline wanted too much in exchange,
including cuts in vacation pay and retirement benefits.

   In a sun-dappled forest on the outskirts of
Geneva, a Soviet negotiator and his American counterpart meet to
discuss, among other things, the nuclear arms race and the fate of
the world.
   They are a diplomatic odd couple. The Russian, Andrey Botvinnik,
is gregarious, impulsive and almost childlike in his enthusiasm for
the frivolous. The American, John Honeyman, is officious,
humorless, a bit priggish and irritatingly sincere about his new
job as the U.S. representative to the arms control talks.
   Their one-on-one marathon conversations make up Lee Blessing's
``A Walk in the Woods,'' a wise and witty evening of theater that
arrived Sunday at Broadway's Booth Theater.
   The Russian wants to discuss country music, Italian suits and
making love to red-haired women. He wants a pal, not protocol.
``Formality is simply anger with its hair combed,'' he coos.
   The earnest American wants to steer the talk back to the
negotiations. He wants results. ``Friendship,'' he says, ``takes
you away from commitment to solving problems.''
   The two-character play was inspired by a true incident in 1982
involving American arms adviser Paul Nitze and a Soviet negotiator.
Blessing takes their real-life rustic ramble and embellishes on it,
transforming their meeting into a theatrical situation laced with
humor, grace and intelligence.
   Some two-person plays are like tennis matches. They are made up
of relentless back-and-forth banter that exhausts the audience
without leading anywhere. ``A Walk in the Woods'' has its share of
volleys and it dallies a bit, particularly in the second act.
Still, it manages to make its point about the need to keep trying
for peace, with a minimum of preaching.
   In part, the play succeeds because Blessing refrains from
overloading the evening with technical jargon and anti-war sermons.
There may be references to MX missiles, megadeaths, Star Wars,
bargaining chips, lasers and Afghanistan, but the emphasis is on
the men, not specific ways of averting nuclear destruction.
   By the time the two diplomats have walked through these woods
during four different seasons, they have grown to understand and
even like each other. That knowledge comes at the same time they
realize their two countries, while proclaiming interest in peace,
have little desire to slow down the arms race.
   If that makes the play sound unusually somber, it isn't. ``A
Walk in the Woods'' has its share of belly laughs, most of them
supplied by Robert Prosky, best known as Sgt. Jablonski on
television's ``Hill Street Blues.'' He's a big, beefy actor who
inhabits the very soul of the Soviet diplomat and who even
negotiates a convincing Russian accent. But the character's
joviality masks a cynicism fed by too many years at the bargaining
table. ``If mankind hated war, there would be millions of us and
only two soldiers,'' he says.
   Sam Waterston, as the somber American, plays straight man to
Prosky, except for one wonderful comic monologue in the second act
when he explains what happened after he threw a gum wrapper on
Switzerland's spotless soil. But for much of the time, this
reliable actor is left to deliver conventional, present-day
attitudes on the horrors of the arms race. It's to Waterston's
credit that he makes them seem part of his character's idealistic
beliefs rather than soapbox oratory.
   The play has been directed by Des McAnuff in an understated
manner with movement kept to a minimum. For a good deal of the
evening, the two actors just sit on a park bench set squarely in
the center of a woodsy glade designed by Bill Clarke and washed in
a delicate light by Richard Riddell.
   Rich-looking earth nearly spills into the first few rows of the
theater and a forest of trees soars to the top of the proscenium
arch. It's an inviting, tranquil setting, the perfect place to
ruminate on what would be lost if the two superpowers didn't
continue their walks in the woods.
   In other reviews:
   The New York Times' Frank Rich offered guarded praise for the
actors' work and called the set _ with the trees changing with the
seasons _ ``pretentious.'' Rich said the play ``fudges the
distinctions of actual international politics and arms negotiation,
choosing instead to telescope the messy, life-or-death conflict
into a sentimental relationship between two likable envoys.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel roundly praised Waterston and
Prosky. ``It is Waterston's most moving work in years,'' he wrote.
``It is hard to imagine a more perfect actor to play the wily
Soviet.''
   Said Kissel, ``A few times the play seems coy or tendentious,
but the two are so powerful we never forget it's about frail men
fighting quixotically against their awareness of futility.''

   The protesters, marching four in a row, walked toward Parliament
from St. George's Cathedral, where Tutu and other clergymen had
declared the churches would have to lead the protests against the
government's anti-apartheid policies because 18 major opposition
groups had been banned last week from all political activity.
   Tutu marched in front of the procession, along with the Rev.
Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
and the Catholic Bishop of Cape Town, Stephen Naidoo.
   At the end of each row were clergymen; lay people who had
attended the service were in the middle. Tutu had warned the
protesters during the church service in the cathedral that they
might be tear-gassed, sprayed with watter cannon or arrested.

   Before starting the march, Tutu told the service, ``We have
gathered here as an active witness and out of protest against what
the South African government did last week. We intend after this
very short service to walk to Parliament to present a petition.''
   He said the intention was not to provoke police and if the march
was stopped the participants should kneel down.
   The petition, addressed to President P.W. Botha and Parliament,
said:
   ``We leaders of a number of South African churches have come to
Parliament today to witness and pray in a time of crisis outside
the buildings in which you make important decisions affecting the
lives of millions of South Africans who belong to our churches. In
terms of the principles of non-violent direct action, we informed
the government of our intention before coming here.''

   The Winter Olympics' flame, which was
lighted in Greece and traversed some of the most rugged terrain by
helicopter, dogsled, snowshoes and skis, was extinguished beneath a
nearly full moon in Calgary.
   With 60,000 people present, athletes from 57 countries marched
in to McMahon Stadium for Sunday night's closing ceremonies
carrying miniature Olympic torches. Banners reading ``Until We Meet
Again'' in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands.
   About 250 skaters took to the world's largest temporary ice rink
in period costumes depicting the history of figure skating as a
high-tech array of thousands of lights glistened off sequined
costumes, flags and flame.
   The skaters included past and present medal winners as well as
young skaters from Albertville, France, site of the 1992 Winter
Games, and Seoul, South Korea, site of this year's summer Games.
   ``These have been wonderful games,'' declared Frank King, whose
title is chief executive officer of Calgary games' organizing
committee.
   For the United States, however, the Winter Games was the worst
showing in 52 years. Two of the six U.S. medals were gold medals,
won by Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed
skating. Blair also won a bronze in speed skating, making her
America's only double winner.
   The Soviets finished first in number of gold medals, with 11,
and total medals, with 29, a record. East Germany's athletes won
nine golds, 25 overall; while Switzerland's team came in third in
gold medals, five, and overall medals, 15.
   Four other teams also did better than the United States in terms
of overall medals: Austria, West Germany, Finland and the
Netherlands.
   In 1936, the United States won just four medals, but only 51
were available then. This time, 138 medals were handed out.

   Curly's skin-pated look-alike mingled with
the crowd while Three Stooges devotees watched old films and ducked
flying pies.
   From as far as California, at least 1,000 fans of the celebrated
knuckleheads came to Maine for a weekend of _ nyuk, nyuk _
Stoogemania, Ron Eugley, one of the convention's organizers, said
Sunday.
   A Stooge trivia contest was in progress when the pie fight _ a
highlight of the event _ broke out.
   ``I was emcee and I didn't even get a chance to close my eyes,''
said Joe Jerrier, 37, a firefighter from Gardiner, Maine. ``I got
four of 'em.''
   ``I've loved Larry, Moe and Curly ever since I was 5 years
old,'' said Virginia Riviera, 30, who came with two friends from
Salem, Mass.
   They and others swapped memorabilia and watched such films as
``Three Little Pigskins,'' ``All the World's a Stooge,'' ``Dizzy
Doctors'' and ``Disorder in the Court.''
   Curly impersonator David Knight, an iron worker from Palmyra,
N.Y., tweaked ears but generally restrained himself from
head-knocking, eye-poking and face-slapping. Those were some of the
slapstick hallmarks of the trio that made more than 190 short films
and about 50 feature-length films until the '60s.
   Morris ``Moe'' Horowitz, who later changed his last name to
Howard, died in 1975; his brother Samuel ``Shemp,'' and Larry
Fineberg died earlier, as did Jerome ``Curly,'' another Horowitz
brother who replaced Shemp as a result of a pay dispute.

   Why is there a three-story, $8,000 stained
glass window 10 yards from the odor control tank at a sewage
pumping station near Fisherman's Wharf?
   The window is part of the $200,000 worth of art commissioned to
decorate the city's sewage treatment plants.
   Under a 1969 ordinance, San Francisco requires contractors to
set aside up to 2 percent of every public works construction dollar
for art that is selected by the Arts Commission.
   ``Just as we need air and water, we need art and culture in our
lives. It doesn't cost any extra ... (and) it makes a facility more
enjoyable and respected,'' Jill Manton, curator of San Francisco's
public art program, said recently.
   Concrete totems, a colored geometric roof gravel design and
mosaic tile walls are other completed sewer art projects.
   The Sunnydale Pump Station near Candlestick Park is in line for
a special design to help hide the station's rooftop air ducts while
featuring a habitat for an endangered butterfly species.

   The dollar drifted lower in light European trading
early today. Gold prices also fell.
   Market sentiment for the dollar turned bearish last week when it
became clear that the currency could not hold the 1.70-level
against the West German mark, said a trader in Frankfurt.
   But overall the market lacked direction, and the dollar was
fluctuating within a narrow range, traders said.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe compared with rates late
Friday:
   _ 1.6869 West German marks, down from 1.6895
   _ 1.3888 Swiss francs, down from 1.3897
   _ 5.7095 French francs, down from 5.7175
   _ 1.8941 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8965
   _ 1,243.20 Italian lire, down from 1,245.45
   _ 1.2639 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2838
   The British pound edged up to $1.7740 from $1.7715.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 128.12 Japanese yen, down from
128.35 yen on Friday. In later London trading today, the dollar was
quoted at 128.28 yen.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $423.75 a troy ounce, down from an opening bid of
$428 and Friday's closing rate of $431.50. A trader said gold came
under heavy selling pressure, but he was unsure why.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $424.20, down from $431.50.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $430.19, down
from $430.34 on Saturday.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $6.10 a troy
ounce, down from $6.20 late Friday.

   The Northwest basked in record-high temperatures while the East
shivered and showers and thunderstorms doused parts of California
and Texas today.
   Cloudiness enshrouded the lower Great Lakes region, resulting in
widely scattered snow showers. Isolated rain showers were common in
the Rocky Mountain region.
   Temperature records established Sunday included 66 degrees in

   Cloudiness extended from the northern Ohio Valley to the West
Coast. Advisories for dense fog were in effect this morning for
southern and central Louisiana and parts of southeast Texas.
   Temperatures were generally below freezing this morning in the
nation's midsection, dropping to the teens in eastern New York
state and northern New England and to single digits in northern
Maine.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from California and Oregon across Nevada and Arizona to Utah and
southern Idaho and as far south as the central Gulf Coast; and snow
or snow showers from northern New England across New York state to
the central Appalachians.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s from New England across the
northern and central Appalachians and the Great Lakes region to the
upper Mississippi Valley and the Dakotas; teens and 20s in northern
Maine, the northern Great Lakes and northern Minnesota; 60s and 70s
from the south Atlantic states across the Gulf Coast states, the
southern Plains, much of New Mexico and parts of Arizona to the
West Coast states; some 80s in southern portions of Texas and
Arizona and 40s and 50s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees below zero at Houlton, Maine, to 71 degrees at Laredo,
Texas.

<TEXT>
   A Pakistani delegation left for
Geneva today for what could be the conclusive round of peace talks
on Afghanistan as the Islamabad government hastened efforts to
reach a consensus on its position.
   Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo spent the weekend consulting
Cabinet ministers and opposition lawmakers over whether to couple a
Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan with the formation of an
interim Kabul government.
   He convened a closed joint session of Parliament to debate the
issue Sunday night and was scheduled to hold another Cabinet
meeting today.
   ``We will contribute positively to the talks in accordance with
the aspirations of our people,'' the state minister for foreign
affairs, Zain Noorani, said today as he prepared to depart from
Islamabad airport as head of the Pakistani delegation.
   On Wednesday, it is to begin working out the final details of a
Soviet troop withdrawal indirectly with Kabul's communist
government.
   Informed Pakistani and foreign sources in Islamabad, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Islamabad still has not decided
whether to sign an accord with the governing People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan under its current leader, Najib.
   Moscow, which first sent troops to Afghanistan in December 1979,
announced Feb. 8 it is prepared to start pulling out its estimated
115,000 troops beginning May 15.
   However, Pakistani officials recently have insisted that a peace
accord should be accompanied by a political settlement to ensure
the safe return of about 3.5 million Afghan refugees now in
Pakistan.
   Afghan resistance leaders, headquartered in Peshawar, Pakistan,
last week proposed an interim government virtually excluding
Najib's party. Najib criticized the proposal over the weekend,
according to official radio Kabul.
   Washington, the Moslem rebels' main military backer, has said a
political accord was ``desireable'' but should not hold up the
Geneva document, which would pave the way for a Soviet pullout.
   Prime Minister Junejo has taken the unprecedented step of
calling opposition groups outside Parliament for consultations on
the issue on March 5. Minister Noorani is scheduled to return to
Islamabad for the meeting.
   Opposition leaders, including Benazir Bhutto of the Pakistan
People's Party, withheld immediate response to the invitation.
Officials of their umbrella organization, the Movement for the
Restoration of Democracy, indicated they will reply in unison.
   The hectic political activity has been typical since Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev made his dramatic Feb. 8 offer to start
bringing the Red Army home 60 days after the signing of a Geneva
accord.
   In a surprise move, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India on
Saturday invited Pakistan President Mohammad Zia ul-haq to New
Delhi to discuss the issue, but Zia declined by reversing the
invitation.
   Indian Foreign Secretary K.P.S. Menon on Tuesday will come to
Islamabad instead, it was decided.
   Pakistan based its rebuff on India's pro-Soviet stance and
Gandhi's repeated refusal to accept Zia's invitations to Islamabad.
Zia went to New Delhi in December 1985 in hopes of launching
friendship talks, but Gandhi has never reciprocated.

<HEAD>20 Soldiers Killed, Amnesty For Rebels Set To Expire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least 20 government soldiers were
killed in clashes with communist rebels, and an aide to President
Corazon Aquino said she will not extend an amnesty for communist
and Moslem rebels.
   Mrs. Aquino first made the controversial amnesty offer in
February 1987 following the breakdown of peace talks with the
communist-dominated National Democratic Front. She extended it for
another six months the following August.
   An official at the presidential palace, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the program administered by the National Economic
Development Authority would expire on schedule tonight at midnight.
   ``Rebels who will come down from the hills starting tomorrow
will be charged in court for crimes they committed,'' he said.
   The official added that rebels who had already surrendered will
continue to receive government assistance.
   The military had been unenthusiastic about the program because
senior officers complained it enabled rebels to avoid prosecution
for killing soldiers. Military dissidents arrested after previous
coup attempts also complained that they should be granted the same
amnesty as the rebels.
   Officials at the National Economic Development Authority claim
nearly 60,000 people, mostly communist rebels or their supporters,
surrendered under the amnesty program. But the authority admitted
that only 6,252 were regulars of the 23,000-strong communist New
People's Army.
   Critics of the program believe those figures are inflated.
Journalists who attended several mass surrender ceremonies found
that many of those claiming to be rebels or their supporters were
simply impoverished peasants seeking government handouts or trying
to avoid military attacks on their villages.
   As the deadline approached, it appeared the communists were
gearing up for a new round of fighting. At least 20 soldiers were
killed in scattered battles with the rebels over the weekend.
   The rebels on Sunday stormed a Philippine Constabulary
headquarters on Negros island, killing six government troopers and
looting the garrison of its weapons, the military said today.
   On Saturday, 12 elite Scout Rangers died when their truck ran
over a land mine between Guinobatan and Jovellar towns in Albay
province, 200 miles southeast of Manila.
   Troops killed four ebels in the ensuing gun battle, the military
said.
   Elsewhere, rebels killed two Philippine Constabulary sergeants
in Leyte province Saturday and soldiers killed two rebels in Bohol
province, according to military reports.

   Police in Panama briefly detained
three U.S. journalists and accused them of breaking the law by
taking a photo of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, a newspaper
reported Monday.
   La Prensa, based in Panama City, has been closed by troops and
is surrounded by city police as part of a crackdown by Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Ursula Seemann and Mike Billington of the Fort Lauderdale
News-Sun-Sentinel and Carol Morello, a reporter for the
Philadelphia Inquirer, were detained for about 45 minutes Sunday,
the News-Sun-Sentinel reported.
   Seemann had photographed the building and police surrounding it
when officers demanded her film and then ordered the three to a
local police station. The film was returned and the journalists
were released without further incident.
   On Friday, Panamanian authorities refused to admit three U.S.
journalists after they landed in a chartered plane at Omar Torrijos
International Airport in Panama City.
   Sam Dillon of The Miami Herald, his wife Julia Preston of The
Washington Post and Nicaragua-based NBC-TV producer John Siceloff
were told they could not stay because they had not announced their
arrival in advance, The Herald reported.
   In separate incidents in January, Dillon and Ms. Preston were
detained overnight after entering Panama on commericial flights and
deported the next morning.

   Carolyn Eeles of Westland filed the suit, claiming she and her
former boyfriend, James W. Renfro, had an oral agreement to share
any winnings from Lotto tickets they bought for a December 1985
drawing.
   Ingham County Circuit Judge Peter Houk upheld the claim Friday.
   Eeles's lawyer, Karl Nickolai of Highland, argued that Eeles
paid $5 to buy 10 lottery tickets Dec. 18, 1985. One of those
tickets turned out to be a jackpot winner, which Nickolai said
Renfro redeemed two days before returning to his estranged wife and
moving to Tennessee.
   Renfro testified that he bought the Lotto tickets himself, but
17 other witnesses contradicted Renfro's testimony, including some
who vouched for Eeles' claim that she and Renfro each paid $5 for
the 10 tickets and that Eeles herself picked the winning numbers.
   Renfro has collected first two installments, worth about $74,000
each after taxes, and Houk ordered him to pay Eeles half of that
sum.
   Houk also ordered that Eeles receive half of the remaining 18
payments and interest on the first two installments and that Renfro
pay her lawyer's fees.
   ``I'm thrilled, there is justice in this land,'' Eeles, 43, said
afterward. Renfro, 48, said the witnesses ``weren't telling the
truth.''

<HEAD>Aquino's Relatives Went To Hawaii To Meet With Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
she sent two relatives to meet Ferdinand Marcos in Hawaii, and her
ousted predecessor said he wanted to negotiate his return.
   Mrs. Aquino said she was not ready to let Marcos come back, but
a senator hinted Marcos may be allowed to come home if he swears
allegiance to the government and meets other terms.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno told reporters Mrs.
Aquino recently sent her uncle, Rep. Francisco Sumulong, and
cousin, Rep. Egmidio Tanjuatco, to meet with Marcos at his home in
Honolulu.
   Marcos fled the Philippines in February 1986 after a
military-civilian uprising that followed fraud-tainted presidential
elections in which both he and Mrs. Aquino claimed victory.
   ``Go there and listen. If we can listen to other people, why
can't we listen to Mr. Marcos, who said that he had an important
message to send,'' Benigno quoted Mrs. Aquino as telling her
relatives.
   Tanjuatco told The Associated Press, ``I saw Mr. Marcos in
Honolulu starting at 2 p.m. on Jan. 26. We met only once. The
meeting was between him and myself only. During the meeting, Mr.
Marcos reiterated to me his desire to return to the Philippines at
the earliest opportunity.''
   In Honolulu, where Marcos lives in exile, Marcos issued a
statement saying:
   ``We are ready to appoint our representatives to negotiate the
details and conditions under which my family and I shall return to
the Philippines for the salvation of the country from the bloody
takeover by communist insurgents.''
   The statement commended the Aquino government for inviting ``all
political factions to organize one united political structure'' and
congratulated the Aquino government for existing as long as it has.
   The Aquino government had no immediate response to the statement
from Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino has banned Marcos and his immediate family from
returning to the Philippines. Asked by reporters today whether she
would let Marcos return, Mrs. Aquino replied ``not yet.'' She
refused to elaborate.
   But Sen. Neptali Gonzales, a former justice minister in the
Aquino government, told reporters Marcos might be allowed to return
if he swears allegiance to the administration and settles claims
that he stole billions of dollars from the treasury during his
20-year rule.
   In another development, officials said they found the name
``Imelda Marcos'' on the passenger list of a flight that arrived in
Manila Saturday from Australia.
   A Marcos family spokesman said Mrs. Marcos was still in Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   Look, down on the ground! It's a bird!
It's a plane! It's an eyesore!
   It's a Stinson Reliant spotter plane, strange visitor from
another era, that now looms behind William Surgi's home.
   ``If we had really wanted to look at airplanes, we would've
moved next door to an airport,'' said Barbara Reeks. ``See how
you'd like it, day after day, out there where you have no choice
but to look at it.''
   Said her next-door neighbor, Anne Sullivan, ``What's he think
he's going to do, fly that thing out of here?''
   The single engine is missing from the plane, built in 1943 for
the Royal Canadian Air Force. The original fabric covering its
wings has been reduced to ragged strips of cloth fluttering from
the rusty steel frame.
   Surgi, 64, a retired Navy mechanic and World War II veteran,
said he is restoring the aircraft as a hobby. Until it is
airworthy, he wants to work on it behind his home.
   City officials say there's no law against that, though some
neighbors are complaining that the industrial flavor of Surgi's
yard may drive down property values.
   Surgi, who concedes that his hobby is an eyesore at the moment,
has been cited by the city for running a junkyard and for storing
so much debris that it attracted rats.
   However, he said his project has the support of most of his
neighbors, and displayed a petition he said was signed in his
behalf by 98 neighbors.
   The city has set a March 21 public hearing on the issue. A
proposed amendment to the city code would prohibit the storage or
repair of an airplane in residential areas, unless it is inside a
building.
   If he makes the plane flight-worthy, he'll have to dismantle it
and take it to an airfield to fly it, Surgi said.

   A drunken soldier who was waving a
grenade to threaten teen-agers at a town fair accidentally dropped
it early today, killing eight people, including himself, and
wounding more than 30 others, police reported.
   Sixteen people were hospitalized with serious injuries after the
explosion in Mae Cham, 50 miles south of the provincial capital of
Chiang Mai, said Lt. Manit Juntanung of the Mae Cham police station.
   Chiang Mai, in the province of the same name, is about 430 miles
north of Bangkok.
   Manit said Sgt. Maj. Phisanu Chuemai, 25, pulled the pin of the
M-26 grenade and was threatening a group of teen-agers who had
gotten into a dispute with fellow soldiers over dancing partners.
   He fell and dropped the grenade at about 12:30 a.m., as the fair
was winding down. About 500 participants were at the fair at the
time, Manit said.
   Manit said Phisanu was training rangers, or paramilitary units,
at a nearby army camp. He quoted the camp commander as saying
Phisanu had been drinking at the base and went to the fair after
hearing about a fist fight between soldiers and teen-agers.

   Considering that adventure writer Jack
London considered his early years here ``the dullest possible
exisence,'' it may be no wonder local officials twice refused to
rename public works in his honor.
   But that has angered some local historians, whose latest efforts
to honor the author of ``The Call of the Wild'' failed when the
park directors recently turned down a proposal to rechristen
Neptune Park as Jack London Park.
   ``I think it's a disgrace for the town. I'm disgusted,'' said
Janet Newton, a local historian.
   The request came from the Heritage Preservation Commission, but
Commission Chairwoman Marie Abbott said she now believes local
residents are too parochial to honor the internationally respected
author.
   Last year, city officials also turned down Abbott's request to
rename Altair Street near Neptune Park after London. The ranch
where London spent some of his childhood is part of Neptune Park.
   Livermore is about 30 miles east of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Kerner Commission Report Reviewed 20 Years Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RACINE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two decades after the Kerner Commission
issued its report on U.S. racial conditions, panelists at a
conference here said prejudice is no longer the main reason many
inner-city blacks live in poverty.
   ``The problem is not a problem of a defective people, the
problem is a problem of a politically and economically defective
system,'' said Roger W. Wilkins, an assistant U.S. attorney general
under then-President Johnson.
   ``And until we get that message across, we are going to continue
to grind up and destroy people.''
   Wilkins said nationwide programs focusing resources on specific
disadvantaged areas and people will be neccessary before any
progress can be made.
   A growing number of people are living in an urban ``underclass''
in inner- city neighborhoods where the social and family support
system has been eroded by the flight of people who could afford to
leave, participants said.
   The report by the National Commission on Civil Disorders, also
called the Kerner Commission, was issued Feb. 29, 1968. The panel,
named by Johnson and chaired by Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner, examined
the causes of racial tension that led to riots in large cities
across the United States.
   The report, in addition to calling for solutions to the problems
of the black ghettos, tied the riots to a trend in which America
was ``moving toward two societies, one black, one white _ separate
and unequal.''
   Participants at the weekend conference, due to end today, said
racial prejudice still exists, but that the growth of a black
middle class has made the ghettos less a racial phenomenon than a
structural one.
   William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology and public
policy at the University of Chicago, said there are 20 percent more
``underclass'' people living in the ghettos of the nation's 50
largest cities than when the Kerner report was issued. He said this
is so despite the fact that those cities suffered a 5 percent
overall population decrease between 1970 and 1980.
   The extreme poverty in such areas eliminates many of the
services and social outlets available in the larger, more
prosperous society at large, resulting in an increase in crime and
a decrease in the aspirations of the impoverished, Wilson said.
   ``Banks, stores, professional services, churches _ they're
either leaving or losing their audiences,'' he said.
   Ronald Mincy of the Urban Institute in Washington said racism
was at the root of the rage that spurred the urban unrest of the
1960s but that social class should be the focus of contemporary
discussion of the impoverished.
   ``The black poor of today don't just compare unfavorably with
white America, but also with a growing section of black America,''
he said.
   Wilkins, now a professor of history and American culture at
George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., said it will ultimately be
up to both whites and blacks to solve the problems of the
underclass.
   The conference was co-sponsored by the Institute for Public
Policy of the University of New Mexico, the 1988 Commission on the
Cities and the Johnson Foundation.

<TEXT>
   Poet and philosopher Mikhail Naimy, one
of Lebanon's major literary figures, died in Christian east Beirut
shortly after developing pneumonia, relatives said today. He was 98.
   Naimy, who lived in the United States for 21 years and served in
the U.S. Army during World War I, died at his home in the Zalka
district on Sunday, his family reported.
   The slim, bespectacled Naimy, biographer and longtime associate
of Lebanese writer Khalil Gibran, was born Oct. 17, 1889, in
Baskinta, a mountaintop village 10 miles northeast of Beirut.
   He was educated at a Russian missionary school in Jerusalem and
attended high school in Moscow. He went to the United States in
1911 and earned a law degree from Washington State University in
Seattle.
   He was drafted May 25, 1918, and sent to the front in France.
   Naimy's career as a writer began after his 1919 return to Walla
Walla, Wash., to live with his two elder brothers.
   He returned to live in Lebanon in 1932, a few months after
Gibran's death. Naimy and Gibran became close friends in the United
States, where Gibran spent most of his adult life.
   Naimy was fluent in English, Russian and Arabic. His English
language ``Book of Mirdad, a Lighthouse and a Haven'' has been
translated into several languages. His biography of Gibran was
first published in Arabic in 1934 and then reprinted in English in
New York in 1950.
   Naimy, a bachelor, was the author of at least 10 other books.

   Vice President George Bush is the chief
beneficiary of the free flowing money for presidential politics in
Ohio, while Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is the top money man
among Democrats running in the state's May 3 primary.
   Bush raised nearly $1 million in Ohio last year, more than four
times greater than any other GOP presidential candidate, according
to a story in the Akron Beacon Journal Sunday. The sum is more than
5 percent of the $18 million his presidential campaign raised
nationally.
   Among Democrats, Dukakis last year raised the most in Ohio _
$66,710. While it is much smaller than Bush's contributions, it is
much more than his nearest Democratic rival got, the report said.
   Overall, the six Republican presidential candidates took in
$1,467,729 in Ohio, more than seven times the $193,642 given to
seven Democrats.

no candidate in either party graded better than fair on the group's

   About 1,500 Armenians marched through

   Chanting in Armenian and waving signs with slogans such as ``one

mile-long march Sunday at Los Angeles City College, where they
listened to speeches and sang Armenian songs.
   Police Sgt. Tom Knopp said the crowd was orderly and no problems

the Soviet Union, said spokeswoman Sona Tenkerian.
   About 200,000 of the up to 500,000 Armenians in California live

   President Abdou Diouf declared a state of
emergency to quell violent demonstrations that began today
following radio reports that he was winning re-election by a
landslide.
   Witnesses said truncheon-swinging riot police battled students
in the northern section of the capital and rock-throwing protesters
destroyed several buses in the southern section.
   A broadcast on national radio said all public meetings were
banned and that the emergency declaration was being made ``in
response to grave troubles this morning.''
   The radio said Diouf, who polled 83.5 percent in the 1983
election, received 77 percent of the vote in early returns. It said
early returns showed the leading opposition candidate, Abdoulaye
Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party, got 21 percent of the
vote. Two other candidates split the rest.
   Diouf had been expected to easily win re-election to a second
five-year term in Sunday's voting. But opposition candidates
charged Sunday that Diouf's Socialist Party was handing out
fraudulent voting cards to his supporters.
   Reporters saw riot police break up a meeting today of the
opposition Senegalese Democratic Party outside party headquarters.
A photographer for The Associated Press was arrested and his camera
and film confiscated.
   The opposition party earlier had threatened demonstrations if
the government announced election returns before they had been
certified by the country's Supreme Court, which hears challenges to
results.
   Armored personnel carriers mounted with machine guns blocked
major entrances near the opposition party headquarters and to the
University of Dakar, where dozens of people were arrested today
during clashes with police.
   Witnesses said police moved in to break up a group of students
who had gathered on campus, and that police broke into the
students' residences, knocking down doors and throwing tear gas
grenades into the rooms.
   A group of Moroccan students told reporters they had been taken
out of their beds by police, dragged outside on the lawn and beaten
with rubber truncheons.
   Those who had been singled out for beatings also had their heads
shaved by police, students said.
   Although the election campaign had been marred by battles
between police and opposition supporters, the only reported trouble
on election day was in the northern town of Kebemer. A Radio France
International reporter said police fired on a group of young
Senegalese Democratic Party supporters who were throwing rocks at
them.
   The Kebemer hospital said four people were treated and released
and two others were hospitalized after surgery. No other details
were available.
   Diouf was appointed to succeed President Leopold Senghor who
retired in 1981.
   His party was expected to maintain its majority in the National
Assembly, although it appeared likely it would lose some of the 111
seats won in the 1983 elections.
   Candidates from four parties were contesting the presidency
while six parties had candidates running for seats in the
legislature.
   The opposition parties have called for changes in the electoral
process.
   Wade has repeatedly claimed there was widespread fraud in the
1983 voting and threatened to turn his party into a national
liberation movement if Sunday's voting was rigged.

was reburied in the Irish Republic after a second autopsy.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey was expected to tell
Parliament on Tuesday about the results of the examination of the
body of Aidan McAnespie.
   In a snub of Britain, Haughey has ordered an investigation into
the Feb. 21 killing, which occurred across the border in the
British-ruled north. A British soldier has been charged with
unlawful killing.
   McAnespie's body was exhumed Sunday after his family requested
that an autopsy by done by an Irishman. A British autopsy already
had been completed.
   The second post-mortem was conducted at Monaghan General
Hospital by Dr. John Harbison, Ireland's chief state pathologist.
The body was then reburied Sunday night.
   Haughey's order for the inquiry has upset the British government
and infuriated the majority Protestant politicians in the north,
who see it as interference in their affairs.
   Harold McCusker, a Protestant lawmaker, said: ``It was always
clear that this inquiry was designed not to help but to embarrass
the British government and to question its procedures and honesty.''
   ``My own view is that this inquiry will not produce anything
startling or embarrassing, though it will be used for that
purpose,'' McCusker said.
   McAnespie belonged to the Roman Catholic minority and his
sister, Eilish McCabe, claimed Sunday that her brother had received
a number of death threats from the British army.
   She said British soldiers constantly harassed her brother as he
crossed the border between his home in the north and his workplace
in the republic.
   The army said the bullet that hit McAnespie was fired
accidentally and ricocheted. An 18-year-old soldier charged with
unlawful killing is held on bail in military care.
   The McAnespie family lawyer, Pat Fahy, said there was autopsy
evidence to show the fatal shot entered the body from the front,
rather than the back, as indicated by authorities in Northern
Ireland.
   McAnspie was buried last Tuesday in Clara, County Monaghan,
across the border from his home at Aughnacloy.

<HEAD>Super Tuesday ``Main Event,'' Says Backer of Idea</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Robb comments in top 7 grafs, picking up in 3rd

   Super Tuesday was hailed today as ``the
main event'' of the primary season as centrist Democrats who had
hoped to give the presidential campaign a Southern flavor opened a
two-day meeting.
   ``Democrats can't win the White House without winning the
South,'' former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia told the Democratic
Leadership Council.
   Robb is the outgoing chairman of the council and a prime mover
in getting Southern states to hold nearly all their primaries and
caucuses on March 8, now dubbed Super Tuesday. He said the 20
states that will vote that day represent ``the first broad-based
test of the primary season _ the first opportunity for the
candidates to address a truly national audience.''
   He said that ``as the sun rises on Super Tuesday, fewer than 10
percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention will
have been selected. By sunset, as a result of voting that begins on
the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and ends thousands of miles away
in the Pacific Ocean, over 40 percent of the delegates to Atlanta
(site of the convention) will have been chosen.''
   Robb also noted that the Super Tuesday states represent 207
electoral votes, 76 percent of the total needed to be elected
president.
   ``So to a large extent,'' he said, ``the general election
chances of the Democratic Party rest with these 20 states. The
preliminaries are over and Super Tuesday is indisputably the main
event of the primary season.''
   In at least one sense, however, Super Tuesday is not turning out
as some of its creators had hoped. Three of the leading Democratic
contenders were pursuing agendas far from that advocated by the
Democratic eadership Council.
   The candidate with the largest base in the South is Jesse
Jackson, who has referred scornfully to the DLC as the ``Democratic
Leisure Class.''
   Another leading contender is Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, whose Northeast base is exactly the wrong place most
DLC members think the party ought to look for its next nominee.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was a founder of the DLC, but
has become a leading 1988 contender by advocating the kind of trade
sanctions sought by organized labor and anathema to the DLC.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, the southerner in the race,
but never a particular favorite of the DLC, is pursuing a Super
Tuesday strategy, taking stands to the right of his rivals.
   The Democrats DLC members most wanted to see in the presidential
race were Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and former Gov. Charles Robb of
Virginia. Robb is ending a term as DLC chairman and will be
replaced by Nunn.
   The DLC was established in the wake of the 1984 election in
which Democratic presidential candidate Walter F. Mondale carried
only one state. That landslide defeat was the party's fourth loss
in the last five presidential elections.
   The problem, decided many Democratic officials from the South
and West, was the disproportionate weight wielded in the party by
labor, minority groups and Eastern liberals. It was time to give
the South a stronger voice in choosing the next nominee and time to
diminish the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Thus was born Super Tuesday, which amounts to a Southern
regional primary. Twenty states will hold primaries or caucuses on
March 8, a majority of them south of the Mason-Dixon Line.
   A discussion of ``The Super Tuesday Challenge'' was on the
agenda for the DLC's two-day meeting at Colonial Williamsburg.
   Other topics included ``Democratic Capitalism: New Strategies
for Growth With Equity,'' and ``Citizenship and National Service.''
   But the most watched event of the meeting will be a debate
Monday night between five of the party's six presidential
candidates.
   Participating in the forum at the College of William and Mary
are Gephardt, Jackson, Gore, Dukakis and former Sen. Gary Hart of
Colorado.
   Not joining was Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who is passing up
Super Tuesday.
   The most recent Democratic debate on Saturday in Atlanta was a
contentious confrontation with Dukakis, Gephardt and Gore attacking
each other.
   Displaying his most aggressive style of the campaign, Dukakis
focused on Gephardt's vote in favor of President Reagan's 1981 tax
cut and said Gore ``has never run a government.''
   Gephardt retorted that Dukakis had ``raised taxes about 10
times'' in Massachusetts, while Gore said the governor would need
``on the job training in foreign policy.''

<HEAD>Consumer Federation of America Rates Members of Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Federation of America says its
annual ratings of the voting records of Senate and House members
show 48 ``heroes'' and 23 ``zeroes'' for consumers.
   The ratings released Sunday were based on a dozen votes in the
Senate and 14 in the House of Representatives. Members were given
credit for some obvious consumer issues, such as support for
appliance energy efficiency standards, and for some that were not
so obvious, such as a vote against Supreme Court nominee Robert
Bork.
   The heroes included nine senators and 39 House members, the
group said, and it gave the Senate its best rating ever.
   For the first time since the federation started rating Congress
in 1971, it said, the Senate supported consumer interests in more
than half of the votes counted.
   Overall, senators sided with consumers 59 percent of the time,
it said, up from 45 percent a year earlier. Members of both parties
were credited with significant improvement.
   In the House, consumer issues were supported 53 percent of the
time, up from 51 percent the year before.
   Senate votes listed as favoring consumer interests, in addition
to the appliance and Bork votes, included retaining the broadcast
fairness doctrine, giving communities notice of large plant
closings, supporting clean water funds, cutting tobacco export
subsidies and opposing raising the speed limit to 65 miles per hour.
   House votes favoring consumers also included clean water, the
fairness doctrine and low speed limits plus limits on credit card
interest rates, requiring banks to make deposited funds available
to customers, encouraging use of generic drugs, restricting smoking
on airplanes and funding legal services.
   Senate heroes voted correctly, according to the federation,
every time, while House heroes managed at least 13 out of 14 votes
correctly, the study said.
   Senate heroes are Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.;
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.; Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., and Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt.
   House heroes, all Democrats, are Ronald V. Dellums, California;
Brian J. Donnelly, Massachusetts; Dennis M. Hertel, Michigan; Dale
E. Kildee, Michigan; Joe Moakley, Massachusetts; Ted Weiss, New
York; Sidney R. Yates, Illinois; Anthony C. Beilenson, California;
Thomas J. Downey, New York;Richard J. Durkin, Illinois;
   Also Dennis E. Eckart, Ohio; Don Edwards, California; Lane
Evans, Illinois; James J. Florio, New Jersey; Sam Gejdenson,
Connecticut; Frank J. Guarini, New Jersey; Charles A. Hayes,
Illinois; George J. Hochbrueckner, New York; Steny H. Hoyer,
Maryland;
   Plus Gerald D. Kleczka, Wisconsin; John J. LaFalce, New York;
Mickey Leland, Texas; Sander M. Levin, Michigan; Edward J. Markey,
Massachusetts; Robert T. Matsui, California; Nicholas Mavroules,
Massachusetts; Matthew F. McHugh, New York; Kweisi Mfume, Maryland;
   And George Miller, California; Henry J. Nowak, New York; Donald
J. Pease, Ohio; Claude Pepper, Florida; Charles B. Rangel, New
York; Peter W. Rodino, New Jersey; James H. Scheuer, New York;
Stephen H. Solarz, New York; Pete Stark, California; Gerry E.
Studds, Massachusetts, and Henry A. Waxman, California.
   On the other side of the coin, zeroes were listed as those in
the House and Senate who voted as the federation thought correct
either once, or not at all.
   Senate zeroes, all Republicans, were James A. McClure, Idaho;
Steven D. Symms, Idaho; Malcolm Wallop, Wyoming; Phil Gramm, Texas;
Jesse Helms, North Carolina, and Don Nickles, Oklahoma.
   House zeroes, also all Republicans, were Connie M. Mack III,
Florida; Robert E. Badham, California; Dan Burton, Indiana; Daniel
Coats, Indiana; Howard Coble, North Carolina; Larry Combest, Texas;

<HEAD>Former Emperor's Death Sentence Commuted To Life Imprisonment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Andre Kolingba
today commuted former Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa's death sentence,
reducing it to life imprisonment in solitary confinement.
   The government-controlled national radio announced the
commutation.
   The self-proclaimed Bokassa I had appealed the death penalty to
the Supreme Court, but the appeal was rejected last November.
Bokassa was convicted June 12, 1987 of ordering the murder of at
least 20 political opponents. He also was convicted of diverting
huge sums from the state treasury.
   Kolingba, a general who is reportedly opposed to capital
punishment, has commuted all previous death sentences imposed in
this former French colony.
   Bokassa was living in exile in France when he flew back to
Bangui to vindicate himself ``before the Central African people.''
He had been convicted in absentia and sentenced to death in 1980.
   The former emperor, who ruled this nation of 3 million from
1966-79, was toppled in a French-backed coup while he was visiting
Libya.
   The French action followed allegations that Bokassa had been
involved in the deaths of 100 schoolchildren, beating 17 of them to
death himself. The students were protesting government rules
requiring them to wear expensive uniforms made in a factory run by
one of Bokassa's wives.
   Bokassa also had been accused of cannibalism, but he was
acquitted on this charge during a trial that began in December 1986
and ended in June.
   Under the French legal system used in the Central African
Republic, the government was obligated to try Bokassa again. It was
the first time a former head of state had been publicly tried in
black Africa.
   Bokassa, 67, the son of a village chief of the minority M'baka
tribe of the southwest, was educated in Roman Catholic mission
schools. He joined the French army and rose to the rank of captain
after winning a dozen combat medals in Indochina.
   After the Central African Republic became independent in 1960,
President David Dacko asked Bokassa to form an army. Bokassa led a
coup against Dacko and named himself president and prime minister
on Jan. 3, 1967.
   Bokassa proclaimed himself emperor and was crowned in a ceremony
in 1977 which cost more than $200 million, or 25 percent of the
nation's annual revenue.

<HEAD>Doctor Charged With Killing Wife Tells Of Her Death Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Patty Rosier picked at her last meal,
kissed her children goodbye and rested in bed with her husband.
They talked and wept and hugged, he said, and then she swallowed a
handful of sleeping pills.
   ``My wife wanted to sleep. To just fall into a restful sleep and
die. She took the drugs herself. Her last words to me were, `I love
you, Peter,''' Peter Rosier said in an interview published Sunday.
   Rosier, a Fort Myers physician, is charged with first-degree
murder in the death of his 43-year-old wife on Jan. 15, 1986. His
trial is scheduled to begin April 18, and prosecutors say they will
seek the death penalty if he is convicted.
   Mrs. Rosier did not die from the sleeping pills, nor from
injections of morphine which her husband allegedly gave her after
she lapsed into a coma. The woman's stepfather, Vincent Delman of
New York City, says that he finally suffocated her.
   Delman has been granted immunity from prosecution. Prosecutor Ed
Volz says Rosier conspired in the death of his wife and can be
tried for first-degree murder.
   Authorities investigated the death only after Rosier talked
about the circumstances on television.
   Mrs. Rosier was diagnosed in April 1985 as having lung cancer.
Rosier quit his job as head of the pathology department at Lee
Memorial Hospital to be with his wife, whose treatment at first
seemed successful.
   Six months later, doctors found brain tumors. Soon there were
more tumors, in her abdomen and on her skin, Rosier said.
   ``She was incurable. She was going to die. She felt, why go
through that torture (radiation therapy) all over again,'' Rosier,
46, said in an interview published in Sunday's editions of The
Miami Herald. ``My wife chose to end her life.''
   It was Rosier's first interview since he was indicted in
September.
   He said he and his wife of 22 years had planned at first to die
together.
   ``We spent an entire day going over the assets, which Realtor
would sell the home, how to dispose of the property. ... I told the
children I could not live without Patty. But then I realized it was
my responsibilty to stay with them,'' he said of their children,
Jacob, now 20, and Elizabeth, 19.
   On the night of her planned death, Mrs. Rosier invited family
and friends for a last visit. She gave them gifts and had a catered
dinner, although she was too ill to eat.
   Later, Rosier helped her to the bedroom. The couple made love.
They talked.
   ``I had had an affair earlier on in our marriage. I asked her
again if she had forgiven me,'' he recalled. ``She said, `You know
I've forgiven you thousands of times.' We talked about a lot of
things. About whether there was a God ... About how much we were
going to miss each other. She wasn't scared. I was.''
   Then she took the drugs.
   ``I couldn't bear to be with her after she'd fallen asleep. I
left the room,'' he said. Twelve hours later, Mrs. Rosier was still
alive.
   Delman has said that Rosier attempted in vain to end his wife's
life with injections of morphine. Finally, the stepfather
intervened.
   ``I decided to cover her mouth and her nose. ... I mean it was
pathetic to see this lady in bed and all this stuff going on for
11, 12, 10 hours, whatever it was. So the thing is to end it,''
Delman said in depositions.
   The body was cremated within 48 hours.
   Months after his wife's death, Rosier commission a scriptwriter
to produce a screenplay from a book he wrote about her death. Then
he went on television and during an interview said he helped his
wife die, a confession that sparked the criminal investigation.

   Oral Roberts told a church service that
some people are trying to embarrass evangelists and ruin their
ministries.
   ``Right now, this old world and the media and certain church
people are dragging the name of evangelists in the mud,'' said the
70-year Roberts.
   Roberts, of Tulsa, Okla., mentioned no one by name when he spoke
to more than 1,200 people Sunday at the Christian Center in
suburban Gahanna.
   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart was disciplined by the
Assemblies of God last week after confessing to unspecified sinful
behavior against his wife. Jim Bakker left his national television
ministry last year after he admitted having an extramarital sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Roberts made a controversial appeal last year for $8 million,
saying that God would ``call me home'' if he did not raise the
money to fund scholarships for medical missionaries.
   Oral Roberts University said last month that 117 scholarships
had been funded, but that there were no plans to raise funds for
additional aid.
   In December, Roberts pulled his weekly ``Expect a Miracle''
program from 71 stations, but continued to run it on 150 others.
   ``Our income dropped off in May and it stayed there,'' his
spokeswoman, Jan Dargatz, said at the time. ``That's when the Jim
and Tammy thing heated up. There is a correlation there.''

   Israeli soldiers killed one Palestinian during
a protest in the occupied West Bank today, hospital officials said,
and the army said a second Arab died of wounds suffered in an
earlier clash with soldiers.
   Meanwhile, a Jewish settler suspected of killing two
Palestinians was freed on bail, and an Israeli officer trying to
teach his men restraint made them watch TV footage of soldiers
beating captured Arabs.
   Yasser Daoud Eid, 18, died after he was shot in the neck during
a clash with soldiers in Burin, about 3 miles south of the West
Bank city of Nablus, the Arab-owned Palestinian Press Service and
officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital said. The army said it was
checking the report.
   A second Palestinian, 30-year-old Mahmoud Batwi, died of wounds
suffered four days ago when he was shot in the head in a protest in
the West Bank town of Jenin, the army said.
   Police freed on bond Hananiya Schneider, a Jewish settler
detained on suspicion of involvement in the shooting death of two
Arabs in the West Bank. Police said an investigation into the
slayings would continue.
   Schneider, of Neve Tzuf, is suspected of killing two
Palestinians on Saturday night from the neighboring village of Abud
after villagers blocked the main road.
   The army today charged three soldiers, including a
sergeant-major, with aggravated assault and brutality for allegedly
burying alive four Palestinians in the West Bank village of Kfar
Salem, an army spokesman said.
   The incident occurred Feb. 5 after troops broke up a
stone-throwing demonstration in the village. The Arabs escaped with
the help of relatives.
   The soldiers' names were not released. It was the first known
case of a soldier facing serious criminal charges related to the
unrest in the occupied lands, although other soldiers have been
disciplined for using excessive force there.
   The army also confirmed it was investigating charges that a
soldier shot and killed a Palestinian demonstrator in cold blood
after seizing him during a demonstration. The spokesman said the
incident occurred in the Gaza Strip last month but gave no other
details.
   In another development, an Israeli senior commander on Sunday
made his officers watch CBS television footage showing four
soldiers beat two Palestinians for nearly 40 minutes last week.
   Excerpts of the footage showed the soldiers bent over the Arabs,
who were lying on the ground with their hands tied behind their
backs. The soldiers kicked the Arabs in the head and chest, then
picked up fist-sized rocks and smashed them on the Arabs' arms and
legs, trying to break bones.
   ``We have to make sure that we don't become an army of rabble,''
Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, commander of Israeli troops in the West
Bank, told army radio.
   The four soldiers accused in the beatings near Nablus were
released from custody today, army radio said. Their case went to
the military prosecutors' office, where it will be decided what
steps to take against them, it said.
   In Jerusalem, police today safely detonated a bomb planted at
the entrance to a large supermarket in Ramat Eshkol, one of the
city's northern Jewish neighborhoods, police spokesman Rafi Levi
said. Levy said the bomb was discovered by a passerby who alerted
police.
   The latest fatalities came as U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz pursued his Middle East shuttle. Since unrest began in the
occupied territories on Dec. 8, 74 Arabs have died, according to
U.N. count.
   Shultz visited Cairo on Sunday, where his peace plan received
support from President Hosni Mubarak. Shultz then returned to
Israel for more meetings with Israeli officials Sunday night and
this morning before flying to Jordan.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told reporters after meeting
Shultz today that he believed Jordan was taking the shuttle ``very
seriously'' even though King Hussein flew to London for dental
treatment before the mission began.
   During a debate of Israel's 24-member Cabinet on Sunday,
Transportation Minister Chaim Corfu and Labor and Social Affairs
Minister Moshe Katzav proposed barring reporters from the West Bank
and Gaza. No decision was made.
   ``I've reached a conclusion that media presence creates riots. .
.. so in order to subdue the riots or stop them completely it's
better that the media would not be present,'' Katzav told army
radio.

   A woman who thought she won enough in a
million-dollar sweepstakes to pay off her debts is deeper in debt
now after taking a celebratory trip and finding out she didn't win
after all.
   But officials of United States Purchasing Exchange, the
contest's sponsor, say Debra Long probably is the victim of a
mixup, a misunderstanding or a bad joke. She won't be getting any
money.
   Long quit her $2.25-an-hour waitress job, took a trip to Las
Vegas with her boyfriend and made plans to buy a house and pay off
debts after thinking she won $1.7 million in a sweepstakes.
   ``They were convinced I was a winner. I got phone calls saying
that,'' Long said after learning last week that she wouldn't
receive the money.
   A spokeswoman for the California-based mail-order company
disputes Long's story on several points. Among other things, she
says, no winner has been named because the sweepstakes is still in
progress.
   Long ordered a $9.98 canister set from USPE in November and
entered its sweepstakes.
   In early February, she said, she received a letter from USPE
saying she would receive a ``multimillion-dollar cash letter.''
Another USPE letter arrived Feb. 13 by certified mail, and Long
said she took it to mean she had won.
   USPE officials said the second letter was a promotion advising
customers they're in the running for the prize.
   Long said she called the company Feb. 15 to confirm her windfall
and was asked to read the letter over the phone.
   A secretary said ``if I heard two beeps, it meant I wasn't a
winner,'' Long said. ``I was sitting on the edge of my chair,
waiting, but I didn't hear any beeps.
   ``And then she connected me with the manager. He said, `Miss
Long, I pronounce you the grand prize winner of the USPE
sweepstakes. You're $1,731,852.21 richer than you were 24 hours
ago.'''
   She said she was told the money would be deposited in her bank
account within 60 days.
   USPE officials got word of Long's claim last Thursday, and
Cheryl McGeary, the company's customer service supervisor, called
Long with the bad news.
   Besides not confirming information via telephone, McGeary said,
USPE doesn't notify winners by certified mail and doesn't ask for
bank account numbers.
   And while Long said she called USPE on Feb. 15 to verify her
claim, McGeary said company offices were closed that day for
Presidents' Day.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch called President Reagan a
wimp in the war on drugs today after taking out a full-page ad in
The New York Times urging the president to cut economic aid to
drug-producing countries.
   The mayor's ad bore a black-bordered picture of a 22-year-old
rookie policeman murdered last week in the drug-ravaged South
Jamaica section of Queens.
   ``We are truly in a war with the drug pushers, but the president
is not acting as the commander-in-chief. If anything, he's acting
as a wimp,'' Koch said today on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Koch said the ad attempted to ``channel this rage that the whole
city is feeling'' about the killing Friday of officer Edward Byrne,
who was shot three times while guarding the house of a threatened
witness in a drug case.
   The $12,900 ad, paid for by Koch's 1989 re-election committee,
said Byrne was killed ``by a gunman who, very probably, was acting
on instructions from a New York drug kingpin.''
   Reagan is expected to sign an order Tuesday exempting some
countries from a law mandating cuts in economic and military aid
for their failure to take adequate steps to combat drug trafficking.
   Koch's ad asks readers to send Reagan telegrams saying, ``Do not
sign the certifications for foreign aid to Mexico, Panama, the
Bahamas, Haiti, Paraguay, Colombia, or any other drug source
country.''
   The mayor also urged readers to send telegrams to members of
Congress, asking them to vote against certificates of aid to drug
source countries if Reagan approves the aid.

Trafficking</HEAD>

   The United States will not impose maximum
penalties against Panama for failing to take steps to control drug
trafficking, a newspaper reported today.
   Under a 1986 anti-drug law, the president has until Tuesday to
certify whether countries in which major drug trafficking occurs
are fully cooperating in efforts to fight the trafficking.
   The New York Times, quoting senior Reagan administration
officials, said President Reagan last weekend signed an order to
decertify Panama, but that he declined to use his discretionary
powers to impose the maximum penalties.
   However, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
president has not made a decision. ``It hasn't gone to him yet.
It's going today.''
   The law requires the United States to vote against new loans by
international development banks such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund to decertified countries. In the case
of Panama, the United States also would be obliged to keep in place
the military and economic sanctions imposed last year.
   Other sanctions Reagan has the power to impose include the
barring of airline flights between Panama and the United States;
imposition of a 50 percent tax on all Panamaniam imports; and the
loss of preferential tariff treatment.
   Some administration officials have said the president should
impose full sanctions as a means of conveying disapproval to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's de facto leader. Noriega was
indicted in Florida this month on drug-trafficking charges.
   It was not known why Reagan chose not to use all the mechanisms
under the law, but some officials speculated that the
administration wants to wait until events become more stable in
Panama. Panama's president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, was ousted on
Friday by the country's assembly, which Noriega controls.

   Iran hanged two men sentenced to death
for bombing a Tehran square, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported today.
   The executions Sunday raised to seven the number of people
hanged in public in the Iranian capital during the weekend for
bombings. IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said five men were hanged
Saturday.
   A senior commander of Tehran's Revolutionary Committees, which
have largely taken over security from civilian police, announced
Saturday that 30 people responsible for recent bombings in Tehran
and western Iran had been arrested.
   He said the suspects, described as ``paid Iraqi agents,'' would
be handed over to the Revolutionary Courts for trial.
   IRNA did not specify whether the seven men executed were part of
the group of 30 reported arrested.
   IRNA identified the two men hanged Sunday as Mohammed Kazimzadeh
and Rasoul Rahmani. It said the Islamic Revolutionary Court
convicted them of planting bombs, spying for Iraq and transporting
explosives to Tehran from Iraq.
   They received ``a large amount of money'' from Iraq for the
bombings, the agency said.
   The two men were sentenced to death for bombings last year in a
Tehran square and were hanged ``at the scene of their crime,'' IRNA
said.
   The latest reported bombing in Tehran was Feb. 18, when a car
bomb exploded on a Tehran expressway, wounding two people.
   Another 10 people were wounded three days earlier by a blast in
north Tehran's Martyr Bahonar Avenue, only a few hundred yards from
the residence of Iranian revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980. Members of
Iranian resistance groups fighting against Khomeini's fundamentist
Islamic regime are invariably branded Iraqi agents by the Iranian
authorities.

<HEAD>Court Will Consider Medicare Reimbursement Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
letting the federal government apply retroactively a formula that
limits reimbursement paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients.
   The court said it will hear Reagan administration arguments that
some hospitals could reap a windfall from the ban on retroactive
application of the formula.
   The government in 1981 adopted a rule that excluded from the
Medicare reimbursement formula wages paid by hospitals owned by the
federal government.
   The idea was to save money by not applying national pay scales
to private hospitals in areas with lower wage levels.
   But the Department of Health and Human Services adopted the new
rule without allowing a time for the public to comment on the
proposal. The formula was challenged by private hospitals and
thrown out by a federal judge as a violation of proper rule-making
procedures.
   The federal agency adopted the rule again in 1984 using the
correct procedure. But this time the department applied the rule
retroactively to reimbursement sought by the hospitals beginning
July 1, 1981.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last June that the
formula may not be applied retroactively, and awarded more than $2
million in reimbursement money to seven hospitals.
   The appeals court said that if the government believes any
hospital has received excess reimbursement, each case must be
proved.
   The Justice Department, in its appeal to the Supreme Court, said
the appeals court ruling ``would effectively eliminate the only
realistic method available ... to make retroactive corrections to
reimbursement decisions.''
   The hospitals involved in the case are Georgetown University
Hospital, Howard University Hospital and Greater Southeast
Community Hospital, all in the District of Columbia; Tucson General
and Tucson Medical Center in Arizona, St. Cloud Hospital in
Minnesota and Community Hospital of Battle Creek, Mich.
   The case is Bowen vs. Georgetown University Hospital, 87-1097.

<TEXT>
   A reporter's attempt to force the State
Department to release documents from U.S. embassies around the
world failed in the Supreme Court today.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out
Donald F. Goldberg's lawsuit, which had been filed under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   Goldberg, a reporter on the staff of syndicated columnist Jack
Anderson, filed an FOIA request in 1984 seeking from the State
Department responses to an unclassified 1982 questionnaire on
foreign governments' diplomatic practices.
   The FOIA was passed by Congress in 1966 to help curtail
government secrecy.
   State Department officials told Goldberg in 1985 that only four
of 161 relevant documents could be released fully.
   Of the remaining 157 documents, nine were not to be released at
all and 148 were to be released with certain portions omitted.
   The government invoked an FOIA exemption that protects secrets
of national defense or foreign policy.
   Goldberg then sued, contending that the responses improperly
were given a ``classified'' designation in Washington by John
Eaves, director of the Office of Mandatory Review in the State
Department's Classification and Declassification Center.
   Goldberg noted that most of the responses originally had been
designated ``unclassified'' by responding ambassadors.
   A federal trial judge dismissed Goldberg's suit before trial,
and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
upheld that ruling.
   The appeals court said it rejected Goldberg's argument that
``the affixing of conclusory `unclassified' labels on responses to
an unclassified questionnaire by itself controverts a detailed
review and explanation that some parts of those documents are
properly classified.''
   The case is Goldberg vs. State Department, 87-655.

<HEAD>Justices Will Review Kansas Man's Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
decision halving the fines and prison terms given to a Dodge City,
Kan., business and its president for rigging highway-construction
bids.
   The justices said they will hear federal prosecutors' arguments
aimed at reinstating the original sentences received by Broce
Construction Co. Inc. and Ray C. Broce.
   Broce and the business pleaded guilty in 1982 to charges
contained in two indictments, respectively alleging bid-rigging in
highway-construction projects in Meade and Barton counties.
   Broce was sentenced on March 15, 1982, to concurrent two-year
prison terms and fined $101,000. The corporation he headed was
fined $1.5 million.
   More than a year after the sentencing, Broce and the corporation
sought to set aside the judgment and sentence from the second
indictment. They contended that the separate sentences meted out
under the second indictment amounted to multiple punishment for the
same crime.
   A federal trial judge threw out the appeal but the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling.
   The appeals court said that the Constitution's protection
against double jeopardy had been violated by the sentencing, and
that Broce and the corporation had not waived their double-jeopardy
protections when agreeing to plead guilty.
   The appeals court set aside the sentences issued under the
second indictment _ $750,000 in fines for the corporation and
$50,000 in fines and a two-year prison term for Broce.
   In seeking Supreme Court review, government lawyers noted that
the two defendants pleaded guilty to two indictments alleging two
different criminal conspiracies under a plea bargain in which the
government agreed not to prosecute on other charges.
   Under such circumstances, the government's appeal said,
defendants should not be able later to attack the sentences on
grounds that the two alleged conspiracies were actually a single
conspiracy.
   The case is U.S. vs. Broce, 87-1190.

<TEXT>
   Police today arrested Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other church leaders as they marched
toward Parliament with a petition protesting the government's
crackdown on anti-apartheid groups.
   The clergymen, wearing robes and crosses around their necks,
stood with arms linked and Bibles clutched in their hands as a
policeman announced through a bullhorn that the gathering was
illegal. Police had been lining the street outside St. George's
Anglican Cathedral, waiting for the marchers to emerge.
   After Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and other clergymen
were placed in police vehicles, police fired water cannons at more
than 100 demonstrators sitting on the sidewalk singing a hymn,
local journalists said.
   The clergymen and demonstrators were taken to a police station
and released with a warning that charges would be brought against
them if they staged a similar protest, said the Rev. Allan Boesak,
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. He said they
were told summonses might be issued against them for demonstrating
near Parliament and they might be called to court.
   Police also took some journalists into custody.
   Upon their release, the white, black, mixed-race and Indian
clergymen held a news conference in the cathedral, which was still
surrounded by policemen with a water cannon nearby.
   ``We are not defying the law,'' Tutu said, ``we are obeying God.
We also obey God every day.''
   ``In the past,'' Tutu continued, ``it was possible for people to
say it was the usual rabble rousers demonstrating. They can't say
it any more. It's the church.''
   Boesak described today's protest as ``an act of subversion.''
   ``We told the South African government that we had decided we
would be obedient to God. That is a higher law to us,'' he said.
   The clergymen carried a petition, addressed to President P.W.
Botha and Parliament, saying: ``We leaders of a number of South
African churches have come to Parliament today to witness and pray
in a time of crisis outside the buildings in which you make
important decisions affecting the lives of millions of South
Africans who belong to our churches.''
   The protesters, marching five abreast, walked a few yards toward
Parliament from St. George's Cathedral, the main Anglican church in
downtown Cape Town.
   In a service in the cathedral before the march, Tutu and other
ministers declared the churches would lead protests against the
government's anti-apartheid policies because 18 major black
opposition groups had been banned last week from all political
activity.
   Tutu marched in front of the procession, along with Boesak and
other prominent ministers.
   Tutu warned those at the service that they might be tear-gassed,
sprayed with water cannons or arrested. The church leaders said
they had informed the government about the proposed march.
   The march proceeded with clergymen at the end of each row and
lay people in the middle. As they reached Government Avenue, near
the Parliament buildings, they were met by about 50 policemen who
linked arms to block the road.
   The police told the crowd they were gathering illegally, then
began leading away the church leaders, starting with Boesak.
   The Rev. Sid Luckett, head of the Anglican Board of Social
Responsibility, led the rest of the crowd to the police vehicles
and they sat down on the sidewalk.
   Police sprayed the seated protesters with water cannons, but
they stayed in place, and were then put into police vans as they
recited the Lord's Prayer.
   Last Wednesday, the government banned the United Democratic
Front, the nation's largest anti-apartheid organization, and 17
other major black opposition groups from conducting any political
activity.
   Banning orders were also issued against 18 prominent black
leaders, prohibiting them from taking part in anti-government
activities, confining them to their hometowns, and ordering them
not to speak to the press.
   Church groups weren't included in the crackdown and
theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns,
but most forms of peaceful protest are banned under existing
regulations.
   Tutu had called the new regulations ``a declaration of war
against the people.'' He and other church leaders had pledged the
churches would begin to conduct some of the protest campaigns that
had been organized by the banned groups.
   In May 1980, Tutu was one of 54 people, mostly priests, who were
arrested in Johannesburg under the Riotous Assemblies Act for
marching in protest against the detention of a Congregational
Church minister. All were convicted and sentenced to pay a $45 fine
or spend 50 days in jail. Tutu's fine was paid.
   Boesak was last arrested in August, 1985, when he was charged
with subversion for, among other things, organizing a march to
Pollsmoor Prison where African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela is serving a life term. Fourteen months later the charges
were dropped.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation,
the nation's 5 million whites maintain political and economic
control over 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national
affairs.

Searches Lose Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois officials wanting to conduct
warrantless searches of racetrack employees' on-grounds living
quarters as one way of protecting the sport's integrity lost a
Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that such
searches violate constitutionally protected privacy rights if
conducted without first obtaining a court warrant.
   The Illinois Racing Board for years had authorized state law
enforcement officers to search, without warrants, the rooms of
``backstretchers'' _ those employees who feed, groom, exercise and
generally take care of racehorses.
   The searches were aimed at discovering drugs or mechanical
devices that could affect a race's outcome.
   While employed by horse trainers, many backstretchers live in
small rooms located in the area where horses are stabled, the
backstretch.
   The board also authorized warrantless searches of the employees
themselves.
   At one time, backstretchers were required to consent to such
searches as a condition to receiving their licenses.
   Three backstretchers working at Arlington Park Racetrack
challenged the state board's policy and rules in 1982.
   Don Serpas, Raymond Johnson and Carl Waters sued the racing
board in behalf of all backstretchers working at Illinois tracks.
The three had been subjected to searches that turned up no evidence
of any crime.
   U.S. District Judge Charles P. Kocoras ordered that the
warrantless searches be halted temporarily in 1983, and then banned
them permanently in 1985.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban last July
17 after finding no explicit authority for the searches in Illinois
law.
   The appeals court said the backstretchers' living quarters,
though temporary and humble, must be treated as their homes.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment generally prohibits searches
of someone's home unless a court warrant is obtained. Courts
generally will not issue a search warrant unless authorities show a
likelihood that evidence of criminal conduct will be found as a
result.
   ``There is no reason to doubt that drugs and mechanical devices
pose major threats to the integrity of the horseracing industry,''
the appeals court said. But it added that the Illinois racetrack
searches ``without the safeguard of a warrant are unreasonable and
violate the Fourth Amendment.''
   In seeking Supreme Court review, Illinois Attorney General Neil
F. Hartigan relied on past rulings by the justices that have
allowed warrantless searches of heavily regulated industries.
   The case is Schmidt vs. Serpas, 87-644.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive
lawsuits charging the government and federal contractors with
negligently causing deaths and disease among people exposed to
open-air atomic tests.
   The court, without comment, let stand a federal law that
effectively spared the government from having to defend itself
against claims seeking billions of dollars.
   The atmospheric nuclear tests that gave rise to the case took
place between the closing days of World War II and the adoption of
a treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1963
banning open-air testing.
   Suits were filed on behalf of 29 people _ civilians and members
of the military _ including 26 who died from cancer or
cancer-related causes. The suits alleged that the health problems
were caused by radioactive fallout from the explosions.
   Charged with negligence were the University of California, which
operated the Los Alamos, N.M., project; Lawrence Livermore
laboratories, which helped develop the atomic bomb; Sandia Corp.,
which provided engineering for the weapons program; and Reynolds
Electric Engineering Co., which helped build and operate a test
site in Nevada.
   The suits accused the private contractors of failing to take
adequate safety precautions at the test sites, and also said the
government was responsible for failing to enforce its own safety
standards.
   If the suits were successful, the government ultimately would
pay the claims because it had insured the private contractors for
any losses.
   But in 1984 Congress passed a law supported by the Reagan
administration that says only the U.S. government may be sued for
negligence allegedly caused by a private contractor in the atomic
weapons testing program.
   The result was to bar the claims since the government is immune
from such suits unless it surrenders immunity under the existing
Federal Tort Claims Act.
   Those who sued the companies said the 1984 law
unconstitutionally deprived them of a remedy for the deaths and
disease caused by the atomic explosions.
   ``The petitioners had a remedy against the original defendants.
They have none against the United States,'' they said.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law last June.
It rejected arguments that the law violates the Constitution's
required separation of powers by retroactively preventing the
courts from considering pending claims.
   The administration, in urging the Supreme Court not to disturb
the appeals court decision, said more than 3,000 people are seeking
damages totalling more than $4.9 billion in all cases stemming from
the weapons tests.
   The high court on Jan. 11 refused to hear a related appeal by
some 1,200 people in Nevada, Arizona and Utah who sought to hold
the government financially responsible for deaths and diseases
allegedly caused by the tests in Nevada.
   The case acted on today is Konizeski vs. Livermore Labs, 87-953.

<HEAD>Administration Asked About Taxing Indian Bingo Games in Oklahoma
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court asked the Reagan
administration today whether it thinks high-stakes bingo games run
by Indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before it says whether it will review an attempt by Oklahoma
officials to tax revenue from a bingo game in Tulsa run by the
Muscogee Creek Nation.
   The Justice Department's brief may not be filed for months.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September that
the state could not force the tribe to collect and remit the
state's 2.5 percent sales tax on the bingo operations.
   The appeals court said the state's interest in collecting the
tax is minimal in this case.
   ``Patrons do not travel onto Creek lands to play bingo in order
to avoid sales taxes,'' the appeals court said. ``Creek Nation
bingo does not undermine the state economy or tax base. The state
is not losing tax revenues it would otherwise obtain from sales
made outside of tribal boundaries.''
   The appeals court also based its ruling in part on a Supreme
Court decision last year that said state and local governments may
not regulate Indian-run gambling unless Congress gives them
permission.
   The Muscogee Creek bingo game is conducted in Tulsa on a
100-acre area known as the Mackey site along the Arkansas River.
   The 10th Circuit court said the land is Indian territory in the
same way any reservation belongs to native Americans.
   The appeals court also said the fact that the bingo game is
managed by a non-tribal entity _ Indian Country, USA Inc. _ hired
by the tribe does not alter the exempt status of the gambling
operation.
   Forcing the tribe to collect and remit the sales tax would place
a heavy burden on the Indians even if the tax did not affect
revenue for the Creeks, the appeals court added.
   It said the tribe would be subject to fines and liens on its
property if it were held responsible for collecting the tax and
then failed to do so.
   The case is Oklahoma Tax Commission vs. Muscogee Creek Nation,
87-1068.

   Former Army football star Peter
Dawkins today announced his candidacy for the GOP Senate nomination
in a bid to unseat Democratic Frank Lautenberg, saying New Jersey
needs to improve its environment, education, employment and trade.
   ``We've gone from being a state that was written off to a state
being written up. And we're ready to climb even higher to become
the very best,'' said Dawkins, who was a Rhodes scholar and Vietnam
War hero after he graduated from West Point.
   He is the first candidate to announce his candidacy in the June
7 Republican primary.
   ``We can't be satisfied until the opportunity and prosperity
that has reached some, reaches all,'' Dawkins said. ``We can't
forget those people caught in the forgotten pockets of poverty in
Camden, in Trenton, in Newark, where too often the real growth
industries have been drugs and crime and disappointment.''
   Both Dawkins and Lautenberg already have raised millions and are
employing top national political strategists.
   Republicans claim Lautenberg, seeking his second six-year term,
is among the most vulnerable incumbents in the Senate. Democrats
counter that the millionaire businessman has compiled an impressive
record.
   Dawkins has never sought elected office, but has spent more than
a year planting the seeds of his candidacy around the state.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
Little Rock, Ark., man's criminal conviction thrown out because
police did not tell him specifically about his right to free legal
help.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a state Supreme Court
ruling that so-called Miranda warnings given before police question
criminal suspects must mention that right.
   Michael E. Mayfield was convicted in 1985 of robbing a Little
Rock store. When arrested and read his rights, Mayfield had
confessed.
   The standard warning then used by Little Rock police said a
suspect has the right to remain silent or to talk with a lawyer
``either retained by me or appointed by the court'' before giving a
statement.
   Such police warnings have been given since 1966 when the Supreme
Court ruled in a case called Miranda vs. Arizona that the Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination requires them.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court, ruling last Sept. 28 that Mayfield
is entitled to a new trial, said his confession should not have
been used as evidence against him.
   The state court said an indigent criminal suspect must ``be
informed that he has just as much right to representation by an
attorney as a person who can afford one.''
   Earlier last year, the Arkansas court upheld a police warning
that stated, ``If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed
for you, before any questioning if you wish.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Arkansas Attorney General Steve
Clark told the justices the state court ruling is inconsistent with
their 1981 decision that the warnings given by police do not have
to follow the Miranda decision verbatim.
   The 1981 decision, however, involved a case in which a criminal
suspect was told about his ``right to have a lawyer appointed to
represent you at no cost to yourself.''
   The case acted on today is Arkansas vs. Mayfield, 87-1105.

   Jewish leaders have presented a
5,180-signature petition to the Israeli consul general recommending
a ban on television coverage of Israeli-Arab conflicts in the
occupied territories.
   Israeli Consul General Rahamim Timor accepted the petition
Sunday at Temple Emeth near Delray Beach.
   ``Good friends can give us advice,'' Timor told the audience of
400. ``Any recommendations, suggestions and advice will be studied
and considered.''
   Rabbi Leon Fink and Cantor David Leon led the petition drive
that blamed television coverage for sparking more violence on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Graphic television footage of recent Palestinian demonstrations
against Israeli rule has been shown around the world. The footage
has shown stone-throwing by Palestinians and Israeli retaliation,
including tear gas attacks, gunfire and brutal beatings.
   Seventy-four Palestianians have died in the protests since Dec.
8, according to United Nations figures.
   ``We're not against the press, but there's a major difference
between the camera and the press,'' said Leon, adding that
television footage gives a distorted view of the entire conflict.
``You get a completely different picture from the print.''
   ``If you think that stoning and firebombing in the Middle East
is a new thing, you are wrong,'' he said. ``We are concerned, we
should not be excited.''
   Timor said that occasionally, excessive force is used, ``but
this is war.''
   ``We shall not commit suicide,'' he said. ``If the public
relations is not nice, then they are not nice, but we shall
survive.''

   A tourist was in intensive care today
after falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in the first such
incident in the college spring-break season.
   David Irwin and several friends stepped out onto the balcony
after hearing a firecracker go off Sunday night. Irwin, 23, reached
for a railing but missed, his friends told police. He fell to the
pool deck.
   It was not known whether Irwin was a college student. Manager
Neal Hughes of the Hawaiian Inn in Daytona Beach Shores Irwin had
traveled alone from Ontario.
   About 500,000 students are expected to visit area beaches this
March and April for spring vacations. Thirty people have fallen
from Daytona Beach-area hotel and motel balconies in the past four
years, mostly during spring break. Six have died.
   Heavy drinking has usually been the reason for the accidents,
officials say.
   The Hawaiian does not allow students on hotel balconies after 11
p.m.
   ``We have had students here for three weeks'' so far this year,
said Hughes. ``They have been real good. They have been real
cooperative about keeping the curfew hours.''

   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, prayed
with ordinary people in church then played with Hollywood
celebrities at a black-tie dinner, where the duchess joked with a
male admirer in the audience.
   The Duke and Duchess of York ended a diverse day of activities
Sunday with the star-studded dinner organized by industrialist
Armand Hammer and Arco Petroleum chief Lodwrick Cooke.
   Among the 700 guests paying $1,000 apiece to dine with British
royalty at the Biltmore Hotel were Zsa Zsa Gabor, her husband
Prince Frederick von Anhalt, ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins, her
date George Hamilton, Burt Bacharach and his wife, Carole Bayer
Sager, actor Michael York and astronaut Buzz Aldrin.
   British actor Roger Moore, the master of ceremonies, joked about
the nature of the royals' trip, quipping that the highlight was
today's visit to a supermarket.
   ``I couldn't help but notice the royal couple will be there on
double coupon day. And just in case you want to do a little
shopping, this one's for disposal diapers,'' Moore said, holding up
a coupon for the couple, whose first child is due this year.
   Their fourth day in Southern California was to start today with
a visit to two British exhibits at the California Museum of Science
and Industry. In the afternoon, attention focuses on promoting
British trade.
   They were to tour the Bullocks Wilshire clothing department
store and visits a Vons supermarket in Arcadia.
   For Sunday night's black-tie event, the duchess arrived in a
strapless black evening gown with a shimmery, puffy orange wrap
draped around her shoulders.
   Allowed to give a few remarks after two lengthy introductions
and a short speech by her husband, Sarah drew applause and some
cheers when she said: ``At last I have a turn to talk _ all these
men.''
   A man from the audience shouted, ``I love you.''
   ``I'll see you later,'' she quipped to more applause and cheers.
   Andrew had gotten in his dig a moment earlier when he
acknowledged Hammer's remark that the couple ``could fly duets'' as
they are both licensed pilots.
   ``You mentioned being able to fly duets,'' the prince said. ``It
is a little bit difficult because we would be fighting for the
controls of the plane.''
   Money raised by the dinner benefits the three-month UK-LA '88
art festival and a fund to salvage books damaged in disastrous 1986
fires at the Los Angeles Central Library. The guests dined on
crepinette of salmon and white fish, with champagne chervil.
   On behalf of the British library board, Andrew brought a gift,
the book Wonders of Creation. Sarah presented the couple's personal
gift, two volumes of the book, ``Royal Heritage,'' bound at Windsor
Castle.
   On Sunday, the day began on a more common note. The couple
attended services at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Long Beach.
   About 300 people lined the sidewalk across from the church to
see the couple.
   ``We love them, we really do,'' said 48-year-old Myrna Dillon,
perched on a stepladder to ctach a glimpse. ``We follow their every
move.''
   Unknown to the royal retinue, officers sweeping the motorcade
route detained a man carrying a .22-caliber rifle.
   John Kasser, 30, of Long Beach, had retrieved the unloaded rifle
from the police station and was headed to his car when Los Angeles
city police officers spotted him, said Long Beach Lt. Rod
Mickelson. The gun had been held for safekeeping for several days
after officers confiscated it during a domestic dispute, Mickelson
said.
   Kasser was later freed and allowed to keep his gun, police said.
   ``There's absolutely no relation between him and the
motorcade,'' Mickelson said.

   Every Saturday morning at Gene's Cafe, over
coffee, grits and country ham biscuits, elders of this small
piedmont town discuss the weather, how to solve the nation's
problems and lately, who should be nominated for president.
   Unlike previous races, they've had plenty of firsthand looks at
the candidates. And their Republican primary votes on Saturday,
along with the rest of South Carolina, will carry unprecedented
weight.
   As George Bush pointed out last week during one of many days
spent in the state:
   ``This state is going to be on the leading edge of the most
significant political event in terms of selecting a president that
we've had in this country in modern times,'' he said, in only a
slight overstatement of the importance of the Super Tuesday
collection of 20 primaries and caucuses three days after South
Carolina votes.
   ``You're going to see the darndest invasion of people who want
to be president that you've ever seen.''
   The Republican candidates are blanketing the state ahead of
Saturday's balloting with an eye toward the state's 37 GOP
delegates, yes, but more importantly, with hopes of a boost going
into Super Tuesday.
   South Carolina's primary falls three days before 20 states,
mostly in the South, choose more than one-third of the delegates to
the national convention in New Orleans.
   ``By going ahead of that, South Carolina has a special place in
the sun. You're going to send a signal, you see, all across the
region. And that signal will reverberate across the country,'' Bush
said.
   Heavy stuff for the boys at Gene's.
   But Claude Crocker said no topic is too big for his crowd.
   ``We talk about international trade policy, the Panama Canal,
the deficit. ... We handle all those high-level things,'' the vice
president of Clinton Mills deadpanned.
   Crocker thinks Bush is the man to beat in his area and in the
state. But Charles ``Buddy'' Oakley said former television
evangelist Pat Robertson can't be counted out.
   ``I think Robertson appeals to a large group of religious-type
people in South Carolina,'' he said.
   Their observations mirror more objective measurements.
   A survey published Sunday by The State newspaper said Bush was
the choice of 48 percent of the voters likely to cast GOP ballots,
Dole 25 percent, Robertson 19 percent and Jack Kemp 3 percent. The
poll, conducted last Monday through Wednesday, surveyed 319 likely
GOP voters.
   But Lee Atwater, a South Carolina native and Bush's national
campaign manager, said Robertson's strength has to be at least
doubled because of the strong turnout of his supporters and the
difficulty in measuring them. Robertson has attracted new voters to
the rolls, and many conservative Democrats are expected to vote in
the GOP primary for him.
   University of South Carolina political professor Earl Black said
``there is an enormous potential for a heavy cross-over vote''
because South Carolina voters don't register by party and because,
this being the second primary ever, there is no historical gauge.
   Robertson has said for months that he is seeking a first-place
finish in South Carolina, where he has a large and fervent
following of fundamentalist Christians. One Robertson stronghold is
PTL's Heritage USA, where more than 1,500 people live.
   South Carolina is a do-or-die state for Kemp, who has yet to
finish better than third in any contest. The New York congressman
is portraying himself here as the conservative alternative, saying
Robertson has no chance of winning the nomination.
   ``South Carolina is George Bush's to lose,'' said Blease Graham,
an associate professor in governmental studies at the University of
South Carolina.
   One issue that could cost Bush votes, Graham said, is his
opposition to legislation that would restrict the growth of textile
imports, which the industry says is causing job losses.
   The industry is running advertisements across the state every
day urging people indirectly to vote for candidates who back the
legislation. Robertson and Dole announced last week that they
support the bill now in the Senate.
   Bush's main strategy in South Carolina has been to promote his
close ties with President Reagan, who remains popular here.
   Turnout in 1980 was 145,000, and party officials estimate that
between 175,000 and 200,000 people will vote Saturday.

<TEXT>
   A man sentenced to death in Utah for his role
in the 1974 killings of three people forced to swallow drain
cleaner before they were shot lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices let stand William Andrews' conviction and death
sentence for the three murders committed during an Aril 22, 1974
robbery of an Ogden store.
   Police said Andrews and Pierre Dale Selby, both stationed at
Hill Air Force Base in Utah, robbed the Hi-Fi Shop. Killed were
Stanley Walker, the store's assistant manager; Michelle Ansley, a
cashier; and Carol Naisbitt, a relative of the store's owner.
   Andrews' lawyers said he was a ``non-triggerman'' participant in
the crime, and that Selby actually murdered the three.
   Selby, from Brooklyn, N.Y., was executed last Aug. 28.
   Andrews, a former resident of Jonesboro, La, contended that he
was denied a fair trial because blacks were excluded from the trial
jury. His appeal also challenged the validity of Utah's death
penalty law on several grounds.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously had rejected
those arguments.
   The case is Andrews vs. Shulsen, 87-5449.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may block a man from trying to prove he fathered the
child of a woman married to someone else.
   The court said it will study a challenge by a man identified in
court records only as Michael H., to a state evidentiary rule
creating a conclusive presumption of fatherhood to a wife's husband.
   Michael H. contends he is the father of a 6-year-old girl,
Victoria, born to a woman identified as Carol D. at a time when
Carol D. was married to Gerald D.
   Michael H. filed in a state court in Los Angeles a ``reverse
paternity'' lawsuit in 1982, seeking to have himself declared
Victoria's father.
   His lawsuit was thrown out because California law, as do laws in
many other states, creates a conclusive presumption of paternity in
favor of a woman's husband if a child is conceived and born during
their marriage.
   In upholding the dismissal of Michael H.'s lawsuit, a state
appeals court said the conclusive presumption is based ``upon a
determination by the Legislature as a matter of overriding social
policy that given a certain relationship between the husband and
wife, the husband is to be held responsible for the child and the
integrity of the family unit should not be impugned.''
   The California Supreme Court had refused to hear Michael H.'s
appeal last July 30.
   The nation's highest court two years ago rejected, without
comment, a similar appeal from a Massachusetts man seeking to prove
he fathered the child of another man's wife.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Michael H. said he
enjoyed ``an ongoing father-child relationship'' with Victoria and
that blood tests show a better than 98 percent chance that Victoria
is his biological daughter.
   The appeal said Victoria was born as a result of an affair
Michael H. and Carol D. had while she was married to Gerald D.
   The appeal also said that Carol D. and Victoria moved to the
Virgin Islands to live with Michael H. for several months in 1982
when she and her husband were estranged.
   Court records indicate that Carol and Gerald D. later resumed
living together.
   The case is Michael H. vs. Gerald D., 87-746.

<HEAD>General Strike In Panama, Delvalle In Hiding</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of strike, quotes. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A general strike started today to
demand the resignation of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but
government intimidation, censorship and the fact that today is
payday apparently hurt its effectiveness.
   The opposition asked the nation's businesses and industries to
close today and remain shut indefinitely.
   Deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle remained in hiding,
defying Noreiga, who ousted Delvalle and ordered him out of the
country.
   Buses, by far the main mode of public transportation, circulated
this morning like any other morning. Most were full, taking people
to work.
   About two-thirds of the stores were open at a commercial center
of more than 100 enterprises on Central Avenue in Panama City.
   Many Panamanian banks were closed by the strike, but
international banks were open.
   Several people consulted by The Associated Press as they stepped
from buses on their way to work mentioned intimidation as a reason
for not observing the strike.
   ``There's fear,'' said a middle-aged man, a bank employee. ``We
lack unity to confront these people who have all the arms and are
disposed to use them.''
   ``The people don't have means to resist,'' said a woman, a
domestic employee, walking with him. ``One has to live as they (the
armed forces) say.''
   The two also noted that today, being the last day of the month,
is payday for many Panamanians.
   Police Chief Col. Leonidas Macias told journalists it would be
understandale if hungry people looted a closed supermarket, and his
forces would not try to prevent them.
   The strike call was supported by the industrial workers' union
of Panama, and its effectiveness appeared to be greater in industry
than in commerce. Most factories in Panama City's industrial zone
were closed.
   Roberto Brenes, a leader of the National Civic Crusade,
predicted Sunday that the strike would do well in manufacturing and
construction, but would be less effective in the service industries.
   Opposition figures also said they expected the strike to pick up
in several days. They said government censorship had slowed word of
the strike.
   Indeed, La Prensa, the leading opposition paper, has been closed
by troops and the newspaper building surrounded by city police.
   Delvalle's relatives would not disclose his whereabouts but they
said he was in a ``safe and secure place'' in Panama, in ``good
spirits'' and determined to regain his job.
   ``I am going to stay here (and) stick it out,'' Delvalle told
ABC television in a telephone interview Saturday night. ``I'm going
to fight it all the way.''
   Roderick Esquivel, Delvalle's vice president, also was in
hiding. Both men were ousted Friday by the National Legislative
Assembly in a move orchestrated by Noriega, chief of Panama's
17,000-member Defense Forces.
   On Thursday, Delvalle ignited the latest crisis in eight months
of civil unrest in Panama when he tried to fire Noriega, charged in
Florida with corruption and narcotics trafficking. The United
States also has urged Noriega to step down as military chief.
   On Friday, Delvalle returned to his home in an upper-class
neighborhood. Police surrounded the house Friday night and
Delvalle's telephones were cut, leaving him under an undeclared
house arrest.
   Sometime that night, he reportedly climbed over a patio wall at
the rear of the house and escaped through a neighbor's yard.
   Opposition leaders said a prolonged strike could create
financial chaos in Panama and force Noriega to resign, paving the
way for Delvalle's return to office and an end to military
domination of the government.
   The pro-government newspapr Critica blared a red-ink banner
headline ``a closed business is a taken-over business.''
   Osvaldo Velasquez, president of the Panama Committee for Human
Rights, predicted the government would ``use state terrorism'' to
``try to counteract the strike.''
   He added: ``One of the means they will resort to is to stimulate
the crowds to get into the stores, to break into the businesses
that dare to close.''
   He said that tactic had been used by the government in previous,
unsuccessful strikes last summer.
   Raul Diaz, Delvalle's brother-in-law, said Sunday that the
former president was telephoning world leaders from hiding to ask
their support.
   Delvalle, he said, was not with his wife and three children, but
all of them were safe. ``They are in one place and he is alone in
another,'' he said.
   The U.S. State Department said on Saturday that some of
Delvalle's children or grandchildren were at the U.S. Embassy or
the home of U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis. The Embassy declined to
comment Sunday on that report.
   In an interview on CBS News' ``60 Minutes'' program, Noriega was
asked where Delvalle was and the general said, ``He's with the
North Americans, with the ambassador of the United States.'' When
he was asked if Delvalle was at the U.S. Embassy, Noriega said,
``At this point we don't know.''
   Delvalle's hopes of regaining his post were dealt a setback
Saturday when the Permanent Council of the Organization of American
States, meeting in Washington, declined to impose trade sanctions
on Panama or approve a resolution condemning the president's ouster
by the military.

<HEAD>Casual User an ``Accomplice to Murder' _ First Lady</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan today called for a crackdown on
casual drug users, saying they are ``an accomplice to murder'' in
the deaths of judges, agents and others who have been killed by
narcotics traffickers.
   ``I want to make it impossible for casual users to escape
responsibility for any innocent deaths due to drugs,'' Mrs. Reagan
said. ``I want to make them fully face the brutality of drug use.''
   The first lady was joined by her husband, President Reagan, at
the White House Conference for a Drug Free America, a meeting
intended to showcase the fight against drugs.
   She said that when she moves back to California next year, ``I'm
not going to give up my interest and concern about this.'' She said
she will continue her efforts at the Nancy Reagan House in Los
Angeles, which is to be run by the Phoenix House.
   In his remarks, the president said that despite all the
publicity about drugs, ``let's keep in mind the progress we've
made.'' He said the number of users is leveling off and may even be
falling.
   ``The tide of the battle has turned and we're beginning to win
the crusade for a drug-free America,'' Reagan said.
   Mrs. Reagan gave a more somber assessment, saying, ``Drugs are
tearing our community apart.'' She said drug traffickers and
dealers will murder anyone who stands in their way.
   In particular, she cited the murder of Colombia's chief
prosecutor, Attorney General Carlos Hoyos, and his two bodyguards
who were abducted last month by a half-dozen gunmen who the
government accused of working for local cocaine barons.
   Hoyos' bullet-riddled body was dumped outside the center of the
nation's drug trade. The body had been blindfolded and handcuffed.
   The government blamed his abduction and death on the Medillin
cartel, which U.S. officials say controls 80 percent of cocaine
entering the United States.
   Mrs. Reagan said that ``the people who casually use cocaine are
responsible beause their money bought those bullets.''
   ``The casual user may think when he takes a line of cocaine or
smokes a joint in the privacy of his nice condo, listening to his
expensive stereo, that he's somehow not bothering anyone,'' she
said.
   ``But there's a trail of death and destruction that leads
directly to his door,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``The casual user cannot
morally escape responsibility for the action of drug traffickers
and dealing.
   ``I'm saying that if you're a casual drug user, you're an
accomplice to murder,'' the first lady said, prompting loud
applause from the audience of anti-drug activists.
   ``The casual users ... also cannot morally escape association
with those who use drugs and then endanger the public safety,'' she
said. ``The message from casual use is that drugs are acceptable,
that they can be handled, that somehow it's simply a matter of
dosage.
   ``Casual use sets the tone for tolerance and that tolerance can
kill,'' she said, recalling a train crash in Maryland last year
that killed 16 people and injured 175 others. She noted that an
investigation determined that a train engineer and brakeman had
smoked marijuana.

   All five members of one family were found
dead early today in their burning home, and authorities said
investigators were treating the deaths as homicides.
   ``They were obviously not killed by the fire,'' said Livingston
County Sheriff Richard Kane. He said that it might have been a
murder-suicide, and that a 16-gauge shotgun was found near the
father's body.
   ``Obviously, two scenarios come to mind: murder-suicide is one,
and the other is that another person was involved in committing
these acts,'' said Kane.
   The fire, discovered just before midnight by neighbors, was
``highly suspicious,'' Kane said.
   Kane identified the victims as Lawrence Delabarto, 32; his wife,
Linda, also 32; and their children, Anthony, 12, Danielle 10, and
Dominic, 6. He said the three young children and the father were
found shot; Mrs. Delaberto was apparently strangled.
   ``It's the entire family,'' Kane said. ``They were all dead.''
   Firefighters in this hamlet about 10 miles south of Geneseo
found the five bodies in their bedrooms, Kane said.
   Kevin Niedermaier, chief of the Groveland Volunteer Fire
Department, said it took two hours to bring the fire under control.
   The father of the family worked for a wholesale liquor company
in the area, Kane said.

   Panama's ambassador to the United States said
today that efforts by the newly installed government in Panama to
replace him will not succeed.
   Following the ouster last Friday of President Eric Arturo
Delvalle, the successor government appointed the second ranking
official at Panama's U.N. Embassy, Leonardo Kam, to succeed
Ambassador Juan B. Sosa.
   The U.N. Embassy said that Kam was in Washington today but Sosa
said he had heard nothing from the envoy.
   Sosa said in a telephone interview that the ouster of Delvalle
by the National Assembly, dominated by forces loyal to military
strongman Manuel Noriega, was unconstitutional. Sosa said he
continues to regard Delvalle as Panama's president.
   ``I hope not to hear from Mr. Kam,'' Sosa said. ``It would be a
very embarrassing situation. He would be representing an
unconstitutional government. He would be wasting his time.''
   Asked about the status of other embassy diplomats, Sosa said,
``The Panamanian Embassy is loyal to its ambassador and the
ambassador is loyal to President Delvalle.''
   He said the representative of Panama's Defense Forces at the
embassy, Capt. Jose S. Motta, continues to serve at his post. He
added that Motta reports to the Defense Forces and not to the
ambassador.

   The U.S. Naval Observatory is looking for help
in sighting the moon.
   While nearly anyone can see the huge full moon, the astronomers
are trying to determine just how soon after a new moon the first
faint crescent of moonlight becomes visible to observers.
   To help determine just how quickly that occurs, the observatory
has scheduled an experiment for July 14.
   The new moon will occur at 7:53 p.m. EDT July 13, and observers
are being asked to look for the first visibility of the moon on the
following night.
   The observatory wants residents of the United States, Canada,
the Caribbean and Central America to begin looking for the new moon
about 40 minutes after sunset July 14 and to record and report
their results.
   Persons willing to take part can get details by writing to
``Looking for the Moon,'' U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C.,
20392-5100.
   First moon sightings have been reported as early as 18 hours
after new moon _ that time each month when the moon is completely
obscured bu the Earth blocking the sun's light. But such early
sightings are considered extremely difficult.
   Being able to pinpoint first visibility of the moon is important
in several foreign cultures, the observatory reports. In Islam, for
instance, the end of one month and the beginning of the next occurs
when the moon is first visible, and being able to predict that
moment will help in preparing calendars.

   One of three men arrested on capital murder
warrants in the shooting death of an off-duty police officer had
previously pleaded guilty to an assault on another police officer
and was on parole, authorities said.
   Another of the men arrested was on parole after a robbery
conviction.
   ``This is rather indicative of how the criminal justice system
is working,'' Capt. John Holt said Sunday.
   The officer's death was the seventh in six shootings involving
police this year. In addition to three dead police officers, four
civilians have been killed by police this year.
   Vincent Edward Cooks, 23, was arrested Sunday in Houston, and
Tony Ray Harvey, 23, and Tracy Dewayne Stallworth, 27, were
arrested Saturday, Holt said at a news conference Sunday.
   Holt and Lt. Ron Waldrop told reporters that other details of
the arrests were not available because the investigation into the
death of officer Gary D. McCarthy was continuing.
   Cooks began serving a five-year sentence in December 1986 and
was paroled on Aug. 4, 1987. He initially was charged with
attempted capital murder of a police officer, but Houston police
Sgt. V.W. West said Cooks pleaded no contest in September 1985 to a
reduced charge of aggravated assault.
   Harvey was paroled Jan. 18 after serving 18 months of a six-year
sentence for aggravated robbery and unauthorized use of a motor
vehicle, Holt said.
   Harvey was being held in lieu of $500,000 bond while bond was
set at $300,000 for Stallworth. Cooks was to be returned to Dallas
from Houston, said an officer who refused to give his name.

   The government has some sweet news for
candy-loving Poles: the rationing of chocolate will be lifted on
Tuesday.
   Newspapers on Monday printed an official announcement on the end
of the rationing, but no explanation was given for the decision.
   Under the rationing system, parents could only buy 7 ounces of
chocolate a month for each child under 16 _ about two candy bars a
month.
   Adult chocolate-lovers did not receive a monthly ration for
themselves.
   Until now, the only recourse was to buy chocolate on the black
market, in private shops or in government-run Western currency
stores for prices several times higher than the government-set
price for Polish-made chocolate products.
   Meat is the only food product still rationed in Poland. Since
introducing widespread food rationing in 1980-81, the government
has gradually lifted restrictions on purchases of grain products,
butter and cooking fats, alcohol, cigarettes and sugar. Gasoline is
still rationed for private car owners.

   Three vehicles packed with people crashed

26 others, authorities said.
   Many of the victims were supporters of political candidates
going to Nakuru to see the office-seekers present papers for the
March 21 general election.
   According to witnesses, one overcrowded pickup truck tried to
pass another, but rammed into an oncoming minibus.
   The injured were taken to Nakuru Provincial General Hospital,
where 11 were admitted and 15 were treated and released.
   The accident occurred about 8 a.m. on a road outside Nakuru,
which is 100 miles northwest of Nairobi.
   Small covered pickup trucks and minibuses or vans are the most
popular form of public transportation in Kenya. The brightly
colored vehicles, known as ``matatus,'' are criticized as
deathtraps because of their overcrowding and reckless drivers.

   James G. Radakovich liked to dance with his
wife at the local Serbian club and take care of his Cadillac and
his yard, said those who knew him.
   No one knows what led to the shootings Saturday that claimed the
life of Radakovich, his wife and their sons, both college students.
Police say Radakovich shot them dead and then himself.
   ``You never know what goes on inside a family,'' said Richard
Grilli, a neighbor.
   ``Something happened. He just cracked up,'' said Joseph
Bergamasco, a police officer in this working-class Pittsburgh
suburb.
   Mary Radakovich, 57, was found on the livingroom floor. One son,
James L., 21, was in his bed, and Paul, 19, was on the floor of
their bedroom.
   Radakovich, 54, a retired steelworker, died of a single gunshot
wound in the head and was found beside his younger son, authorities
said. He had two notes in a pocket of his pajamas, one a will, the
other burial instructions.
   ``The note said he was sorry for what he is doing, but possibly
they would all be better off wherever they were going. But it gave
no reason,'' said Bergamasco.
   Investigators found no signs of struggle.
   ``Whether he was depressed, I don't know, but he didn't show
it,'' said Samuel Budich, Mrs. Radakovich's brother.
   ``He was always a good husband to my sister,'' Budich said.
``Two weeks ago he was dancing the `colo' down at the Narodi Dom.''
   The deaths were discovered after James' girlfriend alerted her
father that all three family cars were parked at the home but no
one was answering the door. Police found two .22-caliber pistols, a
revolver and an automatic.
   Radakovich was laid off from the Homestead Works of USX Corp.
two years ago, and had a good pension, relatives said. He caddied
at the Oakmont Country Club for extra money.
   ``He took up golf when he was laid off,'' said Grilli. ``He'd
have a beer now and then, but I never saw him drunk. He took care
of his house and his lawn. He was nice, quiet.''

   Northern Africa and the Sahel region are facing the
threat of an invasion by desert locusts that could cause widespread
destruction of crops and pastures, a U.N. group reported Monday.
   About 2.5 million acres have been infested in northern
Mauritania, said the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, which
issued an appeal to international donors for two spraying aircraft
and 39,000 gallons of pesticide.
   ``Successful control of infestations in northern Mauritania
would greatly reduce the risks of substantial invasion of Morocco
and Algeria to the north and of the Sahel zone to the south,'' the
FAO said in its appeal.
   Major control efforts have been under way in Morocco and several
other countries in the past several months, the FAO said.
   Small infestations have also been detected in Sudan, near the
Red Sea coast, but these are under control, it added.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
opening an emergency session of the General Assembly today, urged
the United States not to close the U.N. Mission of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and to respect the United Nations.
   ``This question has immediate and profound importance for the
United Nations,'' he said as the 159-member assembly reconvened a
three-day session to condemn the U.S. plan to close the PLO Mission
under a new anti-terrorist law.
   ``The PLO is an invitee of the United Nations and the United
States is obliged by its U.N. Headquarters Agreement to permit
accredited PLO personnel to enter and remain in the U.S. and carry
out their official functions,'' the U.N. chief said.
   Perez de Cuellar said he hoped the United States could reconcile
its domestic legislation with its international obligations.
   Both the State Department and the United Nations say the new
anti-terrorism law that would close the mission by March 22
violates the 1947 Headquarters Agreement between the United States
and the United Nations. It allows all missions to operation.
   Still, the Justice Department reportedly intends to go ahead and
order the mission closed, although legal maneuvering is expected to
keep the mission open for as long as a year.
   Twenty-two speakers, including the PLO ambassador and the envoys
of the Soviet Union, Jordan, Egypt and Syria, were to speak today
before the assembly.
   In the unusual session, the United States, the largest U.N.
contributor, was expected to be lectured and rebuked by the world
body, which recognizes the PLO.
   The head of the U.N. Arab Group said Sunday that if the United
States insists on closing the legal PLO Mission, operating under
international treaty, then the General Assembly should vote to
leave New York and relocate in Geneva.
   ``I don't exclude any idea of shifting the General Assembly, the
Security Council and other key bodies dealing with the Middle East,
if the U.S. goes ahead with closure,'' said Ambassador Karim
Ebrahim Al-Shakar of Bahrain.
   ``I would hope it will not reach that point,'' he said. ``But
that depends on the will and good intention of the host country,
the United States.''
   Without the PLO, recognized as the legitimate U.N.
representative of the Palestinian people, the United Nations cannot
hold discussions on the Middle East, said the Bahrain envoy, head
of the 21-nation Arab Group.
   Most other diplomats and the PLO said it was unlikely that the
United Nations would leave New York.
   The three-day session is expected to approve resolutions calling
on the United States to allow the 13-year-old PLO Mission to
operate, as legally required by treaty with the United Nations. It
also may seek a ruling against the United States by the
International Court of Justice.
   The State Department and U.N. lawyers both say the plan to shut
the PLO Mission under a new anti-terrorist law is illegal and
violates the 1947 Headquarters Agreement between the United States
and the United Nations.
   U.S. prestige and influence at the United Nations are at an
all-time low over the Reagan administration's withholding of more
than $250 million in U.N. budget dues. The United States has also
sided with Israel and South Africa on key issues.
   The United States is the largest U.N. contributor, paying about
one-quarter of the annual budget of $800 million. But the United
States has failed to pay its dues because Congress has not
appropriated full funding. American critics say the organization is
inefficient and biased against the United States.

   Matt and Ben Kearney did more homework, read
more books and spent more time with their parents while facing the
ultimate challenge, an entire year without television.
   It came to a festive end at a family party when their father,
lawyer Mike Kearney, handed each boy a packet of 10 $50 bills tied
up in a red ribbon and then turned the television set back on at
7:30 p.m. Thursday.
   ``It feels real weird,'' said 9-year-old Matt, flipping channels
quickly between the Olympics, ``Jeopardy'' and ``Magnum P.I.'' ``It
feels like I'm not supposed to be doing it.''
   Kearney got the idea about the year without television when he
read about a New Jersey boy whose mother offered him $500 to turn
off the set for a year.
   ``Every day they'd get up in the morning and watch TV until they
went to school,'' Kearney said. ``Then they'd come home and watch
it the rest of the day. On weekends they'd watch it until their ...
eyes bugged out.''
   It took the two brothers about ``two seconds'' to take their
father up on the challenge, Ben, 11, said.
   The first days were the hardest. ``The first night we sort of
played more and then went to bed,'' Ben said. ``And then the next
morning we got up and thought, `What are we going to watch?' And
then we remembered we couldn't.''
   Their mother, Shannon Kearney, saw the project as an exercise in
self control. The rest of the family, including 5-year-old Patrick,
had continued watching television.
   The boys plan to spend part of their money on a home video game
and save the rest.

   A graduate of Texas A&M, whose alumni are
dubbed Aggies and are the butt of some farming jokes in Texas, has
some of his fields under water and dumps hay on them, leading some
anonymous wag to proclaim it an ``Aggie Hay Farm.''
   But John Gaulding, 41, is not trying to grow hay. He's feeding
crawfish.
   Gaulding farms about 1,200 acres about 60 miles east of Houston
and leases about 300 acres to people who raise the freshwater
crustaceans, especially popular in Cajun cuisine.
   He said he didn't appreciate it when a sign with the message
``Aggie Hay Farm'' mysteriously appeared in front of his land in
October.
   ``At first, it seemed like a harmless prank,'' Gaulding said
Sunday. ``I had no idea who did it. I don't know if they really
even knew that it was a crawfish farm.''
   ``We left it up for a couple of days. People were asking us to
leave it up, and there was so much talk, finally we decided we
would,'' he said. ``I figured if A&M could win the Cotton Bowl, I
could put up with a little kidding about it.''

   Pain and punishment are more than mere agenda
items to Armando Valladares, a human rights ambassador with a
resume written by two decades of imprisonment.
   Valladares is the chief U.S. delegate to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission. He is among the delegates from 43 nations who are
meeting here to discuss human rights violations.
   But as a political prisoner in Cuba for 22 years, he is far from
a typical ambassador.
   When he talks about torture, he points to broken bones that
never healed quite right. When he talks about prison life, he
displays scars left on his hands by hungry rats.
   When he discusses desperation, he can recall being denied pens
and pencils in prison, and writing a poem in his blood.
   When the topic is cruelty, he talks about forgiveness.
   ``I do not hate anyone,'' he said, ``not even those who tortured
me, because I think that hatred kills the person who feels it. I
would say ultimately that those years were a struggle between love
and hatred and love always triumphs.''
   Valladares, 50, a U.S. citizen for slightly more than a year, is
his country's latest weapon in a struggle to get the commission to
discuss alleged human rights violations in Cuba.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Valladares said the
effort is a struggle ``against a selective sensitivity'' in the
commission, which routinely condemns human rights violations in
Israeli-occupied territories, South Africa and Chile.
   But his appointment as chief U.S. delegate session has angered
the Cuban government, which denounces Valladares as an impostor who
never was tortured or paralyzed during his prison tenure.
   Valladares is a slightly built man with intense eyes under a
shock of dark hair just beginning to turn gray. He is the father of
two boys, one 3 and one nearly 2, and the husband of a woman he met
in prison when she came to visit her father. They were married
behind bars.
   He was just 23 when he was sentenced to a 30-year term for what
he says were anti-communist remarks. In a book about his
experiences, ``Against All Hope,'' he said prisoners were
systematically tortured and denied proper medical care.
   He said at one point, following a 46-day hunger strike in 1974,
he developed polyneuropathy, a nervous system deterioration that
confined him to a wheelchair for five years.
   At that time he began writing poetry and smuggling it out of
prison to his wife, Martha, then living in the United States, he
said.
   He won his freedom in October 1982 after French President
Francois Mitterrand intervened in his case. Just a month after
obtaining U.S. citizenship, he was added to the U.S. human rights
delegation.
   The chief Cuban delegate, Raul Roa Kouri, told a news conference
that Valladares' book was ``full of lies.''
   The Cuban government held similar news conferences in Washington
and Mexico City and distributed pamphlets rejecting what it said
were lies by the State Department about Valladares' past.
   ``It is an attack against me, a man, because they cannot refute
the violations of human rights that are happening in their
country,'' responds Valladares.
   Although his mother and sister live in Miami, his 77-year-old
father remains in Cuba.
   ``He lives in the center of the island and often the authorities
tell him to pack all his things because he is leaving Cuba. Then he
travels all the way to Havana and they tell him it was an error,''
said Valladares.
   He said his father also is denied treatment for an eye ailment
that has left him nearly blind.
   ``I think that the Cuban government is moving this way against
him thinking perhaps that I will change my attitude. I will not do
that,'' he said.
   What he does do is bring a dramatic air of realism to the
commission.
   Speaking recently on torture, Valladares said: ``I remember when
they had me in a punishment cell, naked, my leg fractured in
several places _ fractures that were never treated and eventually
fused into a mass of deformed bones.
   ``Through the wire mesh that covered the cell, the guards would
pour over me buckets of urine and excrement that they had collected
earlier.''
   International condemnation of such acts, he said ``is the only
thing capable of pressuring the torturers.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities said today that a small
wooden boat carrying illegal aliens from the Dominican Republic
sank in rough seas off the west coast of Puerto Rico. A survivor
was quoted as saying more than 40 people were aboard.
   Elmer Hasker, deputy district director for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in San Juan, said one illegal alien was in
INS custody, another hospitalized, two bodies had been recovered
and another had been spotted but washed away before it could be
retrieved.
   One of the two known survivors ``has stated that there were
approximately 40 people on the boat,'' Hasker said in a telephone
interview in San Juan. ``We don't know anything about their
situation ... whether they drowned or made it to shore is unknown
at this point.''
   The boat sank during the weekend off Aguada, about 85 miles west
of the capital San Juan. At the time, the seas were very rough and
it was very windy.
   In a telephone interview from Aguada, police spokeswoman Evelyn
Crespo said a survivor told authorities there were 45 people on the
boat, including 37 men and eight women.
   Police said the two bodies were of two girls, one 14, the other
16.
   Ms. Crespo said one of the survivors reported the group left
from the province of Higuey, on the southeastern tip of the
Dominican Republic, early Saturday. The survivors were rescued
around 10 p.m. Sunday, she said.
   There was no information available on why the boat sank. Hasker
said the boat apparently sank Sunday night.
   ``The boat has washed ashore so it was close enough that it
didn't disintegrate,'' Hasker said.
   Estimates on the length of the boat ranged from 20 to 30 feet.
   This morning a vessel from the Commonwealth Maritime Police
searched the waters off Aguada for survivors and bodies, and INS
and local officials searched the land, INS Border Patrol Agent Luis
Garcia in a telephone interview from Aguadilla, about five miles
from Aguada.
   Garcia said some clothes had been found along the beach in
Aguada but there was no way of knowing whether they belonged to
those aboard the boat that sank.
   In October, as many as 100 Dominicans are believed to have died
when their boat sank about three miles off the north east coast of
the Dominican Republic as they started their journey to Puerto Rico.
   Hundreds of Dominicans leave their country each year in wooden
boats to make the dangerous crossing to Puerto Rico, where they
hope to find jobs and a better life.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up Case of Fired NSC Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether employees of a Pentagon intelligence agency are entitled to
administrative hearings when they are fired as security risks.
   The justices said they will hear Reagan administration arguments
that those who work for the National Security Agency are not
entitled to such procedural protection.
   The case raises issues similar to those in a case decided
Tuesday by the high court.
   In that ruling, the court said the Merit Systems Protection
Board _ which provides job protection to federal workers _ lacks
authority to reinstate an employee fired for lacking a security
clearance. The court upheld the firing of a laborer at a Navy
installation.
   In the case acted on today, the justices will review a ruling
that granted an administrative hearing to an unidentified NSA
employee who said he was fired because he engaged in homosexual
activities.
   The employee, identified only as John Doe, works with secret
codes for the spy agency.
   He told his superiors in 1982 that he had homosexual relations
with several foreigners during vacation travels abroad.
   After a psychiatric evaluation, the NSA _in a decision upheld by
the defense secretary _ ordered him fired on grounds his
``indiscriminate'' sexual activities posed a security risk since he
had access in his job to the most secret type of classified
information. The agency said the fact the acts were homosexual was
not the determining factor.
   Doe then filed a federal court suit, claiming the Department of
Defense violated a federal civil service law entitling him to an
administrative hearing.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with him in a ruling
last June.
   The appeals court said, ``As the government acknowledges, in
this case the (defense) secretary has not found that a hearing
would itself contravene national security. Accordingly, (Doe) is
entitled by law to that hearing.''
   Caspar Weinberger was secretary of defense at the time of Doe's
firing. Since then, he has been succeeded by Frank Carlucci.
   The case is Carlucci vs. Doe, 87-751.

<HEAD>Botha: Government May Agree to Remove Union Jack From Flag</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha suggested
Monday that his government might comply with a demand by some
British lawmakers that the Union Jack be removed from the South
African flag.
   Members of all three main parties in Britain's Parliament,
citing Botha's latest crackdown on black oppositon, urged their
government on Saturday to request that a replica of the British
flag be removed from the South African flag.
   The Union Jack and the flags of two South African provinces are
displayed in the center of South Africa's flag as symbols of the
country's past.
   ``The flag of South Africa not only relates to our history but
is indeed a symbol of national unity and nationhood,'' Botha said.
``It is surprising that the agitation against the South African
flag from Britain is not taking into consideration the feelings of
the English-speaking South Africans.''
   ``But if the British government wishes to interfere with the
composition of a South Africa symbol on this basis, the question
may be asked whether the South African Parliament should not give
this matter its serious attention.''
   Designed 60 years ago, the South African flag was intended to
show how the country was formed by a merger of British-controlled
territory and the former Afrikaner republics of Transvaal and the
Orange Free State. The mainly Dutch-descended Afrikaners make up
about 60 percent of the 5 million whites, while most of the others
have British ancestry.
   The British and Afrikaners battled each in the Boer War that
ended in 1902, and strains between the two still surface.

<HEAD>Former Dissident Starts Basic Training For Civil Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, who
immigrated to Israel in 1986 after serving nine years in a Soviet
prison, has begun basic military training, an associate said Monday.
   Sharansky reported Sunday to a military base near Tel Aviv for
three weeks of training, said Yuri Stern, a spokesman for the
Soviet Jewry Information Center, a private lobbying group.
   Sharansky, 40, will join Israel's civil guard, rather than the
regular army, because of his age and poor health, said Stern.
   Civil guard members serve in Israel, and their duties include
patrolling population centers and guarding holy sites, such as the
Western Wall, the last remnant of the second Jewish Temple
destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
   Like all Israeli men, Sharansky will be called up for several
weeks of reserve duty once a year, Stern said.
   Stern said Sharansky was ``proud to fulfill his duty of
defending the country.''
   However, Stern added, Sharansky ``will be no more than a private
in the army, while his true battlefield is the campaign for the
release of Soviet Jews. That's where he is a general.''
   Since coming to Israel, Sharansky spent most of his time
studying Hebrew, lecturing on the plight of Soviet Jews and writing
his memoirs, Stern said.
   Sharansky, one of the Soviet Union's most prominent dissidents,
served nine years in a Soviet jail on espionage charges. He was
freed in February 1986 in an East-West spy swap after his wife,
Avital, campaigned for his release throughout the West.

<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two nuns are suing the nephew of
their mother superior, claiming he embezzled their community
property and holy relics.
   The lawsuit was filed in El Paso County District Court on behalf
of the Carmelite Monastery of the Sacred Hearts, an independent
community no longer recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. Named
as defendant was Jose de la luz Sanchez of Albuquerque, N.M., who
once was the nuns' legal conservator.
   ``I'm not worried because none of that is true,'' said Sanchez,
65. ``Every time they ran out of money they sure knew who to call.
I never refused them because, frankly, my wife and I have no kids
and they're all we have.''
   The lawsuit filed last week accuses Sanchez, who is retired from
New Mexico's highway department, of theft, fraud and breach of
fiduciary duty.
   It says he transferred the sisters' community assets, including
a $150,000 promissory note, to his own name; that he took items
such as the nuns' car, wheelbarrow and organ; and that he told the
nuns he was looking after them for free but ``billed the community
thousands of dollars for his time.''
   ``Mr. Sanchez has gone so far as to deprive the nuns of their
chalices, monstrance and holy relics,'' according to the complaint
filed by two Denver lawyers, Roger P. Thomasch and Mark Wielga, who
have never met the sisters in person.
   The nuns, who follow religious vows that permit little contact
with outsiders, declined comment.
   Sanchez is the nephew of Mother Helen Chavez, 79, the leader of
the community, and Mother Agnes Chavez, 86, who live in Albuquerque.
   The suit was filed by Mother Josephine Florence, 76, and Sister
Theresa Schull, 79, who apparently have separated from Sanchez's
aunts and are struggling to establish themselves in Colorado
Springs.
   Since the late 1970s, the suit says, the nuns have lived in
three states while searching for a permanent home. They left
Burnet, Texas, in 1978 for Bryan, Texas. Later they moved to
Gallup, N.M., and to Albuquerque. Then they moved to Colorado
Springs.
   The two nuns living in Albuquerque are in nursing homes and
receive some Social Security.
   The nuns follow the rules of the larger Discalced Nuns of the
Order of Our Blessed Lady of Mount Carmel, but their group is no
longer affiliated with the larger order, said Bishop Jerome
Hastrich of Gallup, N.M.
   He said they were ordered by the Vatican to disband several
years ago.
   ``They didn't have unity,'' said Hastrich. ``The Mother was
about 80, and she was unable to control the group. About half were
in their 70s and 80s, and half were quite young.''
   He found other homes for about 16 nuns, but said the four elders
refused to separate from the community.

   Acting Gov. Rose Mofford held to a regular
schedule Monday as the Senate began its impeachment trial of Evan
Mecham.
   Mrs. Mofford held a routine 9 a.m. staff meeting, said her press
secretary, Athia Hardt.
   ``The only TV we have is in my office, and I don't expect it to
be on most of the day,'' Ms. Hardt said. ``We'll probably just
catch it like everybody else when we go home at night.''
   Mrs. Mofford has told department heads not to watch the trial
and her Department of Administration director has instructed state
employees not to watch it during work hours, Ms. Hardt said.
   Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat elected as secretary of state, became
acting governor when the House impeached Mecham, the elected
Republican governor, on charges he illegally concealed a $350,000
campaign loan, misused $80,000 in state money and obstructed
justice.
   Mecham, who says he is innocent, also faces a recall election in
May and a criminal trial next month on six felony charges stemming
from the campaign loan.
   Mrs. Mofford would become governor should Mecham be convicted at
either trial. Should Mecham lose the recall, the opponent who
received the most votes would become governor.

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Die; Israeli Settlers Urge Tough Policy</HEAD>

   Israeli troops shot a Palestinian dead Monday
and another died of earlier wounds. Jewish settlers urged even
tougher polices in the occupied lands, where 12 weeks of violence
have cost at least 76 Arab lives.
   The peace mission of Secretary of State George P. Shultz ran
into trouble. Sources said Jordanian leaders, who believe
Palestinians are entitled to their own negotiating team, rejected
talking with Israel as part of a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, military commander of the West Bank,
said Israel has four times as many soldiers there as it did before
riots began Dec. 8. In keeping with army policy, he gave no figures.
   The latest deaths brought to 76 the number of Palestinians
killed, according to U.N. figures, most of them shot by Israeli
soldiers. Hundreds have been wounded.
   Israeli measures to quell what Palestinians now call ``the
uprising'' have been criticized abroad. Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said Monday those who censure Israel from outside ``like to
see us beaten and hate to see us defending ourselves with force and
remaining alive.''
   ``Nations which said nothing when we were brought to the
slaughterhouses are now going wild when they see rioters receiving
their due punishment,'' he told reporters in northern Israel.
``It's hard to understand the injustice in these reactions.''
   Some Cabinet members have said journalists should be banned from
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Shamir did not reject
the idea. ``If it becomes clear that indeed it may limit the
damage, I would be willing to consider it,'' he said.
   Jewish settlers distributed 3,000 leaflets in Palestinian towns,
working overnight to avoid clashes with Arabs, that warned of tough
Israeli action against Arab agitators.
   ``Don't be mistaken enough to think we are turning the other
cheek,'' said the leaflets from the nationalist group Gush Emunin.
``The days when Jewish blood was cheap are long gone, as is the day
of the slogan `Slaughter the Jews.' Don't mistake our intention. We
are staying here forever.''
   Gush Emunim urged Israel to impose emergency laws in the West
Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the
territories.
   Noam Arnon, spokesman for Gush Emunim, said: ``Anyone who lifts
a rock ... puts his life on the line. The Arabs have to be told
this. We don't have to wait until, God forbid, Jews will be burned
in a bus. We must do this now.''
   Hospital officials said two Palestinians were wounded by gunfire
in the Gaza Strip and 50 Arab women and children threw stones at
soldiers in the West Bank city of Ramallah, taunting them with
chants of ``We are the PLO!''
   Troops used tear gas and fired shots into the air in Ramallah,
and arrested two young Arabs, Associated Press photographer Martin
Cleaver said.
   In Burin, a West Bank village of about 1,400 three miles south
of Nablus, 50 Palestinians attacked an army jeep with stones and
iron bars, the army said. The report said soldiers fired tear gas
and rubber bullets to no effect, then used live ammunition and
Yasser Daoud Eid, 18, was fatally shot in the neck.
   The second death Monday was of Mahmoud Batwi, 30, who died of a
gunshot wound to the head suffered four days earlier during a
protest in Jenin, a West Bank town.
   Two Jewish settlers suspected of killing two Arabs on Saturday
were freed on bail. Also released were four soldiers who were shown
in a CBS News videotape to be beating two Palestinians for more
than half an hour near Nablus last week. Authorities said
investigations would continue in both cases.
   Hananiya Schneider, 45, and Moshe Bahagon, 37, both of the Neve
Tzuf settlement, were released on bail of 2,500 shekels each (about
$1,500).
   They are suspected of killing the two Palestinians in Abud after
residents of the village barricaded the main road.
   At Kibbutz Gesher in northern Israel, home of one of the
soldiers involved in the beating, friends and relatives of Sgt.
Saguy Harpaz, 20, accused Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of giving
ambiguous orders to young soldiers.

   A salvage crew continued pumping oil
today from an upside-down barge that was raised one month after it
sank in Guemes Channel and spilled about 70,000 gallons of heavy
bunker oil into inland waters.
   After the delicate lifting procedure Sunday, the inverted barge
was held at the surface by cables strung from two cranes as crews
began pumping the remaining 344,000 gallons of oil aboard into a
second barge.
   Coast Guard officials said this morning that one compartment of
the oil barge contained mostly water, raising the possibility that
more oil leaked than previously thought.
   ``It appears the structural integrity of the tank may be
breached,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Eldo DeLong.
   Coast Guard Guard Chief Petty Officer Roy Compton said that as
oil was pumped out of the barge's six tanks, air would be pumped in
until the barge floated on its own.
   As of 8:40 a.m., an estimated 68,976 gallons had been pumped out
of the damaged barge.
   A small oil sheen marked the spot where the barge surfaced
Sunday morning. Mark Stewart of the state Division of Emergency
Management said roughly 500 to 1,000 gallons of lightweight oil had
spilled.
   Surface skimmer boats had cleaned up about 160 gallons, while
absorbent pads collected more of the spill, he said.
   Most of the barge's cargo is heavier-than-water bunker oil.
   State Ecology Department spokesman Ats Kiuchi said it appeared
the fragile, inner coastal environment had avoided a disaster.
   ``We're dealing with a lot of unknowns here. It's like Mount St.
Helens erupting; you use the best estimate you can get. But it (the
lift) was smooth,'' he said.
   The barge, operated by Olympic Tug and Barge of Seattle, sank
Jan. 31 in about 130 feet of water four miles west of Anacortes and
about 100 yards off Shannon Point. It had been loaded at an oil
refinery at Anacortes and was being towed by to Seattle when it
began listing and capsized.
   After resting with its stern on the bottom and the bow breaking
the surface for about a week, the vessel dropped all the way to the
bottom.
   On Thursday, the Coast Guard assumed financial responsibility
for the salvage because Olympic was unable to obtain pollution
liability coverage. Compton said Harley Franco, Olympic president,
would be billed for the salvage costs.

   Iran said it fired three missiles into
the Iraqi capital of Baghdad before dawn today and Iraq said two
missiles crashed into residential areas, killing many civilians.
   Twelve hours later, Iran's official media reported Iraqi
warplanes bombed residential districts of Tehran and hit a
hospital. Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said 16 people were killed at the hospital and ``dozens
wounded, including newborn babies.''
   Tehran Radio, also monitored in Nicosia, urged Iranians to take
refuge in recently built bomb shelters. It was the second time the
Iraqis have bombed Tehran in three days.
   The Turkish Anatolia news agency said one bomb exploded 300
yards from a downtown hotel where State Minister Yusuf Ozal of
Turkey was staying with an official delegation led by Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal, his brother.
   There were no reports of Turkish casualties.
   Earlier today, Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency, monitored
in Nicosia, quoted a military spokesman as saying Iranian artillery
also shelled residential areas of the embattled southern port of
Basra and the border town of Khanaqin, 80 miles northeast of
Baghdad during the night. He made no mention of casualties.
   It was the third straight day of attacks on cities and
industrial centers by the two Persian Gulf war foes, beginning when
Iraqi warplanes bombed Tehran on Saturday for the first time in
months.
   The attacks heightened fears that the two nations had begun
another round of the so-called ``war of the cities'' that started
in March 1985.
   In other action, Iran claimed Kurdish guerrillas and
Revolutionary Guards killed or wounded 350 Iraqis on Sunday in
fighting in northeast Iraq.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, quoting a military
communique, said Kurdish guerrillas beat back an assault by Iraqi
special forces on positions in Erbil province, killing or wounding
250 men.
   The agency said Iranian Revolutionary Guards killed or wounded
another 100 Iraqis in a bombardment of Iraqi positions in the
mountainous Kurdistan region. IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said
Revolutionary Guards gunners fired the three surface-to-surface
missiles at the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's state-run television
and radio network and ``two military targets'' in Baghdad.
   IRNA said the Iranians fired the missiles in retaliation for
Iraqi air raids ``on non-military areas'' in Tehran, the Kurdish
city of Saqqez in northwest Iran, Dezful in southwest Khuzestan
province, and the western city of Hamadan in recent days.
   It said 28 civilians were killed in those raids, with scores
more wounded.
   The communique warned ``the Iraqi government that its renewed
attacks on civilian areas will not go unanswered,'' IRNA reported.
   Baghdad Radio did not identify the Baghdad residential districts
it said were hit by the missiles, believed to be Soviet-made,
Scud-B weapons supplied to Iran by Libya and Syria.
   The explosions were heard across the city of 5 million.
   ``Many Iraqis were killed, among them women, children and old
people. Many more were wounded and many houses were destroyed,''
the communique said. No exact casualty figures were given.
   The radio quoted an unidentified military spokesman as warning:
``All Iranian cities are now targets for our air and missile forces
until further notice. The losers in the end will be the rulers in
Tehran.''
   The missiles were the first to hit the Iraqi capital since Nov.
8. The Iranians have fired eight missiles into the city since the
U.N. Security Council called for a cease-fire in the 7-year-old war
on July 20 last year.
   Altogether, Iran has fired 37 missiles into Baghdad since March
1985, when the two sides began the ``war of the cities.''
   Thousands of civilians on both sides have been killed or wounded
in the intermittent campaigns involving air raids, missiles and
long-range artillery bombardments. In one of the worst missile
attacks, more than 30 children were killed and more than 100
wounded when their school was hit Oct. 13.
   Tehran's War Information Headquarters said Iranian warplanes on
Sunday bombed a petrochemical plant in the southern Iraqi port of
Basra, oil installations in Abul Khassib in the southeast and a
bridge linking Iraq with Umm Rassas island in the Shatt al-Arab
waterway.
   Baghdad said long-range Iranian artillery shelled six border
towns and cities Saturday and Sunday, killing and wounding an
undisclosed number of civilians.
   Baghdad Radio said Iraqi warplanes later Sunday bombed Hamadan
in eastern Iran and Dezful in the southeast in retaliation for
``recent atrocities and crimes committed by the charlatans of
Iran.''

<HEAD>Court to Consider Barring Customs from Conducting Drug Tests for
Applicants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DRUG TESTS
   
   The court agreed to consider barring the U.S. Customs Service
from conducting drug tests for people seeking drug-enforcement
jobs, setting the stage for its first ruling on the
constitutionality of mandatory drug-testing for public employees.
   The court said it will hear a challenge to the testing program
by a federal workers labor union that says taking urine samples
from employees violates their privacy rights.
   The case is National Treasury Employees Union vs. Von Raab,
86-1879.
   
   ATOMIC TESTS
   
   The court refused to revive lawsuits charging the government and
federal contrctors with negligently causing deaths and disease
among people exposed to open-air atomic tests.
   The court, without comment, let stand a federal law that
effectively spared the government from having to defend itself
against claims seeking billions of dollars.
   The case is Konizski vs. Livermore Labs, 87-953.
   
   MEDICARE
   
   The court agreed to consider letting the federal government
apply retroactively a formula that limits reimbursement paid to
hospitals treating Medicare patients.
   The court said it will hear Reagan administraion arguments that
some hospitals could reap a windfall from the ban on retroactive
application of the formula.
   The case is Bowen vs. Georgetown University Hospital, 87-1097.
   
   EMBASSY DOCUMENTS
   
   The court let stand rulings that threw out a reporter's attempt
to force the State Department to release documents from U.S.
embassies around the world.
   The lawsuit by Donald F. Goldberg, a reporter on the staff of
syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, had been filed under the
Freedom of Information Act. He had sought from the State Department
responses to an unclassified 1982 questionnaire on foreign
governments' diplomatic practices.
   The case is Goldberg vs. State Department, 87-655.
   
   BINGO
   
   The court asked the Reagan administration whether it thinks
high-stakes bingo games run by Indian tribes are subject to state
sales taxes.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before it says whether it will review an attempt by Oklahoma
officials to tax revenue from a bingo game in Tulsa run by the
Muscogee Creek Nation.
   The case is Oklahoma Tax Commission vs. Muscogee Creek Nation,
87-1068.
   
   SECURITY RISKS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether employees of a Pentagon
intelligence agency are entitled to administrative hearings when
the government fires them as security risks.
   The justices said they will hear Reagan administration arguments
that those who work for the National Security Agency are not
entitled to such procedural protection.
   The case is Carlucci vs. Doe, 87-751.
   
   PATERNITY
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may block a man from
trying to prove he fathered the child of a woman married to someone
else.
   The court said it will study a challenge by a man identified in
court records only as Michael H., to a state evidentiary rule
creating a conclusive presumption of fatherhood to a wife's husband.
   The case is Michael H. vs. Gerald D., 87-746.
   
   HI-FI KILLINGS
   
   The court let stand the conviction of a man sentenced to death
in Utah for his role in the 1974 killings of three people forced to
swallow drain cleaner before they were shot.
   The justices let stand William Andrews' conviction and death
sentence for the three murders committed during an Aril 22, 1974
robbery of an Ogden hi-fi store.
   The case is Andrews vs. Shulsen, 87-5449.
   
   RACETRACK SEARCHES
   
   The court let stand rulings that warrantless searches of
Illinois racetrack employees' on-grounds living quarters violate
constitutionally protected privacyrights.
   The Illinois Racing Board for years had authorized state law
enforcement officers to search, without warrants, the rooms of
employees who feed, groom, exercise and generally take care of
racehorses.
   The case is Arkansas vs. Mayfield, 87-1105.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis walked aboard his chartered
jet with a smile on his face. ``They don't know what a frappe is
here in Texas,'' he said, ``but I got one.''
   Dukakis didn't come all the way from the gold-domed statehouse
in Boston to the heart of Texas for the thick milkshake that every
soda jerk in New England knows how to make.
   But if he can find one in the land where Lyndon Johnson once
reigned, can the Massachusetts liberal also find enough votes to
establish himself as a Democratic presidential candidate of
nationwide appeal?
   With 1,307 Democratic National Convention delegates at stake on
March 8, a festival of 20 primaries and caucuses with a Southern
flavor known as Super Tuesday, his aides concede it's a challenge.
   ``Outside South Florida I wouldn't call it hostility, but
there's a skepticism about Mike Dukakis,'' says S. Stephen
Rosenfeld, who left his statehouse job in Massachusetts to organize
in Florida for the governor.
   While Dukakis periodically insists that he's competing ``in
every state'' on Super Tuesday, he is targeting his appeal to
liberals, labor workers and retirees, and reminding voters
everywhere that he is the son of Greek immigrants.
   Dukakis and his aides carefully avoid saying that he must carry
even a single Southern state to succeed on March 8, and say they
are concentrating on winning as many delegates as possible.
   Much of his time and campaign budget is focused in areas of
Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia. Like other Democratic
rivals, he is virtually conceding the region's large black vote to
Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis has made subtle changes in the campaign message that
earned him a respectable third place in Iowa and victories in New
Hampshire and Minnesota. He no longer emphasizes his opposition to
President Reagan's support for the Contras in Nicaragua. And to
demonstrate toughness in an area that likes it, he is suggesting he
might authorize strikes against terrorist base camps in an effort
to deal with hostage problems in the Middle East.
   He also showed a combative side in last Saturday's debate,
repeatedly challenging Rep. Richard Gephardt to say whether he was
proud of his vote in favor of the 1981 Reaganomics tax bill and
questioning Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s credentials for the White House.
   He still trumpets his record of nine balanced budgets as
governor of Massachusetts as the centerpiece of his campaign and
calls for ``real jobs at real wages.''
   Dukakis is ready to run commercials attacking Gephardt if
campaign officials decide it is necessary. ``One of the things that
you can't do is to try to make yourself into something you're
not,'' Dukakis said in an interview. ``He's got a record, and the
record is there for all to see.''
   For the next week Dukakis is targeting his time, money and
resources in a hectic Southern effort to prove his appeal outside
his Northern, liberal base. Hundreds of delegates are at stake.
   The governor and his aides also hope he can win the Maryland
primary (67 delegates at stake) and the Washington caucuses (65) on
the same day, to go with a rousing victory at home in Massachusetts
(98) and Rhode Island (22).
   Dukakis' aides say they hope he can win delegates in 110 of the
171 congressional districts voting on March 8 and hope for 350 or
so delegates overall.
   They believe that would put Dukakis in the lead for nominating
delegates just as the campaign heads for the industrial states
where he should feel more at home.
   ``If we can move out of Super Tuesday with a good total of
delegates I think we will be clearly established,'' he said in an
interview as his jet carried him from Austin to Atlanta, Ga.
   Largely bypassing the conservative vote in deepest Dixie,
Dukakis is concentrating on South Florida, where the population has
been swelled in recent years by droves of cold-weather refugees. He
also will make an effort in central Florida and campaign
extensively in Texas, whose 183 delegates make it the biggest
single prize on March 8.
   This emphasis is seen by the decision of where to have Dukakis
campaign personally and where to advertise on television. The first
wave of ads were aired in South Florida and parts of Texas, as well
as Baltimore.
   Barring changes in the schedule, Dukakis will campaign in areas
around Atlanta, competing for a fraction of Georgia's 77 delegates,
and in targeted areas of North Carolina (82 delegates).
   Don't look for the man with the New England accent and the
wing-tipped shoes to spend much time, if any, in Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Virginia and Kentucky. He'll
leave Tennessee and Missouri to favorite sons Gore and Gephardt.
   ``We'll do well by winning delegates in a lot of congressional
districts,'' says senior campaign aide Leslie Dach. Since most
delegates are awarded on the basis of the vote within congressional
districts, a candidate can score by campaigning in one region of a
state and ignoring another.
   Thus, in a state like Florida or Texas, he might not pull enough
votes statewide to be a winner, but he could leave with plenty of
delegates.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout, hospital now says baby died Sunday night</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOMA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eight-day-old baby girl born with
almost no brain died one day after she was taken off a respirator
used to preserve her organs for transplant, hospital officials said
today.
   Evelyn Keys died peacefully Sunday night, said Dr. Joyce
Peabody, chief of neonatology at Loma Linda University Medical
Center.
   ``Her heart valves, eyes and corneas have been donated. The
parents are saddened, but still very pleased their daughter could
give some gift of life,'' Ms. Peabody said in a statement.
   A previous statement released by the hospital during the early
morning hours today had said the baby was still alive, but Ms.
Peabody said the baby had died at 10:35 p.m. Sunday.
   The infant with the usually fatal birth defect called
anencephaly was part of a novel organ donor program at Loma Linda
University Medical Center to use the hearts and livers of such
babies once they are legally declared brain-dead.
   Loma Linda has developed the nation's first guidelines for using
such infants as organ donors.
   The hospital, 65 miles east of Los Angeles, is known for its
frequent infant heart transplants. Thirteen babies have received
new hearts at the center, with nine surviving.
   Baby Evelyn never met the hospital's critieria for brain death,
however, and was taken off life-support systems with parental
approval Saturday, Ms. Peabody said.
   The infant continued to breath on her own and received feedings
by mouth until she died, said hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   On Saturday, Ms. Peabody said the baby girl was breathing but
was already showing ``signs of gradual deterioration.''
   The hospital uses life support systems on until babies are brain
dead in order to maintain organs until they can be used.
Anencephalic babies are connected to respirators soon after birth,
and doctors then monitor their abilities to breathe on their own.
   If they can't breathe by themselves they are declared brain dead
before any organ deterioration caused by oxygen loss occurs.
   If they continue to breathe on their own, slow deterioration
eventually makes their organs unsuitable for transplants, Ms.
Rockwell said.
   Evelyn was born Feb. 20 in San Antonio, Texas, to Judy Keys, 22,
and Airman Todd Keys, 21, of the 6993rd Electronic Security Squad
at Lackland Air Force Base. The infant was flown to Loma Linda that
same day to be used in the donor program.

   Colorado's first experiment with high-oxygen fuels
ended Monday, without the epidemic of clogged fuel injectors and
stalled cars predicted by opponents of the smog-control program.
   ``We were very surprised _ we thought there'd be more consumer
backlash,'' said Jerry Levine of Amoco Corp. in Chicago. Levine had
opposed the mandatory program in hearings last year before
Colorado's Air Quality Commission.
   It will be another month, however, before state officials know
whether the experiment reduced levels of carbon monoxide along the
eastern slope of the Rockies.
   At the city's mile-high altitude, ordinary gasoline burns
incompletely and the unexpended fuel emitted into the air adds to
the pollution which frequently robs Denverites of their mountain
views.
   Gasoline suppliers plan to switch back to traditional gasoline
without oxygenated additives sometime in March, but oxygenated
fuels will be back in the service stations Nov. 1, when next
season's four-month program begins.
   Since Jan. 1, Colorado motorists have been able to buy only
high-oxygen blended fuels, either ether-based MTBE or corn-based
ethanol. State officials predicted the program would reduce carbon
monoxide levels by at least 8 percent this year.
   Oil company executives and car mechanics predicted highways
would be littered with stalled cars and repair shops overflowing
with clogged fuel injectors and other mechanical ailments.
   ``There have been no major problems,'' said state air pollution
control specialist Kim Livo. ``The actual program probably has
relieved a lot of concerns people might have had before it
started.''
   The more skeptical agree.
   ``The negative effects on our cars have been fairly minimal,''
said BMW service manager Mike Palmieri at Ralph Schomp Oldsmobile,
Honda and BMW in Littleton. Mechanics at the dealership had
predicted they would be flooded with complaints of vapor lock, and
drying and cracking fuel lines and injector seals.
   ``I think everybody including us guys here are willing to put up
with some minor inconveniences to clean up Denver's air _ we live
here too,'' Palmieri said.
   He said he thought the fuels reduced mileage by about 5 percent;
Livo denied the fuels had any effect on mileage.
   Oil companies also had predicted consumers would be stuck with
the blended fuels all year, because it would be too expensive for
suppliers to switch fuels twice a year.
   Now, Total Petroleum, Amoco and Conoco say they plan to stop
selling the oxy-fuels when the program ends and current supplies
run out.
   Levine said the blended fuels cost Amoco about three cents extra
per gallon, though the additional price was offset this year by a
drop in gasoline prices overall.
   Both Levine and Palmieri remained skeptical about next year's
program. They said Colorado's transition to oxygenated fuels was
smooth only because MTBE still accounted for 95 percent to 98
percent of the market.
   That balance probably will change next year when the oxy-fuels
program is expanded to four months, and the required oxygen level
rises from 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
   Oil companies favor MTBE because it has been used as an octane
enhancer since the early 1980s, said Levine.
   Oil companies and many dealers have recommended MTBE as being
safer than ethanol, although the Big Three U.S. auto makers and
many import manufacturers have said their cars can be adjusted
either to MTBE or ethanol blends at the 2 percent oxygen level.
   Ethanol producers and state officials say the corn-based product
got a bad rap in Denver three summers ago when a batch of
low-quality gasohol hit the area. Since then, they say, state
regulations have ensured a higher-quality blend.
   State officials have been adamant about securing ethanol a place
in the air quality program and giving consumers a choice of
oxy-fuels. Livo said the Air Quality Control Commission will review
the program this spring and make its final recommendations for next
year.
   Whatever the commission decides, Levine said, ``We'll accept it.
We'll live with it.''
   The oxy fuels program targeted the 1.6 million people living in
the Front Range from Colorado Springs north to Fort Collins.
Because oil companies could not deliver oxygenated fuels through
their pipelines just to this area, however, nearly all of Colorado
and part of Wyoming _ more than 2 million people _ wound up
switching fuels.

<TEXT>
   Israelis in this communal farm
expressed shock Monday over the arrest of one young member in the
beating of two Arabs, but they said government policy in the
occupied territories placed soldiers in an untenable position.
   Sgt. Saguy Harpaz, a Gesher resident, was detained in the
communal dining hall Friday night after a CBS News videotape showed
that he and three other soldiers beat two bound Arab protesters
with rocks for more than half an hour in Nablus.
   ``People who saw the film were shocked,'' said Catherine Gur,
38, who taught Harpaz in elementary school. ``It was very brutal.
He did not act according to the values we impart on our children.''
   Ms. Gur and other kibbutz residents held Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin responsible, saying his announced policy of beating
Arab rioters instead of shooting them has confused troops.
   Ms. Gur said Harpaz, 20, joined the army because of ``an ideal
to serve the country and to defend the country.'' But she said
Rabin's policy had taught him ``to beat up women and children.''
   Harpaz and the other three soldiers were arrested and their
deputy unit commander, a captain, was suspended. The four will be
tried by a military court. The two Arabs were ordered released.
   On Monday, Harpaz was released into the custody of his parents.
Wearing his uniform, he sat in the small living room of his
parents' garden apartment, drinking coffee. He was surrounded by a
dozen relatives and friends.
   ``I'm happy he's out,'' said his mother, Amalia. ``But I'm angry
about what happened to him. He seems to have changed over the past
few weeks. It was an unfair responsibility to have been placed on
such young shoulders.''
   ``They make my son into a murderer,'' his father, Yossi, told
the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. ``Saguy isn't violent by nature. He
grew up in this kibbutz and was educated with values.''
   Harpaz's arrest prompted intense soul-searching in Gesher, where
600 Israelis live within view of Jordan 80 miles north of
Jerusalem, and in other kibbutzim, which are traditional bastions
of liberalism and patriotism.
   Kibbutzniks are considered the backbone of the army, with
disproportionately large numbers volunteering for combat units and
serving as officers.
   Kibbutzim were founded on the ideas of equality, self-sacrifice
and socialist principles. They have produced many of the country's
left-wing leaders.
   How Israel quells unrest in the occupied territories ``has
become a question for the whole kibbutz society,'' Absorption
Minister Yacov Tzur, himself a kibbutznik, said Monday during a
meeting of the United Kibbutz Movement.
   ``We know we are sending our children to do a very difficult
task that cannot be compared to anything we did in the past,'' he
said.
   Former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon accused army leaders of
responding to the case with hysteria. He criticized officers who
arrested ``a soldier, a fighter, in his kibbutz, in the dinning
hall, and took him from the bosom of his family.''
   Ms. Gur said six Gesher members serve in the army in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. ``It's hard to speak to them about what they
do because they are ashamed, just ashamed,'' she said.
   Unlike in the past, many of Gesher's young people are no longer
eager to serve, she said.
   Added Harpaz's 19-year-old brother, Chen, who will join the army
Thursday: ``I have zero motivation. If that's the way the country
treats its soldiers, I don't want to be a part of it.''
   Ms. Gur said kibbutz education stresses the values of tolerance
and acceptance of other ethnic groups. However, she said, the only
Arabs most kibbutz children come in contact with are laborers
building homes or picking up garbage.
   She described Harpaz as an intelligent youth with a ``rough
exterior. But underneath he's still quite sensitive, a child.'' She
noted that he wrote his final essay in high school on democracy.
   Gesher is nestled in rolling hills south of the Sea of Galilee.
Its members grow cotton, mine gypsum and produce magnets and
ceramic wares.

   Rioting broke out in an industrial city in
Azerbaidzhan, the Tass news agency reported today. A dissident said
the violence was sparked by tensions between Armenians and
Azerbaidzhan's dominant ethnic group, the Azeris.
   The Tass report said the disturbances Sunday in Sumgait, a city
on the Caspian Sea, were provoked by ``a group of hooligans,'' and
``rampage and violence followed.'' The agency said measures were
adopted ``to normalize the situation.''
   The official Soviet agency gave no indication what led to the
violence.
   Armenians in huge numbers took to the streets last week in their
capital, Yerevan, to demand that a region of Azerbaidzhan that has
a largely Armenian population be made part of their republic.
   Of Sunday's violence in Sumgait, a city some 1,500 miles from
Moscow, dissident Sergei Grigoryants said: ``Thugs in Sumgait went
up to people and asked them if they were Armenian or not. They
started to beat people who said they were Armenians. Several people
were knifed.''
   Grigoryants, who lives in Moscow but is of Armenian origin, said
it appeared that no one was killed in Sumgait. He said ``several
dozen'' Azeris were reportedly involved in the attacks.
   Grigoryants said by telephone that he received his information
on the unrest from sources in Yerevan.
   Tass said an investigation has been launched into the violence
at Sumgait.
   The four-paragraph Tass dispatch gave only sketchy details of
the violence and did not say whether there had been deaths or
injuries. The report did not say who was involved in the unrest or
say what caused the violence.
   An official at the Azerbaidzhani government's offices in Moscow
contacted today by telephone refused to give any details of the
unrest.
   ``Everything will be printed in the central press and shown on
television,'' said the official, who refused to give his name.
   Telephone calls placed from Moscow to Baku, the Azerbaidzhani
capital 20 miles southeast of Sumgait, did not immediately go
through.
   Sumgait, with a population of more than 160,000, is the second
largest city in Azerbaidzhan after the capital. Sumgait is 150
miles from the autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is at
the center of a dispute between Armenia and Azerbaidzhan.
   The Armenians want the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which has been
part of Azerbaidzhan for 65 years, returned to Armenia. Three
quarters of the 157,000 residents are Armenian.
   Last week hundreds of thousands of Armenians took to the streets
in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, calling for the region's annexation.
   Protests also occurred in Nagorno-Karabakh backing the call.
   On Friday, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for
``civil maturity and restraint'' in an address read on Armenian
television by a senior party official. In the address, Gorbachev
promised that the Communist Party Central Committee would review
relations among the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities.
   That same day Gorbachev also met with two prominent Armenian
writers to help work out a solution to the Armenian problem.
   Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet republics in the
Caucasus. It is bounded on the west by the Soviet republics of
Armenia and Georgia, on the north by the Russian Republic. The
Caspian Sea runs for nearly 800 miles along its eastern edge and to
the south lies Iran.
   The republic is predominately Shiite Moslem, expect for the
Armenian Christians living in the Nagorno-Karbakh region.

<HEAD>Illinois Woodworkers Building Doors For Ellis Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KAPPA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family of craftsmen is hard at work in a
modest woodworking shop outside this tiny central Illinois town,
producing an essential element for the restoration of Ellis Island.
   The Young family, owners of Custom Crafted Doors located 50
miles east of Peoria, is building 136 mahogany and maple doors for
the century-old immigration station. The work is part of a $140
million project to restore Ellis Island and create a museum to
America's immigrant heritage.
   ``This is a little piece of American history being reproduced,''
said Steve Young, a woodworker who is supervising the construction.
``It's a special project for us.''
   The Ellis Island project involves the entire Young family, as
well as their 25 employees.
   Owners James and Dean Young were cabinet makers when they
started their company 25 years ago and now they specialize in
doors. The couple handle paperwork and bidding while sons Steve,
29, and Jim, 20, take care of daily business at the shop.
   Steve, who describes himself as a special door craftsman, is the
ramrod in the workshop while Jim, company vice president, spends
more time in the office dealing with changing blueprints and
specifications for the doors.
   ``We're excited about it,'' Mrs. Young said. ``At first, we
didn't know wow we're losing the drug war,
let's keep in mind the progress we've made,'' the president told
conference participants at a local hotel. He ticked off statistics
he said show the United States is making headway, saying ``drug
seizures are at an all-time high.''
   ``But as significant as stopping smugglers and pushers is,
ending the demand for drugs is how, in the end, we'll win,'' the
president said.
   Mrs. Reagan picked up the subject there, saying that while
progress has been made, ``many ignorant ideas persist. And one of
the worst is the casual user's justification that drug use is a
victimless crime, that drugs don't hurt anyone except the person
who's using them.''
   She called attention to several people in the audience who lost
loved ones because of drug abuse and cited the murder of Colombia's
chief prosecutor, Attorney General Carlos Hoyos, who was abducted
by a half-dozen gunmen whom the government accused of working for
local cocaine barons.
   Hoyos' bullet-riddled body was was found blindfolded and
handcuffed.
   The government blamed his abduction and death on the Medillin
cartel, which U.S. officials say controls 80 percent of cocaine
entering the United States.
   ``The people who casually use cocaine are responsible,'' Mrs.
Reagan said, ``because their money bought those bullets. They
provided the high stakes that murdered those men, plus hundreds of
others in Colombia.''
   She dismissed ``the notion that the mellow marijuana user
doesn't hurt anyone,'' pointing to the murder of American drug
agent Enrique Camarena Salazar in the aftermath of the eradication
of a 10,000-acre plantation in Mexico.
   ``The casual user may think when he takes a line of cocaine or
smokes a joint in the privacy of his nice condo, listening to his
expensive stereo, that he's somehow not bothering anyone,'' she
said. ``But there is a trail of death and destruction that leads
directly to his door.''
   ``The casual drug user cannot morally escape responsibility for
the action of drug traffickers and dealings,'' she said. ``I'm
saying that if you're a casual drug user, you're an accomplice to
murder.''
   While the Reagans helped kick off the drug conference, the
administration came in for some criticism on its anti-drug abuse
efforts, with Marion Barry, the mayor of the District of Columbia,
complaining that not enough was being done.
   Barry, facing a record murder rate in nation's capital fueled by
warring drug dealers, said the problem in cities has reached
``catastrophic dimensions.''
   ``We're beginning to lose the war on drug and alcohol abuse,''
Barry said in his welcoming remarks, telling the conference his was
the ``view from the cities. The United States government has not
done enough to stop drugs from coming into this country.''
   ``We must say to Colombia, Peru and Mexico, we're not going to
take it anymore. Heroin and cocaine does not grow here, it's
brought here. We must stop it, stop it, stop it from coming here,''
Barry said.
   A private study released last week said the Washington area's
drug problem is almost unrivaled among large cities and that drug
abuse has grown in the area's suburbs more than in any other
suburban area in the nation.
   In her address, Mrs. Reagan alluded to this problem, saying that
``in Saturday's Washington Post, there was one page in which every
article was a local drug story _ and there was another local drug
story on the front page.''
   ``We must face the fact that drugs are tearing our communities
apart.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Drug Control, said in advance of
Monday's conference: ``Advances in stopping drugs _ we haven't made
any.''
   ``If we didn't have Nancy Reagan, we wouldn't have anything,''
he said in an interview with the Post.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, during an appearance at
Samford University in Birmingham, S.C., said drugs are the nation's
No. 1 social problem, but said some progress is being made,
particularly in high schools.
   But, he acknowleged, ``We still have a long way to go.''
   Cocaine seizures by U.S. authorities have risen by 1,822 percent
in the past seven years, according to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   In fiscal 1981, 1,872 kilograms was seized, compared with 35,970
kilograms in fiscal 1987, the DEA said on Feb. 4. A kilogram is
equal to 2.2 pounds.
   During the same period, marijuana seizures went down 42 percent,
from about 1 million kilograms in fiscal 1981 to 632,000 kilograms
last year. It peaked at 1.4 million kilograms seized in fiscal
1984, the DEA said.
   The DEA increased the number of its agents 34 percent, from less

   It has happened so many times over the
past 25 years that Ron Burrows long ago lost count.
   A car drives toward Burrows' house, the heads inside turning
about, until it comes to a stop in his driveway at the end of the
short road leading to Craigville Beach. The befuddled motorist
either turns the car around or asks Burrows for directions.
   The problem: The Kennedy family compound is accessible only from
Irving Avenue in Hyannisport, a half mile from Irving Street, where
Burrows lives.
   ``I'm so used to directing cars to the Kennedy compound that
I've even thought of setting up an information booth and charging
them 10 cents a piece,'' Burrows joked Monday.
   Now, his days as an informal tour guide are coming to an end.
   He and the other residents of Irving Street last week persuaded
town officials to change the name of the dead-end street to Inwood
Lane. The name change became official Thursday; Burrows is just
waiting for a public works crew to change the street sign.
   ``That might take a couple of months,'' he said.
   Burrows, 80, doesn't blame tourists for seeking a peek at the
Kennedy compound.
   ``But it was a nuisance with all the cars coming up such a small
street and sometimes it was a problem because big trucks trying to
deliver merchandise to the compound would end up here.''

<HEAD>Protestant Evangelism Growing Rapidly in Argentina</HEAD>

   Protestant fundamentalism is
growing rapidly in this predominantly Roman Catholic nation, and
American missionary Don Exley's yellow and white revival tent
symbolizes the movement.
   One night last week, 63 people crossed a muddy field in a hard
rain to hear Exley, who represents the Assemblies of God, preach a
spirited sermon in Spanish. He told them God would save their souls
if they prayed hard enough and sang loud enough.
   Before the two-hour revival ended in the tent in suburban
Martinez, many of the men, women and children, had ``spoken in
tongues'' and eight bowed before Exley to be saved. Exley said his
revival attract crowds of up to 200 people.
   ``The Assemblies of God is trying to minister to felt needs,''
Exley said in an interview. ``People come, and they're coming more
and more, because they're hurting financially, physically or in
their relations with family.''
   Sidney Rooy of Buenos Aires, a historian of religion, said
Pentecostal churches are the fastest-growing religious movements
among Argentina's 31 million people. The Assemblies of God arrived
here 40 years ago, but its rapid growth began just five years ago.
   Another historian, the Rev. Timothy Hamilton of Buenos Aires,
said the popularity of Protestant evangelism has been growing for a
decade. Exley claims Argentina now has about 2.8 million
evangelical Christians in a population that is 90 percent Catholic.
   Jimmy Swaggart, the disgraced Assemblies of God television
evangelist, visited Argentina in 1986 on a four-nation crusade that
included Brazil, Chile and Paraguay. A packed house of 60,000 heard
him preach at the River Plate Stadium in Buenos Aires.
   Carlos Annacondia, a former salesman, probably is the most
popular Argentine evangelist. He preaches in Quilmes, just outside
the capital.
   In his magazine Abundant Life, he published pictures of a recent
crusade in Paraguay during which he met President Alfredo
Stroessner, the general who has ruled that neighboring country
since a coup in 1954. He features the meeting with Stroessner in
promotional material.
   Exley attributes the popularity of his religious movement, in
part, to years of high inflation and ``disillusionment with
military government and democratic government.''
   He holds revivals four to six nights a week in the tent. Exley,
38, has been an Assemblies of God missionary since 1976 in
Argentina and Argentina.
   As an example of his denomination's growth, he cites Cordoba,
the northwestern industrial center and second-largest city of
Argentina. Exley said he began the Assemblies of God ministry there
12 years ago with 75 people in a small church, and Cordoba now has
20 churches serving 3,000-4,000 members.
   The church claims up to 14 million members in Brazil, one-tenth
of the population, and 12,000 in Paraguay.
   When asked how the movement will be affected by the Swaggart sex
scandal, Exley said: ``For sure it affects his credibility, it
affects his credibility a lot. I'm sure it'll affect his finances.
But it's very early to know how far-reaching.''
   Swaggart's tearful confession of sin was was front-page news in
Argentina.
   Exley said Swaggart and the Assemblies of God provided most of
the money for the block-long lot where the tent stands, provide the
Swaggart television program dubbed in Spanish and were expected to
help build a church complex.
   Other financial help from the Swaggart group included financing
an elementary school in the lower-class Lomas de Zamora section of
Buenos Aires, he said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Federico Pena has ordered an investigation
into reports that street crews spend more time eating and reading
than working.
   ``I am outraged by the information ... that a handful of city
employees has been wasting taxpayers' dollars by intentionally
neglecting their assigned responsibilities as members of the city's
work crews,'' Pena said in a statement.
   He commented after seeing a news series that KUSA-TV of Denver
began broadcasting Sunday. The station's news crews followed city
crews for eight hours and videotaped them with a hidden camera.
   Complaints about the city's Public Works Department, including
slow cleanup following a December blizzard, have fueled a recall
effort against Pena.
   The station taped several street crews leaving public works
yards in the morning, then spending time at stores, restaurants and
talking with other crews.
   In one case, KUSA said, a crew drove 64 miles but did no work in
its eight-hour shift while visiting five food stores.
   Pena said disciplinary action would be taken against city
workers who could be identified from the videotape.
   ``While the evidence appears to implicate less than 10 of the
city's 11,000 employees, the type of intolerable and inexcusable
behavior allegedly involved unjustly damages the reputation of the
overwhelming number of city employees who have worked long and hard
on behalf of the people of Denver,'' Pena said.
   Pena also said earlier evidence had led him to begin a
management review to improve supervision in the city's pothole
repair operation.
   Chuck Mills, president of the city employee's union and a public
works employee, said if there were problems with workers taking
excessive time off, they were isolated.

<HEAD>Administration Urges Appeals Court To Stay Out Of Dispute With
Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Monday urged a
federal appeals court to stay out of a dispute over whether the War
Powers Resolution should have been invoked when the Navy began
escorting oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.
   Justice Department attorney James Spears urged a three-judge
panel to uphold a lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit brought by
110 members of Congress to force President Reagan to report to
Congress that U.S. forces were sent into hostilities last summer in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``Our policy has begun to bear fruit,'' Spears said of the
Navy's operation to protect reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers from
attack by warring Iraqi or Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf.
``For a court to recharacterize the U.S. role threatens to undercut
this progress.''
   Spears called the issue ``quintessentially a non-justiciable
political question'' that courts cannot decide.
   ``This is a situation where a political decision has been made
by the political branches, it is not one for the judicial branch to
come in and second guess,'' Spears said.
   The 1973 War Powers Resolution requires that in the absence of a
declared war the president must notify Congress within 48 hours of
placing U.S. forces in hostilities.
   The lawsuit was filed by Rep. Michael Lowery, D-Wash., and other
members of Congress, after President Reagan refused to file a
report notifying Congress that the Navy ships escorting reflagged
Kuwaiti oil tankers had been sent into hosilities.
   The case was dismissed late last year by U.S. District Judge
George Revercomb, who ruled that courts did not have jurisdiction
to consider the claim.
   Alan Morrison, an attorney representing the lawmakers, argued
that ``unless we are to say the statute is unenforceable... it
seems to me the court has the power to at least require that the
president file the report'' with Congress.
   Chief Judge Patricia Wald questioned Spears' assertion that
courts are not qualified to decide what situation amounts to
hostilities, which is essentially a military and diplomatic
question.
   Recalling Vietnam, Wald said that if ``people are in jungles
fighting and dying ... you would say that is still a political
question, if the president did not want to submit the report'' to
Congress.
   ``No matter what's going on overseas, that's a political
question,'' Spears said. He said Congress has the power under the
Constitution to declare war. ``Congress can't take the power that
the Constitution assigned it and assign it to a court'' to decide
the question.
   Judge Stephen Williams questioned why Congress had not passed
resolutions declaring that the Persian Gulf operation was covered
by the War Powers Resolution.
   ``The fact that Congress hasn't acted is not relevant'' to
whether the president must obey the resolution's requirment that he
notify Congress that a military operation has begun, Morrison said.
   The War Powers Resolution was enacted because Congress was
concerned that its role in deciding whether to send U.S. troops
into armed conflict had been greatly diminished, Morrison said.
   ``The whole purpose of the War Powers Resolution is not to have
to pass a new law every time we have a Vietnam or a Cambodia,''
Morrison said.
   But Williams said the lawmakers who filed the suit were
``inviting courts to add a third voice to U.S. foreign policy where
events found by a court fitted into the meaning of the resolution.''
   The resolution provides that once he has reported that U.S.
forces have entered hostilities, the president must withdraw troops
in 60 days if Congress doesn't formally declare war or the
lawmakers take action to extend the deadline.

<TEXT>
   For European leaders, this week's NATO
summit is a welcome chance to join President Reagan in trumpeting
alliance unity and highlighting its recent successes.
   Privately, though, the Europeans may add some words of worry.
   The most immediate concern to Europeans is a lack of Western
consensus on how to balance the need to guard against a possible
Soviet attack with the hope for further reductions in East-West
tensions.
   A more deeply rooted worry is that budgetary pressures may soon
compel Washington to pull some of its 326,000 troops out of Western
Europe.
   The summit meeting Wednesday and Thursday is likely to declare
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization united on the need to keep
some nuclear weapons in Europe. The problem is deciding how many
and which kinds.
   It also is expected to demand that the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
alliance accept proportionally bigger conventional arms and troop
cuts than the West, according to NATO sources familiar with
preparations for the summit.
   But the summit will sidestep, at least in public, the questions
of whether and when to improve NATO's very short-range atomic arms,
most of which are deployed by the United States on West German
soil. Smaller numbers are in Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands,
Italy and Turkey.
   Attention has been drawn to these weapons, which include
ballistic nuclear missiles and artillery, since Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a treaty in December eliminating
more than 2,000 U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles which have ranges
from 300 to 3,000 miles.
   Moscow has suggested scrapping all short-range nuclear arms, of
which the East bloc has more than a 10-1 numerical edge in Europe,
according to NATO figures.
   But Lord Carrington, the NATO secretary general, said in a
recent interview that all 16 alliance members are steadfastly
opposed to such a complete elimination. Alliance members see the
short-range weapons as vital to NATO's strategy of responding to an
attack with a full range of military options.
   ``The one thing that everybody is agreed on is that you can't
have a third zero,'' Carrington said, refering to the INF treaty
which eliminates two categories of nuclear missile.
   West Germany, however, wants NATO to begin negotiations to bring
the Soviet total of short-range nuclear arms down to NATO's level.
But most of the other allies worry that such talks would eventually
lead to a total ban on these weapons. They want to hold off until
progress is made in reducing Soviet advantages in conventional and
chemical arms.
   A further complication is Washington's desire, backed most
strongly by Britain, to upgrade NATO's short-range nuclear arsenal,
in part by deploying a new, longer-range version of the Lance
ballistic missile. Key factions of the Bonn government strongly
oppose this, saying it would force West Germany to bear too much of
the nuclear risk.
   Although Bonn and Washington appear to have agreed to play down
the short-range nuclear issue, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher is expected to tell the Brussels summit that NATO must
carry through with a commitment, first made in 1983, to upgrade
these weapons.
   French President Franoics Mitterrand, however, has indicated
that he is unhappy with the public focus on improving NATO's
remaining nuclear arsenal.
   ``It would be paradoxical and inopportune to overarm just now''
as Washington and Moscow are striving to further improve East-West
relations, Mitterrand said in an interview published Monday by
France's largest circulation newspaper, Oeust-France.
   The presence of Mitterrand at the NATO meeting is significant.
It demonstrates a growing desire by France to tighten its political
links to the alliance.
   No French president has attended a NATO summit since President
Charles de Gaulle pulled French forces out of NATO's joint command
in 1966.
   Beyond the immediate concerns about how to organize Western arms
control priorities, the European leaders view the Brussels meeting
as an opportunity to underscore their support for the U.S.-Soviet
missile treaty, which must receive a two-thirds vote of approval in
the U.S. Senate.
   The Europeans also are eager to publicize their support for
Reagan in advance of his expected meeting with Gorbachev in Moscow
in May or June.

   Inflation has pulled the enforcement teeth
from many government safety laws by reducing the impact of fines, a
coalition of consumer groups said Monday.
   Penalties for violating various health and safety laws have
remained essentially unchanged over the years, while inflation has
reduced the value of the amounts involved, the Consumer Federation
of America and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said in a
report.
   ``Letting civil penalties be eroded by inflation operates as if
there were a built-in depreciation schedule in our key health and
safety statutes,'' said Michael Waldman of the group Public
Citizen's Congress Watch, in a statement released with the study.
   Examples cited in the study included:
   _The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 retains its
original penalties of $1,000 per violation and $10,000 for failure
to provide a safe workplace. To keep place with inflation these
would have to increase to $2,970 and $29,700.
   _The Federal Aviation Act has retained the same $1,000 fine for
violations of safety rules since 1958. Inflation has reduced its
value to one-quarter of the original worth.
   _The Consumer Product Safety Commission Act civil penalties of
$2,000 per violation up to a maximum of $500,000 have not changed
since 1972, with inflation reducing them to 36 percent of their
original impact.
   The consumer groups submitted copies of the study to Congress in
support of a bill to adjust the civil penalties in federal laws to
keep them up to date with inflation.

   The ability of the Soviet Union to
wage an offensive land war is the ``most destabilizing factor'' in
European security and is likely to be a key topic at this week's
NATO summit, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany said Monday.
   Ambassador Richard Burt, in an interview with The Associated
Press, also termed ``a publicity stunt'' last week's removal of
some Soviet missiles from East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   He predicted that differences of opinion over modernizing
short-range nuclear missiles and other points of dispute would not
disrupt the Atlantic Alliance meeting in Brussels Wednesday and
Thursday.
   ``There is a growing consensus emerging within the Alliance _
which I believe will be reflected in the summit _ on the importance
now of negotiations on enhancing conventional arms stability,''
Burt said.
   ``There has been a focus on the nuclear dimension of security in
Europe,'' he said. ``But there is a growing view that the time has
come now to focus on the most destabilizing factor in European
security, which is the Soviet capability to wage an offensive war
against Western Europe.''
   ``Their forces are deployed, structured and trained to fight an
offensive war in Europe,'' Burt said, adding later that he meant an
``offensive land war.''
   Burt said it was mandatory to address this problem in arms
control negotiations.
   ``Military power casts a political shadow. The threat is not
just one of outright invasion.''
   There are about 990,000 active duty NATO troops in central
Europe, most of them in West Germany. Western sources say they face
about 1.2 million Soviet-led Warsaw Pact troops in Eastern Europe.
   West German leaders already have begun calling on the Soviet to
reduce their superiority in conventional weapons and undertake
other arms control measures.
   During the pre-summit preparations, Washington officials had a
highly publicized dispute with West German officials over U.S.
insistence on the need to modernize short-range nuclear weapons in
Western Europe.
   The Reagan administration later promised not to insist on the
modernization issue as a topic at this week's summit.
   ``There are no serious differences between Bonn and Washington
on these subjects,'' added the 41-year-old ambassador, an expert on
arms control and European security issues.
   Burt has been speaking out against claims by some politicians in
Bonn that the intermediate-range missile treaty signed in December
leaves West Germany vulnerable to Soviet nuclear attack.
   ``We will continue to be able to deter an attack in Europe with
U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in Europe and at sea,'' he said.
``There is a sense that this agreement leads to the
denuclearization of Europe. That is not the case.''
   ``In fact ... we should resist a trend towards the
denuclearization of Europe,'' he added.
   Asked about the highly publicized removal of some Soviet SS-12
rockets from Warsaw Pact members East Germany and Czechoslovakia
last week, Burt said: ``I tend to think this was basically a
publicity stunt.''
   ``I think they were mainly aiming to win points with Western
public opinion,'' Burt said.
   The ambassador added that only when the Soviets comply with the
verification provisions of the treaty will there be certainty that
the missiles have been destroyed. The treaty is awaiting
ratification by the U.S. Senate.

<HEAD>High Court Rules Psychiatrist Not Negligent In Mental Illness Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychiatrist who failed to commit a
mentally ill man can not be held negligent in the man's commission
of murder three days later, the Maine Supreme Court ruled Monday.
   Laurence D. Herst was acting in an official capacity on behalf
of the state and therefore immune from civil liability when he
examined Henry A. Taylor and determined he did not need to be
involuntarily committed to a mental institution, the high court
ruled in a 6-0 decision.
   Herst was employed by the Maine Medical Center at the time.
While that is not a state-owned facility, Herst examined Taylor at
the request of the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department.
   ``Even though Dr. Herst is not employed by a state mental
hospital, he is acting in an official capacity on behalf of the
state when performing the task of determining, for involuntary
commitment purposes, whether a `person is a mentally ill individual
and because of his illness, poses a likelihood of serious harm,'''
the court said.
   Taylor was arrested Nov. 14, 1978, after he drove through toll
booths and onto a restricted area at the Portland International
Jetport. He was taken to the Cumberland County Jail, where he began
to show ``erratic and violent behavior,'' the court said.
   Herst examined Taylor and found that he did not exhibit
tendencies that indicated he was a danger to himself or others.
After Taylor refused to voluntarily commit himself, he left the
hospital.
   Three days later Taylor killed Louise Michaud, 84, during a
shooting spree. He barricaded himself in his house but surrendered
four hours later when tear gas was used to force him outside.
   In 1979, he was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity and
sentenced to the Augusta Mental Health Institute. He was released
shortly after a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that set aside a lower
court's denial of Taylor's petition that he be released from the
institute as an outpatient.
   No suit had been filed. The Supreme Court issued its opinion at
the request of a lower court with the consent of Taylor and Herst.
   Taylor's attorney, Eugene C. Coughlin of Bangor, said he had not
received a copy of Friday's decision and declined to comment.
Steven J. Mogul, an attorney for Herst, was in court and could not
be immediately reached, his secretary said.

   Protesters hurled bombs at a police
jeep and burned other vehicles Monday in a new wave of
anti-government violence designed to disrupt this week's
parliamentary elections, witnesses and police said.
   Three people, including a policeman, were injured in two bomb
blasts during a rally called to protest the deaths of three people
reportedly killed during demonstrations the day before, witnesses
said.
   Meanwhile, an opposition leader called for continued protests to
disrupt Thursday's parliamentary balloting, charging that a fair
election is impossible under the administration of President
Hussain Mohammad Ershad.
   Obaidur Rahman, general secretary for the anti-government
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, told supporters at the rally here to
form ``resistance committees'' in the villages to disrupt ``this
farcical election called to perpetuate the rule of Ershad.''
   Mohammad Ershad, a senior police official posted near the rally
site, said ``people threw three bombs at a jeep carrying
paramilitary troops. One bomb exploded inside, injuring a
policeman.''
   Four cars were set ablaze by rioters in different parts of the
city, police said.
   In downtown Hazari Bagh, protesters set fire to three election
posts and damaged seven vehicles, witnesses said. They exploded
several crude bombs before police dispersed them, the witnesses
said.
   Five vehicles were attacked and damaged near the Dhaka
University, a center of anti-government protests.
   The opposition has called for a nationwide strike on Wednesday
and Thursday to disrupt the elections. The government has ordered
all schools and colleges closed to enable teachers to work at
polling places.
   At least 100 people were killed during local elections Feb. 10
in clashes among rival political groups.
   But government officials said they already were beefing up
security at polling places.
   Information Minister Anis Ul-Islam said at least 9,000 soldiers
would be deployed to help maintain peace on election day, forming
part of a 300,000-member force that also includes village defense
forces.
   ``They are moving out now. In some places they have already
moved,'' He said.
   There are about 50 million voters but only a small percentage is
expected to vote, according to political analysts.
   Sheik Hasina, leader of the opposition Awami League, said three
people were killed during a violent clash on Sunday. The violence
began shortly after Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia
addressed separate rallies at the city's main square.
   The women have led a series of strikes and demonstrations since
Nov. 10 to try to oust Ershad, a former army general who took power
in a bloodless coup in 1982.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party and several minor opposition parties are
runningup candidates for the 300 elected seats of Parliament, but
the main opposition groups have boycotted the balloting.
   The military has been the driving force in Bangladesh's
politics. In the country's 17-year history, every change in
government has been by coup. Ershad, 58, seized power in 1982 and
was elected president in a 1986 vote the opposition boycotted and
contends was rigged.

   Instead, Toms has called on the government to provide some form
of alternative national service for young men who object to joining
the army. He has urged that alternatives be found for those who do
not want to serve in black townships or in the bush wars in Angola
and South-West Africa.
   Toms served as an army doctor for two years following graduation
from medical school in 1978. However, he has decided to refuse
participation in the annual two-week camps required of all white
men who are physically fit.

<HEAD>Government Negotiating With Marcos</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said Monday it had
sent emissaries to talk with exiled President Ferdinand Marcos, who
has praised the Aquino government and said he was ready to
negotiate his return to the Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino said earlier Monday she would not yet
let Marcos come home. But other officials hinted he may be allowed
to return if he promises to behave and to return a some of the
billions of dollars he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.
   In Honolulu, where Marcos has lived since his ouster in February
1986, a spokesman for the former president read a statement. It
said in part:
   ``We must recognize the achievement of the present
administration in being able to survive this long when many
countries, especially those belonging to the Third World, have
floundered and gone under water. For this we must openly and
candidly congratulate the Aquino government.''
   The statement said Marcos was ready ``to negotiate the details
and conditions under which my family and I shall return to the
Philippines for the salvation of the country from the bloody
takeover by communist insurgents.''
   Marcos spokesman Lonnie Tan said Marcos had held meetings
recently in Hawaii with Philippine Reps. Francisco Sumulong and
Egmidio Tanjuatco, both relatives of Mrs. Aquino.
   ``Indeed there were negotiations. They came over here to talk to
the president to discuss the subject of him returning to the
Philippines,'' Tan said.
   He would not say what Marcos might offer to secure his return.
   Tanjuatco, a cousin of Mrs. Aquino, told reporters Monday that
he met Marcos on Jan. 26.
   ``We met only once,'' Tanjuatco said. ``The meeting was between
him and myself only. During the meeting, Mr. Marcos reiterated to
me his desire to return to the Philippines at the earliest
opportunity.''
   Sumulong, Mrs. Aquino's uncle and majority floor leader of the
House of Representatives, said he met Marcos separately in
February. Sumulong said the former president's health was
deteriorating and that he wanted to return home ``possibly because
he believes he is near the end of his life on Earth.''
   In a statement issued through her spokesman Teodoro Benigno,
Mrs. Aquino confirmed she had sent her relatives to Honolulu.
   ``Go there and listen,'' Benigno quoted her as saying. ``If we
can listen to other people, why can't we listen to Mr. Marcos.''
   Benigno revealed no details of the talks but said there was ``no
official response to the message as far as I know.''
   Marcos fled the Philippines during a civilian-military revolt in
the wake of fraud-tainted Feb. 7, 1986 presidential elections in
which both he and Mrs. Aquino claimed victory.
   Mrs. Aquino canceled the passports of Marcos and his immediate
family and banned them from the country. Asked by reporters Monday
if she would lift the ban, she replied, ``Not yet.''
   But Sen. Neptali Gonzales, a former justice minister, told
reporters Marcos might be allowed to return if he swears allegiance
to the Aquino government and settles claims that he plundered
billions of dollars from the treasury.
   Emmanuel Pelaez, the Philippine ambassador to the United States,
told reporters in Manila that if Marcos ``returns the stolen
wealth, I think there are good chances for him to come home.''
   Meanwhile, officials said the name ``Imelda Marcos'' was on the
passenger list of a flight to Manila from Australia. A Marcos
spokesman said the former first lady was still in Hawaii.
   Immigration supervisor Rolando Mancilla said the woman arrived
Saturday on a Philippine Airlines flight from Sydney and gave a
home address in Ilocos Norte, Marcos' home province. He said a
Narcotics Command agent found the name during a routine check of
the manifest.
   In Honolulu, a servant who answered the phone at the Marcos
residence said ``she's here, he's here, both of them.'' But he
refused to give his name or put either Marcos or his wife on the
line.

   Evan Mecham today became the first
governor in almost 60 years to face an impeachment trial as the
state's chief justice convened a jury of 30 state senators to
decide whether to remove him from office.
   First on the agenda was a series of motions, including one to
throw out the charges against Mecham, a Republican whose 13 months
in office have also been scarred by a recall effort and a criminal
indictment.
   ``The Senate trial of Evan Mecham does not concern merely this
one officeholder, but instead addresses the very essence of
democracy in our state constitution,'' Senate Minority Leader Alan
Stephens, a Democrat, said in a floor speech shortly before the
court convened.
   ``We are really testing our form of government. Will we stand up
and do our duty amid calls from the public to intimidate us?''
   Senate leaders say they'll take up to two months to hear
testimony and arguments before deciding whether the governor should
be removed and possibly barred from holding elective office.
   Mecham, 63, also faces a March 22 criminal trial on six felony
charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, and a May 17 recall
election.
   Twenty-nine of the state's 30 senators were at desks in the
brown-walled chamber as the presiding officer, Arizona Supreme
Court Frank X. Gordon Jr., convened the Senate as an impeachment
court. A small gallery was packed with reporters and visitors, and
the trial was being broadcast on radio and television.
   The state House was represented by a five member impeachment
board of managers, or prosecutors, while Mecham himself stayed at
his temporary office in suburban Glendale and was represented by
several lawyers.
   After the trial began, the Senate agreed on a voice vote to let
the governor's original lawyer, Murray Miller, withdraw from the
case. Miller was replaced by Washington attorney Jerris Leonard
last week in a surprise move.
   A clerk read the impeachment articles, and the Senate then
considered and denied a defense motion seeking to have
consideration of an article referring to the campaign loan delayed
until after his criminal trial.
   The Senate broke for lunch at noon while considering a motion to
throw out all charges.
   Mecham maintains he'll be acquitted in both trials, win the
recall election and return to the office he gave up to Democratic
Secretary of State Rose Mofford after he was impeached Feb. 5 on a
46-14 House vote.
   The senator absent this morning was Republican Hal Runyan, a
Republican who suffered a stroke in November.
   At a news conference Saturday, Mecham said winning acquittal in
criminal court is more important than persuading the Senate to keep
him in office.
   ``I could have my freedom taken away and be sent to jail if I
were guilty (in criminal court). Doesn't that somehow seem to you
... a little more important than the job as governor? It does to
me,'' Mecham said.
   The state Supreme Court on Friday refused an emergency request
by Mecham to intervene and delay the Senate trial until after the
criminal trial. The court planned to discuss Tuesday whether to
grant an injunction, although several justices already have said
they believe the court lacks jurisdiction.
   Mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court. A new
attorney hired by Mecham last week, Thomas Crowe, said he would
decide by Wednesday where the appeal would be filed.
   The governor claims the impeachment trial threatens his right to
a fair criminal trial because the Senate proceedings will not be
bound by the same rules of evidence as a criminal court but will be
widely publicized to prospective jurors.
   ``As governor of this state, I ask nothing more than is accorded
to every garden-variety criminal,'' he said. ``Is this a star
chamber or will we proceed under the time-tested constitutional
mandate that I be afforded all of my basic constitutional rights?''
   The House has leveled 23 charges against Mecham accusing him of
concealing the $350,000 loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and trying to
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state
official against a witness before the grand jury that investigated
Mecham.
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane said the Senate has decided to
hear testimony on all charges even if it appears there could be a
vote to convict him on the first charges heard.
   Prosecutor Paul Eckstein said he and co-counsel William French
planned to begin with testimony on the allegation that Mecham
ordered Department of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead not to
cooperate with a probe of the alleged death threat against former
Mecham aide Donna Carlson, who testified before the state grand
jury investigating Mecham.
   State official Lee Watkins, who has since resigned, has denied
making the threat.
   Two-thirds of the 30 Senate votes are required to convict
Mecham, who is the first U.S. governor to be impeached since 1929,
when Huey Long of Louisiana and Henry S. Johnston of Oklahoma were
impeached. Long was never tried, while Johnston was removed.
   Of the 16 governors in the nation's history to be impeached, six
were convicted and removed from office.
   Mecham, who never was considered part of the state's Republican
establishment, won the governorship in a three-way race 1986 on his
fifth try.
   He immediately became embroiled in controversy when he canceled
a Martin Luther King holiday for state workers, saying it was
illegally declared by his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Bruce
Babbitt.
   Mecham has been criticized for defending the use of the word
``pickaninny'' in a book and for making remarks that angered women,
Jews, homosexuals and the Japanese.

   NASA announced Monday it will
acquire a Boeing 747-100 jetliner to use as a second space shuttle
transporter.
   The 231-foot-long aircraft will be modified to carry shuttles
piggyback from landing sites back to the launch center here.
Officials said the second vehicle would increase ferrying
capability and eliminate a transportation problem that could result
if there were only one carrier and it was grounded or suffered a
mishap.
   The three remaining shuttles have not flown since the Challenger
accident two years ago. When flights resume, presently planned for
August, NASA said that, for safety reasons, shuttles will land for
the foreseeable future at the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., instead of on the runway here, where there is little
margin for error.
   A letter contract has been signed for the aircraft with Boeing
Military Airplane Co., a division of the Boeing Co. of Seattle.
Required modifications and cost are being negotiated, NASA said.

   Police Monday looked for suspects who
apparently fired a shot from a van on Interstate 95, killing a man
on his way to a party after taking the Florida Bar exam.
   Irv Ribler, 26, was shot just below his left shoulder Saturday.
His car sped across the median, three lanes of oncoming traffic and
plowed into a gully.
   Friends following Ribler's car told police the shot was fired
from a van whose occupants had just thrown a small object at the
victim's sportscar, but that was unconfirmed, Broward County
Sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal said Sunday.
   No other traffic hit Ribler's car and no other injuries were
reported.
   ``He left me a note before he left Saturday,'' Ribler's mother,
Zaida Ribler, said Sunday. ``It says, `Mom, see you in the morning.
I love you. Irv.'
   ``He was a good son. He studied so hard. He worked in the yard.
He cleaned the house. He didn't drink,'' said his mother, who
cleaned houses and worked as a tailor seven days a week to put her
only child through Florida State University and the University of
Miami Law School. ``Now my life has ended. Everything is over.''
   Ribler was graduated from law school in May and initially failed
the bar exam. Since then, he had studied constantly. After taking
the test Wednesday, he was elated, certain he had passed, friends
said.
   ``His whole life was centered on passing the bar and working as
a public defender,'' said classmate Manny Fernandez, 24. ``He had
some offers. He was almost there.''

<HEAD>Town Meeting Day Finds State Under Development Pressures</HEAD>

   Town Meeting Day is as much a symbol of
Vermont as the maple sap that flows soon after, but this year's
town meetings find Vermonters fearful of their state's future
because farms are going out of business and open land is sprouting
vacation homes.
   ``We are losing our farms and we are losing rural Vermont at an
unbelievable rate,'' says Jack Starr, a dairy farmer from Troy.
   The changing Vermont is evident everywhere:
   _ Vermont has lost more than 300 dairy farms, 10 percent of its
total, in just the last two years;
   _ Average housing values, fueled by competition from affluent
out-of-staters, have increased 48 percent in two years;
   _ The annual number of applications for development permits has
almost doubled in the past six years;
   _ The number of houses being bought by and built for
out-of-staters seeking a vacation retreat is skyrocketing. In 1986,
52 percent of all new housing constructed in Windham County alone
was second homes.
   The reasons for the development pressure are simple: Improved
transportation networks have brought Vermont closer to Boston and
New York; a booming economy has provided people with the cash; and
Vermont's ski resorts are expanding to become more attractive
year-round.
   To help preserve farms, some towns are using the limited clout
of their annual town meetings, a New England fixture in which
residents vote directly on town expenditures and policy. In Pawlet,
voters are being asked to exempt farm silos from property taxes, a
move that would mean a savings of $200 a year for each of the
town's 17 farms.
   ``It's going to be a combination of these little things that
keep the farmers going,'' said state Rep. Perry Waite of Pawlet.
``Do you want New Jersey or do you want a few farms left? I don't
feel we can afford to lose one farm in Pawlet.''
   And the Legislature is considering a controversial $40 million
package that includes the first-in-the-nation state subsidy for
dairy farmers, to offset cuts in federal milk price supports.
   ``It's a radical proposal, but these times demand it,'' said
Rep. Paul Poirier, the House Democratic leader and chairman of a
special House committee on growth.
   ``This has become the year of the farmer,'' said Rep. Michael
Bernhardt, the House Republican leader. ``Saving farms seems to be
something people can identify with as a way to save Vermont.''
   The concerns over growth reached a boiling point last fall,
prompting Gov. Madeleine Kunin to appoint a special Governor's
Commission on Vermont's Future.
   More than 2,000 people attended the commission's 11 public
hearings, with several hundred voicing their fears.
   ``I don't see a lot of `rural' going on anymore,'' said Peter
Saman of Woodstock. ``If Vermont is going to be here, I think rural
has to exist or we're going to live in Disneyland.''
   Victoria Fraser of Williston told the commission: ``I am afraid
we will obscure the soul of Vermont by covering her with parking
lots, highways and condominiums.''
   ``Too many Vermonters in towns near major ski areas and tourist
centers are feeling like strangers in their own communities,
hesitating to go to the grocery store or post office for fear of
sitting in traffic or waiting in line,'' said Mary McCallum of
Proctorsville.
   Kunin, armed with the commission's report, devoted her entire
state-of-the-state address in January to detailing ``today's
unprecedented growth'' and describing her own fears about the
changes.
   Kunin said the only way to regain control is ``to inaugurate a
new and tough planning process which will guide Vermont into a
future that we envision for ourselves.''
   The special House growth committee has endorsed a far-reaching
proposal that calls for $20 million to go into a special fund to
buy up open land and help provide affordable housing. It also calls
for stronger planning and would provide for regional tax sharing,
under which property-rich resort towns would share some of their
tax wealth with outlying communities.
   But the cornerstone of the legislative proposal is the dairy
assistance, prompted by reports that between 10 percent and 40
percent of the state's farmers will be forced out of business in
the next two years.
   The federal price support for 100 pounds of milk paid to farmers
now stands at $10.60, almost $3 below what it was in 1980, and the
decline has meant the difference to some farms. Under the proposal,
the state would pay farmers an extra 50 cents per 100 pounds.

<HEAD>US Should Be Able To Avoid Recession This Year, Economists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The October stock market crash will contribute
to a significant slowdown in economic growth this year but the
country should be able to avoid a recession, economists for top
U.S. corporations predicted Monday.
   The National Association of Business Economists said its latest
member survey found economists in a more upbeat mood than three
months ago when more than half of them said the record fall in
stock prices on Oct. 19 would lead to a recession in 1988.
   In the latest survey, the number forecasting a recession this
year had dropped to one-fourth, good news for Republicans hoping to
hold onto the White House. But an overwhelming 83 percent of the
anlysts said a downturn was very likely before the end of the next
president's first year in office.
   ``Back in November there was a great deal of nervousness about
what Oct. 19 meant to the economy,'' said Kathleen Cooper, who
briefed reporters on the new forecast. ``Since that time, we have
had good Christmas sales, good employment growth and consumer
confidence surveys have improved. These things make economists feel
better about the future.''
   While the next president will likely have to deal with a
recession early in his first term, the economists said they
expected the economy this year to expand at a modest pace of 2
percent, as measured by the gross national product.
   This would be about half of the 3.9 percent GNP growth turned in
during 1987. The Reagan administration, by contrast, is more
optimistically forecasting 2.4 percent GNP growth this year, when
measured from the fourth quarter of 1987.
   ``Even though most of us don't expect a recession, we will have
much slower growth than in 1987,'' said Ms. Cooper, who is chief
economist for Security Pacific National Bank of Los Angeles. She
said the stock market decline had caused many economists to slash
their GNP forecasts by between 0.5 percent and 1 percent.
   In other predictions, the survey results from 200 economists
found:
   _ Unemployment will creep up this year because of the sluggish
growth forecasts, rising from the current 5.8 percent level to 6.1
percent by the end of the year.
   _ Inflation will remain under control with consumer prices
rising 4.2 percent this year, a bit slower than the 4.4 percent
consumer inflation recorded in 1987.
   _ The federal budget deficit will rise to $157 billion in the
current fiscal year, but then resume falling, droping to $140
billion by 1990. This is more pessimistic than the Reagan
administration, which puts this year's deficit at $146.7 billion, a
further improvement from the $150.4 billion 1987 deficit.
   _ The foreign trade deficit, which hit a record $171 billion
last year, will finally start coming down, dipping to $150 billion
this year and $130 billion in 1989. Half of this year's overall
growth will come from improvements in the trade deficit, the
economists said.
   _ Interest rates will hold steady, ending up the year about
where they are currently. Banks cut their prime rate, used to set
interest rates on a variety of corporate and consumer loans, to 8.5
percent in early February and analysts forecast this would be the
rate in effect at year's end.
   Ms. Cooper said that the optimistic outlook for interest rates
stemmed in part from a belief that the Federal Reserve would be
easing its grip on the money supply in the first half of the year
in an effort to keep the recovery alive.
   She said over two-thirds of the economists believed the Fed
would be easing credit conditions in the coming six months with
one-fourth of the analysts looking for a cut in the discount rate,
the interest the Fed charges to make bank loans.
   Ms. Cooper said that the economists believe that the dollar,
which has at time fallen sharply on foreign currency exchanges,
will stabilize this year with only one-fifth of the analysts
expecting a decline of 10 percent or more. Just three months ago,
more than 40 percent of the economists were forecasting a decline
in the dollar that was at least that large.

<HEAD>Leaders Discuss Endorsing Candidate Before Super Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Democratic leaders are
discussing the possibility of acting together on a pre-Super
Tuesday endorsement of one of the six candidates pursuing their
party's presidential nomination.
   Former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia and Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia confirmed on Monday such discussions have taken place but
both cautioned against assuming that an endorsement would be
forthcoming.
   ``It's only a possibility,'' said Robb.
   Nunn described it as ``a question that is in considerable
doubt.''
   Robb and Nunn discussed the endorsement in separate interviews
during a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of
elected officials who banded together in 1985 to halt what they
considered the leftward drift of the national party.
   Robb was chairman of the DLC the past two years and Nunn
succeeded him at this meeting.
   The agenda for the two-day meeting included discussions of the
economy, but politics was the topic that dominated most
conversation, particularly the impact of Super Tuesday March 8 when
20 states, most of them south of the Mason-Dixon Line, and American
Samoa will hold Democratic presidential primaries or caucuses.
   In a luncheon speech, Nunn, who considered entering the
Democratic presidential race and decided against it, warned that
``political marketing seems to be replacing political leadership.''
   The Georgia senator said, ``First, campaign consultants tell the
candidates what they think the public wants to hear _ usually more
services and less taxes _ then the candidates deliver the message,
usually avoiding any implication of short-term individual sacrifice
for long-term national gain.''
   ``The art of campaigning,'' he went on, ``is in danger of
becoming divorced from the art of governing. The real question of
the 1988 election is not who wins, but whether the winner can
effectively govern America.''
   Members of the DLC took the lead in convincing Southern
legislatures to schedule their presidential primaries on the same
day in an effort to give the region a stronger voice in selection
of the Democratic presidential nominee.
   Robb told the group that Super Tuesday was important ``because
Democrats can't win the White House without winning the South _
it's that simple.''
   Robb noted that one-third of the delegates to the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta in July would be selected on that
day and that the 20 states also represented 207 electoral college
votes, 76 percent of those needed to be elected president.
   ``The general election chances of the Democratic Party rest with
these 20 states. The preliminaries are over and Super Tuesday is
indisputably the main event of the primary season.''
   Four Democratic presidential candidates are in a furious battle
for support in the Super Tuesday states _ Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee, and Jesse Jackson. Dukakis, Gephardt and Gore are
from Super Tuesday states, while Jackson, a native of South
Carolina, has a powerful base in the region's black community.
   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida said that 30 days after Super Tuesday
``there are going to be three candidates left, there'll be Dukakis,
there'll be Jackson and there will be either Gephardt or Gore.''
   The former Florida governor described Gephardt, who has made
trade the central issue of his campaign, as ``the only candidate
who is running a message campaign. So he has the benefit of
operating almost in a vacuum.''
   Graham said Gore, who has been counting on his Southern
background to attract votes on Super Tuesday, ``has got to find
some reason beyond geography to get people to vote for him.''
   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas summed up the debate between Gore
and Gephardt this way:
   ``Gore's major argument was vote for me and I won't lose the
general election for you because I'm tough on foreign policy.
Democrats get beat by being weak on foreign policy.
   ``Gephardt's argument is I'll win the general election for you
by having a good economic policy. Democrats win on economic policy.
   ``Both of them are telling the truth. Both of them are right.''
   Clinton said he had not been involved in discussions of an
endorsement and said, ``I doubt if we could all agree.''

   A recent Star Wars space experiment has
increased the confidence of Pentagon scientists that they can
defeat attempts to fool a missile defense by using decoy warheads,
the head of the program said Monday.
   Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, the Air Force general in charge of
the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, said the so-called
Delta 181 space experiment conducted three weeks ago had provided a
``tremendous amount of data'' that already was expanding scientific
understanding of how objects look as they travel through space.
   That, in turn, will be crucial to devising infrared, radar,
laser radar and other types of sensors that can tell the difference
between a real nuclear warhead and a fake one traveling through
space, Abrahamson said at a Pentagon briefing.
   While months if not years of research are still ahead, ``I think
all of our evidence, so far ... is that, yes, we should be able to
find effective ways to discriminate'' between decoy and real
warheads, he said.
   The three-star general also acknowledged, however, that budget
cuts imposed by Congress this year have slowed the Star Wars
program by at least a year and possibly more. The Reagan
administration had wanted to spend $5.2 billion on research this
year, but received $3.5 billion.
   A future president probably will not be in a position to make a
decision on deploying a rudimentary missile defense system until
1993 or 1994, Abrahamson said, and actual deployment then could not
begin until sometime after 1995.
   Star Wars _ known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative _
is a research program aimed at developing lasers and other types of
exotic weapons that could be deployed in space and on the ground to
automatically shoot down incoming nuclear missiles.
   Abrahamson and a top program official, Maj. Andrew J. Green,
appeared at the Pentagon on Monday to discuss Delta 181, which has
been described as the most ambitious Star Wars experiment ever
conducted in space.
   Delta 181 was launched Feb. 8 from the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida. It boosted a special satellite into space that was used
for 12 hours to conduct a series of tests.
   Sensors on the 6,000-pound satellite were used to track how a
variety of different-shaped objects appeared in space and against
various backgrounds, such as the Earth's surface and the portion of
the atmosphere just above the ground called ``Earth's limb.''
   Data from the tests are still being transmitted back to the
ground but that process should be completed by the end of the week,
Green said.
   The data already in hand, however, show a laser radar sensor on
board the satellite succeeded in highlighting ``vast differences''
in the way various objects looked in space, including contrasts
based on the weight of the object, Green said.
   SDI officials consistently have termed the mission a success,
but the magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology reported on
Feb. 15 that the satellite had been unable to complete ``battle
management fire control computations.''
   The magazine blamed the problem on computers, but Air Force Col.
John Otten, assistant director of the SDI kinetic energy office,
said at the time that the problem was caused by an optical sensor
trying to lock onto an object beyond its range.
   Some test data were lost when the sensor gave false information
to on-board computers. But Otten said the losses were minor because
the tracking exercise, in which the sensor was to look away from a
target and then back to the target, was a secondary objective of
the mission.

<HEAD>Just Another Monday at Arizona Capitol for Impeachment Trial</HEAD>

   The grass was being cut, the windows
washed and the cactus garden weeded as employees hurried to work.
Just another Monday morning at the Arizona Capitol.
   Except for the governor, who went on trial.
   Only a few of Gov. Evan Mecham's supporters showed up as his
trial began in the Senate. Seats were open in the gallery. Three
bus loads of schoolchildren made their annual field trip to learn
about government, and the plaza in front of the Senate was quiet.
   ``Most of the people are working. I had to take a chance of
losing my job to be here,'' said Andy Cosentino, a supporter of the
governor who was carrying a Bible and a placard. ``People are going
to have to make a sacrifice to make sure justice prevails.''
   While Mecham's woes have drawn some large and loud rallies, the
embattled Republican's trial opened with little fanfare. Mecham did
not attend the opening sesion.
   By the 9 a.m. scheduled start of his trial, only a half-dozen
protesters patrolled the plaza. ``More are due anytime now,'' said
Cosentino.
   By 10 a.m., their ranks had swelled to about 20.
   One woman placed a large radio by her signs so she could hear
the proceedings in the Senate, which must deliberate 23 charges
made by the House.
   A few retirees milled about. One group laid a paper railroad
across the courtyard with a drawing of the governor, gagged and
bound on the tracks.
   ``He's being railroaded,'' said Wilma Harm of Phoenix. ``The man
has done nothing to be called upon like this.''
   When the doors were opened to public seating in the gallery,
only 15 people were in line. June Reynolds, a retired government
teacher who lives in Scottsdale, arrived two hours early and was
first.
   ``I'm concerned about what's happening to the state,'' she said.
   The loudest noises in the plaza came from the lawnmowers. Even
the air was calm, and the scent of orange blossom suffused the
still air.
   The House impeached Mecham on Feb. 5, accusing him of concealing
a $350,000 campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and trying to
thwart an investigation of an allegation that a state official
threatened the life of a grand jury witness. Two-thirds of the 30
Senate votes are required to convict.

<HEAD>Government Expanding Program For Payment With Credit Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is expanding a program
to allow more government services and non-tax debts to be paid for
with credit cards, budget officials said Monday.
   Under the program, the government is expected to process 130
million credit-card transactions annually by next year, or $6.5
billion worth, said Joseph Wright, deputy director of the Office of
Management and Budget.
   ``It will make us the largest credit card user in the world,''
Wright said.
   The government now accepts credit cards for some items,
including publications of the Government Printing Office.
   But Wright and Budget Director James C. Miller III told a news
conference this program would be expanded to include a wide array
of new items _ from purchasing passports to paying some fines.
   Credit cards will also be more widely used by the government
itself, both to pay expenses of officials who are travelling and
for some federal procurement, the officials said.
   ``Everybody uses credit cards _ except for the federal
government,'' Miller said.
   The comments came as the White House released President Reagan's
report to Congress on ``Management of the United States
Government.''
   The report noted that ``over half of U.S. households own one or
more credit cards,'' and that the administration planned to begin
making more use of them.
   ``For the government, credit cards make collections easier in an
electronic environment, reduce delinquencies, cut down on bad
checks, eliminate paperwork, and improve information received on
collections,'' the report said.
   The report said that agencies that would start accepting credit
cards by this April included:
   _ The Interstate Commerce Commission, for duties, fees and fines.
   _ The National Archives, for sales of documents and publications.
   _ The U.S. courts, for filing fees, fines, opinions, and
videotapes of proceedings.
   _ The Federal Trade Commission, for fines and fees.
   _ The Army Corps of Engineeers, for permits, fees and map sales.
   _ The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for sale of flood
maps.
   Wright said that OMB is also working with the IRS to develop
guidelines that might be used later on to enable taxpayers pay
their taxes with credit cards. However, he said to do so would
require legislation from Congress _ legislation the administration
is not currently seeking.
   The management report also said the government is studying, for
possible future use, a system under which ``smart cards'' would be
issued by the government to those who receive federal payments and
benefits, including Social Security recipients.
   ``These cards (would) have embedded on them information about
the cardholder that can be accessed electronically. Potentially
(the) cards could make available funds for food stamps, social
security payments, or grants and control their use electronically
through central computers.''

   Democrats and Republicans in 20 states and American Samoa will
vote in statewide elections or participate in presidential caucuses
on March 8, Super Tuesday.
   We plan frequent transmission of at least 10 separate tables
summarizing the popular vote and delegate allocation both by state
and cumulatively for all participating states. In addition,
separate formats will summarize activity in five states conducting
precinct caucuses that night.
   
   All tables will be transmitted at least once an hour, and more
frequently as circumstances warrant.
   
   Our lineup includes the following:
   
   _ PRIMARY VOTE STATE-BY-STATE. Summary packages displaying the
latest popular vote, by state. Separate packages will cover
Democratic and Republican candidates. These tables are slugged
BC-PP-Dem-Pres-All and BC-PP-GOP-Pres-All.
   
   _ CAUCUS RESULTS STATE-BY-STATE. Identical in format to the
Primary Vote State-by-State tables, with separate transmissions for
Democratic and Republican caucuses. Since caucus rules may differ
from state to state, the numbers in each of the summaries may not
mean exactly the same thing. These tables are slugged
BC-PC-Dem-Pres-All and BC-PC-GOP-Pres-All.
   
   _ SUPER TUESDAY DELEGATES STATE-BY-STATE. Packages displaying
the latest delegate allocation by state, with separate packages for
the two parties. The formats are similar to the primary vote
formats. These tables are slugged BC-PP-Dem-Deleg-All and
BC-PP-GOP-Deleg-All.
   
   _ SUPER TUESDAY DELEGATE SUMMARY. Cumulative summary of
delegates allocated in all states holding elections and caucuses on
Super Tuesday, with a separate summary for each party. These
summaries are slugged BC-PP-Dem-Deleg-Sum and BC-PP-GOP-Deleg-Sum.
   
   _ SUPER TUESDAY VOTE. Cumulative summary of the vote in all
states holding primary elections on Super Tuesday, with a single
summary for both parties. These summaries are slugged
BC-PP-Pres-TotVot-Sum.
   
   _ NATIONAL DELEGATE TABLE. An update of the overall delegate
summary table that has been moving on national wires for several
weeks. It gives the breakdown of the presidential preferences of
all national convention delegates selected or allocated thus far,
plus trend information. A single table contains totals for both
parties. This table is slugged BC-US-Deleg-Sum.
   
   _ U.S. SENATE STATE-BY-STATE. Summary package displaying the
latest popular vote in U.S. Senate races in Maryland, Mississippi
and Texas, with a separate package for party. These tables are
slugged BC-Dem-Senate-State-by-State and
BC-GOP-Senate-State-by-State.
   
   Depending on election-night developments, we may transmit
single-state summaries on some presidential primaries.
   
   Samples of the first four formats listed above will follow this
advisory. Sluglines contain the word ``SAMPLE'' but otherwise are
as indicated above. For illustration only, the summaries and tables
include mock votes and percentages rather than zeroes.
   
   The samples contain the candidate names in order and total
precincts as they now exist for each state. That information may
change before election day.
   
   Please call Tom Jory at 212 621-1614 if you have questions.

<HEAD>Jackson Showing in Maine Seen as Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's strong second-place finish in
Maine, following respectable showings elsewhere, proves he is
attaining what he lacked throughout 1984 _ expansion beyond his
black base of support.
   In a state with a 1 percent black population, Jackson got 28
percent of the vote on Sunday after campaigning for only two days
in Maine. Winner Michael Dukakis, well known to Maine voters as
governor of nearby Massachusetts, garnered 42 percent.
   On Monday, addressing cheering students at Pembroke State
University in North Carolina, Jackson shouted, ``Talk about
mainstream; try the state of Maine.''
   Political consultant Ann Lewis, who has informally advised the
Jackson campaign, called Maine ``the most significant breakthrough
state for him so far.''
   In Iowa and New Hampshire he finished fourth out of seven
contenders, she noted, after devoting considerable time and
resources. In Minnesota he was second with 20 percent in last
week's caucuses, thanks to the state's liberal activists, she said.
   But in Maine, where Jackson's 28 percent contrasted to the 1
percent that he got when he ran in 1984, she said, ``The force of
his message produced votes for him in a state in which he has been
unable to make a major commitment of resources.''
   In Maine, Jackson did buy $10,000 worth of TV ads in the days
before the caucuses.
   Bob Beckel, a top political adviser to Walter Mondale's 1984
camapign, called Jackson ``one of the best hidden political stories
of the year.''
   ``I would say it's a sign of a growing movement among non-black
supporters of Jackson, and for people to try to ignore it, they're
making a great mistake,'' he said.
   ``People don't want to buy the notion that Jesse Jackson has got
a message that people listen to and that has begun to rise above
his blackness,'' he added. ``Somebody in this party has to to
recognize that this is a significant guy in the party.''
   Jackson carried two of Maine's largest cities, Portland and
Bangor, and won considerable support among the gay community and
students. In his bid to expand his base, he has targeted those
groups as well as poor people, blue-collar workers and farmers.
   He beat Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., handily in the mill town
of Jay. Both candidates went to Jay last fall to show solidarity
with workers of International Paper Co. who have been on strike
since last June. The company has hired replacements in the meantime.
   Gary McGrane, Jay Democratic chairman, commented that Jackson
``said a scab is a scab. He didn't call them replacement workers.
People understand plain talk.''
   Political analyst William Schneider said that while Jackson has
gotten white votes, there is evidence the votes come not so much
from the economically oppressed as from ``the radical chic.''
   ``It could be the Village Voice crowd instead of the
downtrodden,'' he said, citing exit polls from Iowa and New
Hampshire that showed a good portion of Jackson's white supporters
were upscale well-educated liberals.
   But he and other analysts also said that besides being better
known nationwide than the other candidates _ excepting former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart _ Jackson has a clear, strong message that
does not change from state to state.
   ``There is no other candidate in the race who really stands for
the old politics ... what I would call Democratic fundamentalism,''
as espoused by the late Sen. Hubert Humphrey, Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, said Schneider.
   Beckel added, ``I think people consistently underestimate him.
They forget one important thing in politics. That is that message
matters. He has got a message ... and it appeals to a lot of
people.''
   Rick Barton, Democratic state chairman, who had predicted
Jackson would do as well in Maine as he had a week earlier in
Minnesota's caucuses, contended that timing was a key to Jackson's
success.
   Jackson's successful appearance at the University of Maine in
Orono on Feb. 11, just after Iowa's caucuses and just before the
New Hampshire primary, was ``just the right time ... when Maine
Democrats were starting to lock in,'' he said.
   Barton said the scaling back of the Paul Simon and Hart
campaigns also helped Jackson. He suggested that defections from
those candidates inflated Jackson's support by 5 percentage points.

<HEAD>`Hooligans' Rampage in Soviet City; Ethnic Tensions Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Hooligans'' went on a rampage in a city in
Azerbaidzhan, Tass reported Monday. An Armenian dissident said
``thugs'' beat and knifed Armenians as the ethnic hatred kindled by
a territorial dispute spread in the Caucasus republics.
   A Soviet deputy prosecutor general said over the weekend that
two people in another region of Azerbaidzhan had been killed in
``disorders'' sparked by Armenian demands that a part of
Azerbaidzhan be reattached to their republic.
   Street demonstrations, in which some witnesses said more than 1
million people participated, took place in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan last week to call for the annexation of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaidzhan, whose 157,000 inhabitants
are mostly Armenian.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Friday to the people
of Armenia and Azerbaidzhan for ``civic maturity,'' but state-run
media reports and accounts reaching dissident circles in Moscow on
Monday indicated he had failed to quell the dispute.
   The official Tass news agency said a ``group of hooligans
provoked disturbances'' Sunday in the industrial city of Sumgait,
1,150 miles south of Moscow on the Caspian Sea. ``Rampage and
violence followed,'' it said.
   The Tass dispatch on the unrest in Sumgait was the first
official report of civil disturbances in the Soviet Union since it
reported that 3,000 people rioted in Alma Ata, capital of the
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, in December 1986. Two people
died and hundreds were injured in those riots.
   Tass gave no indication what led to the violence in Sumgait, a
chemical and steelmaking center that is Azerbaidzhan's most
important industrial city after its capital, Baku.
   A Moscow-based dissident said the disturbance was sparked by
tensions between Azerbaidzhan's dominant ethnic group, the Azeris,
and Armenians. Azeris are predominantly Moslem, while Armenians are
predominantly Christian.
   ``Thugs in Sumgait went up to people and asked them if they were
Armenian or not,'' said Sergei Grigoyants, who is of Armenian
origin. ``They started to beat up people who said they were
Armenian. Several people were knifed.''
   Grigoyants, who said he had received information on the unrest
from sources in Yerevan, said apparently no one was killed in the
Sunday fracas. He said ``several dozen'' Azeris reportedly were
involved in the attacks.
   Tass indicated that authorities in Sumgait, a city of more than
160,000 people, fear a resurgence of violence.
   ``Measures have been taken to normalize the situation in the
city and safeguard discipline and public order,'' Tass said, adding
that an investigation was under way.
   The watch officer at the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Baku,
reached by telephone Monday evening, said he had no information on
the disturbances in the city 22 miles to the northwest. An
Azerbaidzhan government official in Moscow refused comment.
   Sumgait is 150 miles northeast of the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a region smaller than the U.S. state of Delaware,
which traditionally had been part of Armenia until the Soviet
government put it under the jurisdiction of Azerbaidzhan in 1923.
   Deputy Prosecutor General Alexander Katusev was dispatched from
Moscow last week to investigate reports that the clash over
Nagorno-Karabakh had led to ethnic bloodshed between Azeris and
Armenians.
   In a weekend report on Baku state-run radio, Katusev said two
people in a district of Azerbaidzhan that borders the contested
region ``fell victim to murder'' in disorders linked to the
territorial dispute.
   Katusev identified the dead as Bakhtiar Uliyev, 16, and Ali
Gadzhiyev, 23, both of the Agdamsky district. Several other people,
he said, ``suffered bruises, beatings and injuries that do not
threaten their life and health.''
   The prosecutor spoke over Baku radio on Saturday, in a report
that was monitored by the British Broadcasting Co. in London.
   ``There are no other victims or people who were maimed either in
Nagorno-Karabakh or any other part of the republic (of
Azerbaidzhan),'' Katusev said.
   However, Valery Senderov, another Moscow-based dissident, said
Friday that there had been street scuffles in Baku when Armenians
demonstrated outside three downtown movie theaters last week to
demand that Nagorno-Karabakh be made part of Armenia.
   ``Blood was spilled,'' Senderov said, citing telephone reports
he received from sources in Azerbaidzhan. He said no serious
injuries were reported.
   Gorbachev told the party leadership in a Feb. 18 speech that
relations among the more than 100 ethnic groups that make up the
Soviet population is the country's greatest problem. He said the
party Central Committee would hold a meeting to discuss those
relations.
   Armenian broadcasts Friday also said the Central Committee would
reconsider whether it should reattach Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
It refused such a request in January.

<TEXT>
   An unsuspecting pilot wound up with his face in the
dirt, M-16s pointed at his head and his ruined plane upside down on
the runway after drug agents mistook him for a cocaine smuggler.
   Gustavo Viera, a Miami accountant, has received an apology from
Vice President George Bush's anti-drug task force, the Drug
Enforcement Admimistration and the U.S. Customs Service.
   However, he said Monday he had received no compensation and
plans to file a claim against the government.
   Viera said he did not see or hear the Customs Service helicopter
that followed him to the airport, and worries what would happen if
the service's controversial proposal to shoot down suspected
traffickers is adopted.
   ``Had that been in effect, I wouldn't be here talking to you
today,'' said Viera. ``When you're in one of these airplanes and
the engine is loud and they shoot a warning, you're not going to
hear it.''
   The incident occurred July 9 when Viera flew his Piper Cherokee
_ bought only three weeks before _ over Biscayne Bay. He then
headed for a small airport south of Miami.
   A subsequent letter from William Rosenblatt, an assistant
commissioner in the Customs Service enforcement office, explained
what happened next.
   Rosenblatt said Customs Service radar had lost a suspected
trafficker in flight, then picked up Viera's plane.
   ``It was incorrectly assumed that your aircraft was in fact the
suspect,'' Rosenblatt wrote.
   According to friends of Viera who witnessed the incident, a
Customs Service Blackhawk helicopter followed Viera's plane as it
touched down at the Kendall Glider Port, but stayed behind him.
Viera said it was impossible to see or hear the helicopter in that
position.
   ``When (Viera) was turning left to get out of the runway,
presumably the pilot of the helicopter thought Gus was trying to
run away,'' said Rene Betancourt. ``He made a maneuver with a blast
of the prop, and turned Gus's plane upside down.''
   Viera first thought his nose gear had collapsed, then he
realized the danger he was in.
   ``I'm upside down on my runway, fuel was pouring out and the
thing was about to blow,'' said Viera. Then he saw the helicopter
land beside him and several men rush toward his plane.
   ``I thought they were going to rescue me,'' he said. Instead, as
he pleaded with them to pull him out of the plane, someone smashed
in his window and hit him in the back of the head, he said.
   The next thing he knew he was lying face down with a foot on his
back. Two Bahamian agents who accompanied the Customs team were
pointing their M-16s at his head, said Viera.
   ``They never identified themselves as Customs agents, they never
read me my rights and they illegally searched my plane,'' said
Viera.
   He was held for about 45 minutes until computer checks
established the error.
   The Viera wrote to Customs and the DEA, but only began to
receive apologies when he finally wrote Bush's task force.
   A letter from Howard Gehring, director of the task force's
national narcotics border-interdiction system, said ``any
inconvenience that this incident has caused is unfortunate.''
   Rosenblatt also apologized in a letter.
   ``As a resident of Dade County, Fla., you are in a position to
view firsthand the drug-related violence that occurs almost on a
daily basis,'' said Rosenblatt, adding that the danger results in
actions which ``might seem excessive.''
   Viera said the company which insured his plane paid off quickly
and he has bought a new plane.
   Roger Garland, chief of the Customs air branch at Homestead,
said as far as he knew, the Viera incident was the first of its
kind.
   ``Normally, we wouldn't even do that to a bad guy,'' said
Garland.

   Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole
said Monday that the Reagan administration was sending mixed
signals about Panama's strong man Manuel Antonio Noriega, and he
suggested the United States ``may want to go back and take another
look'' at treaties turning over the Panama Canal to Panama.
   ``Say no to drugs. Say no to Noriega, and no, maybe, to giving
them the canal,'' Dole said at a news conference.
   Dole, the Senate's GOP leader, said that when he voted against
the Panama Canal treaties 10 years ago in the Senate ``we knew
about'' drug trafficking by members of the Panamanian military.
   He said that while the Reagan administration has accused Noriega
of dealing in drugs it has also been sending a different signal to
the Panamanian leader. ``It seems to me we have one signal saying
Noriega ought to stay, Noriega isn't such a bad guy,'' Dole said.
   Referring to the Panama Canal treaties, Dole said, ``We may want
to go back and take another look at that.''
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., appeared with Dole at a news
conference and offered his endorsement. ``The reason can be
described in two words _ effective leadership,'' Cochran said.
   Earlier, in Atlanta, Dole jabbed at George Bush and the other
Republican presidential contenders, declaring himself the tough
candidate for president and calling toughness ``a quality that some
may be lacking.''
   Trying to beat Bush in the big Southern presidential primaries,
which are one week away, Dole went before the predominantly
Democratic Georgia state House and Senate for separate addresses.
   Dole, the Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, proclaimed an
affinity with the Georgia Democrats through his rural Kansas
background, his start in rural politics and his legislative career.
By comparison, that underscored the point he has often made that
the vice president has had a more privileged background _ though he
didn't mention Bush by name.
   ``I got here just like you did. I got here the old fashioned way
_ I earned it,'' Dole said. ``Nobody gave it to me.''
   It was unmistakable who his target was as he stressed his
ability to work with Congress and said candidates shouldn't be
judged on ``who has the longest resume and most impressive
resume.'' Bush often notes the high-level government posts he has
held.
   ``There's one candidate and only one candidate with experience
in dealing with Congress and making tough decisions,'' Dole told
the Georgia Senate.
   ``I believe that I have a certain quality that some may be
lacking,'' he told the House. ``I am tough. I understand you have
to be tough to make tough choices.
   ``You have to be tough to deal with the legislature or to deal
with Congress or to deal with (Mikhail) Gorbachev or to deal with
(Daniel) Ortega,'' he said, referring to the Soviet and Nicaraguan
leaders.
   Dole strongly criticized Noriega, saying the United States
should impose a ``full-scale embargo'' on Panama if Noriega doesn't
give up power in 30 days. He said the United States should use
``whatever force is necessary'' to protect the Panama Canal and
other U.S. interests there.
   ``We don't need Noriega peddling drugs to our children,'' Dole
said. ``He's a bad influence and he has been a bad influence for 10
years.''
   Dole was making a series of campaign stops across the Southeast
on Monday as he campaigned toward the Southern primaries on Super
Tuesday, March 8. From Atlanta he flew to Jackson, and was going on
to Florida and to North Carolina.
   More than one-third of the GOP nominating delegates are at stake
in the contests on Tuesday, including races in most of the South.
   Bush leads Dole in most of the Super Tuesday states, according
to most polls. Dole aides said they were planning to begin airing
new television ads contrasting Dole and Bush's records in selected
Southern states.
   Dole repeated his call for a one-year budget freeze to reduce
the federal deficit, a proposal that he and Bush tangled over in
the Republicans' debate on Sunday. Dole said ``there is a
bipartisan majority for that kind of action.''
   He was accompanied to the Georgia Legislature by his wife
Elizabeth.

<TEXT>
   A former Navy pilot testified Monday
that he made six cocaine flights for reputed Colombian drug lord
Carlos Lehder Rivas in 1979.
   Lehder, 38, reputed to be one of the leaders of Colombia's
violent Medellin Cartel, is on trial on charges he and others
conspired to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States
from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas from 1978 to 1980.
   Leverett Francis, whose testimony opened the 14th week of the
trial, is described in the indictment against Lehder and
co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed as working with Ed Ward in flying
cocaine for Lehder.
   Francis, 66, said he began working for Ward, an admitted
marijuana smuggler, and then switched to flying cocaine, making
three trips from Norman's Cay in the Bahamas to Colombia and three
flights from the island to Astor Park, Fla.
   As a marijuana smuggler, Francis said, he was paid $30,000 a
flight. On his cocaine runs from Colombia to Norman's Cay, he
received $100,000 a flight, then $30,000 more to fly cocaine into
the United States, he said.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle questioned Francis about his
contacts with defense attorneys and asked if he had wanted to
testify against Lehder.
   ``Nobody does. It's distasteful,'' said Francis.
   Merkle asked Francis if he had concealed illegal drug earnings
from the government because he wanted to avoid paying taxes. The
witness replied he had.
   ``Did you say that if you didn't get a promise, you would take
contempt instead of testifying?'' asked Merkle.
   Francis replied that his cooperation in the Ed Ward case had
earned the government a lot of money and he felt that had
discharged his obligation.
   When asked why he became a smuggler, Francis replied, ``I was
kind of wondering the same thing. It was the thrill of doing
something, in addition to the money.''
   Francis was shown a photograph of a stack of money and replied
that it was $88,000 given to him by Ward.
   He had allowed federal agents to take a picture in 1980.
   ``I understood that Mr. Lehder was the gentleman for whom Mr.
Ward was flying,'' he said.
   When asked to identify Lehder in court, Francis said he had
developed vision problems over the past few months. He was allowed
to leave the witness stand to get closer to the defendant.
   He walked up to attorney Stephen Weinbaum, who represents Reed,
and said, ``Is that you, Joe?'' Joe is Lehder's nickname.
   He also said he couldn't recognize Reed.
   Reed, 57, is charged only with being part of the alleged
conspiracy.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.

<HEAD>Chairman Says He Expects Panel to Adopt His Recommendations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of President Reagan's AIDS
commission said Monday he expects the panel to adopt his interim
recommendations, including a $1 billion boost in federal spending
on the disease, without substantive change.
   Retired Adm. James D. Watkins outlined the commission's
activities in an appearance at the National Press Club a day before
the panel embarks on three days of hearings on some of the most
controversial aspects of dealing with the disease.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop is scheduled as the leadoff
witness at Tuesday's session, and Education Secretary William
Bennett will testify Thursday morning.
   The two have differed on the best ways to combat the spread of
the fatal disease, most notably in what emphasis to place on
recommending use of condoms to prevent its transmission sexually.
   Watkins, a former chief of naval operations, said he does not
believe Koop and Bennett, or their followers, are as far apart as
often perceived.
   ``My feeling is our job is to try to bring ... things
together,'' Watkins said during a question-and-answer session. ``I
don't see that we have such obstacles ... we can't reach consensus.
I wasn't so sure four months ago, but now I am.''
   Still, he said the commission is ``not going to shy away from
anything'' such as touchy legal issues regarding confidentially of
AIDS test results and discrimination protection for people with the
virus.
   ``I think it's going to be a donnybrook in there, but I think
something useful will come,'' he said.
   Watkins' remarks about the commission's willingness to adopt his
interim recommendations were limited to his call last week for
spending an additional $1 billion a year in federal funds to fight
the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug abusers and several other
suggestions on developing drugs to treat the disease and revamping
the system of caring for AIDS patients.
   The commission began considering those recommendations earlier
Monday _ with no hint of substantive differences _ and will meet
Thursday night to adopt the version that will go to the White House
the following week.
   The panel's final report, which Watkins said will address the
more controversial issues, is due June 24.
   Responding to a wide range of questions about AIDS in general,
Watkins said he agrees with those who do not foresee a dramatic
spread of the disease into the general population in the immediate
future.
   But he cautioned against complacency, particularly concerning
the possibility that the virus could be spreading undetected among
sexually active adolescents.
   ``We don't know what it is in adolescents,'' he said. ``There
may be lurking on the horizon a real problem that has yet to
unfold.''
   He also renewed his call for those physicians who do not
specialize in AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ to
become more familiar with it.
   ``The medical education horse has got to get in front of the
general education cart,'' he said.

<HEAD>Youth Will Have Bone Marrow Transplant, Despite Insurance Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dying boy who needs a bone marrow transplant
will go to Seattle for the treatment next week, even though a court
battle still is being waged over his father's health insurance
coverage, officials said Monday.
   Jim Lacina sued Nationwide Life Insurance Co. of Columbus,
contending the company mistakenly canceled his health insurance
policy without notifying him.
   Attorneys had rushed to bring the lawsuit to trial Monday
because doctors said Lacina's 11-year-old son, Jamie, needed a bone
marrow transplant by March 15 to survive more than a few months.
The boy has leukemia.
   But the trial was postponed until June 27, Visiting Cuyahoga
County Common Pleas Judge George G. McMonagle said, adding that
Lacina, of Geneva, had found a way to pay for the treatment at the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
   ``I understand Medicaid is taking care of the arrangements,''
the judge said.
   Officials of the Cuyahoga County Department of Health and Human
Services declined comment, saying Medicaid applications are
confidential.
   There was no answer at Lacina's home Monday in Geneva, and
Lacina's attorney, Gerald Jeppe, didn't return phone calls. But
Jeppe said last week that his client was applying for Medicaid.
   Edward E. Duncan, attorney for Nationwide Life, also declined to
comment.
   Lacina was an agent for Nationwide Life until five years ago,
when his job was terminated because of company cutbacks. Because of
his son's health, he paid to continue his health insurance after he
left the firm, attorneys for both sides agree.
   However, the policy lapsed in late 1983. Lacina said he never
got a copy of his policy, a notice that his premium was due or a
termination notice, Jeppe said in court last week.
   Lacina sued Nationwide Life on April 24, 1986. While the case
has been pending, his son has received chemotherapy treatments at
Rainbow Babies' and Children's Hospital in Cleveland. Court
documents show Lacina, who is unemployed, owes the hospital more
than $24,000.
   The lawsuit became more urgent when doctors advised Lacina to
take his son to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center by March
15 for a bone marrow transplant. The center requires patients to
have $100,000 or proof of insurance coverage before it will treat
them.
   Susan Edmonds, Hutchinson spokeswoman, said Jamie Lacina is
scheduled to arrive at the center on March 7. She said she hasn't
received word from the boy's father that he has made arrangements
to pay for the procedure.

   President Abdou Diouf declared a state of
emergency Monday and truncheon-wielding police battled rioting
gangs of young people after news reports said Diouf was winning
re-election easily.
   Opposition leaders denounced the early returns of Sunday's
voting, which had Diouf getting 77 percent of the vote, as violence
spread throughout the city.
   Police arrested the presidential candidate of the major
opposition party, Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democrafamily said Monday
night. The wife of Ousmane Ngom, a
party press secretary, satic
Party, his id 20 men had come to her home, searched
it and arrested her husband.
   Diouf declared a state of emergency in the area around the
capital ``in response to grave troubles this morning,'' according
to a broadcast on national radio, which said all public meetings
were now banned.
   A 2{-mile stretch of Boulevard General De Gaulle, one of the
city's main thoroughfares, was littered with fire-gutted vehicles,
spent tear gas canisters and shattered glass.
   Young rioters burned a stack of tires at one traffic circle,
windows were smashed in many houses and large granite stones that
had been pulled from a monument lay in the street after they had
been thrown at police.
   Merchants in the downtown Plateau districtains to senior citizens seated
at long tables.
   At the school, Robertson was met by students shouting ``Go Pat
Go!'' Some students held signs passed out by campaign staffers.
   When a student asked if Robertson would ever renew diplomatic
relations with Cuba, he replied: ``I don't think we should have
diplomatic relations with a butcher and a tyrant!''
   Robertson began his Florida tour in Jacksonville Monday and
arranged a rally in Miami Monday night, followed by breakfast
Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale and stops in Hollywood, Fort Myers,
Sarasota, Gainesville and Orlando.
   In Jacksonville, Robertson told about 500 supporters that
``along with Texas, Florida is one of the two most pivotal states.''
   He added:
   ``We've got one week to the most crucial election, I believe, in
the history of America, certainly this century and maybe since its
beginning.
   ``We're at a crossroads in America. We're either going to return
to the ways that made this nation great, or we're going to go down
the road.''
   Robertson mentioned a gun problem experienced this year in
several Florida schools.
   ``How can a child study when he's living in mortal fear of
somebody shooting him with a handgun in the halls of the school? We
owe our children an education in a crime-free, drug-free school
environment,'' said Robertson.
   ``If we want to see this country strong. There's only one way in
my estimation to do it. We will restore the greatness of America
through moral strength,'' he added.
   Robertson also said that ``we've got to go back to a time in our
educational system when once again we teach our kids moral values.
We've got to bring God back into the public schools of America.''
   On trade, he said: ``There isn't one country that is treating us
fairly. ... As president of the United States, I'm not going to
shut down American factories and put Americans out of jobs to
improve the standard of living in communist China and communist
Russia.''
   At a news conference following his address, Robertson called
Panama military strong man Manuel Antonio Noriega ``a bandit,'' but
added that ``I don't see us sending troops (to Panama). I don't
think it is necessary.''
   On South Africa, Robertson said, ``I am totally opposed to
apartheid ... but the thing I'm concerned about is turning South
Africa into a bloody battleground.''
   ``I don't want to see a Marxist state in South Africa,''
Robertson said.

   The flashing billboard broke down but at least two
wedding offers still stood Monday, a day that leap-year lore
supposedly gives women the right to propose marriage.
   Four women were scheduled to have their marriage proposals
flashed on an electronic board in London, but British Telecom's
giant ``message master'' suffered an electrical glitch, said
spokesman Peter Chandler.
   The couples, who stood on a street corner waiting for the
proposals, were whisked to a nearby hotel for a consolation lunch.
   Two couples walked away without announcing their intentions, but
the other two said they would tie the knot.
   Donna Walker, 20, turned to her boyfriend, Mark Beva, 22, and
said ``Everything's gone wrong, but anyway will you marry me?''
   A stunned Beva blurted yes.

   George Bush and Pat Robertson will skip next Sunday's debate in
Tennessee, putting that pre-Super Tuesday confrontation in
jeopardy, and Richard Gephardt has backed out of the Democratic
version the same day in rival Albert Gore Jr.'s home state, aides
said today.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' staff debated the debate,
with one aide saying he would not go and another saying the
decision on the League of Women Voters' forum in Nashville was
still under consideration.
   Word of candidates no-debate decisions tumbled out as the
presidential contenders themselves plunged into their final week of
campaigning before the biggest delegate day of the primary season.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis was celebrating another New England victory,
in Maine, saying he will ``surprise some people in the South'' next
week on Super Tuesday. Vice President Bush claimed victory in Maine
on the GOP side.
   The GOP presidential hopefuls split up today after criticizing
each other on taxes and trade in a debate Sunday in Atlanta.
   Robertson, in Jacksonville, Fla., told about 500 people today,
``I've got a feeling we're going to win in Florida and we're going
to win in the South. ... We've got one week to the most crucial
election, I believe, in the history of America, certainly this
century and maybe since its beginning.''
   Dukakis and Gephardt, the winners of the major Democratic
contests so far, skipped a Democratic debate in Houston on Sunday.
Gephardt aides said today that he wouldn't show up for a debate in
opponent Albert Gore Jr.'s home state.
   Gephardt, who had said last October he would participate in the
debate, sent word last week that he would not, noting that it was
to be in Gore's home state, said Janice Kaplan, a spokeswoman for
the League of Women Voters' presidential debates.
   Dukakis aides passed out conflicting word on his intentions.
Political director Paul Jensen said he would not attend the debate;
communications director Leslie Dach said ``no official decision had
been made'' on whether or not to attend the Sunday debate.
   League officials said Dukakis had told them last fall he would
participate and they have heard of no change in that stance.
   She said Robertson _ as well as Bush, who announced his plans
earlier _ would not take part in the GOP debate the same day. Bob
Dole has not formally agreed to attend, and the Republican debate
will be called off if he decides against debating, she said.
   It was a son of the South, Jesse Jackson, who pulled the
weekend's surprise, finishing a strong second to Dukakis in the
Maine Democratic caucuses on Sunday.
   With Super Tuesday looming barely a week away, Republican Jack
Kemp sought to pump up his fading campaign with direct attacks on
Bush and Senate GOP leader Dole, saying they will not be true to
Ronald Reagan's legacy.
   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported every
single tax increase over the last eight years,'' Kemp said in a
testy GOP debate Sunday in Atlanta. ``If they're nominated, the
Reagan revolution is over, gone, dead.''
   Harsh rhetoric did not dim the good news from Maine for Bush and
Dukakis.
   Bush's campaign claimed victory in the GOP caucuses on Sunday.
With no official count available, his campaign gave out figures
saying he more than doubled his rivals' totals in the city and town
meetings.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis won the Maine caucuses easily,
relying on a strong organization and his neighborly ties. He took
better than 40 percent of the delegates to the state convention and
at least 10 national convention delegates.
   ``Today's victory gives our national campaign another push
towards success on Super Tuesday,'' Dukakis said.
   Earlier, he told a crowd in Maryland _ where he hopes to do well
on March 8: ``You're an important Super Tuesday state. ... I think
we're going to surprise some people in the South.''
   Dukakis' win was expected. Jackson's strong second-place showing
was not.
   The black civil rights leader campaigned relatively little in
the state, but showed strength in many parts of the New England
countryside to win nearly a third of the vote. A block of
uncommitted delegates was in third place with the rest of the
Democratic field trailing.
   Both Dukakis and Bush hoped to put another victory in their
column on Tuesday, when the non-binding Vermont primaries are
scheduled.
   The Democratic candidates gather for another pre-March 8 debate
tonight in Williamsburg, Va., before the members of the Democratic
Leadership Council. It was DLC members who put together the idea of
a southern regional primary and then pushed state legislatures
across the region to move their primaries to the early March date.
   The Republicans' debate Sunday in Atlanta may be their last
full-scale confrontation before Super Tuesday.
   Bush, who is skipping the League of Women Voters' debate next
Sunday in Nashville, told his three rivals that intra-party sniping
is not useful.
   ``There's no point in Republicans going around criticizing each
other or certainly criticizing the president of the United States.
What we want to do is go after the people you had here yesterday,''
Bush said, referring to the Democratic candidates who debated in
the same hall on Saturday. ``That's easy. That's slow-motion, slow
targets to go for.''
   Kemp attacked hardest during the debate sponsored by the Atlanta
newspapers, accusing his opponents of sounding like Democratic
hopeful Gephardt on trade.
   ``Pat Robertson and Bob Dole sound like Dick Gephardt to me on
trade, and George Bush and Bob Dole say the budget deficit is
public enemy No. 1. I want to say I believe the Soviet Union is
public enemy No. 1,'' Kemp said.
   For his part, Dole attacked Bush for the Reagan administration's
decision to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``We never should trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issue
these reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ the
vice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and say
it's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said, holding
up a report on terrorism that was written by a commission headed by
Bush.
   Bush did not respond directly, but did say ``mistakes were
made'' in the Iran-Contra affair. He has maintained throughout the
affair that he did not know the arrangement was an arms-for-hostage
deal.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia said Monday it would
not bar Iranians from making a pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest
shrine and scene of violent rioting last year.
   ``There is no trend ... to bar any Moslem from performing the
pilgrimage rites,'' a government official was quoted by the Saudi
Press Agency as saying.
   Dates will be announced soon by the responsible authorities
regarding the commencement of entry formalities, said the official,
a representative the Ministry of Pilgrimage and Wakf, religious
endowments.
   The agency did not provide the official's name, but said he made
the statement in response to ``recent claims by some Iranian
responsible officials regarding a trend to bar Iranians from this
year's pilgrimage.''
   The Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina harbor Islam's most sacred
shrines, and Moslems from all over the world converge on the
kingdom for the annual pilgrimage, falling this year in the latter
part of July, according to the lunar calendar.
   Thousands of Iranian pilgrims staged a political demonstrations
last year and more than 400, most of them Iranians, were killed in
subsequent clashes with Saudi riot police.
   Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef has issued stern warnings
that no political activity would be allowed during pilgrimage.
   Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Hojatoleslam
Mohammed Khatami challenged the Saudi statements recently,
insisting that Iranian pilgrims were planning political rallies
again this year.
   Iran is Persian and Shiite, while the Sunni sect generally
dominates in Persian Gulf Arab nations. The deep division between
Shiites and Sunnis began with a split in Islam centuries ago.

<HEAD>Prices to Farmers Down 0.8 Percent in February</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products in
February declined an average of 0.8 percent from January but still
were 6.6 percent above those a year earlier, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said lower prices
for lettuce, tomatoes, cotton and milk contributed most to the
February decrease. Higher prices for cattle, hogs, corn and
soybeans helped soften the declines for the other commodities,
however.
   ``Most commercial vegetable prices dropped sharply from a month
earlier as supplies became plentiful,'' the report said. ``Warm
weather in the Southwest pushed vegetable crops to maturity.''
   But cattle and calf prices ``were the highest since May 1979''
and hog prices rose for the second month in a row, the report said.
Corn prices at the farm were the highest since July 1986, while
soybean were the highest in more than three years.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers set a
record in 1987 of about $57 billion. This year's net _ the
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the
range of $50 billion to $55 billion.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
   According to the preliminary February figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was down 4.3 percent
from January but averaged 11 percent more than a year ago.
   Commercial vegetable prices dropped 33 percent from January and
were down 2.2 percent from February 1987. Sweet-corn prices rose
from January, while all other vegetables declined. Lettuce prices
dropped to $11.90 per 100 pounds from $35.60 in January.
   Feed grains and hay, collectively, showed a 3.2 percent price
gain from January, averaging 23 percent more than a year earlier.
Corn, sorghum, oats and hay were up, while barley prices declined
from January levels. Cotton prices were down 6 percent from January
but averaged 22 percent more than a year earlier.
   The index for livestock and livestock products was up 2 percent
from January and 4.2 percent above Februrary 1987. Prices were
higher for beef cattle, calves and hogs, which more than offset
declines in milk, poultry and egg prices.
   Prices of beef cattle averaged $67.90 per hundredweight, up
$2.50 from January. Calf prices, at $93.10, were up $4.90 per
hundredweight. Market hog prices rose $3.60 from January to $47.50
in February but were still below a year earlier.
   February farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977
base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures,
down from a revised January reading of 131 percent. A year ago, the
February index was 122 percent.
   No new figures for farm production costs were included in the
report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of
budget cutbacks.
   In January, however, farm expenses were up 0.6 percent from last
fall but averaged 1.4 percent below a year earlier. The next
quarterly figures will be reported in April.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $67.90 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $65.40 in January and the $58.80 reported for
February 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as
beef.
   _Hogs averaged $46.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $43 in
January and $48.20 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $1.83 a bushel, was up from $1.77 in January and the
average of $1.42 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.83 per bushel, compared with $2.75 in January and $2.58
a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.85 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.70 in
January and $3.83 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $5.90 per bushel, compared with $5.73 in January
and $4.69 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 57.1 cents per pound, compared
with 60.6 in January and 46.4 cents in February 1987.
   _Eggs were 46.9 cents per dozen, compared with 49.3 cents in
January and 58.3 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.50 in January
and $12.90 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 25.7 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
27.1 cents in January and 30.1 cents a year ago.

   Edna Brown turned 25 on Monday,
according to Leap Year standards, but lots of relatives gathered to
help her celebrate her 100 years on the planet.
   But Mrs. Brown can't claim the distinction of being the only
person in her family born on Feb. 29, which comes around only once
every four years.
   Her great-great grandson, David Jacobs, 20, is celebrating the

Napier of Visalia, was having his 19th Leap Year birthday, although
he's really 76.
   Eula Jones, one of Mrs. Brown's 10 children, said her mother has
been resting up for her party. She just had a cast removed from an
arm that was broken around Christmas.
   ``Mother's real spunky, real sharp,'' Mrs. Jones said. ``We're

   A driver whose vehicle struck a bicyclist
has been sentenced to community service, most of which could be
waived with a bicycle ride on a narrow highway near Crested Butte.
   ``It might be a real eye-opener for you,'' Gunnison County Court
Judge Gerry Reese told Bruce Hartel at his sentencing last week.
``Riding a bicycle along the highway while three-ton vehicles hurl
by can only be appreciated by experiencing it.''
   Reese decided that if Hartel, 59, of Littleton, rides a bicycle
on a section of the highway between Crested Butte and Crested Butte
South within 90 days, 100 hours out of 124 hours of court-ordered
community service will be waived.
   Reese told Hartel he can walk part of the way if he gets tired,
as long as he has a bicycle with him. Colorado 135 is a two-lane,
narrow, winding mountain highway with no shoulders.
   In a plea bargain, Hartel pleaded no contest to careless driving
and driving too fast for conditions.
   The charges stemmed from a Sept. 22 collision with bicyclist
Eliane Wiscocq of Crested Butte. She was knocked off her bike and
suffered facial lacerations, a broken wrist and whiplash.
   Hartel apologized in court and presented his driving record,
which was clean.
   He was sentenced to 90 days of unsupervised probation and fined
$561, and said his insurance company has agreed to pay Wissocq's
lost wages, property damage and medical expenses up to $50,000.
   Hartel left court without commenting on the sentence.

   Two sisters' homes burned within a day
of each other, bringing to six the number of residences they have
lost to fire.
   Pat Rader and her family have lost four trailers, the most
recent on Wednesday.
   ``The first three burned on the same spot,'' she said. ``The one
that burned (Wednesday) was on the same property, but not on the
same place. ``I don't know if I'll ever live in another trailer,
but I won't go back there.''
   On Thursday, fire hit a frame home owned by her sister, Wanda
Pratt, and her family. Mrs. Pratt said the house may be salvageable.
   The house stands near the spot where the Pratts lost a mobile
home to fire about three years ago.
   ``My uncle was living with us then,'' Mrs. Pratt said. ``He was
85. The fire started in his room, but we never knew what started
it.''
   Mrs. Rader, her husband and three children are staying with her
parents in Kingfield for now.
   ``I'm going to try to get me a house,'' she said. ``My

   The streets were awash with dress blues and
angry tears Monday as 10,000 police officers attended last rites
for Edward Byrne, a 22-year-old policeman killed while protecting a
witness in a drug case.
   It was the largest police turnout for a fallen colleague in the
history of the New York City police, authorities said. They came
from Texas and Ohio, Maryland and Rhode Island, and they lined the
eight blocks approaching St. James Church.
   ``Eddie's murderers need to be pitied and also prayed for,'' the
Rev. Thomas DeVita said in his homily during Mass. ``They do not
know about the sanctity of life. They cannot really know or
understand what they have done, even though this is such a terrible
sin.''
   Byrne was slain early Friday as he guarded a witness who had
complained to police about crack dealers working in the South
Jamaica section of the borough of Queens. There have been no
arrests. Byrne, eight months on the force, was struck by three
shotgun blasts.
   Eight officers carried the coffin, draped in the green-and-white
flag of the department, into the church as a police bagpiper played
``When the Battle is Over.'' The family followed; his father, a
former city police lieutenant, carried a color photograph of his
son.
   ``Today we commit Eddie back to our God and Father, to God who
gave us Ed 22 years ago. ... If only it could have been longer,''
the priest said.
   He remembered Byrne as a smiling storyteller, an enthusiastic
friend, relative and police officer. Byrne turned 22 nine days ago.
   ``Maybe Eddie has done more in eight short months than other
people will do in a lifetime,'' DeVita said. ``He sacrificed his
life trying to protect the lives of others.''
   Six police helicopters followed overhead as the body was taken
to St. Charles Cemetery for interment.
   After the Mass, the Rev. Charles Norris of Bethesda Missionary
Baptism Church, located in the 103rd Precinct where Byrne served,
climbed to the altar to speak in support of police who are fighting
drugs _ ``this venom.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch also spoke from the altar after the
service. He said he felt the same sadness he felt upon the deaths
of Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``In a strange way, Edward Byrne's death has the same
importance,'' Koch said. ``If drug trafficking has become so bold
that they can engage in the assassination of a police officer, then
our whole society is at risk. ... That is why his death is so
important.''

   All four Republicans and at least one
Democrat appear to be passing up Sunday's presidential debates in
Nashville, a League of Women Voters spokeswoman said Monday.
   Republicans George Bush and Pat Robertson sent word they would
not participate, Nashville president Carole Bucy said. Jack Kemp
had never accepted the debate invitation, she said.
   The fourth epublican, Bob Dole, said he was willing to attend,
but only if Robertson and Bush participated. ``I'm not sure I want
to spend an hour with Jack Kemp,'' he said in Jackson, Miss.
   Democrat Richard Gephardt advised the League he would not attend
the Nashville debate.
   Aides to Michael Dukakis were sending out conflicting signals.
Political director Paul Jensen said he would not attend the debate;
communications director Leslie Dach said ``no official decision had
been made'' on whether or not to attend the Sunday debate.
   Gephardt and Dukakis skipped a Democratic debate in Houston on
Sunday, leaving the forum to Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee,
Jesse Jackson, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Gary Hart.

<HEAD>USDA Makes Progress on Jobs, Services for Blacks, But Still Has
Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a general rule, the Agriculture Department
is making progress but still lags in expanding jobs and services to
black Americans, a special review panel said Monday.
   In 1986, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng directed all
agencies in the department to carry out new guidelines to improve
USDA compliance with civil rights and equal opportunity standards.
   As part of the department's February observance of Black History
Month, five study groups looked at how USDA has performed since
then.
   ``Black employees continue a modest but upward movement in all
occupational categories,'' the report said. ``Some increases have
been realized both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of total
USDA employment. This is especially important because the increases
have occurred at a time when overall employment in USDA was
declining.''
   The USDA employs the equivalent of approximately 102,000 full
time employees, according to recent budget documents. The task
force report said blacks comprise 8.4 percent of the department's
employees, up from 8.1 percent in 1986. But that ``is low compared
with other federal agencies,'' it added.
   ``To continue to improve its equal opportunity posture, USDA
must realize larger increases in the number of blacks hired,
promoted and trained,'' the report said. ``And such increases mus
be realized at a faster pace. Additionally the department must
place emphasis on retention strategies once black employees are
recruited at hired.''
   The task force report said there are ``encouraging signs'' that
USDA agencies are beginning to address the complex problems of
black farmers and their declining numbers.
   ``Coordinated efforts between the Soil Conservation Service,
Farmers Home Administration and Extension Service are just
beginning to show limited success at eliminating the historical
factors militating against small and economically disadvantaged
farmers,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Sandinista-Contra Talks At An Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mediator of peace talks between
the government and the Contra rebels said the Sandinistas'
insistence on a limited agenda for the discussions is a step
backward.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the mediator, broke off the last
round of meetings in Guatemala on Feb. 19, saying the two sides
remained far apart on ways to end the 7-year-old war.
   Since then, the Roman Catholic prelate has charged the leftist
Sandinista government with failing to compromise and President
Daniel Ortega has criticized the ``abrupt'' end to the second set
of direct talks.
   Ortega, in a speech Sunday, reiterated that the discussions
should be limited to how to arrange a truce. The U.S.-backed
Contras and Obando y Bravo are seeking to discuss political reforms
as well as a cease-fire.
   Earlier Sunday, the cardinal said the government's position
represented ``a step backward'' for his plan. The cardinal declined
to say whether further talks would be held, saying, ``We'll have to
reflect on that.''
   Agreement on details of a cease-fire could deter Congress from
voting for non-lethal aid for the rebels.
   The Democrat-controlled House on Feb. 3 narrowly voted down
President Reagan's proposal for $36.2 million in funding, including
$3.6 million in military financing.
   In the recent talks, Obando y Bravo expanded his role by
offering his own peace plan. In addition to cease-fire proposals,
it calls for complete press freedom, renewed talks with internal
opposition parties, a revision of the military draft law and a
total amnesty, reforms long sought by the Contras.
   The Sandinistas agreed to discuss the sections of the cardinal's
proposal that had to do with a cease-fire, but they have refused to
enter into what they call a ``political dialogue'' with the rebels.
   In a peace plan signed Aug. 7, the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras committed themselves
to implementing cease-fires, amnesties and greater democracy and
called for an end to outside aid to insurgencies.
   Nicaragua has permitted the reopening of some newspapers and
radio stations it had closed. The government maintains that a full
amnesty will be granted when there is a cease-fire.
   Talks with the internal political opposition parties _ also
mandated by the peace plan _ broke down in December when the
government refused to discuss a new constitution.
   The Sandinistas accuse the cardinal, often harshly critical of
the government, of siding with the Contras.
   The cardinal called on those attending his Sunday Mass to pray
for peace. He estimates that 15 Nicaraguans die each day because of
the war.
   Nicaragua's internal problems have been increasing. Opposition
parties, taking advantage of new freedoms since the state of
emergency was lifted in January, have staged several demonstrations
against the Sandinistas.
   The Sandinistas have held their own marches to show their
strength and at times have quelled opposition demonstrations.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that ousted
pro-American dictator Anastasio Somoza.

<HEAD>Officials Say Loophole Allows Criminals To Get Gun Permits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only three applicants for concealed
weapon permits under Florida's new gun law have been turned down
because of previous crimes, but officials said Monday many
convictions don't show up because of loopholes.
   As of Thursday, 20,393 Floridians had received concealed weapons
permits under the law effective Oct. 1, state records show. A total
of 26,086 applications have been received, and of those only 20
have been denied, said Marilyn Thompson, chief of the Bureau of
Concealed Weapons.
   Thirteen were rejected because of documentation problems, four
for other reasons and three because of a criminal history, Ms.
Thompson said.
   Under certain circumstances, the state cannot deny permits to
admitted felons, people with a history of violent crimes and those
with drinking and psychological problems, said Ms. Thompson.
   Unless a judge formally hands down a guilty verdict, a defendant
who pleads guilty or no contest to either a felony or a misdemeanor
has not been formally convicted, she said. Such withholding of
adjudication, which does not create a criminal record, is usually
part of a plea bargain on first offenses or lesser offenses and
often is accompanied by probation.
   ``I can only deny a permit under the law if they have been
formally convicted of a felony by a judge,'' Ms. Thompson said.
   Unadjudicated cases are not entered into the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement computer system, which the bureau uses to check
criminal backgrounds.
   ``No adjudication means there is no guilt,'' Marion Hammer, a
lobbyist for Unified Sportsmen of Florida, a group backed by the
National Rifle Association. ``And if there is no guilt, you can't
take a person's rights away _ whether that's the right to vote or
the right to bear arms.
   Stewart Schurr of the FDLE said he doubted that unadjudicated
defendants receiving concealed weapon permits would lead to a
murder increase.
   ``The sort of people who do these crimes don't go get a permit
so that they can conceal the gun and sneak up on someone,'' he
said. ``In other words, I wouldn't be comfortable saying the law
has had any kind of effect.''
   But some people, including tourism officials, fear Florida could
develop a ``Wild West'' image.
   ``Here in Canada, anything to do with Florida makes front page _
especially bad news,'' said Ellis Webber, the Florida Tourism
Department's marketing director for Canada, which ships the
Sunshine State 1.5 million tourists yearly.
   Before lawmakers closed a legal loophole allowing open carrying
of firearms, ``We got telephone calls from people concerned about
going to Florida and seeing people strolling down the shopping mall
with guns on their hips,'' he said.

   President Reagan, who is of Irish ancestry,
paid tribute to the Irish Monday in a St. Patrick's Day message.
   Two and a half weeks ahead of time, Reagan took note of the
commemoration of St. Patrick's Day on March 17, saying ``I seek to
remind America and the world of the debt we owe to the Irish
people.''
   Through the ages, he said, the Irish people ``have created and
perpetuated a unique heritage of faith and freedom, of humor and
hope, of scholarship and sanctity and sacrifice.''
   ``With faith and fearlessness, St. Patrick brought Christianity
to Ireland a millennium and a half ago,'' Reagan's message said.
``The annals reveals the Irish people's eagerness to embrace the
faith and to keep it; that trait remains to this day, a tribute to
the Apostle of Ireland and to his flock in every generation.''
   ``May America and Ireland always cherish each other and the
kinship in which we hold St. Patrick's Day,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham faces charges detailed in
23 counts in his impeachment trial before the Arizona Senate.
   The Articles of Impeachment brought against him by the House are
the equivalent of an indictment in criminal court. The specifics
center on three alleged violations of law _ misuse of $80,000 in
state funds, concealment of a campaign loan and obstruction of
justice in trying to thwart investigation of an alleged death
threat.
   Briefly, these are the accusations:
   _ Misuse of state funds.
   In May 1987, a governor's protocol fund was created from funds
raised by the governor's inaugural ball. The funds had been
earmarked to pay off Mecham's campaign debts, but a state law
limiting campaign contributions precluded that use. Two months
after the protocol fund was established to promote interests of the
state, $80,000 from it was loaned to Mecham's automobile agency.
The loan has been repaid, but prosecutors contend Mecham, with his
son, Dennis, tried to conceal an illegal loan of state funds.
   Mecham says the protocol fund was private, not state money, and
that he broke no law by loaning it to his dealership.
   _ Concealment of a $350,000 campaign loan.
   In October 1986, Tempe developer Barry Wolfson loaned $350,000
to the Mecham for Governor campaign. The loan, which has been
repaid, was not reported properly on required disclosure statements.
   Mecham says he didn't try to conceal the loan but contends his
brother, Willard, who was his campaign treasurer, tried to save
time by lumping it in with other funds on the financial statements
without including Wolfson's name.
   _ Obstruction of justice by thwarting investigation of a death
threat.
   On Nov. 12, 1987, Lee Watkins, an assistant director of the
Department of Administation, allegedly threatened to harm Donna
Carlson, the governor's former legislative liaison who then was
expected to testify in a grand jury investigation of Mecham's
reporting of the $350,000 campaign loan.
   Watkins is alleged to have said if Ms. Carlson did not keep her
mouth shut, she would ``take a long boat ride'' from which she
wouldn't return. Ralph Milstead, director of the Department of
Public Safety, says Mecham ordered him not to cooperate with the
Arizona attorney general's office in its investigation of the death
threat allegation.
   Mecham says he had already checked out the alleged death threat
and considered it ``a lot of hot air.''

<TEXT>
   The New York Board of Elections ruled Monday
that former Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo., failed to qualify for the
state's April 19 Democratic presidential primary ballot.
   Petitions meant to put Hart on the ballot contained only 6,864
signatures, more than 3,000 under the required number, said board
spokesman Steven LaFever.
   To get on the ballot, Democratic candidates must file petitions
bearing signatures of at least 10,000 registered Democrats and at
least 100 of those must come from each of 17 of the state's 34
congressional districts.
   ``He has 14 days to go into court with an appeal,'' LaFever
said. ``But it's really difficult (to win in court) if you don't
even have the 10,000'' signatures, he added.
   Among other Democratic candidates, Jesse Jackson has collected
more than 64,000 signatures, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis got
42,615, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri collected 22,477, Sen.
Paul Simon of Illinois had 22,076, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee had 21,759.
   A group of Democratic county clerks filed petitions containing
more than 18,000 signatures to get a spot on the ballot for
``uncommitted.'' Most of those clerks want New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo to run.
   While Cuomo has said he is not a presidential candidate, he has
refused to rul out accepting a draft for the nomination if there is
a deadlocked national convention when the Democrats meet in Atlanta
in July.
   Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche filed petitions containing
23,061 signatures. Those petitions may be challenged by mainstream
Democrats.

<HEAD>Attorney Says Georgia Law Violates Free-Speech Guarantee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia's law banning exit polls within 250 feet
of voting places violates the Constitution's free-speech guarantee,
an attorney representing three major television networks argued in
court Monday.
   The 1985 law does not define exit poll and therefore ``allows
certain types of speech but not others,'' said Floyd Abrams.
   Reporters ``can ask questions and take notes as long as they
don't do it in a systematic way,'' Abrams told U.S. District Judge
Robert Hall in a hearing on a lawsuit filed by ABC, NBC and CBS
against Georgia and Fulton County election officials.
   But Patrick McKee, an assistant attorney general representing
state elections officials, said poll workers have interpreted the
law as disallowing anyone from questioning voters about their vote
within 250 feet of the polling place.
   Former state Rep. Claude Bray, D-Manchester, who headed the
House State Governmental Affairs Committee when it considered the
exit poll bill, said election officials mostly in metropolitan
Atlanta complained that voters were being intimidated by exit poll
takers.
   ``This was a bill to help the voters keep their privacy so they
could vote and leave without being harassed,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iraq Unleashes Stunning Missile Attacks On Tehran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq said it retaliated for pre-dawn
missile attacks on Baghdad by firing long-range rockets into the
heart of Tehran Monday. Iran reported 16 people killed in the
bombing of a hospital.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said its
gunners fired five surface-to-surface missiles into Tehran after
two similar projectiles had exploded in Baghdad, killing and
wounding ``many civilians.''
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA, also monitored in
Nicosia, said in urgent dispatches that ``two loud explosions''
were heard after nightfall in Tehran and ``there may have been
casualties and damage.''
   It said the blasts, 10 minutes apart, were ``from fresh Iraqi
attacks'' but gave no other details.
   Earlier, IRNA said Tehran was bombed twice in Iraqi air raids
but made no mention of missile attacks on the city.
   It said in one of the raids, 16 people were killed and ``dozens
wounded, including newborn babies,'' at a Tehran hospital.
   IRNA did not identify the hospital but said several people were
buried under the debris. Tehran Radio urged Iranians to take refuge
in bomb shelters.
   The later communique carried by IRNA indicated there was
confusion over the Iraqi attacks, possibly because Iraq had not
previously used surface-to-surface missiles against Tehran in the
war that began in September 1980. Instead it had relied on its
warplanes to strike deep inside Iranian territory.
   ``The Iraqi rockets will reduce the Iranian capital to rubble,''
the Iraqi News Agency said, quoting an unidentified military
spokesman. ``The Iraqi rockets will fall on Tehran all night until
the city is demolished on the heads of its rulers.''
   It said three missiles were fired at 5:45 p.m., 5:55 p.m. and
6:08 p.m., followed by two more at 11:10 p.m. and 11:20 p.m.
   Iraq was not known to have any surface-to-surface missiles
capable of reaching the Iranian capital about 200 miles east of the
Iraqi border.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as saying the
missiles fired Monday ``had been designed by Iraqi minds and put
together by Iraqi hands as a gift to the leader of Iraq (President
Saddam Hussein) and the people of Iraq.''
   Iraq's attacks began about 12 hours after Iranian missiles hit
Baghdad.
   IRNA quoted a Revolutionary Guards communique as saying the
Iranian missiles were aimed at the headquarters of Iraq's state-run
television and radio network and two military targets in Baghdad.
   State-run Baghdad radio said two missiles exploded in the city
of 5 million people. It reported a military communique said: ``Many
Iraqis were killed, among them women, children and old people. Many
more were wounded and many houses were destroyed.'' No casualty
figures were given.
   The Iraqi News Agency also reported that Iranian artillery
shelled residential areas in the southern port of Basra, the border
town of Khanaqin and Sirwan in northeast Iraq throughout the night.
It made no mention of casualties.
   It was the third day of attacks on population and industrial
centers. The attacks began Saturday when Iraqi warplanes bombed
Tehran for the first time since January 1987.
   On Sunday, Iran said its forces fired three surface-to-surface
missiles in 40 minutes in retaliation for the Iraqi air raids on
``non-military areas.'' It said 28 civilians were killed and scores
were wounded in the Iraqi raids.
   The exchange of attacks and reported use by Iraq of long-range
missiles heightened fears that the Persian Gulf foes are locked in
a fresh round of the ``war of the cities.''
   Iran has fired 37 missiles into Baghdad since that phase of the
war began in March 1985, but had not targeted Baghdad since Nov. 8.
   Meanwhile, President Ali Khamenei of Iran warned the U.N.
Security Council not to approve any resolution imposing an arms
embargo on Iran for failing to agree to cease-fire calls.
   IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying such a move would mean ``the end
of all political solutions to the war, imposed by Iraq.''
   The United States and its allies have been lobbying for an arms
embargo against Iran because of its refusal to agree to Security
Council Resolution 598 adopted in July. Iraq has said it would
agree to the resolution, which calls for a cease-fire, if Iran did.
   Khamenei said again that Iran would not accept any settlement
until Iraq has been condmned as the aggressor and punished by the
international community, according to IRNA.

<HEAD>EPA Reluctant To Expand Program While Removal Effort Focuses On
Schools</HEAD>

   About one non-school building in seven
contains potentially dangerous asbestos that's been damaged and one
in 11 has significant damage, the Environmental Protection Agency
told Congress on Monday.
   However, Administrator Lee M. Thomas said it might do more harm
than good to begin a major regulatory program affecting such
buildings while EPA, states and communities are trying to deal with
asbestos in schools.
   The asbestos in question is ``friable'' _ it can be crumbled by
slight pressure, such as a hand squeeze, and release fibers to the
air. Though asbestos has not been permitted in new buildings since
1978, it was used in millions of structures from the 1920s on.
   The fibers, if breathed, can cause lung cancer and other
illness. The cancer may not show up for 40 years, and the danger
increases the earlier the exposure _ which is why school children
are such a concern.
   Thomas did call for increased grants to states to improve
enforcement of existing regulations and funds to advise building
owners, to increase the supply of inspectors and to develop
guidance for dealing with pipe and boiler insulation. His estimates
totalled $6.6 million a year for the next three years.
   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., whose pressure has helped win passage
of existing asbestos-in-schools programs, said in a statement,
``Everything in this report points toward aggressive federal
intervention except EPA's recommendations, which amount to nothing
more than sweeping this alarming problem under the rug.''
   Congress required the report on the status of asbestos in
non-school buildings in 1986. In partial response, EPA subjected a
1984 building survey to more detailed analysis, reporting for the
first time the condition of asbestos it found.
   The agency had reported that about 20 percent of the buildings
contained friable asbestos. About 35 percent of schools, however,
already were known to have such asbestos, and Congress has required
tighter school regulations.
   By October 1988, all schools must adopt asbestos management
plans to take effect in July 1989. ``The successulf implementation
of this school program should remain our first concern, and we all
have much to learn from it,'' wrote Thomas. ``I fear a major
initiative in other buildings could do more harm that good.''
   John A. Moore, assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic
substances, ``We've got finite resources ... a finite number of
people who are experts.''
   The report said carrying out the school regulations will cost
about $3 billion and a similar program for other buildings could
cost $51 billion.
   EPA's 1984 survey did not cover elementary and secondary
schools, state and local government buildings or apartment
buildings of fewer than 10 units, leaving 3.6 million buildings to
be sampled. An estimated 14 percent of the buildings, 501,000,
contained damaged friable asbestos, and 9 percent, or 317,000,
contained significantly damaged friable asbestos.
   Since only 231 buildings were tested, the range of uncertainty
in the results was wide. EPA said there was a 95 percent chance the
figure reported as 20 percent was somewhere between 14 percent and
27 percent; the 14 percent damage figure was between 6 percent and
22 percent and the 9 percent significant damage could be anywhere
from zero percent to 19 percent.
   This and other statistical points were criticized by the Safe
Buildings Alliance, a trade association of former asbestos product
manufacturers, which said, for example, that EPA's surveyors
disagreed with each other 95 percent of the time on the condition
of the asbestos they were looking at.
   Moore, however, said the agency's methods had been approved by
outside experts.
   Bill Borwegen, health and safety director of the Service
Employees International Union, said, ``The gut level issue here is
the right to know. It's federal policy that workers have the right
to know what dangerous chemicals they're dealing with. ... We want
to inform building occupants if there's a hazard.''

<HEAD>Former Emperor's Death Sentence Commuted To Life in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jean-Bedel Bokassa, a
village chief's son who made himself president for life and then
emperor, was spared the death penalty Monday for murders committed
during his 14-year reign.
   President Andre Kolingba commuted Bokassa's sentence in an order
announced on the national radio.
   Bokassa was convicted June 12, 1987, of ordering the murders of
at least 20 political opponents. He also was convicted of diverting
huge sums from the state treasury.
   The former leader, who had changed the name of his country to
the Central African Empire and proclaimed himself Bokassa I,
unsuccessfully appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court.
   ``During the course of this trial I discovered crimes of which I
know nothing,'' he said. ``I assume the moral responsibility. I
affirm my innocence of the facts against me. I was motivated only
by the desire to serve my country. Today, I only want to live in
peace as a simple citizen.''
   Western governments and some African leaders had asked Gen.
Kolingba to spare Bokassa. Kolingba previously commuted other death
sentences imposed in this former French colony, and is said to
oppose capital punishment.
   Bokassa went into exile after he was overthrown in September
1979 in a French-backed coup after the deaths in custody of 100
schoolchildren who protested a government order to wear expensive
uniforms produced at a factory run by the emperor's wife. Bokassa
was alleged to have personally beaten 17 of them to death.
   A court in this nation of 3 million people, which he had ruled
since 1966, convicted him in absentia and sentenced him to death in
1980.
   In late 1986, he returned from France unexpectedly ``to be
judged'' by his countrymen. He was tried for offenses ranging from
corruption to murder and cannibalism.
   During the six-month trial, prosecutor Gabriel Mbodou said:
``There were no extenuating circumstances whatever in the odious
acts committed by the accused, his atrocities and his greed which
plunged the entire country into a nightmare throughout the 14 years
of his bloody reign.''
   The French legal system used in the Central African Republic
obliged the government to try Bokassa again.
   Officials and Western diplomats said privately last year that
Kolingba probably would commute a death sentence for fear execution
would stir unrest among Bokassa's minority M'baka tribe in the
southwest corner of the landlocked nation.
   Bokassa, 67, was educated in Roman Catholic mission schools. He
joined the French army, won a dozen combat medals in Indochina and
achieved the rank of captain.
   When the country became independent in 1960, President David
Dacko asked Bokassa to form an army. He led a coup against Dacko in
December 1965.
   After Bokassa proclaimed himself emperor, he was crowned in a
1977 ceremony that cost more than $200 million, one-quarter of the
nation's annual revenue.

<HEAD>Reagan Hopes for Safe Olympics in Seoul, Praises President Roh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says he hopes the Summer
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, will be incident-free and that he
has confidence in newly inaugurated President Roh Tae Woo.
   In responses to questions submitted by the South Korean
newspaper, Dong-A Ilbo, Reagan said a smoothly run Olympics
competition in September ``is in everyone's interests.''
   ``The prospect of North Korea, or anyone else's, attempts to
disrupt the games through violence is a danger that we and the
Soviets can agree to work against.''
   ``The key problem in Korea is North Korea's proclivity to use
violence,'' Reagan said, noting the bombing last November of a
South Korean airliner off the coast of Burma. ``The world was
shocked again by the recent murder of 115 innocent people aboard
KAL-858 by North Korea.''
   ``We hope that Moscow will use its close relations with
Pyongyang to urge moderation and to encourage the resumption of
direct North-South contacts on practical ways to reduce tension,''
the president said. ``It is time for the North to eschew violence
and get down to the serious business of resuming dialogue with
Seoul.''
   Reagan, in response to a question about whether he will meet
soon with Roh, replied that ``talk now of the details of summits
and such seems a bit premature.''
   ``As you know, I met President-elect Roh in Washington last
year,'' he said. ``He impressed me as a man committed to the
democratization of your country because he knew that was what
Koreans, including himself, wanted.''
   North Korea has been demanding to be a co-host of the Olympics,
but the International Olympic Committee and South Korea have
rejected the demand.
   A woman who claimed she was a North Korean agent, Kim Hyon Hui,
made a televised confession in Seoul last month in which she said
she destroyed the KAL flight to disrupt the Olympics.
   North Korea has denied it had anything to do with the bombing.

<HEAD>Boat With About 40 Dominicans Sinks; Survivor Says Most Got to
Shore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK GAUD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AGUADA, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small boat said to be carrying
about 40 illegal aliens from the Dominican Republic sank in rough
seas just off the west coast, but a survivor said Monday he
believed most made it to shore.
   One person was in custody, another hospitalized, two bodies were
recovered and a third was spotted but washed away before it could
be retrieved, said Luis Garcia, an agent of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
   Garcia spoke in a telephone interview from Aguadilla, about five
miles from Aguada.
   Hundreds of Dominicans leave in wooden boats each year on the
dangerous, 90-mile journey to Puerto Rico in search of a better
life. Estimates by U.S. officials of the number of Dominicans
living illegally in Puerto Rico range from 40,000 to 160,000.
   The bodies were of two girls, one 14 and the other 16, police in
Aguada said. The boat, estimated at 20-30 feet long, sank Sunday
evening off Aguada, about 85 miles west of San Juan.
   Garcia said Miguel Bigay, a survivor who was with him during the
interview, reported seeing most of the passengers scramble ashore
and flee.
   ``He said most were able to get to shore with him,'' Garcia
said. ``The people who got to shore ran off and hid in the brush.''
   Bigay, who gave his age as about 30 and said he was a part-time
truck driver, said the boat left a beach Saturday night in the
southeastern Dominican province of Higuey with 40-45 passengers,
including eight women.
   It crossed the 90-mile Mona Passage between the Dominican
Republic and Puerto Rico in good weather, but then the see became
rough and a big wave overturned the boat about one-eighth of a mile
from Aguada, Bigay said.
   Garcia quoted him as saying: ``People were screaming and calling
for help.''
   Bigay said he managed to swim ashore but ``thought he was going
to drown because the waves pushed him down every time they passed
over him,'' Garcia said.
   Those in the boat were from different towns and did not appear
to know each other, Bigay said. Police caught him on shore and
Garcia said he would be returned to the Dominican Republic.
   Officials continued searching, but Garcia said he doubted more
survivors would be found because they ``managed to get somewhere
else ... and escaped detention.''
   Pieces of boards believed to be from the boat were on the beach,
along with articles of clothing and a plastic bag labeled
``Dominican Republic.''
   At least 16 Dominicans drowned in December 1986 off Rincon, a
few miles away, when their boat capsized near shore. Last October,
50 or more Dominicans are believed to have died when their boat
sank about three miles off the northeast coast of the Dominican
Republic.

<HEAD>Gore Campaign To Borrow $1 Million To Finance Super Tuesday Blitz</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s presidential campaign
on Monday took out a loan to pay for media saturation going into
next week's Super Tuesday primaries, a campaign spokesman said.
   ``We have borrowed some money,'' said press spokesman Mike Kopp.
But he declined to say how much, saying that was confidential
campaign strategy information.
   ``We're gong to saturate Super Tuesday ... We want to pour it
on,'' before the March 8 series of 20 primaries and caucuses on
which Gore has staked his Democratic campaign, Kopp said.
   He insisted, however that the campaign is not in financial
trouble and only borrowed the money as ``icing on the cake'' for
the extensive media buy the Tennessee senator already has in place.
   In Tennessee, his state campaign treasurer Johnny Hayes said
Monday that Gore has taken a $1 million line of credit against
which money will be borrowed for a TV blitz in 20 states.
   He said part of the credit line was established with Tennessee
banks.
   Kopp reiterated Gore's pledge to spend more money on the Super
Tuesday contests than any other candidate.
   Gore's public financial statement through Jan. 31 showed that he
had just over $2 million in the bank at that point, considerably
less than the $4 million that money leader Michael Dukakis had on
hand. Kopp said Gore has raised about $1.2 million in February.
   The campaign has declined to give any specifics on its spending,
saying it does not want to tip off its rivals.
   Kopp said new commercials will go on the air Tuesday, following
on the biographical spots that have been running on cable TV
nationwide and on local markets in 14 southern and border states
for the past three weeks.
   The ads are produced both by the Campaign Group, Gore's initial
media consultants, and by Raymond Strother, a media consultant
hired last week.
   Kopp said the new ads will be message-oriented, touting Gore's
record. He said they do not include attacks on other candidates.
   Strother traveled with Gore last Tuesday, and the candidate has
been giving a new emphasis in recent days to his congressional
record being one of championing ``the average working man and
woman.''
   Kopp would not rule out the possibility of such ads, which was
essentially the same stance he took last week when asked to comment
on the $1 million loan.
   Television advertising is seen as a major factor to reach the
voters across the vast Super Tuesday spread of states.
   Dukakis, the Massachussetts governor, was advertising on prime
time television during the Olympics in Miami last week. It was also
a biographical commercial.
   Dukakis aides said commercials were also running in Texas and
Maryland.
   Aides for U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri said his
commercial promising trade retaliation to open up foreign markets
was going on the air in the South over the weekend.

<HEAD>Lay Workers Donate Part of Salaries to Pope in Labor Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Vatican lay employees pledged to
donate part of their day's salary Monday to Pope John Paul II in a
labor protest which a Vatican official denounced as ``completely
unacceptable.''
   Mario Cerullo, president of the Association of Lay Vatican
Workers, said preliminary counts showed more than 90 percent of the
1,800 lay employees took part. The employees work at Vatican
museums, the post office, main library, the daily newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano, Vatican Radio and many offices.
   Workers performed their jobs as usual but signed a special form
promising to donate their first three hours' pay to the pope to
help feed the poor, Cerullo said. He estimated donations would
total about $40,000.
   The labor action _ called by the association an ``active
strike'' _ was called to protest plans to change the Vatican
workers' pay schedule and to demand creation of a special office to
resolve labor disputes in the world's smallest city-state.
   ``The Vatican employees want dignity and respect,'' Cerullo said
in an interview. ``We hate to bother the Holy Father but we had to
do something to show our unhappiness. I hope this is the first and
last time.''
   Archbishop Jan Schotte, a Belgian who handles labor relations
for the Vatican, said in letters to Cerullo and Vatican-based
cardinals that the protest was unjustified, extreme and
``completely unacceptable.''
   He said salary and work conditions were ``superior to those
existing in comparable work places'' and that negotiations could
lead shortly to creation of a special labor office.
   Cerullo said Vatican employees' salaries range from $927 a month
to $1,370. The workers are exempt from Italian taxes, work a
36-hour week and have one month of vacation and 26 paid holidays.
   The strike was triggered by the Vatican's recent decision to pay
workers at the end of each month instead of at the beginning.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in other countries are becoming less
willing to lend money to the United States, the head of the
International Monetary Fund said Monday.
   The congressional Joint Economic Committee has predicted that
U.S. debt would reach about $400 billion at the end of last year.
It is growing at about $150 billion annually.
   ``I have looked at a very long historical set of figures,'' said
Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director. ``And I have to
tell you that there are no precedents. Each time similar imbalances
have been... reduced, it was through recession ...
   ``Our latest projections suggest that, on present policies and
exchange rates, the imbalances would still continue to be very
large over the medium term,'' he told a conference sponsored by the
Overseas Development Council, a private study group concerned with
problems of the Third World.
   For some time, the growth of U.S. debt has not been matched by
the willingness of business people in other countries to lend more,
he said.
   ``The risks that this portends for renewed disturbances in
financial markets, for increased protectionist pressures, and for a
weakening in global economic activity need no elaboration here,''
said Camdessus, who is French.
   He said the job of the fund is to help all 152 member countries
in setting strategy that will make them grow.
   He suggested that for a long time U.S. output must grow faster
than spending and that countries with surpluses have to do the
reverse. The process, Camdessus said, should take place without
either a slow-down in business or increased inflation.
   He did not name the surplus countries, but Japan and West
Germany are the major nations which in recent years have been
selling more goods than they buy. Surpluses have also been mounting
in Taiwan, South Korea and other newly industrializing areas.
   Camdessus went on to say that nothing can be done without
reducing the U.S. budget deficit.
   ``No reasonable policy instrument that can contribute to this
end should be ignored,'' he said.
   The U.S. Treasury must borrow to meet the deficit, and much of
the money it borrows comes from abroad. For the year ending last
Sept. 30, the deficit was about $149 billion.
   Camdessus called for new proposals that would help cut the debt
of Third World countries.
   ``Any ... proposal that would be market-based and would share in
a mutually agreed fashion between debtors and creditors the
discount on debt and the benefits of adjustment ... could only be
welcome,'' he said.

<NOTE>For Release at 8 p.m. EST</NOTE>

   Also addressing the conference was American Express Chairman
James D. Robinson III, who suggested creation of a new
international financial organization to help ease the debt crisis
of developing nations by buying their loans.
   Robinson said the organization, which he named ``The Institute
of International Debt and Development,'' would buy outstanding
Third World loans at a discount.
   One possibility, he suggested, would be for the loans to be
acquired at about 60 percent of face value.
   The organization would then offer the banks which had held the
loans ``new, long-term, high-quality obligations,'' including bonds
and certain forms of stock, Robinson said.

<TEXT>
   Panama's ambassador the United States,
proclaiming his loyalty to President Eric Arturo Delvalle, refused
to relinquish the embassy on Monday to an envoy designated by the
military controlled government to replace him.
   The second-ranking Panamanian official at the country's United
Nations mission, Leonardo Kam, showed up at the embassy to assume
his duties, but Ambassador Juan B. Sosa refused to turn the mission
over to him.
   Kam was appointed last Friday by the new government that was
formed after Delvalle was ousted by the National Assembly, which is
dominated by supporters of military strong man Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   After what Kam described as a ``frank'' discussion Monday, he
departed the embassy. Since Friday, Sosa has maintained that the
vote to oust Delvalle was unconstitutional and he has refused to
step down.
   Delvalle's dismissal was touched off by his bid Thursday to fire
Noriega, who ignored the order and then rallied his followers in
the Assembly to replace Delvalle with the former education
minister, Manuel Solis Palma.
   Before his encounter with Kam, Sosa was asked by a reporter
about the position of other embassy diplomats. ``The Panamanian
Embassy is loyal to its ambassador and the ambassador is loyal to
President Delvalle,'' he said.
   Reagan administration officials, meanwhile, said Delvalle's
attempt to reinstate himself as president has been strengthened by
going into hiding and refusing to flee the country. He has been at
an undisclosed location in Panama since the weekend.
   Delvalle is viewed in Washington as a more effective symbol for
opposition forces by being inside Panama than he would if he had
left the country.
   The administration has been pursuing other means to restore
Delvalle to office and to end Noriega's five-year domination of the
country's political life. A number of economic sanctions, including
a trade embargo, are under consideration, and high-level meetings
on that subject were held Monday.
   A U.S. official said Monday that President Reagan planned no new
economic sanctions against Panama, even though he has determined
that Panama has not been cooperating in curbing drug trafficking to
the United States.
   The official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
penalties to be announced Tuesday already have been applied against
Panama and thus will have no material impact on that country.
   Under a 1986 law, countries which do not take steps to halt drug
trafficking to the United States are no longer eligible for U.S.
aid and are not entitled to U.S. support for their assistance
requests to international lending institutions.
   Noriega was indicted by two U.S. grand juries on Feb. 5 on
charges that he is a major figure in an international drug
smuggling conspiracy.
   Over the weekend, Noriega won a credentials skirmish at the
Organization of American States when his OAS Ambassador, Ricardo
Leyton, was permitted to occupy Panama's seat for a meeting on the
Panamanian crisis.
   The United States had supported the seating of Lawrence Chewing
Fabrega, a Panamanian diplomat who broke with Noriega two weeks ago.
   Although the OAS refused to take a stand on the Panamanian
situation, a number of Latin American governments have backed
Delvalle. They include El Salvador, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay,
the Dominican Republic, Bolivia and Ecuador.
   Some officials have been anxious about the safety of the 10,000
U.S. military personnel in Panama and the thousands of other
Americans there in civilian capacities but Noriega has said all
Americans in Panama will be safe.
   Meanwhile, Panamanian opposition leaders in Washington have been
stepping up their activities against Noriega. They have been
telephoning Panamanian diplomatic missions around the world asking
them to withhold the fees they receive for consular services and
other activities instead of sending the money back to Panama for
use by the new government.
   Embassy officials said that on Tuesday they would reveal ``legal
steps that have been taken against the dictatorship of Noriega.''

   Nancy Reagan said Monday that casual users of
drugs are an ``accomplice to murder'' because they help finance
traffickers willing to commit brutal crimes to keep supply lines
open.
   Kicking off a White House Conference for a Drug-Free America at
which the federal government's anti-drug efforts were criticized,
Mrs. Reagan dramatized her ``just-say-no'' campaign with a speech
focusing on those whose lives have been ruined by drugs.
   With President Reagan serving in the unusual role of warm-up
speaker, the first couple talked about the drug problem from both
the supply and demand vantage points.
   ``With all the headlines about how we're losing the drug war,
let's keep in mind the progress we've made,'' the president told
conference participants at a local hotel. He ticked off statistics
he said show the United States is making headway, saying ``drug
seizures are at an all-time high.''
   ``But as significant as stopping smugglers and pushers is,
ending the demand for drugs is how, in the end, we'll win,'' the
president said.
   Mrs. Reagan picked up the subject there, saying that while
progress has been made, ``many ignorant ideas persist. And one of
the worst is the casual user's justification that drug use is a
victimless crime, that drugs don't hurt anyone except the person
who's using them.''
   She called attention to several people in the audience who lost
loved ones because of drug abuse and cited the murder of Colombia's
chief prosecutor, Attorney General Carlos Hoyos, who was abducted
by a half-dozen gunmen whom the government accused of working for
local cocaine barons.
   Hoyos' bullet-riddled body was was found blindfolded and
handcuffed.
   The government blamed his abduction and death on the Medillin
cartel, which U.S. officials say controls 80 percent of cocaine
entering the United States.
   ``The people who casually use cocaine are responsible,'' Mrs.
Reagan said, ``because their money bought those bullets. They
provided the high stakes that murdered those men, plus hundreds of
others in Colombia.''
   She dismissed ``the notion that the mellow marijuana user
doesn't hurt anyone,'' pointing to the murder of American drug
agent Enrique Camarena Salazar in the aftermath of the eradication
of a 10,000-acre plantation in Mexico.
   ``The casual user may think when he takes a line of cocaine or
smokes a joint in the privacy of his nice condo, listening to his
expensive stereo, that he's somehow not bothering anyone,'' she
said. ``But there is a trail of death and destruction that leads
directly to his door.''
   ``The casual drug user cannot morally escape responsibility for
the action of drug traffickers and dealings,'' she said. ``I'm
saying that if you're a casual drug user, you're an accomplice to
murder.''
   While the Reagans helped kick off the drug conference, the
administration came in for some criticism on its anti-drug abuse
efforts, with Marion Barry, the mayor of the District of Columbia,
complaining that not enough was being done.
   Barry, facing a record murder rate in nation's capital fueled by
warring drug dealers, said the problem in cities has reached
``catastrophic dimensions.''
   ``We're beginning to lose the war on drug and alcohol abuse,''
Barry said in his welcoming remarks, telling the conference his was
the ``view from the cities. The United States government has not
done enough to stop drugs from coming into this country.''
   ``We must say to Colombia, Peru and Mexico, we're not going to
take it anymore. Heroin and cocaine does not grow here, it's
brought here. We must stop it, stop it, stop it from coming here,''
Barry said.
   A private study released last week said the Washington area's
drug problem is almost unrivaled among large cities and that drug
abuse has grown in the area's suburbs more than in any other
suburban area in the nation.
   In her address, Mrs. Reagan alluded to this problem, saying that
``in Saturday's Washington Post, there was one page in which every
article was a local drug story _ and there was another local drug
story on the front page.''
   ``We must face the fact that drugs are tearing our communities
apart.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Drug Control, said in advance of
Monday's conference: ``Advances in stopping drugs _ we haven't made
any.''
   ``If we didn't have Nancy Reagan, we wouldn't have anything,''
he said in an interview with the Post.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, during an appearance at
Samford University in Birmingham, Ala., said drugs are the nation's
No. 1 social problem, but said some progress is being made,
particularly in high schools.
   But, he acknowleged, ``We still have a long way to go.''
   Cocaine seizures by U.S. authorities have risen by 1,822 percent
in the past seven years, according to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   In fiscal 1981, 1,872 kilograms was seized, compared with 35,970
kilograms in fiscal 1987, the DEA said on Feb. 4. A kilogram is
equal to 2.2 pounds.
   During the same period, marijuana seizures went down 42 percent,
from about 1 million kilograms in fiscal 1981 to 632,000 kilograms
last year. It peaked at 1.4 million kilograms seized in fiscal
1984, the DEA said.
   The DEA increased the number of its agents 34 percent, from less
than 1,500 to about 2,000, from fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1987, the
agency said.

   The World Bank, largest source of aid loans to
the Third World, announced Monday that it made a profit of $679
million for the last six months of 1987, up from $655 million for
the same period the year before.
   The bank's profits come largely from its ability to borrow money
at low rates of interest, because its funds are guaranteed by the
152 member governments. The bank lends money at varying rates,
depending on how poor the country is.
   In the period, the bank borrowed the equivalent of $7.7 billion
in 17 currencies at an average cost of 6.92 percent. Its rate of
return on $20.8 billion worth of investments at the end of the year
was 8.88 percent.
   The profit helped it make $3.6 billion worth of new loans to
Third World countries, reducing the interest rate it charges them
to an annual 7.72 percent for the first six months of this year
from a previous 7.76 percent.

   Gov. Evan Mecham, absent from the opening
day of his impeachment trial in the state Senate, blasted his
former attorney for remarks to lawmakers on Monday, and vowed he
will be found innocent.
   The governor said he had a falling-out with Murray Miller, his
lead attorney until last week, when Washington attorney Jerris
Leonard was brought in to lead the defense.
   Miller, who appeared at Mecham's Senate trial to formally
withdraw from the case, Monday told senators that he was pushed
aside by Leonard, calling his arrival in Phoenix last week ``a
one-man coup.''
   Responding to question by Sen. Tony West, R-Phoenix, Miller
hinted that the sudden change in legal counsel could weaken
Mecham's defense.
   Responding to Miller's comments from his suburban headquarters,
Mecham said, ``I'd both disappointed and disgusted by the
prejudicial and unnecessary grandstanding by Murray Miller before
the Arizona state Senate today.''
   ``I deeply resent the possible prejudice to me by Mr. Miller's
remarks to the state Senate and do not believe his actions were in
my best interest. ... I don't feel too good about what he did.''
   The governor said he began a search for more attorneys when it
appeared trials in the Senate and state court might overlap. When
Leonard was hired as chief counsel because ``I felt we have to have
a lot more horsepower,'' Miller decided to leave, Mecham said.
   ``I suggested if he did not want to work in a cohesive group
then let's part as friends,'' Mecham said.
   Mecham said he will not attend the impeachment trial until his
attorneys tell him to. He said he hasn't spent much time tracking
the proceedings.
   He did say he expects to be acquitted.
   ``I remain convinced that if I receive a fair trial, the truth
will prevail and I will be acquitted,'' the governor said.
   Mecham said Miller has been paid in full, but he declined to say
how much the attorney received.
   The governor also denied a published report that top
fund-raisers were promised jobs.
   ``One of the things we can prove was that at every finance
meeting, everyone was told, `You get nothing but better
government,'' Mecham said. ``It was the cleanest campaign this
state has ever seen.''
   Mecham said he had had no recent direct contact with acting Gov.
Rose Mofford.

<TEXT>
   Britain said Monday a special commission will
investigate complaints against the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
predominantly Protestant police force in Northern Ireland.
   The announcement was made by Tom King, Northern Ireland
secretary. It prompted speculation that the commission might
supervise a disciplinary inquiry about officers involved in the
killings of six unarmed Roman Catholics in 1982.
   Britain's top official for the province said in a written reply
in the House of Commons the Independent Commission for Police
Complaints will make ``a material contribution to strengthening
good relations between the RUC and the whole community in Northern
Ireland.''
   King and the Northern Ireland Police Authority, a
police-civilian watchdog body, will be able to have the commission
supervise investigations of any complaints against police involving
death or serious injury.
   According to the Northern Ireland Office, the province's
administrative authority, cases that are not the subject of formal
complaints but ``indicate that a member of the police force may
have committed a criminal or disciplinary offense'' could be
included.
   On Feb. 17, Northern Ireland police announced an inquiry into
police shootings of six Catholics in three separate incidents in
late 1982.
   The investigation led by Charles Kelly, chief constable of
Staffordshire, will look into a controversy that has been revived
this year and seriously damaged relations between Britain and the
Irish Republic.
   John Stalker, then assistant chief constable of Manchester,
investigated the shootings for two years. He published a book in
February claiming he was removed because his findings threatened
senior officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
   On Jan. 25, the government disclosed that evidence had emerged
of perjury and subversion of justice in an alleged coverup related
to the shootings, but said no officers would be prosecuted.

   Two men have been hanged in a Tehran
square where they planted bombs last year, Iran's official news
agency reported Monday.
   The executions occurred Sunday, the day after five people were
hanged in another square, also for terrorist bombings, the Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
   Hojatoleslam Serajeddin Musavi, commander of neighborhood
Islamic Revolutionary Committees, announced Saturday that 30 people
responsible for recent bomb attacks in Tehran and western Iran had
been arrested.
   Neighborhood committees are vigilante groups that handle some
security duties.
   According to IRNA, Musavi told a news conference those arrested
were ``paid Iraqi agents,'' who were promised 30 million rials
($470,000) for each bomb exploded in a busy area of Tehran and 6-10
million rials ($94,000-$156,000) for each one that went off in an
area less densely populated.
   He said they arrived in the capital Feb.1 to plant bombs during
the 10-day celebration surrounding the anniverary of the
fundamentalist Moslem revolution that ousted the late Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
   IRNA said the bombers were found and arrested by Musavi's
organization soon after a booby-trapped car exploded Feb. 13 and
wounded 10 people on Martyr Bahonar Avenue a few hundred yards from
the residence of revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   The last bombing reported in Tehran was a car that exploded on
an expressway on Feb. 16, wounding two people.
   In its dispatches Monday, IRNA did not say whether the five
people hanged Saturday were among the 30 Musavi said were arrested
that day.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980 and Iranian
authorities refer to members of Iranian resistance groups fighting
the Khomeini regime as Iraqi agents. Mujahedeen Khalq, the main
Iranian resistance group, has its headquarters and bases in Iraq.

   Opposition leaders said the government
arrested more than 150 activists who were organizing a strike
Monday to protest suspension of six local officials, all of them
members of the outlawed Nepali Congress Party.
   Only a few shops were closed in this capital city on Monday
despite the general strike called by the opposition.
   All political parties were banned in 1960 following Nepal's
dissolution of a Western-style parliamentary system. The Congress
Party, led by Krishna Prashad Bhattarai, has for years sought to
change the present system of government through a disobedience
movement.
   The government said Monday it arrested about 60 strike
organizers.
   Bhattarai, however, told reporters more than 150 of his party's
members were arrested Monday. Congress Party leaders said 35 other
members were arrested in recent days, including the man elected
mayor of Katmandu in elections last March.
   The mayor, his deputy, and four presidents of district and town
assemblies were suspended indefinitely from their offices for
boycotting Constitution Day observances last Dec. 16.
   The government said the six had pledged to work under the
non-party system when they filed nomination papers.
   Nepal, a constitutional monarchy, is governed by a complex
system of district councils and a national legislature.

   More than 300 winners in Bulgaria's first
election with multiple candidates did not receive the majority
needed to gain office, the official Bulgarian news agency BTA said
Monday.
   It said 99.15 percent of Bulgaria's 6,652,792 registered voters
participated in Sunday's election of mayors and local and regional
councils. They were the first elections held since the law was
changed in December to allow more than one candidate for each post.
   The agency report said 66,048 candidates were registered in
55,539 electoral districts. It said up to 1.47 percent of the
electorate voted against candidates who were elected, but was not
clear on whether those voters cast their ballots for alternative
candidates.
   In 302 electoral districts ``the candidates did not collect the
necessary number of votes,'' BTA said.
   To win, a candidate must have more than 50 percent of the vote
if more than half of the electorate has taken part in the election.
The new law does not require Bulgarians to vote.
   BTA said 13 seats in regional councils and Sofia were among
those not filled, along with 31 mayors' offices. Elections were not
held in five districts because ``the candidates died after they
were registered,'' it said without elaboration.
   By-elections will be held to fill all the vacant posts, the
agency said, but did not give a date.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson
revived his charge that there are Soviet missiles in Cuba on
Monday, producing a Cuban refugee who said he had seen the weapons.
   Since Robertson first raised his claim two weeks ago, denials
have been issued by the White House, congressional experts on
U.S.-Soviet affairs and Cuban president Fidel Castro, who Robertson
called ``a butcher and a tyrant.''
   Robertson visited privately with the refugee, who identified
himself only as E. Rodriguez, saying he feared family members still
in Cuba would suffer retribution if he gave his full name.
   Robertson has yet to offer documentation to back up his claim
other than a Miami Cuban-American newspaper, Diario Libre, which
has printed copies of maps drawn by Rodriguez to pinpoint missile
sites.
   ``Ninety-five percent of the Cuban-Americans in Miami believe
there are missiles in Cuba,'' Robertson said at a news conference
where he held up a copy of the newspaper.
   Rodriguez, speaking through an interpreter, said his job in Cuba
as an agricultural planner gave him access to aerial photographs
and to areas where the missiles were based. He said he saw 60
long-range surface-to-surface missiles as well as air defense and
anti-ship missiles. He said he did not know if the missiles had
nuclear warheads. Rodriguez left Cuba three years ago.
   Robertson, campaigning for support in the balloting on Super
Tuesday, was on a two-day swing through Florida, one of the biggest
prizes in the 16-state round of Republican primaries and caucuses
March 8.
   He was greeted by about 400 mostly Cuban-American senior
citizens at the Allapattah Community Center and about the same
number of students at heavily Hispanic La Salle High School.
   ``I will work with you to see Cuba independent and democratic,''
Robertson said at the community center. ``Today I say it, tomorrow
I say it, the next day I say it, Viva Cuba Libre!'' _ long live a
free Cuba.
   He put on an apron and passed trays of chicken, rice and fried
plantains to senior citizens seated at long tables.
   At the school, Robertson was met by students shouting ``Go Pat
Go!'' Some students held signs passed out by campaign staffers.
   When a student asked if Robertson would ever renew diplomatic
relations with Cuba, he replied: ``I don't think we should have
diplomatic relations with a butcher and a tyrant!''
   Robertson began his Florida tour in Jacksonville Monday and
arranged a rally in Miami Monday night, followed by breakfast
Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale and stops in Hollywood, Fort Myers,
Sarasota, Gainesville and Orlando.
   In Jacksonville, Robertson told about 500 supporters that
``along with Texas, Florida is one of the two most pivotal states.''
   He added:
   ``We've got one week to the most crucial election, I believe, in
the history of America, certainly this century and maybe since its
beginning.
   ``We're at a crossroads in America. We're either going to return
to the ways that made this nation great, or we're going to go down
the road.''
   Robertson mentioned a gun problem experienced this year in
several Florida schools.
   ``How can a child study when he's living in mortal fear of
somebody shooting him with a handgun in the halls of the school? We
owe our children an education in a crime-free, drug-free school
environment,'' said Robertson.
   ``If we want to see this country strong. There's only one way in
my estimation to do it. We will restore the greatness of America
through moral strength,'' he added.
   Robertson also said that ``we've got to go back to a time in our
educational system when once again we teach our kids moral values.
We've got to bring God back into the public schools of America.''
   On trade, he said: ``There isn't one country that is treating us
fairly. ... As president of the United States, I'm not going to
shut down American factories and put Americans out of jobs to
improve the standard of living in communist China and communist
Russia.''
   At a news conference following his address, Robertson called
Panama military strong man Manuel Antonio Noriega ``a bandit,'' but
added that ``I don't see us sending troops (to Panama). I don't
think it is necessary.''
   On South Africa, Robertson said, ``I am totally opposed to
apartheid ... but the thing I'm concerned about is turning South
Africa into a bloody battleground.''
   ``I don't want to see a Marxist state in South Africa,''
Robertson said.

<HEAD>Polish Monthly Says 500,000 Poles Deported To U.S.S.R. In World
War II</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official monthly acknowledged about
500,000 Poles were deported to the Soviet Union from territories
occupied by the Red Army at the outbreak of World War II, and said
many died as a result of harsh conditions.
   The unusual account of the fate of the Poles came in an article
in the February issue of Konfrontacje (Confrontation). It is
published by the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth, a
national front organization.
   The article said much was written about the wartime deportations
of Poles to Nazi Germany.
   But it said ``the fate of Polish people in the East has been
unnecessarily covered in a mist of secrecy, although it was known
that there were hundreds of thousands of witnesses of those events
living who probably haven't concealed them from relatives.''
   It was the first time a widely circulated official publication
offered a detailed breakdown of the number of Poles deported to the
Soviet Union in World War II, although Polish underground and
Western publications have described the large-scale suffering of
Poles at Soviet hands.
   Last year, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski criticized
abuses against Poles committed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in
an article in the Soviet Communist Party journal Kommunist. He said
thousands of Poles suffered deportation and repression in
territories occupied by the Soviets.
   After the Germans attacked Poland in September 1939, Soviet
troops invaded from the east and occupied eastern Polish
territories under provisions of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact.
   Konfrontacje said Poles in the Soviet-occupied territories
``found themselves in a difficult situation'' suffering from police
harassment and restrictions on civic rights.
   About 4 million Poles lived in the eastern territories before
the war, along with millions of Ukrainians, Byelorussians and Jews.
   The article said a ``safe'' estimate indicates the Soviets
deported 500,000 Poles from the eastern territories in four mass
transports from February 1940 to June 1941, when the Nazis launched
a surprise attack on the Soviet Union.
   Those deported included state clerks, farmers and their
families, refugees who fled Nazi-occupied Poland, intellectuals and
workers, both leftists and right-wingers, the monthly said.
   It said an additional 200,000 Poles were recruited into the
Soviet army and later evacuated to the Soviet Union.
   About 270,000 of the Poles deported or evacuated ``died in
different circumstances _ in fighting with the Red Army, during
long and exhausting transports, as the result of difficult
conditions in Siberia and in other areas'' or else ``did not come
back to Poland'' after the war, it said.
   The monthly said that overall, about 600,000 to 800,000 Poles
from the eastern territories died during the war, almost half of
them killed in a terror campaign launched by Nazi-collaborating
Ukrainian nationalists in 1943.
   Polish and Soviet historians began a weeklong meeting in Warsaw
on Monday, a follow-up to a Moscow session last year devoted to
``blank spots'' in Polish-Soviet relations, referring to topics so
controversial they are unmentioned or distorted in official
histories.
   Participants told Polish television they would discuss the fate
of Poles in the Soviet Union during the war, including the
deportations, and would have at their disposal ``valuable and
important documents'' previously kept secret.
   The meeting is an outgrowth of an agreement signed last year by
Jaruzelski and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on ideological
and cultural cooperation which discussed the necessity for a more
truthful history of Polish-Soviet relations.
   Gorbachev has encouraged greater examination of history through
his policy of glasnost, or openness.

<HEAD>Solidarity Says Employees Who Stopped Work May Get Higher Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spokesmen for Solidarity said management
promised to consider pay increases for employees of a railroad car
repair plant who stopped work to protest price increases.
   Solidarity's National Executive Commission accused the communist
government of ``alarming ineptness in the economic realm.''
   Spokesmen for the outlawed independent labor federation in
Wroclaw, a southwestern industrial city, said about 1,500 people
joined the job action at the Railway Rolling Stock Repair plant _
about half the work force. Plant officials declined comment.
   A government spokesman denied such a large number of people
participated, and said the stoppage ended when managers dispelled a
misunderstanding about how the annual profit bonus would be paid.
   It appeared to be the biggest work stoppage in Poland since the
government imposed major price increases earlier in February.
   Government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz said plant workers
were disturbed over profit-sharing. He said distribution of the
annual bonus based on profits began last week but many workers
found it too small.
   About a third of the staff stopped work at various times Monday
morning but resumed after plant officials explained how the bonus
was calculated, he said.
   Jozef Pinior, a Wroclaw leader of Solidarity, said about half
the plant's 3,000 workers downed tools at 9 a.m. in response to a
Solidarity call.
   Pinior said plant director Wojciech Zmyslony pleaded with
workers to return to their jobs and said management would consider
increasing monthly pay by the equivalent of $8 to $11.
   Union members said Sunday plant workers were in a ``combative
mood'' because of price increases imposed Feb. 1.
   Besides claiming too much bonus money was going to managers,
they said raises given to offset price increases were inadequate.
   Prices of staple goods were increased 40 percent, with increases
in school tuitions and energy prices set for March 1 and April 1,
as part of an economic reform program aimed at reviving the economy.
   In its statement Monday, the Solidarity National Executive
Commission said: ``Drastic price increases have lowered the living
standards of all society, pushing low-income groups to the level of
subsistence.''
   Union adviser Jacek Kuron read the statement, which accused
police of tightening surveillance of commission members and said
the number of activists jailed, ``often under criminal pretext,''
is growing.

   A huge explosion in the
South Armagh border area killed two Irish Republican Army
guerrillas Monday in ``an unfortunate accident,'' the IRA said.
   The blast destroyed a van and a barn about two miles outside
Crossmaglen village, badly damaged two cars and left a crater.
   Police said four armed and masked men hijacked the van and a car
shortly before the blast. Authorities speculated that IRA
guerrillas were installing explosives in the van when the
explosives accidentally detonated.
   A police officer, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice, said it was believed the IRA's intended target was an
army observation post near the border with Irish Republic.
   The IRA later issued a statement saying two of its men died in
the blast, which it described as ``an unfortunate accident.'' The
group gave no details, and said names and IRA ranks of the dead men
would be released after families are notified.
   Police said human remains were found at the site and
walkie-talkies and a notebook were among the debris.
   Helicopters brought security forces into the surrounding fields
to seal off the area overnight. Police said they would not move in
until Tuesday, after army bomb disposal experts made sure no
booby-trap bombs were around.
   The mostly Roman Catholic IRA often uses explosives in its
violent campaign to drive the British out of the predominantly
Protestant province and unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic.

   Democratic presidential contender
Richard Gephardt came under attack from rivals in a debate Monday
night for taking contributions from special interest groups, with
Michael Dukakis saying Gephardt had accepted the money and raced
``around the country beating up on the establishment.''
   When Gephardt replied that he had often voted against the
policies advocated by people who had given him contributions,
Dukakis scoffed.
   `This isn't a fairy tale; this isn't kindergarten; you're
talking politics,'' he said.
   Gephardt fought back. ``To suggest that ... you're going to take
direction on how to vote is an affront,'' he said.
   He said he was sure that Dukakis, as governor of Massachusetts,
had taken contributions from firms doing business with the state.
``Does that make you less of a public servant?''
   Yes, said Dukakis, but ``I am not running around the country
beating up on the establishment.''
   Gephardt accepted $341,000 in contributions from political
action committees last year.
   The exchange during the debate at the College of William and
Mary, came eight days before voters in 20 states, most of them in
the South, make their decisions in primaries and caucuses on Super
Tuesday. The debate, the Democrats' third in three days, was, by
the count of moderator Judy Woodruff, the 24th time the Democrats
had met in debate.
   The candidates, at Jesse Jackson's suggestion, wore yellow
ribbons on their jackets in protest of the arrest of Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Capetown, South Africa, on Monday.
   To Gary Hart, who joined in the criticism of Gephardt for taking
money from political action committees, the Missourian retorted:
``You took contributions for your Senate campaign.''
   Nonetheless, Hart said, reform is needed: ``The system is out of
control.''
   Gephardt, on the defensive, said, ``We all understand the need
for reform, but to suggest that people have voted according to the
wishes of people who have given them money, I just think is out of
touch with reality. I haven't done that and I know you haven't done
that.''
   Hart said he hadn't and hoped Gephardt hadn't.
   But Jackson said Gephardt's contention that he ignored the
wishes of his contributors was unrealistic.
   ``Lobbyists would lose their jobs if they gave money
continuously against the interests of who they were working for,''
Jackson said.
   At another point, Jackson seized an opportunity to say he was
being treated differently than the other candidates because he is a
black.
   He cited a poll which he said NBC took after the New Hampshire
primary. In it potential voters were asked if they could support a
black for president.
   ``I said did you ask how many would vote for a Greek?'' said
Jackson, a reference to Dukakis, whose parents were Greek
immigrants.
   ``They said no. I said why even bring race into it. My race is
self-evident and my leadership is obvious. Let's take the issues to
the people.''
   For the most part, the candidates wrangled over familiar issues,
with Gephardt belittling Dukakis' plans for increasing government
revenues without a tax increase and Dukakis saying Gephardt has
changed his positions.
   ``In Iowa, Dick was telling us I'm sorry for that vote,''
Dukakis said of Gephardt's vote for the 1981 tax cut proposed by
President Reagan _ a bill that other Democrats say led to the huge
deficits that followed. ``That was the Iowa Gephardt. Now we have
another one here,'' Dukakis added.
   ``I'm trying to figure out which one I'm debating.''
   Gephardt defended his vote for Reagan's tax cuts, saying they
had reduced taxes for the average American.
   And he said the Dukakis plan to collect taxes now evaded by many
Americans _ the New Englander says billions of dollars are involved
_ won't do much to combat deficits.
   ``Sure we want revenue agents but that is not going to solve the
problem,'' Gephardt said.
   Dukakis attacked Gephardt on another front, saying the oil
import fee that Gephardt advocates would damage Mexico.
   ``You're going to kill Mexico,'' Dukakis said.
   Asked Gephardt: ``Are you running for president of Mexico or
president of America?''
   That drew a gasp from the audience and then applause. But more
applause came when Dukakis replied: ``If I'm president of the
United States, I'm going to pay attention to that country.''
   Gore, stressing the harder line he takes on defense issues in
comparison with his rivals, defended the decision by the Reagan
administration to send American ships to protect Kuwaiti tankers.
   ``When the ayatollah said he was going to shut down our access
to 70 percent of the oil available to the free world, no one else
(among the candidates) was willing to say we had a right to keep
the sea lanes open,'' he said.
   The only Democratic candidate who didn't take part in the debate
was Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois.
   The affair's sponsor was the Democratic Leadership Council, an
organization of moderate Democrats who decided after Walter
Mondale's 49-state loss in 1984 to seek to move the party somewhat
toward the right.

   The Arizona Senate on Monday opened the
first impeachment trial of a U.S. governor in six decades, and
within hours an attorney for Gov. Evan Mecham lost a plea for
dismissal of the charges against the first-term Republican.
   ``This man hasn't dipped his hands into public funds,'' attorney
Jerris Leonard said. ``He hasn't ripped off the treasury. He hasn't
committed high crimes in office, and I urge you to dismiss these
articles of impeachment.''
   But the 29 voting senators gave Mecham an overwhelming
rejection. On 11 different motions to dismiss portions of the
charges, the largest number voting for Mecham was seven and the
smallest was two.
   The rest answered firmly, ``No,'' when asked if they would drop
the challenged articles of impeachment. They also refused to recess
early at Leonard's request and continued to address motions brought
by the governor's laywer.
   Attorney Paul Eckstein, one of the prosecutors, had responded to
Leonard that even if it turned out that Mecham didn't violate state
laws, his conduct would be ``grossly offensive to the people of
this state.''
   ``The articles of impeachment ... cry out for conviction,''
Eckstein said. He urged speedy resolution of a raft of pending
motions to allow testimony to begin.
   At the conclusion of Monday's session, senators said they
expected opening statements and testimony to begin Tuesday.
   Mecham, who was not required to be present when the senators
convened, stayed at the suburban Glendale offices of his
``government in exile,'' and said he was too busy to watch the
proceedings on television. He told reporters that he remained
optimistic.
   ``I remain convinced that if I receive a fair trial, the truth
will prevail and I will be acquitted,'' Mecham said.
   Of his absence from the trial, he said, ``When my attorneys tell
me to be there I'll be there.''
   His absence was not mentioned during the proceedings on the
Senate floor.
   Following Monday's session, Sen. Jeff Hill, a Republican who
once strongly backed Mecham, said that judging from the heavy vote
against him on dismissal, things looked bad for the governor.
   ``I think it's not likely he's going to prevail,'' he said.
   Mecham, a 63-year-old auto dealer who won election after five
tries, is accused of ``high crimes, misdemeanors and malfeasance in
office.''
   Twenty-three articles of impeachment approved by the state House
alleged three broad areas of misdeeds. The articles said Mecham
concealed a $350,000 campaign loan, wrongly loaned $80,000 from his
protocol fund to his car dealership and obstructed justice by
discouraging a public official not to cooperate in the
investigation of an alleged death threat to a grand jury witness.
   If convicted by the Senate, Mecham would be removed from office
and could be permanently barred from holding elective office. He is
the first U.S. governor to be impeached since 1929, when Huey Long
of Louisiana and Henry S. Johnston of Oklahoma were impeached. Long
was never tried; Johnston was removed.
   Mecham also faces a March 22 criminal trial on six felony
charges of concealing the campaign loan, and a May 17 recall
election.
   Meanwhile, the Arizona Supreme Court was expected to rule
Tuesday on a defense claim that the impeachment trial should be
delayed until after Mecham's criminal trial.
   Mecham, a political outsider, has drawn criticism for comments
which critics considered slurs against blacks, homosexuals, Jews
and the Japanese. He spurred controversy by eliminating the state's
Martin Luther King holiday on his second day in office and
defending an author's use of the word ``pickaninny'' in a history
book.
   Leonard, who took over Mecham's defense only last week,
addressed his major concern to Mecham's failure to report the
$350,000 loan. He challenged the senators to recall whether they
themselves hadn't committed similar acts and accused them of
putting the governor to a stricter test than other officials.
   ``The rules of the game have been changed overnight,'' Leonard
said. He contended Mecham should have been given a second chance to
amend his disclosure forms.
   ``I think you're applying a legal standard here to an act I'm
not going to condone but is commonplace,'' Leonard said. ``If there
are members of this Senate who haven't had to file an amendment,
God love you.
   ``You are applying a standard to one public official that has
not been applied to others.''
   Eckstein responded that he was ``in no small amount of shock''
at such an argument.
   ``That's commonplace?'' he said. ``God save us all. And if it is
commonplace, that conduct must be offensive to the people as a
whole.''
   The impeachment proceeding opened with an air of high solemnity
after Senate Democratic Minority Leader Alan Stephens told the 29
other senators who sit as judges and jury: ``We are about to embark
on an arduous duty.
   ``The Senate trial of Evan Mecham does not concern merely this
one officeholder,'' Stephens said, ``but instead addresses the very
essence of democracy in our state constitution.
   ``We are really testing our form of government,'' he said.
``Will we stand up and do our duty amid calls from the public to
intimidate us?''
   The first action taken by the Senate as the impeachment court
convened was to accept the substitution of Leonard for Murray
Miller, Mecham's original attorney. Miller, who left the case last
week, made a brief speech saying he had not willingly abandoned it.
   Mecham criticized Miller for making the remarks before the
Senate.
   ``I'm both disappointed and disgusted by the prejudicial and
unnecessary grandstanding by Murray Miller before the Arizona state
Senate today,'' Mecham said.
   During the impeachment proceedings, a handful of Mecham
supporters gathered outside the Senate building. Some carried
placards demanding justice. Others laid a paper railroad track
across the courtyard with a drawing of the governor, bound and
gagged on the tracks.
   ``He's being railroaded,'' said Mecham supporter Wilma Harm of
Phoenix. ``The man has done nothing to be called upon like this.''

<HEAD>Report Says IRA Equipped with Anti-Aircraft Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army is equipped with
Soviet-made SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles, Irish and British
authorities acknowledged in a TV program broadcast Monday.
   The surface-to-air missiles were contained in more than 100 tons
of weaponry sent by Libya to Ireland for the IRA in four shiploads
in 1985 and 1986, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.'s
``Panorama'' program.
   The program said British army helicopters operating along
Northern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic would be the most
likely targets. The helicopters are the army's main mode of
transport in IRA-plagued border regions.
   The Irish justice minister, Gerry Collins, said some of the
missiles ``may very well be'' in Northern Ireland already. The IRA,
outlawed in Britain and Ireland, is fighting to drive the British
out of the province.
   John Hermon, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's police force, said he had ``no reason to doubt''
the SAM-7s are hidden somewhere in Ireland.
   ``As to where they are precisely, there's an element of doubt,''
he said. Asked how many there were, he replied, ``That's not a
question I'd be prepared to answer directly, but I'm satisfied that
they exist.''
   Collins said he was puzzled over how the IRA apparently was able
to unload in one night in October 1986 an estimated 105 tons of
Libyan-supplied arms using an isolated jetty near Arklow, 40 miles
south of Dublin.
   ``That is something that is causing us concern, putting it very
bluntly,'' Collins said. ``At the particular time we did not have
any intelligence that this was about to happen nor indeed did we
know that it did happen.''
   The October shipment contained an unknown number of SAM-7s, the
program said, quoting unidentified British and Irish security
sources. A shipment in July 1986 included four SAM-7s, it said.
   Gen. Sir James Glover, British army commander of land forces in
Northern Ireland in 1979-80, said army countermeasures against
SAM-7s have been prepared but have not yet had to be tested.
   Three shipments that reached Ireland were loaded off the
Mediterranean island of Malta and one 15 miles off Libya, the
program said.
   Last Oct. 30, authorities seized a ship, the Eksund, and its
five Irish crewmen in French waters. The ship was carrying about
150 tons of weapons, including 20 SAM-7 missiles, apparently
destined for the IRA, the program said. The first of the four
shipments to reach Ireland was delivered in August 1985 and
contained seven tons of arms, including pistols and 70 Soviet-made
AK-47 assault rifles, the program said.
   A shipment in October 1985 contained 10 tons of arms, including
100 AK-47s and 10 machine guns, and a third in July 1986 contained
14 tons and included four SAM-7s.
   The three shiploads were landed using inflatable dinghies at
Clogga Strand, an isolated beach near Arklow.
   In August 1986, apparently in response to the U.S. bombing raid
on Libya the previous April, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
bought a ship that in October that year was used to deliver an
estimated 105 tons of weaponry to the IRA, the program said.
   The arms apparently were trucked inland and hidden in already
prepared bunkers. Police have uncovered some of the weapons
recently in both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, but no
SAM-7s have been found.
   On Monday, a huge explosion in the South Armagh border area in
Northern Ireland killed two IRA guerrillas in ``an unfortunate
accident,'' the IRA said.
   Police believe the IRA men were installing explosives in a
stolen van about two miles outside Crossmaglen village, intending
to attack an army observation post, when the explosives
accidentally detonated.

   Oprah Winfrey bought a Mercedes and a Jaguar
when a syndicated television deal made her a millionaire, but the
talk-show host laughs at the notion that fame and fortune may spoil
her.
   ``My feet are still planted firmly on the ground,'' Winfrey said
in an interview published in TV Guide. ``They're just wearing more
expensive shoes.''
   Winfrey's lifestyle reflects her success. She lives in a luxury
apartment with a wraparound view of Lake Michigan, and owns a
Mercedes-Benz 560 SEL and a Jaguar.
   Gayle King Bumpus, an anchorwoman in Connecticut, does not think
wealth and fame have gone to her friend's head. As a fifth
anniversary present, Winfrey sent Bumpus and her husband to Paris,
Rome and Venice.
   ``I remember once she came to visit us in Connecticut in a
stretch limo,'' Bumpus said. ``She was wearing one of her five fur
coats, probably a $25,000 number, and white tennis shoes with
rhinestones on them and a red sweat shirt that said `Husbands Can
Be Temporary but Best Friends Last Forever.'''

   Sikh gunmen killed seven members of a
family in the bloodiest attack on Christians in Punjab state since
Sikh militants began a campaign for autonomy in 1982, police
reported Monday.
   ``It is a gruesome killing, the assailants systematically wiped
out the entire family of Kulwant Massiha,'' said J.P. Virdi, police
chief of Gurdaspur district where the attack occured late Sunday.
Gurdaspur is 40 miles south of the Sikhs' holy city of Amritsar.
   Virdi said the motive for the killings was not known. There have
been several cases in recent years of Sikh extremists killing the
entire families of Hindus or Sikhs suspected of being police
informers.
   Four gummen entered the Massiha house and opened fire with
automatic rifles on the victims who were sitting in one room,
according to Virdi.
   He said the seven killed were Massiha, three brothers, one
sister, their 70-year-old mother and Massiha's 7-year-old son.
   Massiha's wife was away in the village of Kalibramnia when the
terrorists struck, Virdi added.
   He said that as the killers fled they wounded seven people in
Kalibramnia.
   Sikhs, who make up about 2 percent of India's 780 million
people, claim they are discriminated against by Hindus who form
about 82 percent of the population. Punjab state is predominantly
Sikh, and separatists are demanding an independent homeland there.
   Christians compose 2.5 percent of India's population, and most
of the few who live in Punjab are in the Gurdaspur district that
borders Pakistan. Many of the Christians in Punjab are immigrants
from predominantly Moslem Pakistan.
   Police say Sikh extremists have killed at least 313 people in
Punjab this year. Last year they were blamed for more than 1,000
killings in the state.
   Sikhism is an offshoot of the Hindu religion.

   A key Nazi document made public Monday
shows that Kurt Waldheim signed a German letter seeking approval
for mass deportation of Greek civilians in 1943 in a ``cleansing
operation.''
   The document, found in U.S. National Archives, was vital in the
Justice Department's decision to place Waldheim, now Austria's
president and formerly U.N. secretary-general, on a ``watchlist''
barring him from the United States.
   ``The document was one of those used in making the watchlist
decision,'' Justice Department spokesman John Russell told The
Associated Press by telephone from Washington Monday.
   That U.S. government decision said in part that Waldheim
``assisted or otherwise participated'' in ``mass deportation of
civilians.''
   The document, dated Aug. 15, 1943, was made available to the AP
by the World Jewish Congress and its authenticity was confirmed by
Justice Department sources.
   Waldheim says he was innocent of war crimes. He was serving as
deputy operations officer of the German General Staff attached to
the 11th Italian army in Athens at the time the document was sent.
   The document shows Waldheim, while not authorizing the
deportations, received the communication via radio, transcribed it
and forwarded it, the World Jewish Congress said.
   In the message, a German army officer in the field was seeking
authorization from headquarters to deport all the male civilians in
northern Greece where the division was operating. The request was
sent to a Gen. Gyldenfeldt who subsequently approved the
deportation, the World Jewish Congress said.
   However, the order was countermanded before it could be used to
deport any Greek civilians, the World Jewish Congress said.
   The communication mentions ``heavy bandit concentrations'' and
says, ``Bridgehead formations by groups seem particularly
promising, for which reason scheduled cleansing operations in this
area are deemed necessary.
   ``(There is) Hope of success only if all male civilians are
seized and deported.''
   The Nazis often used the term ``cleansing operations'' to refer
to destruction of towns and mass execution of inhabitants as a
warning to others to report partisans to German authorities.
Deported Greek civilians were generally sent to German labor camps.
   The document also says the ``Jewish Committee'' operating in the
town of Joannina, Greece, ``must be regarded as a center of
preparations for a resistance movement.''
   The following March, the Nazis deported 1,860 Jews, virtually
the entire Jewish population of Joannina, to Auschwitz death camp
in Poland, the World Jewish Congress said. The document signed by
Waldheim did not seek authorization to deport the Jews.
   The Austrian government has complained that the Justice
Department has not turned over all information on which it based
its decision to prohibit Waldheim's entry into the United States.
   The U.S. government said it is not up to the United States to do
Austria's investigation. It said the documents are available to the
Austrian government and that Waldheim can appeal the watchlist
decision if he wishes.
   He has not done so.
   A commission of six international historians appointed by the
Austrian government found in February that as a German army
officer, Waldheim knew about Nazi war crimes and could have done
more to prevent atrocities. It said it did not have evidence he
actually committed atrocities, but left open the question of
whether he was guilty of any crime.
   Waldheim said he was vindicated by the commission.
   Under the Nuremberg Charter, the deportation of civilians is
both a war crime and a crime against humanity, the World Jewish
Congress said in a statement.
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
said Monday his organization provided the document to the Justice
Department in 1986.
   The translation of sections of the document from German into
English was done by the World Jewish Congress. It was not
questioned by the Justice Department.
   In London, the British Defense Ministry appealed to the public
Monday for information about Waldheim's wartime activities that
might help its investigation into the Nazi executions of six
British commandos in 1944.
   The commandos, a raiding party captured in the Balkans off
Alimina island in April 1944, were handed over for interrogation to
the unit in which Waldheim served.
   They refused to talk and were executed by the Nazis _ a war
crime under the Geneva convention on prisoners of war.
   The Conservative government ordered an investigation two weeks
ago to try to pin down whether Waldheim interrogated the six men.
   Ian Stewart, minister of state for the armed forces, announced
in a written reply in the House of Commons that ``anyone who has
concrete evidence that might be relevant to the review is
encouraged to submit it to the Ministry of Defense for
examination.''

   The American intention to close the PLO
mission by March 21 jeopardizes U.N. independence, Arab and Western
diplomats told a special General Assembly session Monday.
   Representatives of the 21-nation Arab Group, the PLO and the
45-nation Islamic Conference urged the United States to submit the
dispute to binding arbitration, and asked the assembly to request
an advisory opinion from the World Court in The Hague.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar also recommended
arbitration and said the integrity of the world organization was at
stake.
   Even close U.S. allies such as Canada, members of the European
Community and the Scandinavian countries urged the United States
not to close the PLO mission and joined in the call for arbitration.
   ``At stake at this point are the effective functioning of the
United Nations and the right of the organization to hear the views
of those invited to attend as observers,'' Canadian Ambassador
Stephen Lewis said, speaking also on behalf of Australia and New
Zealand.
   Later this week, the 159-nation General Assembly is expected to
approve resolutions echoing all those recommendations. A resolution
passed in December asked the United States not to close the mission
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has non-voting,
observer status.
   The confrontation over the PLO mission, which Congress has
ordered closed by March 21, has become the bitterest argument ever
between the United Nations and the host country.
   Several speakers said Monday the dispute could hurt U.S. peace
efforts in the Middle East, where Secretary of State George P.
Shultz has been on a shuttle mission.
   U.S. prestige at the United Nations already was waning when the
PLO issue arose, primarily because Washington's failure to pay its
full share of U.S. expenses for the several years has contributed
to the worst financial crisis in the organization's 42-year history.
   Peter Florin of East Germany, president of the General Assembly,
opened the Monday session with a reminder by citing a charter
provision saying a member can lose its vote if arrears grow too
large.
   The United States, which is assessed a quarter of the U.N.
budget, now owes more than $535 million in dues and contributions
to peacekeeping forces. At the current rate of funding by Congress,
the United States could face losing its vote in 1990.
   Last week, U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters said: ``We cannot
continue to neglect our financial commitments to the United Nations
and then expect that our opinions, policies and positions will
carry their former weight in the world body.''
   Arab diplomats said Monday the credibility of the United States
and the independence of the United Nations are at issue, not just
the fate of the 13-year-old PLO mission.
   The United Nations and U.S. State Department both say the
anti-terrorism bill ordering the PLO mission closed violates the
1947 U.S.-U.N. headquarters agreement, but Attorney General Edwin
Meese III is said to be planning to implement the legislation.
   Walters told a news conference Monday he didn't know what Meese
was going to do.
   He said a ``series of discussions is going on within the U.S.
government as to what is the appropriate action to take under the
circumstances and I am not aware the various agencies in the U.S.
government have reached some decision in this matter.''
   Zehdi Labib Terzi, PLO representative at the United Nations,
said Monday: ``Will the U.N. headquarters in New York be in a
position to continue operating in the absence of a respected and
adhered-to headquarters agreement?''
   Karim Ebrahim al-Shakar, ambassador of Bahrain and chairman of
the Arab Group, said the decision to close the mission was ``part
of a feverish Zionist campaign against the Palestinian people.''

<TEXT>
   The Belgrade District Court on
Monday banned another book by dissident sociologist Vojislav
Seselj, saying it could ``imperil public peace,'' the state's
Tanjug news agency reported.
   The book, titled ``The Books For The Pyre,'' deals with court
documents and proceedings from several previous trials involving
Seselj's works.
   Yugoslav courts have banned at least five of the sociologist's
books.
   Seselj was convicted in July 1984 of counter-revolutionary
activity, largely on the basis of an unpublished manuscript that
took a critical look at Yugoslavia's economic and social problems.
He served nearly two years of an eight-year prison sentence.
   Tanjug said Seselj's latest work slandered Josip Broz Tito,
founder and leader of Communist Yugoslavia who died in 1980. By
law, anyone publicly denigrating Tito is liable to criminal
prosecution.
   Tanjug did not say if further action might be taken against
Seselj.

<TEXT>
   A violent white supremacist group
targeted several prominent people for assassination, including
Henry Kissinger and top television executives, a witness testified
Monday in a federal sedition trial.
   Denver Parmenter, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty in 1985 to racketeering, testified that members of
The Order planned robberies, guerrilla warfare and murders to
further their goal.
   ``Our purpose was to kill important people in government or
other important institutions in this country to create havoc,
disorder, destruction,'' Parmenter said. Order members took an oath
which included the words, ``I have no fear of death.''
   Ten of the 14 men on trial are accused of sedition, or plotting
to overthrow the government by illegal means; two are charged with
interstate transportation of stolen money; and five are charged
with conspiring to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent. Neither
the judge, the FBI agent nor any of the celebrities mentioned in
the trial Monday were harmed.
   Parmenter said he was a former member of the Church of Jesus
Christ Christian (Aryan Nations) at Hayden Lake, Idaho, which is
run by defendant Richard Butler.
   Parmenter said Butler frequently spoke of his racial and
political viewpoints in sermons. He said Butler said the U.S.
government was ``basically a government that wasn't supporting its
race.''
   Parmenter said he and eight others, including defendants David
Lane and Bruce Pierce, formed The Order in September 1983 in
Metalline Falls, Wash., home of the late Robert Mathews.
   Mathews outlined six goals for Order members, including
developing a war chest through illegal means such as robbery and
counterfeiting, Parmenter said. Each member was given a target to
kill, Parmenter said, including David Rockefeller, television
producer Norman Lear, Kissinger and the three major network TV
presidents.
   Parmenter previously outlined the assassination plots during the
1985 trial of Order members in Seattle.

<HEAD>Official Trade Unions Attack Proposal To Establish Independent
Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's official trade unions on Monday
denounced a proposal by a group of academics to consider
establishing the country's first independent union.
   In a statement carried by the government news agency MTI, the
Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions said the group seeks ``to
destroy the unity of trade unions and set up organizations outside
the movement.''
   On Feb. 19, some members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
met to discuss the possibility of establishing an independent
union, well-informed sources in Budapest said Monday.
   Several hundred people attended the meeting to consider creating
the Tudosz Union of scientific workers, said the sources who spoke
with the condition they not be identified. They were contacted by
telephone from Vienna.
   The sources said after the meeting, academics from several
universities, including the Karl Marx Economics University,
expressed in university newspapers their support and their
intention to join the new union if it were completely independent.
   Some academics have criticized the official unions in communist
Hungary for not protesting a government decision to cut the
nation's scientific budget by 15 percent.
   According to the sources, a committee of about 30 people was set
up at the Feb. 19 meeting to determine under what conditions the
union could operate.
   The scientists currently belong to the Union of Public
Employees, which is under the umbrella of the central union council.
   The sources said the preparatory committee has sent a report to
scientific insititutions across the country asking them to
recommend delegates to the committee to ensure broad representation.
   There are no independent trade unions in Hungary.
   The first independent union in the Soviet bloc was Solidarity,
formed in Poland in August 1980 during nationwide strikes. It was
chartered by the government but then suspended in December 1981 and
subsequently outlawed.
   MTI reported the union council statement did not directly
mention the academics, but referred to ``a limited group'' that it
said was ``motivated by ill-willed political considerations.''
   The agency quoted the statement as saying the council rejects
``the intentions of those who make an attempt to set up
organizations opposing the trade union movement.''

   Officials of the Assemblies of God met
Monday to discuss the future of TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who
stepped down from his pulpit amid allegations of immoral conduct.
   A police officer guarded the parking lot of the Assemblies'
state headquarters, and officials issued a statement saying the
denomination would have no comment.
   ``Decisions made by the Louisiana district presbytery today will
be returned to the executive presbytery. There will be no further
announcement or comment from the Louisiana district counsel,''
district superintendent Cecil Janway said in the statement.
   There was no indication Swaggart, who confessed a week ago to
committing a sin, was present.
   The meeting broke up at 7 p.m. Seen leaving the office building
were the Rev. Jim Rentz, who is substituting for Swaggart at the
Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, and Forrest Hall,
secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies of God Louisiana district
council.
   Rentz had no comment, but Hall acknowledged that the meeting had
ended and that executive officials from Springfield, Mo., where the
church is based, had attended at the meeting.
   Leaders of the Pentecostal denomination are considering a
rehabilitation plan that will suspend Swaggart from preaching,
reportedly because he paid a prostitute to pose naked and tried to
make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it.
   Last week, Louisiana church officials recommended barring
Swaggart from preaching for three months, but national denomination
officials asked for reconsideration after receiving hundreds of
calls protesting the penalty as too lenient.
   The state denomination also was criticized for publicizing its
recommendation before it was reviewed by the national office.
   During a brief appearance Sunday at the Jimmy Swaggart World
Ministries center, Swaggart thanked about 4,000 worshipers for
their backing.
   ``I'll never have the words to express to you how much that I
care, my concern, for you and my thanksgiving. If it hadn't been
for you, we would not have made it. It's just that plain and
simple,'' said Swaggart.
   Swaggart again was not specific about his wrongdoing, but said
he had received support and sympathy from members of various
denominations.
   The founder of an evangelical empire worth an estimated $150
million said his worldwide ministry would continue.
   ``First of all, this ministry belongs to God. Secondly, this
ministry will continue. And last, but certainly not least, this
ministry will be what He wants it to be,'' Swaggart said.
   Marvin Gorman, the defrocked Assemblies of God minister who
reportedly confronted Swaggart with photographs of him entering and
leaving a New Orleans motel room with a prostitute, asked his own
congregation Sunday for prayers for Swaggart.
   ``I want you all to pray for Jimmy Swaggart and his family
because we know that they're going through a lot right now. And I
want you to know that I know that a lot of miracles will come out
of this,'' Gorman, who now preaches independently, said at his
Metropolitan Christian Centre in New Orleans.
   In a $90 million lawsuit filed last year, Gorman alleged that
Swaggart and 13 others had destroyed his ministry by spreading
false rumors of adulterous affairs.

   Guenther Tschanun, former head of the
city building inspector's office, was sentenced Monday to 17 years
in jail for fatally shooting four of his colleagues in 1986 at his
office.
   A Zurich court convicted Tschanun, a 47-year-old Austrian-born
architect, of voluntary homicide and attempted voluntary homicide.
   Tschanun told the court he committed the April 16, 1986,
slayings during a psychological breakdown and without premeditation.
   State prosecutor Marcel Bertschi had demanded a life sentence
for murder, saying Tschanun deliberately set out to kill after
becoming embroiled in conflicts with his co-workers.
   Tschanun fled after the killings. He was arrested in France
three weeks later.

<TEXT>
   Presidential hopeful Gary Hart, mired in the
back of the Democratic pack, failed to qualify for New York's
Democratic primary ballot, the state board of elections ruled
Monday.
   Board spokesman Steven LaFever said petitions meant to get the
former Colorado senator a spot on New York's April 19 primary
ballot contained only 6,864 signatures, more than 3,000 less than
required.
   To qualify for the statewide primary ballot, Democratic
candidates must file petitions containing the signatures of at
least 10,000 registered Democrats and at least 100 of those
signatures must come from each of 17 of the state's 34
congressional districts.
   The other five announced major candidates and political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche all filed petitions last week with more
than enough signatures to qualify for the ballot.
   Jon Kaiman, New York coordinator for the Hart campaign, said a
court appeal of the board's ruling would be considered.
   ``We don't know what to make of it,'' said Kaiman of the board's
finding. ``We were under the impression we had them (enough
signatures).''
   LaFever said the Hart petitions were received in the mail Monday
morning. The deadline for getting a postmark on the petitions was
midnight Thursday.
   Hart dropped out of the presidential race in May amid reports of
his relationship with a Miami model and rejoined the race in
December. He has been running well behind the rest of the field in
early contest states.

   ``Remember the '70s?,'' asks one of the three
rapidly aging young men who dominate the action in ``Boys' Life,''
a brittle, boorish and unappealing comedy that stumbled into the
Mitzi Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center on Monday night.
   All that another member of this troubled trio can recall about
the decade is Watergate and the Sex Pistols, but then he's not
having such a great time in the 1980s either.
   All three guys have women problems, and playwright Howard Korder
examines their woes in numbing detail. Phil (Steven Goldstein) is a
good-natured schmo, still trying to score with a girl who already
has dumped him. Don (Jordan Lage) is equally dim-witted, but he
manages to find a woman who will put up with his jock mentality.
   The most interesting _ and sarcastic _ character in the play is
Jack (Clark Gregg) who already is married but willing to fool
around. His mean-spiritedness gets a workout during the evening at
the expense of the other characters.
   Some of Jack's comments are funny, but he's really a nasty
fellow. The playwright finally gives him his due in the last scene,
a wedding reception. Between sips of champagne, Jack gets to
confront the emptiness of his own life. By then, the audience
doesn't care. They have had to confront the emptiness of Korder's
play for some 90 minutes.
   The large cast _ some 13 actors, in all _ works hard and
undoubtedly will go on to better things. So will director W.H. Macy
who at least keeps the actors in motion on James Wolk's mobile set.
It's the play that never goes anywhere at all.

<HEAD>Simmons Competent to Stand Trial, Judge Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RUSSELLVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing 16 people,
including 14 members of his own family, is competent to stand
trial, a judge ruled Monday before setting a May 9 trial date.
   Circuit Judge John Patterson accepted a state mental hospital
finding that R. Gene Simmons was competent to aid in his own
defense.
   The State Hospital in Little Rock also found that Simmons, 47,
was sane at the time of the slayings, but that ultimately will be
decided by a jury, defense attorney John Harris noted.
   Simmons was transferred Monday to the Pope County Jail at
Russellville from the State Hospital, where he has undergone a
psychiatric examination since late December.
   On Dec. 28, Simmons surrendered to police in Russellville after
a 45-minute shooting spree in which two former co-workers were
killed and four people were wounded.
   Police then searched Simmons' rural home near Dover where, over
a two-day period, they found 14 bodies _ Simmons' wife, four
daughters, three sons, two spouses of his children, three
grandchilden, and a child who officials say Simmons fathered by his
oldest daughter.
   Dr. Roy Ragsdill, director of the hospital, said the agency
answered yes to both questions asked by the judge: first, whether
Simmons was competent to stand trial and, second, whether he had an
ability to appreciate his actions and conform his behavior within
legal limits.
   But Simmons may still plead innocent by reason of insanity,
Harris said. Simmons could contend either he was unable to tell
right from wrong at the time of the killings or if he was, he was
nonetheless unable to conform his behavior to the law.
   ``They said he was responsible; that means he's not legally
insane,'' prosecutor John Bynum said. ``We thought all along he was
competent to stand trial. ... We're real pleased with the ruling.''
   Harris said he visited Simmons Monday and that he seemed in good
spirits. Harris said more psychiatric tests are needed, and that it
could take a couple of months to get the results back.
   ``Psychiatrists are like lawyers,'' Harris said. ``You get a
different one, you get a different opinion.''
   Simmons has not been arraigned. Lt. Jay Winters of the Pope
County Sheriff's Office said the arraignment may occur Tuesday.
Bynum said it should be soon, but said he didn't know if it would
be Tuesday.

   Two Tamil women ended their 10-day
fast for peace Monday by taking water mixed with salt and sugar,
witnesses said.
   The hunger strikers, Anama David, 58, and Nesamma Vadival, 50,
are members of the Tamil Mothers Front and had vowed not to eat
until Indian troops ceased anti-rebel operations and Tamil
separatist guerrillas agreed to negotiations.
   The witnesses spoke on condition of not being identified.
   There was no indication the women's demands had been met.
   An official at the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in
Colombo said Indian troops had reduced operations in northern and
eastern Sri Lanka, zones where the Tamil minority form a majority.
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
move was not related to appeals from the two women and he insisted
the scaling down did not amount to a cease-fire.
   In New Delhi, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopalaswami
Parthasarthy said operations against the Tamil rebels were
continuing. He said India would agree to talks with the rebels only
after they surrendered their weapons.
   A senior Sri Lankan military official, who also spoke on
condition that he not be identified,, said, however, that Indian
soldiers suspended operations in eastern Batticaloa district in a
bid to save the lives of the women, who were reported in poor
condition before abandoning their fast.
   Officials at the Sri Lankan military headquarters in Colombo
said there was no fighting between Indian troops and Tamil rebels
for the previous 24 hours. The officials, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules, said Indian soldiers were continuing search
operations and patrols, however.
   More than 45,000 Indian soldiers are in Sri Lanka to enforce an
Indian-sponsored peace accord signed last July 29 with the Sri
Lankan government to try to end the rebels' four-year war for an
independent Tamil homeland in the northern zone of this island off
India's southern coast.
   A spokesman for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
largest rebel group, said Sunday the Tigers were prepared for
unconditional talks with the Indian government.
   More than 8,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka since the
Tamil insurrection began. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, comprise
18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They claim the
Sinhalese Buddhist majority discriminate against them.

   Moses Gunn is such a good actor that when he's
speaking, as the blues singer-musician in the new play ``Tapman,''
he makes the character credible.
   However, the play, which opened Sunday at the off-Broadway
Hudson Guild Theater, holds together about as well as a cookie that
has been stepped on.
   The plot focuses on Tapman, who's nearing 50, thinks of himself
as old, ruminates about death and worries because he never has made
a recording.
   Tapman recently has married a chic, well-dressed woman (Kim
Hamilton), after his first wife died. His daughter (Seret Scott)
from his first marriage dislikes the new wife and has a chip on her
shoulder. It's an awkwardly written part awkwardly acted.
   Tapman gets drunk when it's time to go on stage, so the other
three members of his band perform without him and they lose jobs.
He then misses three dates entirely. His musicians, Dean Irby,
Helmar Augustus Cooper and Guy Davis, venerate him but resolve to
work without him.
   The band finally gets a chance to play at the opening of a huge
blues club in Houston, and Tapman rejoins them for the night. But
the play drifts pointlessly, as Tapman begins drinking again and
sends his daughter, who hates blues, on to sing with the band. He
says she is his legacy.
   Author Karen Jones-Meadows has had one other play produced
off-Broadway. Samuel P. Barton directed.

   Police are conducting a criminal
investigation to discover why a judge set bail of only $100 for a
man accused of attempted sexual assault on television actress Tracy
Scoggins, authorities said Monday.
   One of those under investigation is associate municipal
magistrate Rodolfo Romero, police Lt. J.R. Grijalva said.
   Pedro Concepcion Padilla, 35, of El Paso was arrested and
charged with attempted sexual assault after Miss Scoggins, in town
to serve as co-host of the Miss USA pageant, was attacked in a
hotel elevator Thursday night.
   The assailant tore Miss Scoggins' clothes and pushed her into
the back of the elevator. She fought the man off and Padilla was
detained by hotel guests and security before police arrived and
arrested him.
   Romero set $100 bail on the third-degree felony; prosecutors
normally ask for $15,000 bail in similar cases. The decision drew
strong criticism from Miss Scoggins, best known as for her role as
Monica Colby in the television show ``The Colbys.''
   Police are investigating ``the actions of the parties involved
in setting the bond,'' Grijalva said.
   ``We received information over the weekend that there may have
been collusion between the subjects involved,'' he said. ``We may
be looking into some type of misconduct charges.''
   Grijalva would not elaborate on who else is being investigated.
Padilla was represented by lawyer Jose Montes.
   Padilla, who had given police an alias and a false address,
surrendered to police Saturday after District Judge Brunson Moore
issued a new warrant that carried a $100,000 bail. Padilla posted
the required 15 percent of that amount and is free.
   Romero has not returned telephone calls to his office seeking
comment on the case. His home telephone number is unlisted.

   An off-duty policeman shot during an attempted
robbery was remembered Monday as a ``hero in the strictest sense''
at a memorial service for the third Dallas officer slain in six
weeks.
   Hundreds of officers, some weeping and others with their badges
taped in black, filled the Eagle's Nest Cathedral at a memorial
service for Gary D. McCarthy, a former missionary who joined the
force 14 months ago.
   At least 2,200 people attended, police spokesman Ed Spencer said.
   ``He left the foreign mission field but he found another mission
field,'' said the Rev. Clyde Box, pastor of Brook Hollow Baptist
Church in DeSoto where McCarthy, a husband and father of two
children, attended church.
   ``While Gary was a policeman, the streets became his mission
field. Last Friday he gave his life on that field.''
   McCarthy's funeral will be Tuesday in his hometown of Amarillo.
   Police were holding three men in connection with McCarthy's
death Friday, but the district attorney's office said none had been
formally charged by Monday afternoon. The three were arrested on
capital murder warrants.
   One of them, Vincent Edward Cooks, 23, was paroled Aug. 4 from
the Texas Department of Corrections less than a year after he began
serving a five-year sentence for aggravated assault of a police
officer.
   Cooks had originally been charged with attempted capital murder
after apparently shooting at an off-duty police officer outside a
club in Houston.
   Houston Police Sgt. V.W. West said Cooks pleaded no contest to
the reduced aggravated assault charge and began serving his
sentence in December 1986.
   Cooks was arrested Sunday at a Houston apartment where he tried
to escape from a second-story window, said Dallas Police Lt. Ron
Waldrop.
   Another man arrested in the case, Tony Ray Harvey, 23, of
Houston, was paroled Jan. 18 after serving 18 months of a six-year
sentence for aggravated robbery and unauthorized use of a motor
vehicle, police said.
   The third man, Tracy Dewayne Stallworth, 27, of Irving, has no
prior convictions.
   Police would release few details in the case.
   ``We'd rather not get into specifics about what we're going to
allege that any of the participants did because, obviously, this
case is coming back to Dallas for trial and we want to protect as
much of the investigation as we can,'' Waldrop said.
   Harvey was held Monday on $500,000 bond, while Stallworth's bond
was set at $100,000, plus an additional $200 bond for possession of
a controlled substance. Cooks was moved from Houston to Dallas on
Monday but bond was not immediately set, a jail spokeswoman said.
   McCarthy was escorting a grocery store manager back from a bank
visit when a man jumped out of a car to rob the manager, police
said.
   The off-duty officer was shot three times, including once in the
heart, but was able to return fire, police said. He died several
hours later.
   McCarthy's death was the seventh in six shootings involving
police this year. In addition to the three dead police officers,
four civilians have been killed by police.

   Two former Lebanese students of
hostage professor Thomas Sutherland said Monday that the U.S.
government has failed to provide leadership in solving the hostage
problem and Lebanon's civil war.
   Farij El-Awar and Basil Hamdan, who studied under the Colorado
State University professor when he was agriculture dean at American
University in Beirut, spoke at a news conference announcing CSU
activities planned this week to mark Sutherland's 1,000th day of
captivity Friday.
   Both El-Awar and Hamdan are graduate students at CSU.
   Hamdan said Sutherland believed his role as a professor extended
beyond the classroom to helping underdeveloped countries.
   But, Hamdan said, ``the U.S., as a government, is not providing
the leadership it needs to solve the problem. ... They have chosen
to ignore it because of political reasons.''
   Sutherland, 56, was abducted in Beirut on June 9, 1985. He was
working at the Beirut university while on leave from CSU.
   El-Awar said Sutherland ``introduced a new spirit to the
school'' and obtained a new computer for the university in Beirut.
   CSU has planned a number of activities in honor of Sutherland
this week, including the distribution of yellow ribbons Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday; a video with statements by former hostages
Friday; and a ceremony and reception Friday to include appearances
by two of Sutherland's daughters and the Rev. Lawrence Martin
Jenco, a former Beirut hostage held captive with Sutherland.
   CSU President Philip Austin has proclaimed Thursday as ``Tom
Sutherland Awareness Day'' on campus.
   Hamdan said he thinks the Reagan administration is too afraid of
risking small setbacks in the Middle East to begin the complex
strategy required to solve the region's problems.
   ``There is no easy answer to the Lebanese problem. It would be
really childish to say the U.S. could solve the problem tomorrow
... but the government has to have some large vision. If it built
one thing at a time, it would come to a solution,'' Hamdan said.

   A man armed with a toy gun tried to rob a
bus but was overpowered by a passenger who pushed him out the door
and held him on the ground until police arrived, officials said
Monday.
   The suspect, Leon Reddick, 32, of Camden, was charged with
robbery following the attempted holdup Sunday, said Camden Police
Lt. Thomas Long. He was in critical but stable condition at Cooper
University Medical Center with a head injury, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Long said a man boarded a New Jersey Transit bus, showed a gun
and demanded money from the bus driver, Jeannette Rodriguez.
   ``She hit the brakes, he fell forward,'' Long said.
   The hapless robber first hit his head on the windshield when he
fell. Then passenger William Bonet approached, Long said.
   ``He grabbed Reddick and struck him in the head several times
with the gun, which turned out to be plastic and broke,'' Long
said. The man fell out of the bus when the door opened and struck
his head on the ground, Long said.
   Bonet, whose age and address were not disclosed, then held the
man on the ground until police arrived, Long said.
   No charges were filed against Bonet.
   ``We told him, `Atta boy,''' Long said.

<HEAD>Court Says Voting Rights Act Also Applies To Judicial Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUSTIN WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Monday revived a
lawsuit aimed at creating a black-majority district for the
election of Louisiana Supreme Court justices.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 1965
federal Voting Rights Act applies to judicial elections as well as
to elections of legislators and executives. The decision reversed a
lower court ruling in May that had dismissed the suit.
   ``Where racial discrimination exists, it is not confined to
elections for legislative and executive officials; in such
instance, it extends throughout the entire electoral spectrum,''
the appeals court said in its 23-page opinion that sent the suit
back to the district court for trial.
   Activist Ronald Chisom filed the suit to make New Orleans, with
its majority-black population and voter registration, a separate
district for the election of justices.
   The seven justices on the Louisiana Supreme Court are elected
from six judicial districts _ one each from five of the districts
and two from the First District, made up of Orleans, St. Bernard,
Plaquemines and Jefferson parishes.
   Chisom's suit seeks to have Orleans Parish split off into one
district, with the other three parishes becoming a separate
district.
   ``It is particularly significant that no black person has ever
been elected to the Louisiana Supreme Court, either from the First
Supreme Court District or from any one of the other five judicial
districts,'' the appeals court said.
   In dismissing the suit in May, the U.S. District Court judge in
New Orleans had ruled that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of
1965 does not apply to judicial elections. Section 2 makes it
illegal to set up or maintain voting qualifications that might
exclude voters on the basis of race, creed or color.
   The lower court judge had ruled that the section covered elected
representatives, and said judges were not representatives.
   But the appeals court rejected that interpretation.
   ``The right to vote, the right to an effective voice in our
society, cannot be impaired on the basis of race in any instance
wherein the will of the majority is expressed by popular vote,''
the court said.

   President Reagan plans no new economic
sanctions against Panama, even though he has determined that Panama
has not been cooperating in curbing drug trafficking to the United
States, a U.S. official said Monday.
   The official said that penalties to be announced on Tuesday have
already been applied against Panama and thus will have no
additional impact on that country.
   A 1986 U.S. law decreed that countries which do not take steps
to halt drug trafficking to the United States are no longer
eligible for U.S. aid and are not entitled to U.S. support for
their assistance requests to international lending institutions.
   Tuesday is the deadline for certifying that foreign countries
have complied in combating drug trafficking. Countries which are
``decertified'' are subject to the penalties.
   The source, who asked not to be identified, noted that U.S.
economic and military aid to Panama was cut off last year and that
the United States has not backed Panama's requests in the lending
institutions because its repayments are in arrears.
   The institutions involved are the World Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the official
said.
   Under Reagan's finding, Mexico was ``certified'' as cooperating
in drug enforcement efforts, the official said. CBS News and The
Washington Post reported that Colombia was also likely to be
certified as cooperating in drug enforcement efforts.
   The official said government lawyers are studying the
possibility of excluding Panamanian participation from a system of
tariff preferences the United States accords to most Third World
countries.
   In addition, the lawyers are reviewing Panamanian membership in
the Caribbean Basin Initiative, under which nations from that
region are given duty-free access on most products to U.S. markets.
   According to the official, Panama's record on drug enforcement
may be such that it cannot legally participate in either program
based on membership requirements.
   On Feb. 5, Panama's military strong man, Manuel Antonio Noriega,
was indicted by two federal grand juries on charges that he is a
major figure in an international drug smuggling conspiracy.
   Colombian drug traffickers were alleged to have paid Noriega
more than $5 million in return for permission to use Panamanian
airstrips to fly cocaine to the United States.
   The sanctions decision comes at a time when the administration
is seeking to force Noriega out as commander of Panama's Defense
Forces, in which he has dominated Panama's political life.
   Late last week, Noriega ignored an order by President Eric
Arturo Delvalle that he step down as defense chief and moved
quickly to depose Devalle with the help of allies in the National
Assembly.
   Delvalle, calling his ouster illegal, has said he still
considers himself Panama's president, a position supported by the
Reagan administration.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a leader of the
anti-Noriega forces in Congress, introduced a resolution asking the
Reagan administration to consider imposing economic sanctions
against Panama, including a trade embargo. An official said the
administraion is not contemplating any such action.
   The resolution also asks that the United States cut off all
contacts with Noriega because he is ``no longer the lawful
commander'' of the Defense Forces.
   In a brief speech on the Senate floor, Kennedy said that Noriega
``is a threat to peace and security in the region.''
   ``When a drug trafficker gets control over the governmental
powers of a nation, it's a threat to other nations,'' Kennedy said.

   Major issues were unresolved Monday just
hours before the expiration of a contract between the 9,000-member
Writers Guild of America and movie and television producers.
   Negotiations between the two sides were expected to continue
until early Tuesday, and union officials declined to say what they
would recommend to members until after the producers' final offer
was on the bargaining table. The union's contract was to expire at
midnight, but the earliest a strike could begin is Thursday,
officials said.
   ``But it doesn't look optimistic,'' said Cheryl Rhoden,
spokeswoman for the WGA, which represents about 6,500 writers on
the West Coast and 2,500 on the East Coast.
   Herb Steinberg, spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers, agreed, saying, ``The situation is not good.''
   West Coast union members are to vote Tuesday evening on whether
to accept what emerges from the latest round of talks or reject it
and go on strike. East Coast members vote Wednesday, and results of
the votes aren't expected to be available until midday Wednesday.
The walkout could come as early as Thursday, Ms. Rhoden said.
   A strike by writers would be felt first by daily daytime
programs and talk shows that go through many scripts, Ms. Rhoden
said. It would take longer for a walkout to affect shows that need
fewer scripts and have a longer lead time.
   In what he said would be the final public statement before
meeting with the membership on both coasts, the guild's chief
negotiator said Monday evening that the WGA will stay at the
bargaining table as long as necessary.
   ``Perhaps something will break in the next 12 hours or so,''
said Brian Walton, also the executive director of Writer's Guild
West. ``At the moment, the companies and the networks have still
declined to meet us in finding reality-based solutions to our
concerns in many areas.''
   He accused the alliance and the networks of ``continuing to
promulgate press releases with doomsday statistics about how the
film and broadcast industries are in disastrous shape.''
   The writers union, which has a reputation as one of Hollywood's
most militant, last went on strike three years ago. That walkout
lasted for two weeks before writers voted to accept a package
offering them essentially the same terms as the one they had
earlier rejected.
   The median annual income for writers is $40,000 a year, but
about half of the WGA's members are unemployed at any given time,
Ms. Rhoden said.
   Main issues separating the two sides are disputes over creative
rights, residuals from foreign markets and residuals for one-hour
programs.
   On the creative-rights issue, the union wants original writers
to have the power to do the first rewrite of any material, plus the
right to be on the set when the program is being produced.
   ``Sometimes,'' Ms. Rhoden complained, ``original writers aren't
even notified when rewrites are being done.''
   However, Steinberg said such issues are appropriately handled in
individual negotiations when writers agree to terms on which they
will sell their work, not in a national contract.

   The U.S. economy has shrugged off the worst
effects of the October stock market collapse and should be able to
escape a recession this election year, economists for top U.S.
corporations predicted today.
   The National Association of Business Economists said optimism
among its members has risen appreciably since the last survey
conducted in the month following the Oct. 19 plunge in stock prices.
   In November, more than half of the business economists were
predicting a recession would begin before the end of 1988, an
outlook that could have spelled bad news for Republican hopes of
holding onto the White House.

   Since the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip began,
Israeli viewers only once saw troops beat protesters and rarely see

   On the other hand, the overall nutrient levels in the two

life, say city planners from an international architecture
conference.
   ``You've got to face reality. They're gone,'' said Tony McGann,
whose hometown of Liverpool, England, lived through the decline of
dockyard industries. ``If you wait for the steel industry to come
back, you'll wait forever.''
   The planning team, 12 Americans and five Britons, toured
Monongahela Valley communities whose economies have been gutted by
the decline of steelmaking. They addressed about 100 Mon Valley
residents Saturday in Homestead and released a report Monday
suggesting how the once-thriving steel centers of Homestead,
Duquesne and McKeesport could recover.

   Town Meeting Day is as much a symbol of
Vermont as the maple sap that flows soon after, but this year's
town meetings find Vermonters fearful of their state's future
because farms are going out of business and open land is sprouting
vacation homes.
   ``We are losing our farms and we are losing rural Vermont at an
unbelievable rate,'' says Jack Starr, a dairy farmer from Troy.
   The changing Vermont is evident everywhere:

   Protestant fundamentalism is
growing rapidly in this predominantly Roman Catholic nation, and
American missionary Don Exley's yellow and white revival tent
symbolizes the movement.
   One night last week, 63 people crossed a muddy field in a hard
rain to hear Exley, who represents the Assemblies of God, preach a
spirited sermon in Spanish. He told them God would save their souls
if they prayed hard enough and sang loud enough.
   Before the two-hour revival ended in the tent in suburban
Martinez, many of the men, women and children, had ``spoken in
tongues'' and eight bowed before Exley to be saved. Exley said his
revival attract crowds of up to 200 people.

   Michael Caine has just made his eighth film in
three years and has a TV miniseries set to roll, but the
Oscar-winning star of ``Sherlock and Me'' says he still worries
about being out of work.
   ``You feel uneasy if you haven't got something to do,'' Caine
said in an interview in North London's Camden Town, where the $8.5
million-movie was concluding its nine-week shoot.
   ``People say I work all the time, but I don't. What they
(distributors) do is always put the bloody things out at the same
time.''
   The actor's on-screen good cheer has been one of the few
constants in the ever-changing Hollywood scene.
   Last year, he played Sally Field's love interest in
``Surrender'' and a British intelligence agent in ``The Fourth
Protocol.'' He starred in films as quintessentially American as
``Jaws IV _ The Revenge,'' and as quintessentially English as ``The
Whistle Blower,'' a political thriller.
   In 1986 he was a British diplomat romantically linked with call
girl Sigourney Weaver in ``Half Moon Street,'' and had vivid
supporting roles in ``Sweet Liberty'' and ``Mona Lisa.''
   Then, too, there was his Academy Award last year for best
supporting actor for his performance in ``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
The erstwhile Cockney, who was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in
1933, the son of a porter at Billingsgate fish market in London,
had integrated himself into the bittersweet world of Woody Allen's
Manhattan neurotics.
   ``I'd known Woody for years, and I knew New York so well,'' said
Caine. ``I don't have a voice which is posh British, anyway.
   ``My attitude is that I'm more like an American, coming from a
working-class background. Lots of Americans think I'm Australian,
or something like that _ Crocodile Dundee's father.''
   Caine's previous Oscar nominations were for ``Alfie'' in 1966,
``Sleuth'' in 1972 and ``Educating Rita'' in 1983.
   In his new film, he impersonates that celebrated sleuth,
Sherlock Holmes. Caine is a boozing, down-on-his-luck actor who is
hired by Dr. Watson to play the famed fictional detective to prove
him real.
   ``I get to play two parts and a particular hero of mine, which I
like, because I've always been a great fan of Holmes,'' he said.
   ``We have the pipe, the magnifying glass, everything,'' said
Caine, referring to the traditional Holmes accoutrements. ``It's a
chance to play a hero who I'm not really right for and to do it in
an entirely different way, as a comedy.''
   The film, due out in the fall from Orion Pictures, co-stars
Oscar winner Ben Kingsley (``Gandhi'') as Dr. Watson, who is forced
by public demand to find a real-life Holmes to match the figure he
has been writing about in a magazine.
   Caine compared his creation to the part of the inimitable
Inspector Clouzot, created by the late Peter Sellers in the popular
Pink Panther series. ``Peter would have laughed at some of the
physical humor I do. The character is such a putz,'' Caine said.
``I'm having fun; I'll tell you that.''
   On March 14, Caine moves on to his next assignment: a CBS
miniseries, ``Jack the Ripper,'' which marks his first TV work
since he played Horatio to Christopher Plummer's Hamlet in a 1966
production of Shakespeare's tragedy.
   Caine will play the fictitious Inspector Frederick Abberline of
Scotland Yard in the $5 million show.
   Said to be based on confidential police and government files,
the show will be aired in the autumn to coincide with the 100th
anniversary of the notorious mass murderer, who terrorized
Victorian London in the late 1880s.
   Caine said he's made a conscious effort to vary his parts and
his performances. ``It gives you cachet as someone who can play
anything,'' he said.
   ``I've been a leading actor, not a movie star who comes on and
does the Michael Caine personality performance like a Cary Grant or
a John Wayne, although I admire both of them very much.''
   His salary, he joked, reflected this attitude: ``I know a lot of
actors like Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, who don't do pictures
for years, but they get $6 million, $7 million, $15 million a
picture.''
   ``I don't. I get $1.98 and a bollocking (a reprimand) for being
late on Monday morning,'' he joked. Caine is one of the few British
actors who reportedly commands around $1 million a movie.
   Caine said the British had reacted oddly to his decision in June
1986 to return to his native country with his wife, the Indian
model Shakira Baksh, and their 14-year-old daughter, Natasha, after
living for nine years in Los Angeles.
   ``People here treat me as if I'd just come back from some
fearsome jungle and survived,'' he said. ``Americans are just like
we are, except they work harder _ that's what frightens the
British. You've got to get up at 8 o'clock Monday morning and go
out and do something; you can't just sit there.''
   Caine is glad to be home. He divides his time between an
apartment in London's elegant Knightsbridge and a 15th-century
manor house in rural Oxfordshire northwest of the capital city.
   As for the sometimes brutal English class system, Caine said
it's no problem.
   ``Years ago, all the people who wouldn't have spoken to me are
now people I wouldn't want to speak to because they're so boring,''
he said.
   ``I've gone beyond class. I go with anybody, from the queen
down.''

   Assuming Johnny can read, the question remains:
What should he read?
   The Times of London and The Daily Telegraph have tried to answer
the question with lists of classics recommended for children from 3
to 18. Apart from a few books, notably J.D. Salinger's ``The
Catcher in the Rye'' and the basic works for children, the lists
had little in common.
   The papers revealed a powerful pro-British bias, with David
Holloway, one of the conservative Telegraph's panel of experts,
commenting: ``American universities tend to supply their students
with reading lists containing thousands of titles. This is not only
daunting but counterproductive.''
   So The Telegraph suggested the 100 books every youngster who has
gone to school ought to have read by the time he or she finishes.
The Times' panel of teachers, writers and critics came up with 50
titles.
   The Times went by age group and stuck to fiction, while The
Telegraph cast a wider net: modern fiction, classics, translations,
poetry, drama and entertainment.
   The two papers found the most agreement on books for young
children, with The Times recommending, among others, the ``Winnie
the Pooh'' stories, Rudyard Kipling's ``Just So Stories,''
``Charlotte's Web'' by E.B. White and Maurice Sendak's ``Where the
Wild Things Are.''
   The Telegraph, altogether weightier in its approach, opened with
a category called cornerstones that included the Bible, Homer's
``Iliad,'' Horace's ``Odes,'' Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales'' and all of Shakespeare's plays.
   ``Don Quixote,'' by Miguel de Cervantes, John Milton's
``Paradise Lost,'' Boswell's ``The Life of Samuel Johnson and
Charles Darwin's ``The Origin of Species'' rounded out the list.
   However, against such high-brow fare as Bertrand Russell's
``History of Western Philosophy,'' the Telegraph also suggested an
entertainment list that ranged from Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar
Allan Poe to ``The Big Sleep'' by Raymond Chandler and Agatha
Christie's ``The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.''
   Its children's category included one American work, Mark Twain's
``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Many of the others in the
category were the same as chosen by The Times.
   In its 12-18 category The Times ignored Shakespeare and the
ancients but suggested Twain's ``Huckleberry Finn,'' George
Orwell's ``1984,'' ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' ``Jane Eyre'' by
Charlotte Bronte and ``Pride and Prejudice'' by Jane Austen.
   There was Robert Louis Stevenson's ``Treasure Island'' alongside
``The Lord of the Flies,'' William Golding's frightening tale of
power-corrupted children. Salinger's ``Catcher in the Rye'' rubbed
shoulders with ``Emil and the Detectives'' by Erich Kastner.
   The Telegraph recommended 13 translations, among them Boris
Pasternak's ``Dr. Zhivago,'' Gustave Flaubert's ``Madame Bovary,''
``The Three Musketeers'' by Alexandre Dumas, ``The Plague'' by
Albert Camus, Franz Kafka's ``Metamorphosis'' and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.''
   ``War and Peace'' didn't make the list but ``Anna Karenina'' did.
   The Telegraph's longer list found more room for American works,
mentioning F. Scott FitzGerald's ``The Great Gatsby,'' Margaret
Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' Ernest Hemingway's ``A Farewell
to Arms,'' John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and Saul
Bellow's ``The Adventures of Augie March.''
   Vladimir Nabokov's erotic masterpiece ``Lolita'' also was
recommended.
   Poets on the Telegraph list included John Keats, William
Wordsworth, Samuel T. Coleridge, Lord Byron, Alfred Tennyson, T.S.
Eliot, W.H. Auden, Philip Larkin and Charles Baudelaire, plus ``The
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.''
   Its recommended plays were Moliere's ``Tartuffe,'' William
Congreve's ``Love for Love,'' Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ``The
School for Scandal,'' Oscar Wilde's ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' Henrik Ibsen's ``The Master Builder,'' Anton Chekhov's
``The Cherry Orchard,'' George Bernard Shaw's ``Saint Joan'' and
Samuel Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot.''
   But as the Telegraph's Holloway acknowledged in his
introduction: ``It would be an ideal child who had read the lot,
and a pretty remarkable one who could score more than 50 percent.
Certainly, none ... could, hand on heart, say that he or she had
read the whole list before leaving school.''

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sex is out in Swaziland. ``Dallas'' is
tops in Zimbabwe. But ``Hill Street Blues'' is Africa's overall
television favorite.
   That's how foreign TV programs rate among the 5 percent of
Africa's 550 million people who regularly watch the tube, according
to the people who buy the shows.
   Program chiefs from across the continent gathered recently in
Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, for the first buyers' convention for
Africa's mostly state-owned TV stations.
   ``We would not want to show anything that ridicules or
criticizes socialism or allows our people to be influenced by the
cultural dominance of others,'' said Nebiyu Eyassu, head of
state-owned Ethiopian television.
   African stations face wide political censorship and the constant
dilemma whether imported shows are likely to offend traditional
customs or propagate Western values that African bureaucracies
publicly disavow.
   Nebiyu sees television as a powerful propaganda medium when
examining foreign offerings for viewers of the 70,000 television
sets in his country of 42 million people.
   Materialism depicted in many Western shows was confusing to
Ethiopian viewers, he said as program chiefs settled into armchairs
to watch excerpts from 1,000 hours of shows.
   The first preview of its kind in Africa brought the West's most
popular programs to a continent where local producers lack money
and expertise to make their own. Imported programming costs between
$100 and $200 an hour _ up to 20 times cheaper than local
production costs.
   Before the convention, individual buyers flew to such places as
London and New York to decide what they wanted for their screens at
home.
   Market research in Zimbabwe shows ``Dallas'' has the highest
viewership of any program screened in this southern African nation.
More than 510,000 people watch it each Sunday after the evening
news.
   Wendy Layzell, program buyer for state-owned Zimbabwe
Television, attributed the popularity of ``Dallas'' to escapism.
   ``It shows a lifestyle that no one will ever have. It is
fast-moving and essentially non-political,'' she said.
   Despite repeated government calls for more local and culturally
relevant programming, foreign shows account for more than 70
percent of the station's airtime.
   ZTV is strapped for cash and depends on commercials, license
fees and a hefty government subsidy.
   Nigerian buyer Oluyole Fadola said only 5 percent of his West
African nation's 100 million people own television sets, although
public viewing centers are being set up in isolated areas.
   ``When you take TV to the people you have to be particularly
selective,'' Fadola said.
   Better educated urban dwellers are less likely to come under the
spell of television than the rural poor, he said.
   As program coordinator at Nigeria's Federal Television
Authority, he is concerned by explicit sex and the level of
violence in Western TV.
   ``We have had a wave of armed robberies at home and I believe TV
stimulates armed robbery and propagates crime,'' Fadola said.
   In Swaziland, sex on screen is taboo because of cultural taboos
common in southern Africa.
   ``We don't like nudity at all. We shy away from it,'' said
Wellington Sukati, head of programming at the Swaziland television
and Broadcasting Corp.
   ``You may breastfeed in public, but the exploitation of nudity
on the screen is out.''
   But official Swazi prudery does not extend to screens in
nightclubs frequented by tourists, many from South Africa, which
brazenly feature explicit soft pornography.
   Sukati said he was buying about 500 hours of programs.
   Alexandera Taylor, sales director of the British-based
distribution company that staged the Harare convention, said
programs popular among African buyers included a British series
based on Jeffrey Archer's novel ``First Among Equals,'' ``The Bob
Newhart Show,'' ``St. Elsewhere'' and a dramatization of last
year's superpower summit in Reykjavik, Iceland.
   Taylor said her company, African and Caribbean Program Services,
could not estimate the value of business transacted in Harare, nor
rule out surprises in forthcoming bookings.
   In 1987, ``Hill Street Blues'' was a best seller in Africa. But
Kenya, one of the West's staunchest allies in Africa, rejected it.
   ``They didn't like the negative way police were portrayed,''
Taylor said.

   Thais have normally reacted to
corruption with a fatalistic shrug, but a racket involving false
royal decorations has raised a public outcry and spurred the
government into action.
   Some call this a hopeful sign in battling what has been an
endemic problem.
   The racket had allowed hundreds of people to obtain prestigious
royal decorations by making phony donations to charities. The web
of corruption, according to police, involves officials of the
Cabinet and the Education Ministry, as well as a now defrocked
Buddhist monk, Deputy Abbot Pasuk Kaopong.
   Police say that nearly 20 people have been detained, some on
suspicion of forging the signature of King Bhumibol Adulyadej,
regarded by many Thais as a near divinity. One senior civil servant
in the Cabinet secretariat killed himself after being called in for
questioning.
   The result is that even bona fide royal decorations, once
proudly worn at every opportunity, are now viewed with some
cynicism.
   So is the government's fortnightly lottery. Late last year, 15
senior officials were arrested on charges of rigging the lottery
wheels via radio-controlled devices.
   From Forestry Department officials who illegally chop down trees
to police officers smuggling refugees, ``corruption'' _ the English
word is frequently used _ has become a daily staple of local
newspapers and private conversation.
   Amnouy Vongvichian, who heads the Commission of Counter
Corruption, said in an interview his agency investigated 3,418
civil-service corruption cases last year and found about 10 percent
of the suspects guilty.
   Some Thais believe corruption stems from greed spawned by the
rapid destruction of traditional Thai values. Others believe
corruption may well be on the decline in Thailand, but is merely
getting greater exposure through a freer press and the efforts of
Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, who took office in 1980 and
recently stepped up his anti-corruption drive.
   However, Surin Pitsuwan, a member of Parliament, says Prem has
yet to move against powerful figures, including allegedly corrupt
senior officers in the armed forces.
   ``There is a Thai proverb which says: `You put fear into the
monkeys by slaughtering the chickens,' '' Surin said in an
interview. ``The prime minister may only be able to go so far, but
he is saying: `We should not be fatalistic about corruption. Hey
no, I'll show you something can be done.' ''
   Prem is a staunch royalist and it is said he was particularly
incensed by disclosures that for 150,000 baht ($6,000) an
application for a royal decoration could be processed _ complete
with fake documents citing large donations to charity _ all the way
to his own Cabinet.
   Also recently exposed was a massive racket involving officials
and police in Trat province near the Cambodian border smuggling in
Vietnamese ``boat people,'' running guns and engaging in illegal
trade with what is an enemy nation. The Trat governor has resigned
and six police officers have been transferred as the investigation
continues.
   ``Over the last five to 10 years morality has lost its force. It
has been replaced by coveted status symbols,'' says Dr. Chira
Hongladarom, vice rector of Bangkok's Thammasat University. ``What
reward does an honest person get in this society?''
   But Chira sees some hopeful signs. He and other analysts say
corrupt officials must now move more cautiously and employ more
subtle techniques than in the past.
   Arrayed against the so-called ``influential people'' are a few
apparently incorruptible officials, politicians and military men
who have won wide admiration.
   One is Chamlong Srimuang, the mayor of Bangkok, who donates his
salary to charity, sleeps on the floor at home and wears simple
clothing.
   The hero in the Trat case is a low-ranking official named
Surachet Supathit. According to newspaper accounts, he tried vainly
to expose illegal activities to his superiors and refused a large
bribe offered by ``influential people'' who wanted him to register
six Vietnamese refugees as Thai nationals.
   Shortly thereafter, two men entered his house, held his wife at
gunpoint and shot him to death.

<HEAD>Gardening Season Nearly at Hand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With February's cold and snow past, gardeners
are turning their thoughts to home-grown vegetables. While it may
not be time to plant yet in most areas, some projects can be
started right away.
   ``Right now, the first thing they ought to do is decide what to
grow and order the seeds,'' says Charles A. McClurg, a vegetable
specialist with the University of Maryland.
   While family preferences dictate most decisions, ``many people
like to grow something new they've never tried,'' he said.
   ``There are always new varieties coming out. Ones that have
received the All-American Selection Award are those best adapted,
and most commercial seed companies have them in their catalogs,''
he said. ``Most people have better success with hybrids, even
though they cost more.''
   Besides armchair gardening with catalogs, folks anxious to get
to work can start soil preparation in their gardens as soon as the
ground is dry enough. Many still have plant supports and trellises
in place, and this is the time to clean up and get the ground ready.
   About six weeks before the last frost is a good time to start
seedlings indoors, McClurg says, and cold weather vegetables like
broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower can be started even sooner.
   ``Any prepared starting mix with a combination of perlite and
vermiculite plus peat moss is better than soil for starting
seedlings,'' McClurg said. ``You may need supplemental fertilizer a
few weeks after plants start to grow.''
   ``The biggest problem we have with people is light. They tend
not to have adequate light in the house for transplants,'' he added.
   ``Give the transplants full sun from the time that the seeds
emerge. If you don't have a sunny window available, provide
supplemental lighting with a grow lamp.''
   Avoid overwatering by allowing the soil surface to dry out
between waterings.
   A temperature of 70 degrees to 75 degrees is best for
germination and growth.
   A cold frame can be useful, McClurg said, but you have to be
careful not to let it get too hot on a sunny day. And make sure the
plants are not subjected to freezing temperatures.
   Container gardening is losing its popularity somewhat, he noted,
but is ``still an excellent way to grow a few things for people
without space. We suggest they make the containers as large as
practical. They need adequate drainage, and should try to select
plant types that are fairly small,'' he said.
   Cool-season crops that can go in quite early include such
vegetables as asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage,
cauliflower, celery, chives, endive, garlic, horseradish, rhubarb,
kale, leek, lettuce, onions, garlic, parsley, parsnips, peas,
potatoes, radishes, shallots, spinach and turnips.
   Cabbage and head lettuce are best handled as transplants,
McClurg says, but never try to transplant peas.
   Peas and radishes are very good short season crops, and should
be seeded in successive groups to help assure a steady crop. Later
the same garden space can be used for a late season item.

<TEXT>
   The first-run situation comedy may have
peaked in the television syndication market, and ``reality''
programming _ talk and information shows _ seems to be the trend
for the fall.
   The National Association of Television Program Executives has
just concluded its 25th-anniversary convention in Houston, and a
number of the new programs being offered are reality based, such as
``USA Today,'' a news show designed to be a TV version of the
newspaper.
   An estimated 8,000 people attended the five-day meeting at the
George R. Brown Convention Center. The convention is the major
arena for producers to show off their new programs and for station
program executives to pick and choose syndicated shows for the next
television season.
   Altogether, between 300 and 400 shows are being offered to the
program executives. The shows include reruns of network shows and
packages of motion pictures.
   ``What I see is a movement toward reality programming,'' A.
Philip Corvo, executive director of NATPE said in an interview
before leaving for the convention. ``It seems to be bigger than any
move in that direction we've had in the past.''
   Other ``reality'' shows being offered include ``Group One
Medical,'' from MGM, ``Public People, Private Lives,'' from Orbis
Communications, ``The Howard Cosell Show,'' from Casablanca, and
``On Trial,'' from Republic. ``USA Today'' is from GTG
Entertainment.
   ``I think this trend will pick up speed if any of these shows
are successful,'' said Corvo. ``Another trend I see is that some
shows are leaning toward horror and science fiction.''
   Lorimar has ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' and MCA has ``The
Munsters,'' a revival of the horror spoof from the 1960s. Already o
the market are Paramount's ``Star Trek'' and ``Friday the 13th.''
Another new show will be Paramount's `War of the Worlds,'' based on
the novel by H.G. Wells and the award-winning 1953 movie by George
Pal.
   MGM has 30 new episodes of ``The Twilight Zone,'' in addition to
64 vintage shows from the Rod Serling classic series.
   By far the most successful of the distributors is King World,
which has ``Wheel of Fortune,'' ``Jeopardy'' and ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show.''
   ``There doesn't seem to be a dent in the popularity of those
shows,'' said Corvo. ``Stations are buying them three or four years
in advance. In the old days you never bought a game show more than
a year in advance. Most didn't last that long.
   ``The popularity of the original situation comedies has leveled
off and may even be going into a decline. `The Munsters' is the
only new comedy show. Stations tried a checkerboard arrangement
with the comedies, with a different show each night, but they seem
to be getting away from that. I think they'll go back to stripping
game and reality shows (running them each night of the week). I
think that's what Grant Tinker's looking for with `USA Today.'''
   That doesn't mean reruns of network comedies aren't selling,
however.
   ``Bill Cosby is going into syndication in 1988 or '89 with the
highest-priced off-network show in the history of television,''
said Corvo. ```Who's the Boss?' is also going into syndication and
that is getting some very high prices. In fact, the off-network
stuff is so expensive that it's helping the sale of first-run
syndicated shows. It's making them more attractive economically.''
   Corvo said he also sees renewed interest in hourlong,
off-network shows, which have not done well in syndicated sales in
recent years.
   ``The USA Network has picked up `Miami Vice' and `Murder, She
Wrote,''' he said. ``This is a cable network, but it programs just
like an independent station and sells commercial time. It's just
like a superstation.''

<BYLINE>Will Someone Settle This Issue?
^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wherever it exists, rent control is an issue
that splits public opinion, penetrating deep beneath individuals'
mere political instincts into their philosophical marrow.
   It is viewed as the most effective protection the poor have
against greedy landlords. It is seen by others as a violation of
private property rights by governments that should,
constitutionally, be protecting them.
   The issue attracts as much emotion as reason. In every city
where it exists, it is defended as needed to protect the poor _ and
simultaenously damned as the cause of inferior housing, and too
little housing, for the poor.
   Never dormant, the issue has been heated to a boil again by a
Feb. 24 Supreme Court ruling that seems to reaffirm a
municipality's right to consider a tenant's finances before
allowing or disallowing a rent increase.
   In the specific case, Pennel v. City of San Jose, Calif., the
court upheld the constitutionality of an ordinance in which a city
official would deem whether or not a tenant could afford an
increase of more than 8 percent.
   Under the ordinance, if the city hearing officer so ruled, the
allowable rent increase could be rolled back to 5 percent, plus an
amount needed for improvements, maintenance and rehabilitation.
   Landlords boiled over, since most have for years contended that
their industry has been singled out for exceptional treatment, that
treatment being an unconstitutional taking of private property _
that is, theirs.
   But, as usual, even the institution of the Surpeme Court
couldn't deal with the issue without splitting sharply. Chief
Justice William Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, but Justice
Antonin Scalia wrote a scathing critique.
   Said Rehnquist: ``We have long recognized that a legitimate and
rational goal of price or rate regulation is the protection of
consumer welfare.'' But in Scalia's view, such regulation permits
unfair transfers of wealth.
   Moreover, said Scalia, these wealth transfers have added
dimensions that make them cause for additional concern.
   They are, for instance, relatively invisible, he said. They have
``relative immunity from normal democratic processes.'' And as a
consequence, they allow government to subsidize a social group
``off budget.''
   The National Association of Realtors filed a brief that added a
practical dimension. Rent control, it said, it inherently
irrational, since it exacerbates rather than relieves a shortage of
affordable housing.
   The NAR can support its contentions with independent studies; it
is no secret to anyone familiar with rent control that it scares
apartment builders away and can cause landlords to abandon
properties.
   Those who defend rent control contend that theirs is the best
way since, as they see it, those members of society who need
protection are granted it, while landlord interests are secured by
regular and fair, albeit limited, increases.
   But William North, NAR executive vice president, states that the
court has ``created the ultimate oxymoron: compulsory charity.''
Rental hardship cases, he argues, are a responsibility of the
community, not just of landlords.

<HEAD>Danny the Red of 1960s Fame is More Moderate These Days</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Danny the Red, leader of student
revolts in France and West Germany in the 1960s, jokingly says he
was never quite as leftist as his nickname implied.
   ``They only meant my hair color,'' said Daniel Cohn-Bendit,
referring to his rust-colored hair during an interview in his
Frankfurt office. ``I've always been an anti-Communist, more of one
than Reagan.''
   He's now 42 years old and an active member of West Germany's
anti-establishment, environmentalist Greens Party _ the moderate
wing _ and publishes a left-leaning regional magazine in Frankfurt.
   He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Frankfurt in 1986 in a purely
symbolic move, he said. But he is considering seriously running for
Frankfurt's city council next year.
   Cohn-Bendit has also become an author. A collection of
interviews with other 1960s activists around the world was
published in West Germany in September.
   American activists featured in the book include Jerry Rubin and
Abbie Hoffmann, leading Yippies of the era, and the Black Panther
activist, Bobby Seale.
   The book, ``We Loved It So, The Revolution,'' portrays Rubin as
a Yippie-turned-Yuppie and Seale as hoping for commercial success
as a cookbook author.
   His book isn't the only look back: West Germany's news media
have carried numerous articles on the tumultuous times of 1968.
   Cohn-Bendit said that he has basically remained true to many
views he had 20 years ago.
   ``I believe that I can still legitimize everything I do from my
standpoint in 1968,'' Cohn-Bendit said.
   As a moderate member of the Greens, Cohn-Bendit favors forming
coalitions with West Germany's liberal Social Democratic Party,
which the Greens' radical wing opposes. Nor does Cohn-Bendit favor
a West German withdrawal from NATO, as some of the radicals do.
   ``West German militarization is more dangerous on its own than
embedded in a larger context,'' he said. ``That's the lesson of
World War II.''
   Cohn-Bendit has always been a figure who defied traditional
national, political, and religious labels. He was born in
Montauban, France, on April 4, 1945, the son of German Jews who
fled Hitler's persecution in the 1930s.
   His parents moved to West Germany when Cohn-Bendit was 13. In
1961 Cohn-Bendit became a West German citizen.
   ``I did it only for pragmatical reasons,'' he said. ``I didn't
want to serve in the military.''
   Jews whose parents or siblings were persecuted under the Nazis
are by West German law exempted from the country's mandatory
military service.
   Cohn-Bendit, who speaks French and German fluently, said he
doesn't assign his national identify to either country. As a French
citizen, he would have been subject to the military draft in France.
   ``I'm just me. I'm not German or French,'' he added. ``I don't
need a national definition.''
   Cohn-Bendit's views have led to occasional flaps with
Frankfurt's Jewish community. In a highly publicized dispute in
1985 he publicly supported the city playhouse in presenting a play
by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, which many Jews wanted banned as
anti-Semitic.
   In the Feb. 18 issue of his magazine ``Pflasterstrand,''
Cohn-Bendit described himself as a ``convinced anti-Zionist.''
   In the interview, he said he favored the existence of Israel but
also a separate Palestinian state and ``a limitation of Zionism.''
   Tenants' housing rights and terrorist amnesty are among other
issues that have made Cohn-Bendit a household name.
   But the era that propelled the activist to world fame, the
1960s, is a topic Cohn-Bendit said he no longer wants to talk a lot
about.
   In his book, originally published in France, he writes that
people have used him ``like a machine that turns back time.''
   Cohn-Bendit captured world attention as a university student in
France, at a time when youth protests were rocking the globe.
   He was a spokesman for students whose demands included greater
social equality and an end to war, in Vietnam and elsewhere. Danny
the Red became the leader of Paris' tumultuous _ and occasionally
bloody _ student revolts.
   ``We had the will to change our lives, to participate in history
right at the moment it happened,'' Cohn-Bendit writes of his
revolutionary days.
   In May 1968 French authorities expelled him from the country on
grounds of disturbing the peace. The ban was not officially lifted
until 1978, Cohn-Bendit wrote in his book.
   Cohn-Bendit lives with his girl friend, but he said he doesn't
intend to get married.

<HEAD>Brazilians Lining Up at 4 a.m. for U.S. Visas</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was 4 a.m., and the line of
Brazilians seeking tourist visas had already formed outside the
U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro. It started near the front door
and before long wound around the corner.
   Ever since the Brazilian government on Jan. 1 rescinded a
25-percent surtax on overseas airplane tickets and on U.S. dollars
purchased for foreign travel, the Consulate has been besieged with
visa requests.
   On this particulary morning, one man in the line _ he refused to
give his name _ had no intention of going to Disneyworld or looking
out over New York City from the top of the Empire State Building.
He was there, he said, because he can sell his place in line later
for 10,000 cruzados _ about $100.
   The desire of Brazilians to travel to the United States is
growing, not only because it is cheaper nowadays, but because at
least some hope to stay there, even if illegally.
   In 1987 the number of those seeking U.S. visas averaged 300 a
day. Now it is 450, sometimes more than 600.
   ``There has been an increased demand for services, but our
resources have not expanded accordingly,'' Clyde Bishop, the head
of the Consular Section, said in an interview.
   The Consulate has just one U.S.Foreign Service officer to handle
non-immigrant visas.
   ``Me,'' Bishop said.
   The result is delay, and grumbling and dissatisfaction on both
sides.
   ``Our people are working 10 to 12 hours a day processing
visas,'' Bishop said. ``Often they go without lunch.''
   The Consulate's air conditioning broke down recently, and the
temperature inside reached 100 degrees.
   ``The situation is serious,'' said Oscar Dalsenter, president of
the Brazilian Association of Travel Agencies. ``We have people with
reserved flights and booked hotels who miss their trips because of
the visa delay,''
   Most of the visa seekers are legitimate travelers, happy about
the repeal of the tax and hoping to take advantage of cheap charter
flights to the United States.
   A Brazilian can fly to Disneyworld in Florida and back in a
charter group for $650. The normal round-trip economy fare from Rio
de Janeiro to Miami is $1,600.
   The price drops even more if a tourist _ ticket and visa in hand
_ decides to buy the permitted $1,000 for foreign travel at the
official government exchange rate. Near the end of February, for
example, a traveler could have bought the $1,000 for 97,000
Brazilian cruzados and immediately sold the dollars back in Rio's
loosely controlled black market for 121,000 cruzados. The profit
then goes to offset the cost of the plane ticket.
   But some in the lines are Brazilians hoping to use tourist visas
to stay in the United States as illegal aliens. The U.S. State
Department has reported that the number of illegal Brazilians in
the United States recently has been on the rise.
   According to newspaper polls, a growing number of Brazilians
want to leave the country for good because of serious economic and
political problems.
   Among the measures the U.S. Consulate has taken is to require
potential tourists to show proof of income to pay for an American
vacation. It also has stopped issuing visas assigned just to ``the
bearer'' and requires photographs with each application. All this
has slowed the process.
   ``The prime duty of a consular officer is to make sure
foreigners do not get into the United States under fraudulent
pretenses,'' Bishop said. ``On the other hand, U.S. policy is to
facilitate matters for legitimate tourists who want to visit our
country. So we have to carefully go over each request.''
   The travel agents have proposed, and the Consulate is
considering, separate visa handling, en masse, two days a week for
Brazilian passports submitted by registered travel agencies.
   The travel agents association has promised to police its own
ranks.
   Dalsenter, the association's president, maintained the travel
agencies' proposal would reduce the confusion in the visa lines and
discourage the selling of places.
   Bishop said, ``We have heard reports of money changing hands out
there, but we have no concrete proof.''
   ``It goes on every day,'' Dalsenter said. ``Everybody knows it.''
   On the day an Associated Press reporter and photographer arrived
at the Consulate at 4 a.m., no one on line would agree to be
interviewed or give his or her name. Many turned their backs or
covered up documents they were holding.
   A Brazilian policeman then came by and chased away the
photographer, citing reasons of ``security.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With civilization encroaching on the Amazon rain
forest at the rate of 80,000 square miles a year, AP Special
Correspondent Hugh A. Mulligan decided he'd better go see the
world's longest river before it's too late. Here's his journal of a
recent cruise 1,200 miles up the Amazon on a small passenger ship.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE MV BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Aaaah-Yeeee-Haaaaa.'' Tarzan cries
upstage the incessant caw of birds, the chatter of monkeys and
peeping of frogs in the vine-tangled rain forest.
   In the morning mist on the Amazon River, dozens of dugout canoes
dart out from a thatched village hugging the muddy bank, where a
scrawny pig and a few frazzled chickens scurry beneath the banana
trees.
   The cries of the canoeists, paddling furiously toward us with
what seemed to be long-handled, gaily painted pingpong paddles,
brought out more boats from houses on stilts farther upstream and
in the side creeks.
   ``They come to greet us but also to keep their boats from being
smashed against those little wooden docks by our bow wave,'' says
Capt. Harry Biehl, looking down from the bridge wing of the
10,000-ton MV Berlin, a small West German passenger ship.
   Most of the 270 passengers desert morning bouillon on the Lido
deck to hug the rails with their cameras and shower down chocolate
bars, fruit from the dining room, soap from their cabins,
cigarettes and ball point pens in plastic bags on the Indian
families, from toothless grandmothers down to the tiniest infants,
bobbing about in the mini-armada that soon slid by in our churning
wake.
   Around the next bend, where a generator throbs and a TV antenna
rises improbably above the flame and rubber trees, the excited
yells of a small boy out on the landing empties out the clapboard
Casa de Sao Jeronimo mission, leaving the preacher waiting at the
altar on a steamy Sunday morning, as his parishoners took to their
boats.
   What next?
   First came the conquistadors, dropouts from Francisco Pizarro's
expedition against the Incas. Then the bandeirantes, the slave
traders, followed by the diamond hunters and the garimpeiros, the
gold prospectors. Next the rubber barons, who were crueler and
greedier than the slavers, then the loggers and ranchers, soon
joined by the industrialists and power dam builders, chewing up the
rain forest with their voracious machines at the rate of 80,000
square miles a year.
   And now tourists.
   The amazing Amazon, the widest, wettest and, so National
Geographic now affirms, the longest river in the world (4,007
miles, 51 longer than the Nile), boasts the longest snake, the most
venomous viper, the biggest rat, beetle and ant, along with
razor-toothed piranhas that can reduce a Brahman steer to raw bones
in minutes and electric eels delivering 640 volts, enough to drive
a Metro-North commuter train. This surging, swarming stream, veined
by 1,000 tributaries, that on its majestic march from the Andes to
the Atlantic carries one-fifth of the fresh water discharged into
the sea by all rivers of the world, now has seen it all.
   Tourists, yet. No wonder the crocodiles stared with jaws agape
from the seclusion of gigantic Victoria Regia lily pads, and the
pumas and jaguars fled into the forest fastness.
   The strange thing is that our mini-liner, small enough to
navigate the Amazon's side channels, avoiding the freighter and
barge traffic in the broad mainstream, was as much a novelty to the
natives unencumbered by cameras as they were to us.
   Smiling and wide-eyed, they swarmed about with blowguns,
javelins, bows and arrows to sell for only a few dollars or barter
for the clothes off your back. Mask makers, a declining skill,
offered replicas of the palm fiber Yagua headdress, framed with
shoulder-length blonde braids, that erroneously gave the Amazon its
name. Gaspar de Caravaj, a Dominican friar who accompanied the
conquistadores in 1541, mistook the local tribesmen in their
shoulder-length headdresses for women warriors. In his journal he
gave the name Amazon to the river, after the lady legionnaires of
Greek legend, writing of ``battling warrior women who fought as 10
Indian men.''
   The tourist incentive is to see it all before it is too late.
   ``The forest is all gone south of here. Who knows what will be
left by the end of the century?'' lamented Serafim Bastedo, a dock
crane operator at Belem, 90 miles from the mouth, the largest city
on the Amazon.
   Now a city of l.2 million, with 24-story high-rise apartments, a
huge manganese plant, open-pit iron mines, modern hospitals and a
six-lane highway to Brasilia 1,000 miles to the south, Belem is a
boom town of jarring contrasts.
   The luxurious Hilton Hotel is flanked by side streets of narrow
Portuguese houses, a door and two windows wide, out of the l7th
century. Its shopping district pulsates to a samba beat broadcast
at top volume from municipal loudspeakers.
   ``Brazilians can't live without noise,'' Serafim shouts over the
din.
   The yacht club shares the riverfront with a rickety fishing
fleet out of another century, jungle medicine stalls selling dried
snakeskins filled with herbs, bones and feathers, and a sprawling
outdoor market with hundreds of tarpaulin-covered restaurants
redolent of roasting cassava and pato no tucupi, duck stewed in a
tangy yellow soup. On the far shore lies Marajo Island, bigger than
Denmark, rangeland for 400,000 Brahman cattle.
   Belem's excellent Goeldi nature preserve keeps alive in a jungle
setting the Amazon's more bizarre residents: the 38-foot-long
anaconda, the deadly bushmaster, the endangered manatee, the
4-foot-long rat called the capybara, exotically plumed and beaked
parrots and toucans, long-tailed squirrel monkeys and lumbering,
leathery tapirs, the Brazilian mammal that looks like the love
child of Dumbo and Miss Piggie.
   A few miles upstream the street lights vanish and the rain
forest resumes.
   Two Brazilian pilots, sharing four-hour shifts, keep watch for
shifting sandbars, sudden current shifts where tributaries enter
and the writhing limbs of partially submerged trees toppled from
the eroding red clay banks as we negotiate the narrow
Breves-Macacos channel.

   ``Like the Mississippi, the river is always changing,'' observed
first officer Andreas Jungblut, who has taken freighters up to
Baton Rouge, La. ``But in the Amazon there are no buoys or channel
markers, except for a rare light marking a sharp bend.''
   ``At least,'' adds Capt. Biehl, ``there are no bridges to worry
about all the way to Peru.''
   Flocks of yellow-bellied birds called bem-ti-vi, ``I see you,''
dart along the shore, and baldheaded vultures with enormous
wingspreads glide lazily overhead in the faint equatorial air
currents. The sailor on bow watch spots a trio of red freshwater
dolphins frisking just ahead.
   Night brings the telegraph-wire whine of cicadas, the shrieking
of nocturnal dourcouli monkeys, a sudden boom of thunder or another
falling tree, a solitary silver nighthawk soaring beneath the
Southern Cross and, so the first mate insists, the mating yowl of a
jaguar.
   Sunrise finds some passengers down on all fours photographing
the huge moths, fat beetles and slant-faced grasshoopers attracted
to our decks. A barman shimmies up the radio mast to pin a mammoth
purple and gold butterfly for his collection.
   Before noon, the city of Santarem, 700 miles from the sea,
breaks the monotony of forest and savanna. Settled by Confederate
veterans of the Civil War, this gateway to the gold fields has
false-front cafes right out of the American West, signboarded with
names like Higgins, Jackson and MacDonald.
   A torrential downpour cancels a barbecue at Alter do Chao, a
nearby pink ribbon of beach. Then a rainbow arches over the river,
and the Berlin lowers her motor launches so passengers can swim in
the Amazon and walk out for nearly a mile on a narrow, curling
sandbar.
   ``Where have all the piranhas gone?'' an elderly lady inquires.
   ``Fled for their lives,'' answers ship's surgeon Heinz Wehselau.
   Next morning the boats are lowered again for a visit to Boca de
Valeria, a native village of thatched huts on stilts and a red mud
trail through tangled wetlands teeming with exotic flowers,
brilliantly plumed birds and strange insects, like a 4-inch-long
crawling something brightly banded in black and yellow with a red
head and tail. The landing party returns with bows and arrows,
spears and a variety of tick and mosquito bites.
   Some 1,200 miles up river, just below Manaus, nature stages a
spectacular for the film buffs on board. On our left, the
coffee-brown Solimoes River, flowing a mile wide out of lush
lowlands, meets the broad black Rio Negro, fed far upstream by the
snows of the Andes.
   For a dozen miles they flow side by side without mingling, like
competing oil slicks. The banks of the Solimoes swarm with leeches
and insects, while the Rio Negro is almost pest free.
   ``Even the fish swim aloof in their different colored
currents,'' the Brazilian pilot informs us.
   The two eventual mix at the ``Wedding of the Waters'' to form
the Amazon's final surge to the sea.
   At Manaus, the Berlin ties up to the floating dock built by
British engineers at the turn of the century and assembled piece by
piece to accommodate the 45-foot rise and fall of the river.
   The custom house and ``Little Ben,'' the clock chiming in the
plaza before the cathedral, also were prefabricated in Europe in
the days when rubber was king and Manaus glittered like the El
Dorado dreamed of by the conquistadors.
   Workmen were busy restoring the Italian frescoes in the
gold-domed Teatro Amazonas, the 1,000-seat opera house that
showcased Jenny Lind, the Ballet Russe and string quartets playing
Liszt for the rubber barons, whose decaying mansions are now
subdivided into tenements. In 1910, Manaus boasted French modistes,
British tailors, 15 miles of streetcar track and cafes with
fountains gushing champagne.
   Such luxury in the middle of a rain forest was purchased at a
terrible price in human suffering. The Indians who tapped the white
latex from the wild rubber trees were kept in virtual peonage by
their white and mestizo patrones.
   Penned up at night, underpaid for their labor, overcharged at
the company store, often sick with malaria and dengue fever, the
tappers were kept to a quota by guards armed with clubs and guns.
The first failure to meet the quota resulted in a beating. The
tapper lost an ear for the second failure, his other ear for the
third and was killed for the fourth.
   International commissions met to protest the brutality. Then
Henry Wickham, a British biologist, solved the problem by smuggling
out seeds of the wild rubber tree to the royal botanical gardens at
Kew for cultivation as a plantation crop in the Malaysian states.
   By 1915, the boom was over. Cheaper, Asian rubber dominated the
market. Manaus receded to a town on stilts at the water's edge with
suburbs of ``flutuantes,'' floating houses, as the rain forest
reclaimed the cobblestone streets leading to the candy-colored
villas on the cliffs.
   But now with an oil refinery, a 60,000-ton steel plant, huge
sawmills and government-decreed duty-free shops to bolster its
economy, Manaus is making a comeback. Jumbo jets fly in daily from
Miami and Rio.
   The sprawling Tropical Hotel, cleared from the jungles along the
Rio Negro, is attracting conventions from around the world, along
with jet setters and Antwerp diamond dealers to its arcade of
boutiques and jewelry stores.
   At the height of the rubber boom, 400 passenger ships a year
left Liverpool for Manaus.
   ``Two or three cruise ships a month call here now, but we are
hoping for many more,'' says Godfrey Springer from Tooting Bec
outside of London who settled in the Amazon with his Brazilian
wife. He makes his living taking tourists up the side creeks of the
Solimoes in a frail putt-putt boat to view crocodiles lurking among
the Victoria Regia lily pads, broad enough for a small, brave child
to use as a float for sun bathing.
   One would think that like Joseph Conrad's hero, Mr. Kurtz, the
natives would cry, ``the horror, the horror,'' at the first sight
of tourists invading the heart of their dark rain forest. Instead
they smile and offer snakeskin handbags and masks made of turtle
shells that will certainly be confiscated by U.S. Customs agents.
   The Amazon indeed has seen it all.

   BELEM, Brazil _ Some droll, delightful or deadly denizens of the
Amazon rain forest:
   Anaconda _ The world's super snake, a 38-foot constrictor that
suffocates rather than crushes its prey, the distinction usually
being lost on the victim.
   Bushmaster _ Twelve feet of vicious, venomous viper.
   Capybara _ King rat, 4 feet from pointy nose to lack of a tail.
   Crested toucan _ Birdland's Pinocchio, the perennial cover star
of nature magazines and travel folders.
   Dinoponera gigantea _ World's biggest ant at 1{ inches long.
   Electric eel _ It's a carp, not an eel, delivering 640 volts,
enough to power a commuter train. Indians believe its most jarring
jolt is saved for fishermen who catch more than they need.
   Fer-de-lance _ Hissing cousin of the copperhead, but faster and
fiercer with the fang.
   Jaguar _ This loud-mouthed cat out-roars and out-runs the larger
lion and tiger.
   Manatee _ Harmless, hapless and hunted, a flippered,
whale-tailed mammal that grazes on waterlilies; known locally as
the sea cow.
   Morpho didius _ Monarch of all the butterflies with a 7-inch
wingspread.
   Peccary _ A red-eared distant relation of the wild hog, cute but
pugnacious.
   Paiche _ A 400-pound catfish, succulent but seldom pan-ready.
   Piranha _ Only 4 to 15 inches, these ravenous, razor-toothed
fish, with a school enrollment into the thousands, can skeletonize
a cow or a cowhand in a matter of minutes.
   Tapir _ A lumbering, leathery mixture of hog and rhino that's
got to be seen, but not up too closely, to be believed.
   Three-toed sloth _ Upside down tree-snoozing quadruped of
legendary lethargy; may be self-endangered for preferring siesta to
sex.
   Titanus giganteus _ A half-foot long, hard-shelled beetle, the
global giant of its genus.
   Vampire bat _ Count Dracula's late-night drinking buddy with a
thirst for blood light; its dagger-sharp central incisors spread
rabies throughout the Amazon.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When it comes to finding homes for orphaned
pets, the North Shore Animal League is big league indeed. A
combination of operational savvy, a gift for fund raising, and
large doses of affection for its charges enable the League to place
more than 40,000 cats and dogs each year, including animals
regularly rescued from the pound.

   Mehitabel, a calico cat, arrived by
taxi from New York City with a $100 bill around her neck. The note
asked the North Shore Animal League to find her a good home.
   The anonymous owner knew that this non-profit organization,
totally supported by voluntary contributions, never destroys an
animal.
   Others do not arrive in such style. They are simply tied outside
in the cold of night. No note, no donation, just a trusting dog
waiting for an owner's return, a return that will never happen.
That final pat, if there was one, was goodbye.
   And if that's not enough to handle, North Shore has five vans
that daily go to dog pounds to rescue animals on ``death row.'' The
League spends $60,000 a year in pound fees alone gathering the
doomed. Some of them, anyway.
   What sets the North Shore Animal League apart from other equally
noble operations throughout the country is sheer volume. Its
directors say it places more animals in homes than any other
shelter in the world. Consider these statistics:
   _It placed more than 43,000 animals in 1987, although it can
only kennel 400 animals at a time, with another 100 in its foster
home system.
   _An animal's average stay at the League is less than three days.
   _The kennel operation runs a $3.5 million deficit each year, but
its creative fund raising and direct-mail campaigns pull in $5
million.
   _The League spends half a million dollars a year placing ads and
mails out over 30 million pleadings to potential donors each year.
   _It is open 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
   _The average contribution by adopters is $17.
   Despite the good work, the League's animal-loving staff is quick
to point out that their effort scarcely makes a dent in the
slaughter of unwanted pets in this country.
   The American Humane Society, based in Denver, estimates that
about 20 million unwanted dogs and cats are put to death each year.
   The League works hard to educate people to neuter their pets and
its credo is that there is no such thing as an unadoptable animal.
It's their job to match the right animal with the right person.
They matched a deaf dog with a deaf woman who was not only able to
teach it tricks by hand signals, she also taught it to bark, just
as she had been taught to talk.
   While the great majority of their animals are perfectly healthy,
the League has managed to place three-legged dogs, a 12-year-old
Newfoundland, a giant Pyrennees that couldn't walk and a cat with a
bladder problem. On one freezing day recently, a cat lover named
Donna Taffen of Queens came in and asked for the least adoptable
cat. She took home a 7-month old calico with a prolapsed eye.
   ``When an animal has been here for a while, the associates ask
me to help. If I can get its picture in the paper or call it `Pet
of the Week,' that usually works,'' says Betty Rosenzweig, the
director of adoptions who has worked at the shelter for nearly 20
years.
   She's also a born saleswoman as she roams the compound, with
praise for this dog or that cat.
   ``We are all salesmen in a sense, except that our commission is
the satisfaction that up to 300 dogs and cats are adopted on some
days,'' says Michael Arms, director of operations.
   Some big hound and shepherd mixes, All-Americans as the League
calls the non-breed, have been waiting five or six months. But, the
League knows eventually someone will fall for one of these big
mongrels.
   Some breeds, like Yorkshire terriers and poodles, move so fast
they often never see the inside of a cage. Ditto purebred Persian
and Siamese cats.
   Alan Cooper, 24-year-old graduate student in psychology and
currently kennel manager, says that when he walked in the League
five years ago, it was the best thing he ever did.
   He has seen cruelty and animal abuse, but also nobility he never
expected.
   ``One man came in one day and asked for the ugliest dog we had.
He wanted to adopt it and he did,'' recalls Cooper. ``Actually, was
a 5- or 6-year-old terrier mix and it was so ugly, it was almost
cute.''
   Another asked for the dog that had been there the longest.
Another requested the fattest cat. A blind man specified he wanted
the dog with the most beautiful eyes.

   When Cooper began here, he drove one of the vans that rescue
doomed dogs from the pounds. Workers on that duty usually burn out
quickly, he said.
   ``They're told they can only bring 10 dogs back and the pound
might have 40 dogs that are going to be put to sleep. It's awful to
make that choice,'' he says. ``They usually bring back 14 instead
of 10, but they know there is no room for all 40.''
   The North Shore Animal League is truly a national organization.
Contributions and animals come in from many parts of the country,
and because of the League's reputation, people often adopt their
pets here while on vacation.
   The not-so-secret ingredients behind its success are Alex and
Babette Lewyt, a well-to-do couple who came to Port Washington to
retire in the late '60s. Lewyt made his fortune as an inventor,
with 200 patents to his credit, including the Lewyt Vacuum Cleaner.
Babette Lewyt took one look at the old North Shore League, a
down-at-the-heels operation that was about to go under, and set out
to transform it.
   ``Both of them would work here from dawn to dusk, cleaning out
cages, and doing everyting that needed to be done,'' says Ms.
Rosenzweig. ``He took out the first ad in the New York Times under
the adoption columns, advertising a free golden retriever and some
other purebreds. The ad cleared out the shelter.
   In business since 1944, the physical plant is not much to look
at _ a gerrymandered hodgepodge of rooms with cages stacked atop
each other. It's on a side street in a Long Island bedroom
community some 20 miles from Manhattan. The original building was
donated by a San Francisco woman. One individual left the League
$200,000 in a will.
   The League has strict guidelines. One out of five potential
adopters are turned down. It is no coincidence that the man working
the parking lot is an off-duty policeman. Punches have been thrown
when someone was rejected.
   Besides precautions, there is a ``dowry,'' including a leash,
collar, ID tag, starting food, a training book and a 30-day health
insurance policy. But they also check references right there on the
spot, making one area resemble a bookie operation. On occasion,
they make on-site follow-up calls. This accounts for a return rate
of only 6 percent.
   Arms, partial to Newfoundlands, worried when his favorite was
adopted by a Queens couple. He drove by the house and found the dog
chained outside on cement with the new owners at work. An 8-foot
cyclone fence enclosed the area.
   Arms telephoned the pair, fibbing about a faulty blood test, and
asked the couple to bring the dog in for further checking. Then he
snatched the Newfie back and delivered a lecture to the highly
displeased couple.
   Arms can be a tough guy when it comes to rescuing dogs. When he
worked for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals in the Bronx, he was stabbed by three men who were betting
on how long a wounded dog would live. They objected to Arms'
interference with the outcome.
   The League also backs their orphans. For $15 you can bring your
dog back for obedience training for as long as it needs it. Such
training can cost as much as $50 an hour elsewhere.
   The League will also neuter your animal for a token fee _ $30
for a female, $20 for a male. ``And if you can't afford that, it
gets even cheaper,'' says Arms. ``Free.''
   Once in a while, workers let instinct replace checking.
   Such was the case with Bruce and Monsita Abramski and their
three children of Central Islip, N.Y.
   Both adults were experienced dog owners, the children all loved
grandma's dog, and they were about to move into a larger and more
secluded home where Mrs. Abramski would be all alone with the kids.
They wanted a puppy to grow up with the kids, but mature into a big
watchdog.
   They settled on a chubby, big-boned, mostly black pup, about 6
weeks old, with telltale big paws, and to judge by looking, lots of
shepherd genes.
   Jessica, the eldest at 8, took over as family spokesperson and
declared the puppy would be named ``Tramp.''
   ``We will all vote on the name,'' her father corrected as six
little hands all reached in unison to pet the new addition, whose
sad brown eyes looked a bit overwhelmed.
   Monsita Abramski shook her head.
   ``Do you think the puppy is up to these kids?''
   If puppies are puppies and kids are kids, Mrs. Abramski, it's a
sure thing.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ There are still a lot of lakes and mountains and
such in Alaska without proper names, but not because no one has any
ideas. Naming geographic features simply gets bogged down in red
tape, with both state and federal agencies to satisfy. And some of
the suggestions seem frivolous at best.

   A fisherman's pet dog dies, dead blackfish
are found floating on a lake, a college student loses his a skiff
in a storm, British paratroopers scale an Alaskan peak.
   Those are some of the events that inspired requests from people
who want the state of Alaska to name a lake, stream, creek, island,
mountain or some other landmark in honor of someone or something.
   Don Lallemand from the state of Washington buried his dog Mitzi
on an unnamed Southeast Alaska island 12 years ago. He wrote the
State Geographic Board in 1986 asking that the two-acre island be
named in honor of Mitzi.
   ``We buried a small dog who had traveled with us for years
aboard the boat and loved the area as much as we do,'' he wrote.
   Lallemand included a picture showing the sign he posted on the
island, naming it for Mitzi. He plants flowers and trees near the
grave site every year.
   But Lallemand has not heard anything from the state board in the
two years since he submitted his request. ``We're very
disappointed,'' he says.
   He is not alone.
   The board has almost 100 requests on file, waiting for action.
   The board last met in August. Before that, it met in March 1985.
   ``We are swamped,'' says Gladyce Williamson, secretary to the
board.
   Williamson serves as secretary to the state community and
regional affairs commissioner, who chairs the geographic board. She
said there is no extra staff for the board, and she must process
the applications while also handling her regular duties for the
commissioner.
   The eight-member board, comprised of state officials and one
public appointee, reviewed 10 requests at the August meeting. ``The
federal people had really been pushing and really wanted some
action on the oldest cases,'' Williamson says.
   The oldest cases date back six or seven years, she says.
   All recommendations from the state board go to the U.S. Domestic
Geographic Names Board for final approval.
   One of the priority cases was a request from the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to name a mountain near the interior Brooks Range for
a federal geologist. His name is Reuben Kachadoorian. For ease of
pronunciation, Williamson said, the Corps proposed Reuben's Peak.
   Most requests come from individuals, not government agencies.
Some landowners get upset when the board refuses to allow them to
name features on their own property.
   A home-site owner had asked that a lake be named for dead
blackfish found floating on the surface. His nomination of Deadfish
Lake southwest of Fairbanks was deferred by the board.
   Homesteaders north of Anchorage want to pick their own name for
a small lake on their property. ``We felt it was not only our
responsibility to the community, but also our privilege to name a
feature on our property,'' they wrote in their nominating letter.
   The backlog of nominations includes the expected personal
requests such as Otto's Lake and Moore's Mountain, and also some
unexpected ones.
   In 1985 a 24-year-old college student from the Lower 48 wrote a
sad tale of losing _ and finding _ a skiff while crab fishing in
the Aleutian Islands.
   His crew lost their skiff in a storm and then recovered it.
``Now, when we happen to anchor at this cove, we affectionately
refer to it as Skiff Cove.''
   The board also deferred action on Skiff Cove.
   Williamson said nominations must meet certain criteria to win
the board's approval. Commemorative names get the most thorough
review.
   _The person for whom the feature is to be named must be dead at
least one year.
   _The application must include a biography and the person's
length of stay in Alaska.
   _The nomination must have local support and the Native
corporation in the area must be consulted.
   ``The person must have made a substantial contribution to a city
or the state or their rural area,'' Williamson says.
   Some commemorative requests appear to fall a little short of
that criterion.
   A small creek northeast of Fairbanks has been nominated as Pete
Bloom Pup, after a trapper who killed himself in 1937.
   According to the nominating letter and a 1937 newspaper article
accompanying the request, Pete Bloom had fallen into the ice and
knew that even if he lived he would lose his hands and feet to
frostbite. ``He took a snare and put it around his neck and then
attached it to his dog sled. He then told his dogs to mush, thereby
choking himself to a fast death.''
   A Kenai Peninsula resident wants the board to name a lake in the
Kenai National Moose Range as Dangerous Lake. The person had once
found a cow moose near the lake, killed by a bear, and must have
figured it was a dangerous spot to be.
   A Fairbanks resident wants a waterway near the Dalton Highway
named Solitude Creek.
   ``This wayward wandering hall of wonder does not entertain the
aspects of fear, only unpolluted silence. This is a fitting name as
it will no doubt draw others who will be searching for that very
avenue of adventure.''
   An Anchorage resident nominated Tranquility Lake northwest of
town.
   A Kenai resident likes the name of the Greek goddess of the sea.
   Giving a lesson in mythology the person wrote, ``Thetis, the
mother of Achilles, saved him by hanging onto his foot and the lake
is shaped like a foot.'' Therefore, he proposes the name Lake
Thetis.
   Never mind that Thetis is also the Kenai man's first name.
   A 12,060-foot peak in Denali National Park was scaled in 1956 by
members of a British parachute regiment. The regiment's symbol is
Pegasus, the flying horse.
   Although the regiment may have named the peak in their honor,
the federal review board in 1985 rejected Pegasus Peak. The State
Geographic Board still has the file open.
   Tired of Butterfly Lake and Butterfly Creek, of which there are
several in the state, one nominee suggested the French name for the
insect _ Papillon Pond.
   Even children get into the act. ``My daughter thought of the
name after my mustache and a moose,'' said a proud parent in asking
that the state name a small lake Moosestache Lake.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's the southernmost inhabited point in Canada,
an island on Lake Erie virtually isolated in the winter. But the
island's population has dwindled as farms become more mechanized
and today local officials are looking for ways to keep the young
folks at home.

<TEXT>
   They sometimes call it Canada's Key
West, but until the spring thaw comes, the 195 year-round residents
of Pelee Island on ice-crusted Lake Erie are virtually cut off from
the outside world.
   From mid-December, when the last tourist boats head home, until
the ice pack breaks up in late March, commuter flights to Windsor,
Ontario, and Sandusky, Ohio, are the only direct link with the
mainland.
   Pelee Island, 16 miles south of the Canadian mainland and 22
miles north of Sandusky, is the southernmost inhabited point in
Canada.
   ``The only problem with Pelee Island is you either love it or
hate it,'' says Donna Olsen, who runs a bait and tackle shop with
her husband, Svend. The Olsens are among the year-round residents
of the island, 11,000 acres of farmland, scrub and beaches.
   About 300 people consider it their primary residence and up to
1,500 people crowd its 17 square miles during the summer, when the
ferries MV Pelee Islander and MV Upper Canada ply their regular
routes between the island, Kingsville and Leamington, Ontario, and
Sandusky.
   Visitors are few in the winter months, mostly small groups of
hunters who want to make use of one of the few decent spots within
hundreds of miles for shooting pheasant.
   ``I don't have an attitude that it's an isolated place,'' says
Helen McCormick, owner of the Pelee Passage Restaurant, which
offers the island's only year-round food service.
   The island's hotel, motel, bar and other two restaurants close
for the winter.
   The Pelee Passage Restaurant is the site of a Tuesday night card
game and the Canadian Legion Hall hosts a Friday night gathering.
   Seated at the restaurant one recent afternoon were four pheasant
hunters who had flown over that morning on the six-passenger Piper
Navajo that makes twice-daily flights to the island.
   ``We're friends and we go up north every fall, moose hunting and
bear hunting,'' says Dudley Sparks of Merlin, Ontario.
   ``If you want to hunt pheasant, you have to go to Pelee,'' said
one of his companions, Gary Ryckman of Muirkirk, Ontario.
   Farming has dominated the economy of Pelee Island since the
first European settlers arrived in the 1820s. While fields of soy
beans, wheat and corn still cover about 7,000 acres, the population
has dropped sharply as mechanization has increased the acreage one
farmer can plant and harvest.
   ``There were close to 1,000 people here when I was growing up,''
says Don Gow, a retired postmaster born on the island in 1902. ``If
you had 50 acres and a team of horses, you were pretty busy all
summer. If you work it with a tractor, that's a day's work.''
   More typical today is the 540-acre spread farmed by Bill
Krestel, the ``reeve'' or supervisor of the Township of Pelee
Island. Krestel was born on the island to a farm family that
emigrated from Romania before World War II.
   As is common among farmers everywhere, he holds several jobs to
supplement his income, working as a telephone repairman for Bell
Canada, deputy game warden and occasional hunting guide.
   His post as the island's top elected official brings him about
$1,200 a year.
   Krestel says lack of employment opportunity drove most of his
classmates off the island. He wants that to end.
   ``When I went to school, there were 13 kids in my class and
about 130 in the school,'' he says. Now there are 25 in
kindergarten through eighth grade at the two-room Pelee Island
Public School.
   Five young people from the island attend high school in
Kingsville on the Canadian mainland, boarding with local families
and flying home on weekends.

   ``What you've got to have is a job that a kid who has gone to
school can be proud to do,'' Krestel said. ``You can look at a
million things and it always comes back to tourism.''
   He and other island officials and merchants are at work on a
number of projects to boost Pelee's tourist trade.
   Key to the expansion is the introduction of a larger,
400-passenger ferry, with space for 45 cars, to replace the MV
Upper Canada, which can carry a maximum of 100 people and 10
vehicles.
   The MV Pelee Islander, with capacity for 267 people and 15 cars,
will continue to run.
   ``We'll almost double our capacity,'' he says.
   Getting tourists to the island is only half the battle. Krestel
and others are trying to drum up more things to keep visitors busy
while they're here.
   A Pelee Heritage Center, featuring exhibits on the island's
history and economy, is to open on May 1. The town council will
experiment with a third pheasant hunt, importing adult birds to
supplement the 20,000 raised each year on the island's pheasant
farm.
   The 1,600 permits for the two hunts sell out within days.
   Recently, Krestel and Peter Pfeifer, vineyard manager for the
Pelee Island Winery, sat at Pfeifer's kitchen table and discussed
plans for a tasting center that would allow visitors to sample
products of the island's grapes and tour the nearby pheasant farm.
   Pfeifer took the job in February 1986 after answering an
advertisement in a West German wine magazine, bringing his wife,
Inge, and their two daughters from Heppenheim, a city of 36,000, to
the island community.
   The moderating effect of Lake Erie gives Pelee Island an average
of 19 more frost-free days than the mainland and its rich dark soil
yields hearty, sweet grapes that are shipped to the winery in
Kingsville for processing.
   While Pfeifer talks, daughter Alice, 4, wanders in from the
living room where she is watching cartoons on television, clutching
a stuffed bear.
   ``Daddy, I'm thirsty and baby bear is thirsty,'' she said.
Pfeifer gets them a drink.
   Island life has been good for Alice and her big sister, Denise,
7, a second-grader at the island's two-room school. Other children
live just across the road.
   The remoteness has been harder on his wife, who had stayed on in
Windsor after a family trip to the mainland earlier in the week.
   ``It's a little more difficult for the women out here,'' Pfeifer
said. ``There is no shopping. It can be isolating out here.''
   Occasionally, if the lake freezes hard and deep enough,
snowmobilers will trek from Pelee south to Put-in-Bay on South Bass
Island, a part of Ohio.
   Lisa Nageleisen came to Pelee Island to teach in 1981, met and
married a ferry worker. She teaches 11 children in grades four
through eight while in the next room, Debbie Janzen teaches 14
children from kindergarten through third grade.
   ``It's a juggling act,'' Nageleisen said as she and Janzen
watched from a classroom window as the children frolicked outside.
``The kids learn to work a little more independently. The older
ones will sometimes help the younger ones.
   ``They're not as segregated in terms of grades. At lunch, the
whole school was playing soccer.''
   Because the children spend years with the same teachers, they
often become very close.
   Nageleisen says she stays in contact with former students who
have gone away to college on the mainland.
   ``I hope that they come back and find something here and remain
Pelee Islanders,'' she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Over the past two decades he has written some of
America's most popular songs, starting with ``Up, Up and Away'' in
1967. But Jimmy Webb has not been able to get off the ground on
Broadway, even while working with some of the top names in the
theater. He's still trying, with three productions in the works.

   Ace songwriter Jimmy Webb, who has returned to
performing, is still trying to crack Broadway after several
frustrating years of trying.
   ``So many of these things, you can work on them for years and
you don't get to see anything,'' he says. ``Someone told me it took
eight years to get `Annie' on Broadway. It's a tough business.''
   Webb is also not forgetting the record market, his bread and
butter. He alternates, writing one song for records, one for a
Broadway show.
   ``Nobody pays anybody to write Broadway shows,'' he says.
``There's nothing up front. And I think it's dangerous to work 15
months on a musical and not write one song for the record market.
Record people say, `Is he still alive?'''
   After 1967, when his ``Up, Up and Away'' became the first big
hit for the Fifth Dimension and his ``By the Time I Get to
Phoenix'' put Glen Campbell on the charts, Webb concentrated on the
record market. Campbell scored again with Webb's ``Wichita
Lineman'' and ``Galveston.'' Actor Richard Harris had record hits
with Webb's ``MacArthur Park'' and ``Didn't We?''.
   But in the 1980s, Webb has concentrated on writing for Broadway.
Three productions are planned for next season _ on Broadway,
off-Broadway and in Dublin, Ireland.
   So far, nothing Webb has written has been performed on Broadway.
The shows he worked on, with some of the top names in the theater,
never opened.
   Webb composes in a studio in a Manhattan building that was owned
by the late Michael Bennett, the master director of ``A Chorus
Line'' and ``Dreamgirls.''
   ``The first musical I did with Michael, `Scandal,' I spent 14
months in this room writing, almost every day,'' Webb recalls. To
no avail. .
   ``I got kind of uncomfortable with that. I feel I have to get
back to these individual songs. But they're harder. I think it's
easier to write songs when you know the plot than sitting down with
a blank piece of paper and going, `Let's write a hit, here.'''
   Webb accomplished the latter this winter with ``Still Within the
Sound of My Voice,'' Glen Campbell's first hit record in 10 years.
It was Campbell, a friend for 20 years, who in 1985 suggested
Webb's four-verse ``The Highwayman'' to Waylon Jennings, Willie
Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson.
   At 41, Webb also is singing in cabarets, accompanying himself on
the piano. During January and February he performed at Jan
Wallman's and the Ballroom in New York and at the Hollywood
Roosevelt Hotel's ``Cinegrill.''
   ``I'm just not ready to pack it up yet,'' Webb says.
   He performed with a rock band in the early 1970s, but stopped
after a second tour as opening act for the group America. He made
six record albums in the 1970s but none sold exceptionally well.
   Amy Grant sings Webb's ``If These Walls Could Speak'' on her
next album. Webb co-wrote ``Home of the Brave'' with David Paich of
Toto for that group's new album. ``His father, Marty Paich,
arranged `Up, Up and Away.''' Webb says. David was about 12 then.
   In 1980, Webb moved to Tuxedo Park, N.Y., and began writing
``Tuxedo,'' a show based on the history of the once-fashionable
suburb of New York City where the dinner jacket that bears its name
was introduced. ``I was wasting time,'' Webb says. ``I knew nothing
about what I was doing.''
   Then recording mogul David Geffen introduced Webb to Michael
Bennett and Webb started working on ``Scandal.''
   But Bennett announced the postponement of ``Scandal'' two weeks
before scheduled rehearsals in Broadway's Mark Hellinger Theater.
   ``We call it black Monday,'' Webb recalls. ``We had Treat
Williams and Swoosie Kurtz and most of the great dancers and
singers from the original `Chorus Line' and some others from
`Dreamgirls.'''
   Webb says that Bennett probably decided the times were not right
for a show about infidelity.
   Next they started working on another musical together called
``Children's Crusade.''
   ``There was a mass uprising of children in France and Germany,
twice, 40 years apart in the 13th century. Huge groups of children
left their homes and banded together and declared their intention
to go to the Holy Land. And did it. People would ask where they
were going. They'd say they were going to heaven, to see Jesus.
There were hundreds of thousands of them, white-robed children
carrying little wooden crosses with this light in their eyes.
   ``One of the last conversations I ever had with Michael, he
wanted me to go ahead with it. He still thought it was the best
idea he'd ever had for a Broadway show.''
   Webb hopes it'll arrive on Broadway next season.
   Last summer Webb wrote the music and he and Ray Bradbury
collaborated on lyrics for a musical, based on Bradbury's novel,
``Dandelion Wine.'' It's planned for off-Broadway next season.
   ``It's about learning as an adult to face yourself as a child,''
Webb says. ``That way you find out a lot about why you are the way
you are and maybe you can become happier with yourself.
   ``Ray and I have a song, `Kangaroo Tennis Shoes,' in which this
11-year-old has his first pair of tennies and all the things he is
going to do in them.''
   And, Webb is working with Dale Wasserman, librettist of ``Man of
La Mancha,'' on a George Bernard Shaw play, ``The Shewing Up of
Blanco Bosnet.''
   ``It's a one-act play about the Old West, about which Shaw knew
absolutely nothing, which makes it hilarious,'' Webb says. ``We
have a commitment from the Abbey Theater in Dublin.''
   Webb says he has also written eight chapters of a novel about a
boy of 12 growing up in southwest Oklahoma. ``It is about me, quite
a lot about my grandfather and my sons are woven in there, as
well,'' he says.
   Webb and his wife Patsy got married under a big oak tree, on
musician Jimmy Messina's ranch in Ojai, Calif. The composer of
``Up, Up and Away'' had a balloon for guests to ride in at the
wedding reception.
   They now have five sons, Chris, 15, Justin, 12, James, 9, Corey,
5, and Charles, 9 months.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Early this century, railroads looking for cheap
labor brought Mexicans to an Illinois town where they lived first
in boxcars and later in cramped bungalows along a narrow street.
But that winding lane has earned the name Hero Street for the
patriotism of its residents, and some think it should be made a
national monument.

<TEXT>
   For more than 40 years, scores of
Mexican-Americans have gone off to war from a winding drive of tiny
wood-frame houses perched on a hillside rising from an old rail
yard in this Illinois town.
   Eight have returned in caskets.
   And since 1968, the street has been named Hero Street U.S.A. in
honor of the 110 young warriors who have left it for the armed
forces since 1941. Now a move is under way to get Congress to name
the former dirt path a national monument.
   For Joe Munos and his family, life on Hero Street always meant
serving their country. Not only did Munos and his three brothers
all fight for the United States _ his younger brother Johnny died
in Korea _ but his three sons and his daughter joined the armed
forces, as well as his grandson.
   ``That's the tradition of Hero Street,'' Munos says. ``It must
be in our blood. It's an honor for me to be a veteran of foreign
wars.''
   For Georgia Sandoval Herrera, growing up on Hero Street meant
watching a half-dozen brothers leave during World War II and seeing
two return in caskets. Brothers Joe and Frank died 10 months apart
and portraits of them in uniform still hang on her living room wall.
   ``It seemed like a ghost town during the war because so many of
our boys were gone,'' she recalls. ``But we were one big family on
Hero Street. The losses pulled us together. We're still a very
close community.
   ``My son says, `why don't we move?' And I say the only place I'd
want to live is Hero Street. There's no place like Hero Street.''
   Another Sandoval family sent seven boys into World War II and
suffered one death.
   Those kinds of statistics are common on Hero Street.
   No other single block in America has made so great a sacrifice,
according to local officials. Although the Defense Department can't
confirm the claim, it's never been disputed in 20 years.
   A memorial park was built on the site in 1971 and now a city
alderman is leading the drive to have Congress declare Hero Street
a national monument as a tribute to all who died in service _
especially immigrant soldiers.
   ``These men walked into this country and picked up arms without
a complaint,'' says Alderman Joe Terronez, 58. ``Some weren't even
citizens when they joined the armed forces. This is a great story
about great heroes and it should be a national monument.''
   Located between Billy Goat Bluff and Honey Creek, Hero Street is
a small Mexican barrio that winds its way back up a dead-end hollow
near the rail yard in this town of 7,200.
   Some of its 36 tiny bungalows sit precariously on the steep
terrace of the bluff while others are perched just above the creek
and appear to be sinking into the gully.
   Many of the wood-frame homes are long and narrow, like the
railroad boxcars they replaced. Until a few years ago, the street
was a dirt path that turned to mud and trapped hearses as they
brought home dead soldiers.
   When Terronez was growing up, Hero Street was simply 2nd Street
and a ``tough neighborhood.'' Living conditions were poor for the
large Mexican families crowded into the cramped houses.
   The Mexicans were brought to Silvis early this century by the
railroads who were looking for cheap labor. Originally, they lived
in boxcars in the nearby rail yard but were moved to 2nd Street
when townspeople complained about the growing Mexican population in
the yard.
   ``This is a story of our parents coming to the United States and
adopting it,'' Terronez says. ``Although we were all viewed as
aliens, the boys of Hero Street proved this was their country.''
   The fight for national monument status is more than just a
battle for recognition of the contribution made by eight dead
soldiers or even 110 men and women who joined the armed forces.
   For Terronez, it epitomizes the struggle of Hispanic Americans
everywhere for appreciation and respect as first-class citizens.
He's enlisted the help of U.S. Rep. Lane Evans, a Democrat from
nearby Rock Island, in achieving national recognition in Congress.
   Hero Street's residents hope for tangible benefits from
elevating the street to a national monument.
   Federal money would be available for maintaining the memorial,
built on a bluff to resemble a Mayan temple. Residents also hope it
would become a tourist attraction after placement on national parks
system maps.
   Steve Vetzner, an aide in Evans' Washington office, said the
congressman plans to work with the Illinois delegation to get some
sort of designation for Hero Street, such as a national monument,
historic site or historic landmark.
   ``Let's be honest _ naturally this would be a shot in the arm to
Hispanics,'' Terronez says. ``Sometimes, we feel we are
second-class citizens. But when you look at the blood shed by
Hispanics on that one street you know we are real Americans. It
would be a source of great pride for all Mexican-Americans.''

   Actor Kirk Douglas says he learned just how
controversial ``Inherit the Wind'' is when the movie company was
turned away from filming at a private school in Oregon.
   ``This is a play about the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925, but the
issue is as relevant today as it was then,'' he says.
   ``The best example of that came when we planned to shoot a scene
in a schoolhouse in a small town in Oregon. We had made
arrangements with the school's board to film scenes of the young
teacher teaching Darwin's theory of evolution. But when they found
out what we were going to film they threw us out. They said they
only teach Biblical creationism.''
   Douglas, Jason Robards, Jean Simmons and Darren McGavin star in
the new two-hour production of ``Inherit the Wind.'' David Greene
directed from a screenplay by John Gay, based on the play by Jerome
Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.
   Douglas plays Matthew Harrison Brady, a brilliant orator and
fundamentalist politician invited to prosecute a teacher for
bringing Darwin's theory into the classroom. Robards is Henry
Drummond, a liberal lawyer who defends the teacher. Simmons is
Brady's wife and McGavin is a cynical reporter named E.K. Hornbeck.
   The play, of course, is based on the trial of John Scopes in
Tennessee. Brady is really William Jennings Bryan, the three-time
Democratic presidential nominee. Drummond is Clarence Darrow and
Hornbeck is H.L. Mencken. It was made into a movie in 1960 with
Spencer Tracy as Drummond, Frederic March as Brady and Gene Kelly
as Hornbeck.
   ``It's interesting for an actor to play a role with a point of
view you don't believe in,'' Douglas says. ``I think he was very
sincere. He wasn't a charlatan, he wasn't a buffoon. He believed
every word in the Bible should be accepted as it was written.
   ``That's what creates the dramatic friction between my character
and Jason Robards'. They were both sincere in their beliefs. The
pathetic quality which we develop is that these two men had been
friends. Clarence Darrow had backed Bryan in his first run for the
presidency. It's touching because these two men are now bitter
enemies.''
   Douglas says he wasn't interested when his son, Peter, the
executive producer, first brought the idea to him. He didn't want
to do a remake of the movie, in which Brady was more buffoonish.
   ``I never thought he should be played as a fool,'' he says. ``I
played him as a mixture of Pat Robertson, Billy Graham and Jimmy
Swaggart. Brady wasn't gluttonous and eating all the time, the way
he was in the movie.''
   He also began to see how relevant the subject was because of the
ongoing debate, evolution vs. creationism.
   The time of the trial was also moved to the fall.
   ``In the movie you see a hundred extras fanning away because of
the summer heat,'' Douglas says. ``We didn't want that. We also
went back to the original trial transcript and picked up a few
things. Brady dies in the courtroom, but in reality Bryan died five
days after the trial ended. The play was never an attempt to be
exact history.''
   ``Inherit the Wind'' is Douglas' second movie with son Peter.
The first was called ``Amos,'' which was set in a home for the
elderly.
   ``That's the exciting thing about doing movies for television,''
he says. ``You can deal with subjects you can't do for theatrical
films. Theatrical films seem to fall into certain formulas _ wild
comedies, violence or young kids finding out about sex.
   ``On television you can do something with substance. This is the
first program in the new `AT&T Presents' series. What I like about
that is that we have fewer commercial breaks.''
   Douglas' last theatrical film was ``Tough Guys,'' which also
starred Burt Lancaster.
   ``I've got several projects pending, but I've been devoting my
time to my autobiography,'' he says. ``I've just finished it and
Simon & Schuster will publish it. It was interesting to write, like
taking a self-inventory. It was hard work. I found it painful. I
wrote it by myself.
   ``One of my motivations for the book is that I have four sons.
I'll say something and one of them will say, `Gee, Dad, I didn't
know that.' I think this book is my chance to say who I am.''
   Douglas believes that the public has a different image than the
one he has of himself.
   ``Before `Champion' in 1949 I'd played an intellectual
schoolteacher, a weak schoolteacher and an alcoholic. After
`Champion,' I was a tough guy. I did things like playing van Gogh,
but the image lingers. That's one of the things I loved about
`Inherit the Wind.' It was a battle of ideas rather than of
physical violence.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Second Stage has devoted an entire theater
season to the plays of Michael Weller, a rare honor for playwrights
these days.
   Since November, the enterprising off-Broadway company has
presented ``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose Ends,'' two of Weller's
best-known efforts. In April, it will offer the world premiere of
his latest drama, ``Spoils of War,'' at the troupe's small theater
in what was once an old gymnasium on the Upper West Side.
   And in between there will be staged readings of other Weller
plays, panel discussions about Weller and his work and viewings of
``Ragtime'' and ``Hair,'' two movies for which Weller wrote the
screenplays.
   For Weller, the Second Stage celebration is a homecoming of
sorts. Since its start nine years ago, the company, which
specializes in second looks at plays that may not have been
successful the first time around, has been receptive to the
playwright's writing.
   ``Mike is one of the people who started the theater with us,''
remembers Robyn Goodman, one of the company's two artistic
directors. ``He was one of the first people to write a play for
us.''
   And he's doing it again this year. ``Spoils of War,'' the story
of a mother and son in the 1950s, was commissioned by Goodman and
her Second Stage partner, Carole Rothman. Kate Nelligan plays the
mother.
   ``One of the enticements in writing a new play was that Mike
would be cushioned to a certain extent by having his other plays
done during the same season,'' Rothman says. ``New York has kind of
a hit-or-miss mentality. With our current season, people will be
able to see a body of work. It's not as frightening for a
playwright to premiere a new play when it's surrounded by plays
that have been done before.''
   The object of these theatrical festivities is a boyish,
45-year-old writer who does his writing out of an East Village
studio.
   The man is surprisingly low-keyed, considering he is under
deadline to get ``Spoils of War'' finished before it goes into
rehearsal and considering he is juggling phone calls from Texas
where his latest screenplay actually has gone into production. It's
a movie _ as yet untitled _ directed by Hugh Hudson and starring
Donald Sutherland and Adam Horovitz of Beastie Boys fame.
   ``The film is about kids whose parents don't supervise them too
much,'' Weller says. ``The movie follows one boy through his
adventures with a gang and getting into trouble with the law.''
   He had no problem taking a new look at his old plays and was
closely involved with the casting and directing of each revival.
Weller found the experience a pleasant one and didn't feel
compelled to rewrite what he had written years ago.
   ``It's like going into your old neighborhood again,'' Weller
says. ``I usually work out of a real emotional knot and once that's
untied, I don't feel much inclination to go back to a play.''
   ``Moonchildren,'' a look at college students in the 1960s at the
beginning of the Vietnam War protests, was his biggest success. It
flopped on Broadway in 1972 but had a successful off-Broadway run
the following year and has been a staple of regional theaters and
acting classes ever since.
   ``Loose Ends'' examined the same generation 10 years later, when
they were struggling to sort out their lives and loves. It was a
harder play to write, Weller says.
   ``For one thing, I knew more,'' Weller says. ``The more
deliberate you are in your writing, the harder it is. When you're a
kid, you think no one's ever done this before. But the next time,
you realize it's been done a million times.''
   Weller didn't start out to be a writer. He wanted to be a
composer and studied music composition at Brandeis.
   ``I wasn't a good musician,'' he admits, but when an opportunity
came up to write a college musical, he enrolled in a playwriting
course. Writing eventually took precedence over composing and
Weller went off to England to study playwriting before eventually
coming back to the United States.
   A handwritten copy of ``Spoils of War'' lies on the desk in
Weller's study. The penmanship is small and precise.
   ``I write quite a bit every day but I hardly use any of it,''
the playwright says. ``I keep going back and poring over it,
pulling things out. In that way, I am very slow to select what I'm
finally going to use.''
   Weller's parents were both painters, so artistic discipline was
in his blood. And success wasn't what counted the most.
   ``I saw people who went off to their workshop every day and
painted,'' he recalls. ``For some of them, the glory train came in
and for others, it didn't. You couldn't allow that to hinder your
daily output. You couldn't allow yourself to get thrown by it.''
   For that reason, Weller, when he isn't helping take care of his
young son, keeps to a rigid writing schedule. He jots down in
notebooks ideas and notes for projects he will get to when he has
time.
   ``I think the only hard lesson is not to have any big
expectations,'' he says. ``Just concentrate on what you are doing
and get it right.''

   The Nazi occupation in World War II and a
lingering anti-Semitism left the Jews of France in disorder and
disarray _ so much so that many renounced their heritage and took
French names. But more recent years have seen a rebirth of Jewry in
a nation that is largely Roman Catholic, and a new era for Jews has
set in.

<TEXT>
   Friday is a busy day on the rue des Rosiers, a
narrow street in the heart of Paris' oldest Jewish quarter. It is
there that shoppers preparing for the Sabbath find everything from
kosher chickens to prayer books and sacramental wines.
   This colorful neighborhood, and many others like it throughout
predominantly Roman Catholic France, have come alive again as the
Jewish community revels in a new era of Jewish pride and an upsurge
of Judaism.
   Traumatized by World War II, which saw the virtual dismantling
of French Jewry and the deportation of some 117,000 Jews to Nazi
gas chambers, the community of guilt-ridden survivors lived in fear
of anti-Semitism and new persecutions.
   Many renounced their Jewish identities, changing their names,
refusing to circumcize newborn boys as prescribed by their faith or
to give their children Jewish educations.
   Today, those are just bad memories.
   Jews again are playing major roles in the upper levels of French
life _ government, industry, the intelligentsia, entertainment and
the media.
   The change is largely due to the 150,000 Sephardic Jews from
Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia who poured in during the 1950s and
1960s as the French colonies in North Africa gained independence.
   The Sephardim are Jews who originated in Spain in the Middle
Ages and who migrated to North Africa after the Spanish Inquisition
in 1492. Many also moved to the Middle East and the term now refers
to all Jews who are not of Askenazic, or Eastern European, origin.
   The Sephardim make up more than 60 percent of France's
population of 650,000 Jews, the world's fourth-largest Jewish
community after the United States, Israel and the Soviet Union.
   No one was as startled as today's Sephardic Jewish community
when word came from Washington earlier this year that they were
considered wretched enough to warrant $8 million in emergency
relief from the United States.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, one of the measure's
congressional backers, said the money for schools for North African
Jews in Paris was earmarked for ``these unfortunates, these Jews .
.. who have not been absorbed or assimilated.''
   The American funding, later cancelled by Congress, was to build
schools for Ozar Hatorah, a non-profit organization that promotes
education, assistance and charity in 20 countries.
   ``Globally, you can say that the integration of North African
Jews into French society has been a real success story,'' said
Emile Touati, director of Consistoire, the religious governing body
for French Jews.
   Besides their own folklore, culinary habits, tight-knit family
stucture and so-called ``Mediterranean mentality,'' North African
Jews brought their unconditional devotion to Judaism and a demand
for Jewish culture.
   In the past 15 years, the number of synagogues in the Paris
region has increased from 30 to 70. In 1950, Paris had just three
kosher butchers; today they number more than 100.
   Touati says it has become virtually impossible to keep track of
the dozens of restaurants, grocery stores, professional caterers,
supermarkets and fast-food outlets serving kosher fare. Before the
coming of the Sephardim, there were virtually none.
   ``There was a time when you couldn't even find a bottle of
kosher wine for the Sabbath meal,'' Touati said in an interview.
``Now, the finest chateaux in Burgundy, Bordeaux and Champagne
produce kosher wines which we export all over the world.''
   The ``pletzl'' in the Marais, a ghetto-like haven for poor
Askenazic Jews since the Middle Ages, has seen an influx of
Sephardim too, and the shops that once sold chopped liver and
gefilte fish have been joined by fast-food joints serving falafel
and kosher couscous.
   ``These places are filled with young people looking for their
Jewish identity and a sense of community,'' said Eric Ghebeli,
fomer president of France's Jewish Student Union. ``They are
mini-cultural centers where people get together to enjoy a dish
their mothers once made. But there is also a thirst for knowledge.''
   Enrollment in Jewish schools is higher than ever, with 10
percent of school-age children, about 15,000 enrolled full-time in
one of France's 33 Jewish schools. An equal number attend Sunday
school.
   A century ago the watchword was assimilation. Today, it is the
preservation of Jewishness among France's 55.5 million people. The
Lucien de Hirch school, founded in the early 1900s to help new
immigrants adapt to French life, has done an about face: today it
teaches the principles of Judaism to its 850 students, 75 percent
of whom are North African Sephardim.
   Since the arrival of the Sephardim, more than 6,000 study
groups, with different goals and religious tendencies, have sprung
up around the country, along with countless adult education courses
teaching Hebrew and Yiddish.
   In a country where Jews have long believed that flaunting their
Jewishness was asking for trouble, the Lubavitch, ultra-orthodox
Hasidic Jews originating in 18th century Poland, have seen their
memberships swell, thanks to new Sephardic recruits.
   Dressed in long black coats, wearing beards and earlocks, some
have even learned Yiddish to read in the original the works of
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, head of the sect who lives in the
Brownsville section of Brooklyn, N.Y. In December they plastered
billboards around Paris with posters telling Jews to light Hanukkah
candles and installed a giant menorah at the Place de la Concorde.
   Jews around France can tune in to any of 13 radio stations
playing Hebrew and Yiddish songs and broadcasting cultural programs
and news commentaries. The three Paris stations claim a daily
audience of 37,000.
   Jewish publications also have more readers than ever. Numerous
weeklies are distributed free in Jewish centers and shops. The
monthly ``L'Arche,'' geared to France's educated middle class,
reaches 10,000 subscribers. It was joined in December by
``Passages,'' a magazine offering what it calls a Jewish point of
view on the news.

   The Jewish community as a whole has been deeply troubled by the
recent events on the Israeli-occupied West Bank in the Middle East.
   ``We deplore the violence, but our support of Israel is
unconditional,'' said Roger Pinto, president of SIONA, a Zionist
group made up of North African Sephardim. ``Unlike many Askenazim,
we support Israel first, and then ask questions.''
   In a recent statement, an umbrella organization of Jewish
institutions known as CRIF, reiterated its support of Israel and
condemned its Arab neighbors for ``refusing a real and useful
dialogue ... to solve the problems of the region.''
   In an editorial in the monthly ``Information Juive,'' the
Consistoire's Touati asked, ``Under the circumstances, what army in
the world would have behaved better than Tsahal (the Israeli
army)?''
   Nonetheless, nearly a dozen Jewish groups have publicly called
for a peaceful and political solution to the violence.
   (The French government strives for even-handedness in relations
with Israel and the Arab nations of the Middle East, where
historical ties translate today into what France considers
``special relationships'' with several of the Arab nations. France
supports the convening of an international conference with all
parties represented to resolve the Middle East conflict.)
   Many French intellectuals of Jewish origin have begun
identifying with Judaism, some for the first time.
   Benny Levy, militant founder of the Proletarian Left and close
friend and secretary of the author-philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in
the years before his death, has abandoned politics completely and
embraced a life of piety and study of the Torah, Judaism's Holy
Scriptures.
   Philosopher Jacques Derrida, the father of Deconstruction, a
textual analysis based on the theory that language refers to
itself, has been discussing Jewish and Biblical themes in seminars
at the elite Ecole Normale Superieure and at Yale University in New
Haven, Conn., for several years.
   Intellectuals Bernard-Henri Levy, Andre Gluckmann and Alain
Finkielkraut, once committed leftists and later the major force
behind the New Philosophy movement of the mid-1970s, are among
France's most visible Jews, publicly rediscovering their Jewish
roots, writing on Jewish issues and supporting Jewish causes.
   But for Joseph Sitruk, France's newly installed Grand Rabbi,
they are hardly examples of what he calls in Hebrew ``teshuva,'' or
return.
   ``Many of them are interested in Judaism the same way they would
be interested in Buddhism or Leninism,'' he said in an interview.
``They may be going through an identity crisis, and that's
respectable, but they're not calling themselves into question and
going all the way.''
   Rabbi Michael Williams, of the ``liberal'' Copernic synagogue,
said he understands the cyncism of the religious establishment.
   ``How can the so-called return be anything but superficial when
its standard-bearers don't respect the very basic rules of Judaism,
and marry out?''
   Williams maintains that French Jews are ``going through an
intense crisis of love.'' He says he regularly meets with observant
young people planning to marry Gentiles.
   Indeed, studies show that intermarriage is on the rise, at about
50 percent. Among the Sephardim, the figures are only slightly
lower.
   ``The family structure among North African Jews is still quite
strong, and plays an important role in influencing decisions made
by family members,'' Touati said. ``The increase in intermarriage
is one of the consequences of rapid assimilation and integration
into French society.''
   Yet Sitruk maintains the current upsurge in Judaism is not
superficial but profound, touching all classes and backrounds, rich
and poor.
   ``It comes in the wake of the Holocaust, the birth of the state
of Israel, the new positions of power held by Jews worldwide and
the profound and far-reaching need to identify with the Jewish
Biblical message,'' Sitruk said.
   Reform Jews too, have been swept up in the trend towards
orthodoxy. Five years ago, Friday night services at Copernic,
France's largest reform community, were mostly in French. Today,
three-quarters of the service is in Hebrew.
   ``There is definitely an unspoken demand for a return to Jewish
knowledge and values,'' Williams said. ``But we must be careful
that it doesn't come at the expense of a new ghetto-like
mentality.''

<HEAD>AP SPOTLIGHT: French Jews _ Anti-Semitism on the Wane</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One of a three-story package</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the conviction of the army officer Alfred
Dreyfus nearly 100 years ago to the French police zealously
rounding up Jews during World War II, France has a long and sordid
history of anti-Semitism.
   Today, however, Jewish leaders say it is on the wane.
   The bombing of the Copernic synagogue in 1980 and a terrorist
attack on a kosher-style delicatessen two years later were not the
work of Frenchmen, but of Palestinian terrorists, who are still at
large.
   According to the B'nai Brith Anti-Defamation League office in
Paris, the number of anti-Semitic acts of violence has dropped
considerably in recent years. In 1986, it recorded two, though the
desecration and vandalism of Jewish tombstones remains frequent.
   Recent polls indicate that Jews are better accepted than ever
before in France. In 1946, 37 percent of the population thought
Jews were like any other French citizens. In 1987, that figure rose
to 94 percent.
   ``I certainly look Jewish when I walk down the street,'' said
Joseph Sitruk, France's Grand Rabbi. ``I've been in Marseilles for
the past 12 years and have heard only two remarks. That's two too
many, of course, but not very much.''
   Nevertheless, French Jews remain vigilant and many express
concern over the growing popularity of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of
the extreme right-wing National Front that rallies roughly 10
percent of French voters around an anti-immigrant
``France-for-Frenchmen'' platform.
   Le Pen prides himself on ``saying out loud what everybody thinks
to himself.'' He caused a storm of controversy last year by
referring to the Nazi gas chambers as ``a detail,'' adding their
existence was still being ``debated by historians.''
   For decades French Jews didn't like themselves much either.
   ``Anatole France summed up a whole mentality when he said that
if Alfred Dreyfus had been on his jury, he would have convicted
himself,'' said Rabbi Michael Williams of the Copernic synagogue.
   Robert Goldman, spokesman for the B'nai Brith Anti-Defamation
League, says the age-old cliches of the Jew as the dangerous,
money-hungry foreigner with the long noses are dead, but they have
been replaced by anti-Zionism.
   He called French press coverage of violence in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank biased and said Israel has taken an
``excessive drubbing.''
   ``Being harsher in judging Israel than other Western countries
is a new form of discrimination,'' Goldman said. ``It deeply
affects Jews in the diaspora, given the role Israel plays in the
minds of Jews after the Holocaust.''

<HEAD>Italians Dote on Children but They are Having Fewer of Them</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheel a baby down any street in Italy and you'll
never walk alone.
   Fussing over children seems like a national pasttime, but if
present trends continue Italians will have fewer and fewer toddlers
to dote on.
   To the concern of politicians and sociologists, the Italian
family is steadily shrinking. The latest statistics say each family
has an average of 1.27 children, the lowest in Europe.
   ``Children are still king in Italy. But, these days, one king is
enough, not two or three,'' said Renato Tagliani, a father who has
just one little emperor in his household, 11-year-old,
chubby-cheeked Gianbattista.
   Family is practically a sacred institution in Italy. It's
certainly the most enduring one in a country that has seen invaders
conquer and crumple and governments rise and fall.
   ``The value of family as an institution hasn't changed,'' said
Lorella Spinelli, a 30-year-old Roman, who had her first child in
the fall. ``But to create a world for children these days is very
difficult.''
   Fingers point to the slow but steady changing of women's roles,
the difficulty of finding jobs and housing and the irritations of
daily life that are particularly Italian and particularly
frustrating if you want to have children.
   ``To have more children signifies being penalized, suffering the
lack of services, inadequate salaries,'' said demographer Antonio
Golini, who directs a national center for population research.
   What's especially intriguing is that surveys show the practice
of birth control is low in Italy compared to other Western European
countries.
   ``Less than 12 percent of women use the pill, more than 60
percent don't use any contraceptive,'' said Panorama, an Italian
news weekly, in a recent issue.
   ``Are Italians not making love any more? Have they all become
sterile?''
   Studies are under way here to see if Italians are indeed
becoming infertile.
   For Laura Spinelli, just starting out as a parent, and Renato
Tagliani, with more than a decade of experience, the reluctance of
so many Italians to be parents once, let alone more than once,
seems understandable.
   ``Having children once was the goal of an Italian woman's life.
You married, had kids, stayed at home,'' said Mrs. Spinelli.
   ``Now the role of women is more like men's. You go to university
and finish when you're 25 or 26. Then it's usually a year or so
before you find a job. Once you find one, you're reluctant to leave
it to have a child.''
   Her husband's success in business allowed her to give up her job
after childbirth, but he's on the road a lot.
   ``I'm lucky to have my mother at home,'' Mrs. Spinelli said.
   Her 67-year-old mother helps with the care of grandson Luca.
   ``I have a friend whose mother lives on the opposite end of the
city,'' Mrs. Spinelli said. ``She leaves her 7-month-old baby with
her mother all week because with all the traffic it would take her
too long to get there and back.''
   Such daily trials mean ``nonna'' (grandmother) is rapidly
replacing ``mama'' as the anchor of the Italian household.
   Nonna is in special demand because babysitters are hard to find
and can be expensive.
   Many Italians won't let their teen-agers work because they are
obsessed with ``brutta figura'' _ making a bad impression _ and
neighbors might gossip that your children have to work because you
don't earn enough.
   With no grandma handy, the Taglianis, a two-career couple with
their own business, a media agency, feel the shortage of
babysitters daily.
   ``Italian schools close at 1:30 p.m. So where do you put your
child when he gets out?'' said Clemenzia Tagliani.
   In Italy, stores are closed at lunchtime, in the evening and on
Sundays and public schools are open Saturday mornings.
   ``So if you have to buy a pair of shoes for your son you drag
him out of school on Saturday, when you're off, and make a mad dash
to the store before they pull down their shutters at 1 p.m.,'' Mrs.
Tagliani said.
   Miriam Mafai, a journalist who has written extensively on
Italian women, finds it curious that an overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic country, where the pill was illegal until the early 1970s
and where Christian Democrats are the dominant party, doesn't have
a policy to make it easier to raise a family.
   Some political debate has begun about what to do, but so far no
legislation has been adopted.
   Among suggestions are financial incentives, but none so
ambitious as the family program in neighboring France. Gen. Charles
de Gaulle, after becoming president in 1959, used monthly
allowances to encourage the French to have more children. The
result is that a French couple with two children today collects
more than 1,200 francs (about $200) a month from the government.
   Ms. Mafai said such ideas invoke the ``stigma'' of Benito
Mussolini, Italy's fascist dictator who tried to swell the
population for his glory, his army and his dreamed-of imperial
colonies.
   ``War is to man what motherhood is to woman,'' Mussolini once
said. He introduced family allowances in the 1930s and made
bachelors pay a heavy tax. But the birth rate actually fell for
several years under his rule.
   Golini, the demographer, predicts Italy's child population will
swell in the next few years, but that will be only a consequence of
the 1960s economics boom babies reaching child-bearing age.
   ``In the first six months of '86, the average number of children
per family was 1.33; at the end of the year, we went down to 1.32.
In '87, in the same period, the average was 1.29; in December,
1.27. You see, we're always going down.''
   ``But remove the cause and Italy will grow again,'' Golini said.

<HEAD>Singapore's Historic Raffles Hotel Getting New Lease on Life</HEAD>

   It's the kind of place Englishmen left to join
mad dogs in the noonday sun or perhaps strike out on the road to
Mandalay. The more sensible sat around sipping Singapore Slings.
   It's Raffles Hotel, which has survived for 102 years _ ceiling
fans still whirring, grillwork elevator clanking up and down, dark
paneling and long corridors with creaking floors, wide verandas and
elderly waiters shuffling around the Palm Court garden.
   Dear as it was to the hearts of many, Raffles in recent times
has become a bit seedy, and the talk was that it would come down
because the land on which it sits is extremely valuable. One plan
to renovate it was scrapped in 1983 because tourism had slumped and
thousands of rooms in Singapore's more modern hotels stood empty.
   But another chance has come for the legendary Raffles, with the
announcement by its owners that it will be restored to some
semblance of its old self in a two-year, $27.3-million face lift.
   A tourist industry study two years ago had suggested that the
``national asset'' might make it if turned into a suites-only
establishment for state guests and VIPs.
   The 127-room hotel will remain open during the renovation, which
will be done in phases, according to the bankers that now own it.
   The central block will remain but the old ballroom and courtyard
wing are to be demolished to make way for a basement parking
garage, function rooms and a bedroom wing.
   Raffles is in many respects the antithesis of a standard modern
hotel, with its French Renaissance architecture and palm trees all
around.
   The atmosphere is still tropically relaxed, but with a residual
whiff of stiff-upper-lip British colonial.
   Raffles dates to the early 1800s, when it was founded as a
``tiffin house,'' or lunchroom in a private home. The actual hotel
in Beach Road was started in 1886 by three Armenian brothers and
named for the founder of Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles.
   By the turn of the century it was the social center in a key
outpost of the British Empire. Rubber planters, merchants, military
officers, ships' captains, remittance men and other colonials
stayed there. The years have left legends.
   One says that C.M. Phillips, the principal of a nearby school,
was summoned in 1902 to shoot a tiger that had taken refuge under
the billiard table at the hotel. A stuffed tiger on the premises
keep that legend alive today. Then, there's the hotel's Tiger
Tavern, which serves the locally brewed Tiger Beer.
   Bartender Ngian Tong Doon is credited with mixing the first
Singapore Sling 73 years ago. The hotel sells more than 1,000
glasses of the gin-based cocktail each day.
   Lounge lizards who kept their elbows on the bar gave Cad's Alley
its name. It was later changed to Gin's Alley to honor bartender
Ngian and his concoction.
   Another legend has it that Joseph Conrad got the idea for ``Lord
Jim'' while on the veranda reading a newspaper story about a
British crew that abandoned ship and left 200 passengers to die.
   ``Feed at Raffles when visiting Singapore,'' was Rudyard
Kipling`s advice. But he found the beds less than comfortable and
suggested sleeping elsewhere.
   Those were the days of awesome appetites and massive meals. One
dinner menu surviving from 1900 lists 18 courses.
   A typical breakfast of that period: porridge, fish, mutton
chops, deviled fowl, cold beef, salad, boiled eggs, cheese, toast,
tea or coffee and Benedictine.
   When Japanese bombers attacked at the start of World War II,
Raffles' band played on in the ballroom behind blackout curtains.
Singapore surrendered to the Japanese on Feb. 15, 1942, and with
occupation imminent the staff buried the hotel's silver in the Palm
Court garden.
   Hotel records show high-ranking officers of Japan's occupation
army lived there. When the war ended in 1945, former inmates of
Changi Prison and other Japanese internment camps were taken in by
the hotel. The silver was dug up and Raffles reopened for business
again in 1946.
   Somerset Maugham, the late British novelist and short-story
writer, once had said Raffles ``stands for all the fables of the
exotic East.''
   The hotel uses that as its motto today and has a plaque outside
one of its rooms in Maugham's his honor.

<HEAD>Merlin Olsen Plays Amish Father Facing Modern World</HEAD>

   Here's a switch: the two-hour movie pilot for
NBC's ``Aaron's Way'' is set in Pennsylvania and California, but it
was filmed in Australia.
   ``We had to have a grape harvest when we filmed it last March,''
said Merlin Olsen, who stars in the new series as Aaron Miller.
   ``We were able to duplicate parts of California and Pennsylvania
in southeastern Australia. We shot the entire pilot there. We did
all the episodes at the Lorimar Studios and in the Santa Ynez
Valley near Solvang. We have our own grape vineyard and home
there.''
   Olsen stars in ``Aaron's Way'' as an Amish farmer who is
suddenly forced to leave his sect and confront the modern world.
Miller leaves his peaceful Pennsylvania Amish village to run a
California vineyard, yet tries as much as possible to cling to his
religion and his traditions.
   The series also stars Belinda Montgomery (early ``Miami Vice''),
Jessica Walter (``Play Misty for Me'') and Kathleen York. The
series is from William Blinn and Jerry Thorpe, producers of NBC's
``Our House.'' Blinn, who wrote ``Brian's Song'' and co-wrote
``Roots,'' wrote the pilot with Reno Down.
   The series is in the tradition of ``Little House on the
Prairie,'' ``The Waltons'' and ``Our House,'' although Olsen said
it's probably slanted more toward adults.
   The pilot premiered last week. The hour-long series begins a
spring tryout on Wednesday.
   It's the fourth series for the 6-foot-5 Olsen, selected to the
Pro Football Hall of Fame after being an All-Pro defensive tackle
for the Los Angeles Rams. For several years he has been an NBC
football analyst, and is probably best known as the spokesman for
the FTD florists group.
   Immediately after retiring from pro football, Olsen became
Jonathan Garvey on ``Little House on the Prairie'' in 1977 and
stayed for four years. He then starred for a year in ``Father
Murphy,'' a spinoff series. Another series, ``Fathers and Sons,''
ran briefly in 1986.
   In the pilot, Miller goes to California after his son Noah, who
has left the Amish ways, is drowned in a surfing accident. There he
learns that Noah had a common-law wife who is pregnant and owns a
vineyard that needs to be harvested.
   ``Aaron feels that he must help her and the whole family shows
up on her doorstep one day,'' he said. ``I say that we just happen
to be in the neighborhood. Although he's Amish, Aaron is a man
who's looked over the fence and accepted some things that are not
Amish if they suit the needs and lifestyle of his family.''
   Olsen said he knows that the Amish want to be left alone and
were unhappy about how they were portrayed in the movie ``Witness.''
   ``We did some research because it's our desire and our
responsibility to present the Amish as honest and as respectfully
as we can,'' he said. ``But the Amish, like any other faith, have
members with different levels of adherence. Aaron Miller was in
danger of being `shunned' because he kept in contact with his son.''
   Olsen said the show would deal with many contemporary and adult
problems. Many of the problems will arise from Miller trying to
hold onto his traditions, yet having to make concessions to
survive. ``It will ask very serious questions about the values and
morals of an old world family suddenly brought face to face with
the modern world,'' he said.
   He concedes that his role as Aaron Miller is not that different
from Jonathan Garvey on ``Little House'' or John Murphy on ``Father
Murphy.''
   ``It's deliberate in a way,'' he said. ``There are some things
I'm not eager to do. On the other hand, these are roles that came
looking for me. Partly because of my size. It reminds me of what
happened when I first went out for football. The coach asked me
what position I wanted to play. I said quarterback. The coach took
one look at me and told me to play tackle.
   ``I don't think I'm being stereotyped. Each role is different,
but there is a thread of similarity. I want to do roles that I can
sit down and watch with my children. I want to be able to point to
the screen and say, `That's your father.' I'm afraid there's a lot
of things on TV I wouldn't want to watch.''
   Olsen said he filmed 13 episodes of ``Aaron's Way'' while
continuing his full schedule of sportscasting for NBC's pro
football coverage. ``That was a tough fall,'' he said. ``I don't
want to do that again. If the show is picked up I'm going to have
some conversations with NBC Sports about cutting back,'' he said.
``I love doing this show. I look forward to getting up in the
morning and going to work. I love working with Belinda Montgomery
and Jessica Walter.''

   Western banks and Brazil have reached agreement
on important elements of a loan restructuring package for the Third
World's most indebted country, providing it with more money at
lower interest rates.
   Banking sources familiar with the agreement say the negotiations
reflected a surprising level of cooperation from Brazil, which last
year toughened its position over loan repayment terms and aroused
considerable concern in the banking industry.
   Fernando Milliet, president of Brazil's central bank, and
William R. Rhodes, chairman of the Bank Advisory Committee for
Brazil, said Sunday that under the agreement reached in New York,
Brazil will get more than $6 billion in new financing to help make
debt payments through the first half of 1989.

   Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in
January, but a decline in energy costs cloaked increases in many
other areas, the government said.
   The January increase reported Friday in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index followed a revised December increase of 0.2
percent. The December rise initially been reported as 0.1 percent.
   The advance equaled an annual inflation rate of 4.2 percent.
That compares with the 4.4 percent rate of inflation in 1987 and
with the Reagan administration's projection of 4.3 percent
inflation for 1988.

drop which pushed activity to its slowest level in 2{ years,
according to a real estate trade group.
   The National Association of Realtors said Friday that sales
dropped to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 3.21 million units
last month, following declines of 1.2 percent in December and 2.9
percent in November.
   The association said consumer fears raised by the collapse of
the stock market in October partly caused the slowdown.

both categories during December.
   The gains were taken as positive signs that consumer spending

   U.S. companies surveyed by the government
reported a loss of $23.8 billion in 1986 because of foreign piracy
of U.S. patents, trademarks and copyrights, according to a U.S.
International Trade Commission study.
   The ITC said Friday that actual losses are much greater because
not all companies filled out questionnaires on the subject.
   The commission said it received responses from 431 companies.
The questionnaire was sent to 736 U.S. companies, including all
those on the Fortune 500 list.

   Champion Spark Plug Co. plans to lay off
nearly 20 percent of its 1,700 production workers nationwide
because of overcapacity in the auto parts industry.
   The bulk of the cuts announced Friday, which will begin March 22
and will be phased in over the next four months, are being made at
the plant here.
   The layoffs come just one month after workers at four U.S.
Champion plants approved a new four-year contract that includes a
provision that the company try to increase production at two of its
domestic plants.

   Three companies accused of selling thousands of
pounds of non-kosher poultry as kosher to customers in up to 22
states have agreed in a legal settlement to get out of the kosher
business.
   ``We wanted to make sure something like this never happened
again,'' said Rabbi Victor Segal, president of Goldman-Segal Kosher
Caterers of Chicago, which had accused the three companies of fraud
in a federal lawsuit.
   Segal said Friday it was the largest case of fraud involving
mislabeling of kosher foods, and potentially affected Jewish
families in 22 states where the companies' kosher poultry products
were sold.

<TEXT>
   Western banks and Brazil have reached agreement
on important elements of a loan restructuring package for the Third
World's most indebted country, providing it with more money at
lower interest rates.
   Banking sources familiar with the agreement, who spoke on the
condition they not be identified by name, said the negotiations
reflected a surprising level of cooperation from Brazil, which last
year toughened its position over loan repayment terms and aroused
considerable concern in the banking industry.
   Fernando Milliet, president of Brazil's central bank, and
William R. Rhodes, chairman of the Bank Advisory Committee for
Brazil, said Sunday that under the agreement reached in New York,
Brazil will get more than $6 billion in new financing to help make
debt payments through the first half of 1989.
   Both sides also agreed that the interest rate for repaying that
money will be 13-16ths of 1 percent over the London Interbank
Offered Rate, a commonly used benchmark for determining foreign
debt payments. Brazil has been paying 1[ percent above the
so-called Libor rate because of its high-risk status.
   Under the agreement, Brazil also will make a payment next week
of about $700 million from its reserves to cover unpaid interest on
foreign bank loans for January and February, Milliet and Rhodes
said in a press statement.
   ``The amount of (delinquent) interest they're paying is
considerably more than the market had expected,'' said one source
knowledgable about the negotiations. ``The market had expected they
would wrap up the month of January, but they're adding the month of
February. They're starting to make interest payments more often and
in larger amounts than we'd foreseen.''
   Concerned about its deteriorating economy and reliance on
outside money, Brazil hasn't repaid any principal on its $114
billion foreign debt since 1983. In February 1987 it decreed a
moratorium on interest payments but late last year agreed to resume
them.
   With the agreement announced Sunday, the country's interest
payments will be current for all 1988 and the last quarter of 1987.
Brazil still owes back-interest from Feb. 20, 1987, when it first
declared the moratorium, up to Sept. 30, 1987.
   Plans for repaying the remaining delinquent interest are still
under negotiation as part of a broad plan to restructure a foreign
bank financing package for Brazil.
   The banking sources said the package should be ready by the time
a meeting of foreign bank creditors and Latin debtor nations
convenes March 20 in Caracas, Venezuela.
   ``This accord marks the end of a period of great uncertainty,''
Brazil's Finance Minister Mailson de Nobrega told a news conference
in Brasilia. ``We should have all the details smoothed out by the
end of March.''
   The agreement also is expected to help Brazil in negotiations
with the International Monetary Fund that were scheduled to begin
Monday in Washington. Brazil was expected to ask the IMF for $1.7
billion in standby loans.
   Rhodes said in the statement that the negotiations and the $700
million interest payment represent ``significant progress in
restoring Brazil's traditionally good relations with its commercial
bank creditors.''
   About 25 perent of Brazil's foreign bank debt is held by U.S.
lenders. Concern about the country's ability or willingness to
repay has caused many U.S. banks to reclassify some loans as
possibly uncollectable and raised concern about the health of banks
with large Brazilian loan portfolios.
   Negotiations over restructuring Brazil's loan repayments began
in October between Brazilian finance officials and the 14-member
bank advisory committee, which represents 700 creditor banks.

<HEAD>A California County's Only Bank Makes Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN GRUBB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MARKLEEVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Alpine County's main
industries is a silver mine, but neither silver ore nor a gold mine
of ski business are enough to keep the county's only bank from
checking out.
   Bank of America will close its Markleeville branch tonight, 30
years after the county tax collector cajoled the banking giant to
set up shop in California's least populated county.
   The bank says the closure is a cost-cutting move forced by keen
competition following deregulation of the banking industry. It
promises to continue serving Alpine County customers at its South
Lake Tahoe Branch, about 35 miles away.
   The move angers many customers, who lament bygone days when
resident bank managers would open the bank and approve loans after
hours, attend neighborhood potlucks and host an annual holiday
buffet in this Sierra Nevada community.
   They claim the bank would have done well in the county had it
made efforts to secure accounts such as the Kirkwood ski resort and
the Washoe Indian tribe. Now, Alpine is the only one of
California's 58 counties without a bank.
   ``It's not the community failing the bank,'' said Don Jardine,
one of five members of the Alpine County Board of Supervisors.
``It's the bank failing to aggressively go out and just provide
basic services.''
   Corporate spokesman Richard Beebe said ``it's not our intention
to abandon anyone.''
   Beebe said Alpine County clients won't see any interruption in
their accounts and will be able to do much of their banking,
including loan applications, by telephone.
   Although some customers are grumbling they'll bank in Nevada, 20
minutes away by car, the county doesn't have that option.
   State law requires that local governments bank in California.
Alpine county, which has cash assets of $3 million and an annual
budget of $5 million, is considering hiring an armed transport
service for $70 a trip to deposit its money at South Lake Tahoe.
   Dee Rudden, who moved here two years ago from San Jose with her
husband, Bob, and bought the Markleeville General Store, said the
bank's closing ``is really going to be a problem for everyone.
   ``I guess what we're going to do is buy a safe,'' Rudden said.
``We're going to have to do something.''
   In Markleeville, the economy seems as slow as the pace of life.
Welcome signs on the edge of town boast a population of 165 in a
county of 1,200 people. Work is seasonal at the silver mine, four
miles south of town.
   Doranna Tognotti, deputy treasurer-tax collector, said the
estimated $755,00 it would cost to start a new bank in Alpine
County may be prohibitive.
   ``You can't help but wonder if we're going to end up being a
ghost town,'' she said.

<HEAD>Goverment Boosts Minimum Wage 3 Percent Under Anti-Inflation Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mexican government said it would raise by
3 percent the minimum daily wage in March and freeze officially
regulated prices under its inflation-fighting program.
   It also said the value of the peso currency against the dollar
would be maintained in March at the level reached today. The
government had been paring the currency's value by 3 pesos per
trading day.
   ``The national motto is no increase in prices in the month of
March,'' President Miguel de la Madrid said Sunday, in announcing
that the government was stepping up the pace of its anti-inflation
program.
   He said the decision was made after fresh inflation figures
showed ``an important de-acceleration'' in February.
   The inflation tally for February, he said, will be about half
the record 15.5 percent posted in January. Consumer prices rose 8.7
percent in the first half of this month, the government reported
last Wednesday.
   In outlining inflation-fighting steps for March, the
presidential office said the prices of government-produced and
-controlled goods and services, such as gasoline, telephones and
electricity, will be frozen.
   Private companies, it said, will be urged to absorb the increase
in the minimum wage and not pass it along to consumers in the form
of higher prices.
   Moreover, it said, the government will push ahead with plans to
reduce the government's red-ink spending.
   The government had been expected to announce over the weekend a
target for boosting wages and prices in March, under an indexation
plan scheduled to go into effect on Tuesday.
   Under that plan, wages and prices of government-regulated goods
and services were to be increased by a set amount, based on
projected inflation.
   But officials decided instead to raise only the minimum wage,
which will move from 7,765 pesos a day to just under 8,000 pesos,
or about $3.50 at the current exchange rate. The higher pay will go
into effect Tuesday.
   The small increase dealt a setback to labor. Labor officials had
called for a gain of at least 10 percent to help workers keep pace
with the sharp rise in prices in recent months.
   But during a meeting at the presidential office, labor chief
Fidel Velazquez said he believed the fresh steps would help
``attack inflation.'' He said workers had, once again, ``placed the
interests of the country ahead of their own interests.''
   The inflation rate in all of last year was a record 159.2
percent, up sharply from the 105.7 percent of 1986.
   De la Madrid unveiled the anti-inflation program, called the
Economic Solidarity Pact, in mid-December in an effort to prevent
the nation from spinning into hyper-inflation. Officials have
predicted that the plan will reduce the monthly inflation rate to
just 1 percent to 2 percent by year's end.
   As part of the Solidarity Pact, the government authorized sharp
increases in the prices of a variety of officially controlled goods
and services, which kicked up costs throughout the economy.
   The exchange rate on Friday was 2,270 pesos to the dollar in the
controlled market, which is regulated by the government and used in
about 75 percent of commercial transactions.
   The rate in free-market trading, used in tourism and
transactions along the U.S.-Mexico border, was 2,327 pesos to the
dollar.
   In February, the Bank of Mexico, the central bank, sliced the
currency's value by an average of 3 pesos per working day. The rate
had held fairly steady from mid-December to February.

<HEAD>Japan's January Auto Exports Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese automakers exported 9.1 percent fewer
cars, trucks and buses in January, largely because the yen's rise
against the dollar shrank shipments to the United States, an
industry association announced Monday.
   Exports to the United States dropped 19.4 percent from a year
earlier to 199,904 units, according to the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association.
   Japanese companies exported a total 524,785 units in January.
   An association spokesman, who requested anonymity, said there
was no single reason for the drop in shipments to the U.S. market.
He added that the higher value of the yen, which makes cars
exported from Japan more costly to American buyers, was an
important factor.
   The United States is the largest market for Japanese car exports.
   Exports to the United States in the first 10 months of fiscal
1987, which ends in March, were down 5.4 percent compared with a
year earlier, to 1.978 million units.
   Total exports to the U.S. market for fiscal 1987 will probably
not exceed the 2.3 million unit quota set in Japan's voluntary
export restrictions, the spokesman said.

   The stock market staged a broad advance today,
making another run toward new highs for the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 11.27 to
2,034.48 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 699 up, 340 down and
490 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.56 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street. But more than half of that activity came in a
few high-yielding stocks, representing plays on their impending
dividends.
   Analysts said optimistic traders still had their sights set on
the 2,051.89 level in the Dow Jones industrial average, where it
closed Jan. 7 for its highest closing reading since the crash last
October.
   The average failed in a bid to surpass that point last week, but
brokers argued that it might be ready to make another try.
   One concern facing the market is the report due Tuesday from the
Commerce Department on the index of leading economic indicators for
January.
   Analysts generally expect the figure to show a decline. But the
firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. said the 0.2 percent drop
originally reported for December might be revised to show a gain.
   That would mean that the index would no longer have a string of
three consecutive monthly declines, a phenomenon which is
traditionally regarded as a potential recession warning.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up { at
44[; Eastman Kodak, up ] at 42~; International Business Machines,
up ] at 116[, and American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 29\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.89 to 148.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .43 at 284.75.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.64 to
2,023.21, finishing the week with a net gain of 8.62 points.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 5 to 4 on the NYSE,
with 804 up, 655 down and 483 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled
158.06 million shares, down from 213.89 million in the previous
session.

<HEAD>Continental Seeking To Put Hub In West Berlin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines is seeking to open a hub in
West Berlin to serve destinations in West Germany and others parts
of Europe.
   An application has been filed with air attaches in West Berlin
for permission to serve several West German cities, including
Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Cologne and Dusseldorf, and flights to London
and Paris, said C.W. ``Pete'' Runnette, vice president of
Continental's international division.
   The proposal was filed 10 days ago and is expected to be acted
on in several months, the Houston Chronicle reported today.
   ``We feel there is a lot of opportunity in West Berlin right
now,'' Runnette said. ``Continental is considering expansion in
Europe, and West Berlin seems like a suitable entree. We will bring
low-cost, high-quality service to the European market.''
   Under the proposal, Continental would use Airbus 300s and
737-300s in West Berlin, with four flights a day to Munich, seven
to Frankfurt, and five to Dusseldorf, Stuttgart and Cologne.
   Two flights a day to London's Gatwick would also be scheduled,
in addition to service from West Berlin to Paris.
   The West Berlin-London route would connect with the carrier's
non-stop London service from Houston, Miami, Denver and Newark,
N.J., as well as its Newark to Paris flight.
   Under an agreement signed at the close of World War II, only
American, French and British airlines can land in West Berlin,
which is the non-Communist part of the divided city in East Germany.
   The air attaches for the United States, Britain and France
control the west half of the divided city and regulate air routes
and fares, and those three will make a decision on who obtains West
Berlin service, Runnette said.
   Pan American, the major American carrier in and out of West
Berlin, is developing a hub at West Berlin's Tegel airport. Trans
World Airlines and American Airlines have sought permission for
flights in West Berlin, and Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines
are also reported to be interested in gaining rights to fly from
West Berlin, the Chronicle reported.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Reagan
administration for its opinion of a ruling that states indirectly
may tax interest paid to financial institutions from investments in
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) bonds.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before saying whether it will review fully a challenge to a
Maryland bank franchise tax.
   The Maryland National Bank challenged the tax, seeking a refund
of $197,310 it paid under protest to the state for the years 1979
through 1982.
   During that period, the bank reported $2.82 million in interest
from FHLB bonds.
   The sum was included in the bank's net earnings that were
subject to Maryland's franchise tax, which is imposed on financial
institutions for the privilege of doing business in Maryland.
   The difficulty over whether earnings from FHLB bonds are taxable
arises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws.
   The 1932 law that created the FHLB generally exempts the bonds
from taxes.
   But a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a
``non-discriminatory franchise tax'' on ``stocks and obligations of
the United States government'' that generally are exempt from state
and local taxes.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the state franchise tax,
ruling in October that the 1862 law takes precedence.
   The state court based its ruling in part on a 1975 opinion by
the general counsel's office of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   The state court said a franchise tax paid for the privilege of
doing business in the state is not the same as a direct tax on a
bank's income.
   The state court also said the tax does not violate the
Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which binds states to adhere to
federal law.
   The case is Maryland National Bank vs. State Department of
Assessments, 87-1080.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual
fund firm, today announced plans to lay off about 800 workers, with
more than 70 percent of the cuts in its Boston area offices.
   The company attributed the 10.5 percent workforce reduction to a
slump in new stock transactions and slower money management
business since the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   The layoffs, to take effect immediately, include 530 workers in
Greater Boston, about 150 in Dallas and about 50 in New York, said
Fidelity spokeswoman Karen Ernst.
   The remainder of the cuts will come from other offices around
the country, she said.
   The action reduces Fidelity's nationwide staff to approximately
6,850, about the same number of workers employed by the firm in
mid-1987. Since the early 1980s, Fidelity experienced significant
growth as the economy improved.
   Most of the layoffs were from corporate staff department and
``volume-sensitive'' areas, such as telephone representatives and
order takers, said the corporate announcement. No investment
personnel were effected.
   Fidelity, which operates 54 offices in the United States,
presently manages about $80 billion in assets, down from a peak of
about $85 billion in mid-1987.
   The company dismissed about 300 part-time and 50 fill-time
workers Feb. 11, including 50 in Boston and 125 each in Dallas and
Salt Lake City.
   Earlier this year, Fidelity laid off 32 workers at investment
centers nationwide.
   Among Fidelity's other services include discount stock brokerage
and institutional pension management.
   Eric Kobern, a former Fidelity employee who publishes an
independent newsletter that monitors the company, predicts future
layoffs if business does not accelerate.
   ``This is a first step,'' said Kobern. ``I would not be
surprised if we see further cuts after the IRA season if business
stays at the same pace. This may be the first round of cuts, and
they will digest it and see how they are doing then proceed with
others.''

   Stop & Shop Cos. Inc. announced today it would go
private in a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. The deal could thwart Dart Group Inc.'s attempt to
take over the supermarket and department store chain.
   The buyout agreement, signed after several days of negotiations
between Stop & Shop directors and several interested firms, calls
for a Kohlberg Kravis subsidiary, SSC Holdings Corp., to purchase
all 28 million outstanding Stop & Shop shares at $44 each, Stop &
Shop said in a statement.
   Kohlberg Kravis is an investment company specializing in
management-led acquisitions, including the $6.2 billion leveraged
buyout of Beatrice Cos. in 1986. In a leveraged buyout, investors
borrow heavily to buy out a company and then pay off the debt with
the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.
   Stop & Shop's board had rejected as inadequate Dart's offer of
$37 a share, or a total of $1.03 billion.
   Officials of Dart could not be reached for comment today, but a
spokesman had said they would likely make a counter offer.
   Other companies reportedly interested in Stop & Shop were Thomas
H. Lee Co. of Boston, and Riordan, Freeman & Spogli Inc. of Los
Angeles.
   Stop & Shop has 113 supermarkets and 169 Bradlees in 12 states
in the Northeast.
   The company's stock has gone up more than $25 a share since Dart
first announced its takeover intent in January. In early New York
Stock Exchange trading today, it was up another 75 cents to $43.37{
a share.
   The sale, which must be approved by a majority of Stop & Shop
shareholders, is expected to commence on or before March 4, Stop &
Shop said. Kohlberg Kravis has received a financing commitment from
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., the retailer said.
   Stop & Shop said it will retain its present management and
remain based in Braintree.
   On Friday, Dart said it would launch a proxy fight and called
for a special meeting of Stop & Shop shareholders at which it would
move to replace the directors.
   Dart, based in Landover, Md., is known for a series of
unsuccessful but profitable bids to gain control of other
companies, and its chairman, Herbert Haft, and president, Robert
Haft, have acquired reputations as corporate raiders.
   Their most recent targets include Supermarkets General Corp. and
Dayton Hudson Corp.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Barring Customs from Conducting Drug Tests for
Applicants</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court agreed today to consider
barring the U.S. Customs Service from conducting drug tests for
people seeking drug-enforcement jobs, setting the stage for its
first ruling on the constitutionality of mandatory drug-testing for
public employees.
   The court said it will hear a challenge to the testing program
by a federal workers labor union that says taking urine samples
from employees violates their privacy rights.
   The outcome will carry no direct effect on such tests conducted
by private, non-governmental employers.
   President Reagan signed an executive order in 1986 calling for
drug testing of government employees.
   The Transportation Department, with 30,000 employees, became the
first cabinet-level department to adopt random testing for civilian
workers. The program covers those in safety-related jobs such as
air traffic controllers, Federal Aviation Administration pilots and
workers with high-rated security clearance.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the
Customs Service tests, which are not administered randomly, are
lawful.
   The appeals court said the tests may be considered searches but
do not intrude unnecessarily on the privacy rights of workers.
   ``Because of the strong governmental interest in employing
individuals for key positions in drug enforcement who themselves
are not drug users and the limited intrusiveness of this
partricular program, it is reasonable and, therefore, is not
unconstitutional,'' the appeals court said.
   The National Treasury Employees Union challenged the testing
program, which requires some workers to provide urine samples in
restroom stalls as a person overseeing the test waits outside the
stall. The tests are conducted by an independent company hired by
the Customs Service.
   The union said the tests are a ``humiliation'' for workers, and
are being administered indiscriminately to employees who otherwise
are thought worthy of promotion and are not suspected of drug use.
   The tests are given to those in the Customs Service applying for
promotion to drug-enforcement jobs, and for outside applicants for
those jobs.
   The union president, Robert M. Tobias, praised the high court's
decision to hear the case, saying its ruling ``should clarify the
constiutional boundaries of drug testing for federal employees and,
we hope, destroy Reagan's plans for wholesale testing of the
federal work force.''
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Refused to revive lawsuits charging the government and federal
contrctors with negligently causing deaths and disease among people
exposed to open-air atomic tests.
   The court, without comment, let stand a federal law that
effectively spared the government from having to defend itself
against claims seeking billions of dollars.
   _ Agreed to consider letting the federal government apply
retroactively a formula that limits reimbursement paid to hospitals
treating Medicare patients.
   The court said it will hear Reagan administration arguments that
some hospitals could reap a windfall from the ban on retroactive
application of the formula.
   _ Let stand rulings that threw out a reporter's attempt to force
the State Department to release documents from U.S. embassies
around the world.
   The lawsuit by Donald F. Goldberg, a reporter on the staff of
syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, had been filed under the
Freedom of Information Act. He had sought from the State Department
responses to an unclassified 1982 questionnaire on foreign
governments' diplomatic practices.
   _ Asked the Reagan administration whether it thinks high-stakes
bingo games run by Indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before it says whether it will review an attempt by Oklahoma
officials to tax revenue from a bingo game in Tulsa run by the
Muscogee Creek Nation.
   The Reagan administration said the drug tests are needed to
prevent drug enforcement agents who used drugs from being bribed or
blackmailed.
   Justice Department lawyers said, ``Any affront to privacy felt
by those applying for the affected positions is outweighed by the
service's interest in ensuring that officials responsible for the
interdiction of drug smuggling are not themselves drug users.''
   Customs employees are not ``immune from a problem that is
ravaging the society at large,'' the government lawyers said in
urging the court to reject the union's appeal.
   They said the tests are particularly important now because the
Customs Services plans to recruit some 3,000 new employees,
including many in the 18-to-25 age range in which use of illegal
drugs is most prevalent.
   The tests were halted in 1986 after a federal judge ruled they
are unconstitutional and ordered them stopped.
   The 5th Circuit court then overruled the judge, and the Supreme
Court last May permitted the tests to resume.
   Drug testing policies also have come under legal attacks led by
the American Civil Liberties Union.
   The case is National Treasury Employees Union vs. Von Raab,
86-1879.

<HEAD>Houston Business Bankruptcies Hit High Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of local businesses bankruptcies
reached an all-time high in 1987, and increased for the fifth
consecutive year, according to an accounting firm's report.
   There were a record 1,688 bankruptcies in Houston last year, a 4
percent increase from the previous year, a Price Waterhouse-Houston
study showed. The small percentage increase indicates a
stabilization of the business climate, the company said.
   Price Waterhouse said the number of bankruptcies increased by 17
percent in 1986 and 33 percent in 1985.
   ``We expect bankruptcies in Houston to decline in 1988,'' said
Carol Bennett, senior manager and economist with Price Waterhouse.
``Such a decline would be the first we have reported since we began
these bankruptcy analyses in 1982.''
   In its survey last year, the company predicted Houston
bankruptcies had peaked in 1986.
   Retail businesses represented the largest industry segment in
the bankruptcy figures with a 41.5 percent share, the study said.
   But the beleaguered oil and gas industry improved dramatically
in its survival statistics, showing a 53 pecent decrease in
business failures and bankruptcy filings last year compared with
1986. The 59 filings in the energy sector last year were the fewest
since 1982.

   The possibility of a bidding war for Federated
Department Stores Inc. arose today after the nation's fifth-largest
retailer announced that another party in addition to Campeau Corp.
was presenting an acquisition proposal to the Federated board.
   Federated did not identify the new bidder, but said it had been
advised that the party planned to submit a proposal that appeared
competitive with Campeau's $6.1 billion, $68-per-share bid to buy
Federated.
   Federated's board of directors, meeting today to consider
Campeau's proposal, was to consider the rival bid as well, the
retailer said.
   The Cincinnati-based Federated, which owns chains including
Bloomingdale's, Filene's and Burdine's, declined to say where the
board was meeting, or when it would announce a decision.
   Representatives of Federated and Campeau negotiated over the
weekend on a merger plan. However, the retailer said last week
there was no guarantee its directors would agree to a merger with
Campeau, which owns store chains including Jordan Marsh, Ann Taylor
and Stern's.
   Federated stock was up $1.50 to $66.25 a share in late morning
trading on the New York Stock Exchange today.
   Federated ended weeks of fending off Campeau's takeover attempts
by announcing Friday that its board of directors authorized merger
negotiations after the Toronto-based development company offered
$68 per share.
   The directors previously rejected lower Campeau offers and
ordered managers to study alternatives to a takeover.
   Analysts speculated that Federated decided to negotiate with
Campeau because it could not find a favored buyer to acquire the
company or develop a restructuring plan that would pay shareholders
what Campeau was offering.
   Most analysts said that if an agreement was reached, Campeau
probably would sell some Federated divisions to help pay off the
$4.5 billion in debt it would incur to make the acquisition.
   Campeau took similar steps after acquiring Allied Stores Corp.
in December 1986 and sold off 16 of 24 store units.
   Campeau has already indicated it would sell Federated's
non-department store operations, which include Gold Circle discount
stores based in Columbus and Ralph's supermarkets in Los Angeles.
It indicated it would combine headquarters operations of Federated
and Allied Stores.
   Some analysts said the Cincinnati-based Lazarus department store
chain is considered among Federated's weaker performing units and
could be sold.
   There have been rumors that a number of other retailers, such as
May Department Stores, would step in and buy Federated. William
Smith, a retail analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said
St. Louis-based May would be interested in acquiring some of
Federated's stores, ``but they don't have to buy the whole company
to do that.''
   Federated had $11 billion in sales last year. It operates 650
stores nationwide. Its holdings also include Abraham & Straus,
Rich's, Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin.
   Campeau said last week it would raise a substantial amount of
equity for its proposed buyout of Federated by selling the Brooks
Brothers division of Allied Stores to Britain's Marks and Spencer
PLC for $770 million. The Brooks Brothers sale was conditioned on
Campeau acquiring Federated.

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit soared 33
percent to a record 1.5 billion pounds in January as exports fell
more sharply than imports, the government said Monday.
   The latest seasonally adjusted figure, equal to about $2.7
billion, compared with a deficit of 1.01 billion pounds in the
previous month and 597 million pounds in January 1987, the
Department of Trade and Industry said.
   Britain's current account deficit, which includes invisible
trade such as services and overseas investment earnings, more than
doubled to a record 905 million pounds, or $1.6 billion, in January
from a deficit of 410 million pounds in December.
   The current account deficit was 28 million pounds in January
1987.
   The invisible trade in Janaury was estimated to be in a surplus
of 600 million pounds.
   Exports fell 9 percent to 6.2 billion pounds, or $11 billion, in
January from 6.8 billion pounds, or $12 billion, in December.
   Imports fell 1.3 percent to 7.7 billion pounds, or $13.6
billion, from 7.8 billion pounds, or $13.8 billion, in December.

<HEAD>Newtown Firm To Offer Expensive Modular Homes</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of Connecticut entrepreneurs have
in hand the blueprints they think will alter the popular image of
modular homes as boxy structures that sway in the breeze.
   Harvey F. Gerber Jr. and his wife, Wendy A. Horgan, have formed
a company that will sell modular houses designed by an architect to
look like and compete with the best custom-built homes.
   It's a new market with few competitors.
   The incentive to homebuyers is that so-called ``high-end modular
homes'' can be built at a lower cost and much faster than
comparable stick-built homes that are constructed from the ground
up, Gerber said.
   The four styles offered by Gerber Builders Inc. are two-story
homes, with large porches, 9-foot ceilings, family rooms, multiple
bathrooms and at least three bedrooms. The houses also allow for
personalized touches, such as a choice of flooring, siding and trim
molding.
   The price ranges from about $70,000 to $130,000 for a
2,000-square-foot house, depending upon whether a buyer purchases
an unfinished model or a completed home. The price of land isn't
included.
   ``What we have here is a product that is aimed at a high-end
market. It is going to be indistinguishable from te best
stick-built homes,'' Gerber said during a recent interview.
   Gerber, 39, and his wife are both former Wall Street attorneys.
They got their start in construction 10 years ago when they began
renovating historic buildings in New York City. They had branched
out into condominium construction in New Jersey when they decided
to focus on modular homes.
   They chose Connecticut because of their connections to the
state. Ms. Horgan, originally from New Canaan, received her
master's and law degrees from the University of Connecticut. Gerber
attended Yale and got his law degree from Fordham University.
   The company has constructed a Victorian-style model on its
11-acre headquarters site in Newtown, an affluent suburban
community about 70 miles north of New York City. The firm is
constructing three other models on a parcel in Sussex County, N.J.
   The completion of the model was the culmination of three years
of design work and planning that has cost the company about $1
million, Gerber said.
   The company's goal is to sell at least 100 homes the first year
and begin construction of Connecticut's first modular home factory
at the Newtown site.
   If all goes well, ground could be broken on the proposed
57,000-square-foot factory this summer. The factory would produce
300 homes a year and the product line would be expanded to include
lower-priced and more expensive models along with the
intermediate-priced models now being offered.
   The Gerber homes currently are constructed by Contempri Homes in
Taylor, Pa., and shipped to Connecticut. All the Gerber homes have
been designed by Deborah Berke, who teaches architecture at Yale
University and runs a business in New York City.
   Modular homes account for about 5 percent of all housing starts
nationwide, and perhaps 15 percent of new houses in the Northeast,
where most modular home factories are located, said Barbara Martin,
special projects consultant for the Buildings Systems Council of
the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, D.C.
   She could name only three companies selling high-end modular
homes.
   George Oswald of Techno Craft Inc., another modular home
company, predicts that 50 percent of the housing starts in the
Northeast will be modular homes by the year 2000.
   Techno Craft, which opened a 100,000-square-foot factory in
McElhattan, Pa., last year, already has about $80 million in orders
for its luxury homes.
   ``We're the ones who broke the sound barrier by going into the
high-end (modular home) market,'' Oswald said.
   The smallest Techno-Craft home is 2,600 square feet, with its
colonial mansion models ranging up to 7,000 square feet, Oswald
said. The cost averages about $50 a square foot. The homes are sold
finished and are available only through developers.
   Gerber plans to sell to individual home buyers and small
contractors.
   His current models cost about $65 a square foot completed, or
about $130,000. It would take a crew several days to assemble the
six pieces of each model and then about three more months to
complete the home, Gerber said.
   To those wanting to save money, the company will sell unfinished
homes for about $35 a square foot, or about $70,000. For that
price, the home comes with much of the work done, such as all the
plumbing and electrical wiring run, and the insulation and
wallboard installed. But an unfinished house has no roof, no
siding, and the plumbing and wiring need to be hooked up.
   The company also will sell kits to those more than 30 miles away
from its Newtown office.
   ``We've gotten universal praise from every bank, appraiser,
engineer, contractor and prospect who has visited the house (in
Newtown) prior to its formal opening,'' said Gerber. ``At the same
time, we haven't had the ultimate test, which is market exposure.
We can't conclusively say we've designed a Hula Hoop, although
that's what we believe.''

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Slump To 5-Year Low, Price-Support Talks Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN STAINER</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials from leading cocoa producers and
consuming countries began two weeks of talks Monday on measures to
support world prices against the background of a renewed slump in
the market.
   Cocoa bean prices have declined by more than seven per cent
since the start of the year, with contracts for May delivery
dropping the equivalent of $26.40 to touch a five-year year low of
995 pounds, or $1,751, per metric ton, dealers said.
   Cocoa prices have been undermined by a world surplus following
four seasons of overproduction, and the ending of intervention
buying to support the market.
   Intervention buying of cocoa by the 37-nation International
Cocoa Organization was halted indefinitely last week because
purchases had reached the maximum 250,000 tons permitted under the
price-stabilization treaty.
   Dealers said that the market's weakness also reflected doubts
whether cocoa organization members can agree on supplementary
measures to support the market at the talks that opened Monday.
   The cocoa treaty allows the introduction of a stock withholding
process to restrict supplies when intervention purchases have been
halted.
   Under the procedure, the organization's leading producers _ the
Ivory Coast, Brazil, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon _ can hold back up
to 120,000 tons of cocoa. The beans would be put into storage and
only released when prices were rising strongly.
   Industry sources said that although it was likely to come into
force this week or next, there were doubts whether all producers
would operate it.
   ``Holding back cocoa will mean lost export revenue and that is
something that some countries may not be able to afford,'' said one
analyst.
   He noted that most of the producers are massively in debt and
making huge interest repayments.
   The talks will be complicated by a call from cocoa organization
consumers for a cut in the support price, said delegates to the
meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<BYLINE>Wage Freeze Proposed</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway's Labor government proposed a wage
freeze Monday in an emergency measure to put a lid on inflation,
which leaped to 8.7 percent last year.
   The government said the freeze, which also covered stock
dividends, would be temporary until economic planners can prepare a
more comprehensive program to regulate salaries.
   The second stage was due to be introduced in about two weeks and
would keep salaries under control at least until 1989.
   Norway's inflation rate has grown steadily over the past three
years, from 5.7 percent in 1985 to 7.2 percent in 1986 and 8.7
percent last year. By comparison, the average rate in European in
1986 was 3.8 percent, according to the Organization of European
Cooperation and Development.
   Under the proposed bill, prices would be controled but not
frozen. An already existing monitoring agency would be instructed
to ensure prices were not raised unreasonably.
   It was the most extreme anti-inflation measure since another
socialist government froze prices and wages ten years ago.
   On Saturday, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said she would
introduce the wage legislation after the national employers'
organization closed a deal with the country's federation of trade
unions giving workers wage increases and benefits amounting to
roughly five percent.
   The agreement affected 350,000 union members in the private
sector, but the proposed wage freeze would extend the agreement to
most of Norway's work force.
   The bill raised a cry of protest from other unions that their
own negotiations were cut off and superceded by a deal in which
they had no say.
   Exemptions were made for teachers and nurses, who have staged
sporadic strikes over the past several weeks and who were holding
separate pay negotiations.
   Although Mrs. Brundtland's government lacks a majority in the
157-member parliament, the Storting, the legislation was almost
certain to win approval in a vote later this week with the likely
support of the opposition Conservative Party.
   Mrs. Brundtland told a news conference the bill was designed to
bring inflation down to the level of other European countries and
make Norway's industry more competative.

   Two financial company executives were
sentenced to prison today for their roles in bilking mortgage
company investors of millions of dollars.
   Oakland County Circuit Judge Norman L. Lippitt sentenced Barton
Greenberg to the maximum six years, eight months to 10 years in
prison, and sentenced Gary L. Mitchell to 16 months to three years
in prison.
   Scattered applause broke out as the two former executives of
A.J. Obie & Associates and Diamond Mortgage Corp. were led away in
handcuffs.
   Lippitt gave the two 56 days to appeal.
   The pair were accused of defrauding 1,600 investors of about $47
million in what state Attorney General Frank Kelley has termed
Michigan's largest mortgage scam.
   Greenberg and Mitchell were charged last year with 18 counts of
securities fraud. Greenberg also was charged with two counts of
obtaining money under false pretenses.
   In a plea bargain arranged before trial, Greenberg pleaded no
contest to one count of obtaining money under false pretenses and
Mitchell no contest to a count of securities fraud. The other
counts were dropped.
   Kelley has said that Greenberg, former board chairman of Diamond
and former Obie president, used corporate accounts for personal
purposes while drawing a $1 million annual salary.
   Mitchell owned no stock in either company, had little control
over bank accounts and drew a $100,000 annual salary, Kelley wrote
Lippitt in a letter last week. Kelley said while Mitchell knew of
two of the fraud schemes, he was not the primary instigator and did
not benefit nearly as much as Greenberg.
   Diamond and Obie were charged with arranging high-risk mortgage
loans at above-market rates that Obie then resold to investors.
   Because they had more investors than borrowers, Obie frequently
gave individual mortgages to several investors. Diamond also was
accused of failing to account properly for escrow money to pay
taxes and insurance.

<HEAD>Former E.F. Hutton President Agrees To Censure By Stock Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
has agreed to a censure by the New York Stock Exchange for failing
to oversee E.F. Hutton & Co. properly when he was president of that
firm during an illicit overdrafting scheme, sources familiar with
the settlement said Monday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
the exchange determined George L. Ball wasn't aware of the scheme,
which was conducted in the early 1980s and played a role in
Hutton's later demise. But the exchange felt Ball still bore some
responsibility, the sources said.
   Hutton's former chief financial officer Thomas Lynch also will
be censured, and Hutton must pay a $400,000 fine to the exchange,
among the largest ever levied, the sources said. Because Hutton was
acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. late last year, Shearson
will pay the fine.
   Norman Epstein, a former Hutton executive responsible for
overseeing some of its operations, also faced discipline by the
exchange but reportedly has been resisting a settlement.
   Ball was away from his office and did not return telephone
messages for comment, but a Prudential-Bache official said the
chairman agreed to the settlement in order to put the matter behind
him.
   ``This is the mildest form of action available to the
exchange,'' said the official. ``There is no fine, no restrictions,
it's a censure.''
   The action by stock exchange investigators is regarded as
largely inconsequential. It isn't expected to have any effect on
Ball's position at Prudential Bache.
   ``What they're saying is, `We realize and acknowledge you
weren't aware of any of the improprieties,'' the Prudential Bache
official said.
   Stock exchange spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin declined comment in
accordance with its policy on investigations that haven't been
concluded.
   Shearson officials did not return calls for comment, and the
whereabouts of Lynch and Epstein weren't clear.
   Shearson has said previously that in acquiring Hutton, it
scrutinized the firm's legal history and potential liabilities.
   The exchange's investigation stemmed from a 1985
check-overdrafting scheme that Hutton orchestrated through its
retail brokerage network. The firm earned up to $8 million in
interest income at commercial banks by deliberately overdrawing
checking accounts and putting the money to use elsewhere.
   Hutton pleaded guilty to 2,000 federal fraud counts and paid a
$2 million fine in May 1985 because of the scheme, which exposed
serious management lapses at the firm and led to a chain of events
that forced Hutton to sell itself.
   Ball departed Hutton for Prudential-Bache in 1982, after a
federal probe of the overdrafting scheme had begun.
   The stock exchange routinely disciplines member firms for
violating its rules of conduct, with punitive actions ranging from
expulsions for severe infractions to fines or censure for less
serious offenses.
   Previous large fines levied by the stock exchange included
$400,000 against First Wall Street Settlement in 1981 and $400,000
against Bache Halsey Stuart Shields in 1982.

<HEAD>De Benedetti Announces Partnership with Two Belgian Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlo De Benedetti reached a
partnership agreement with two Belgian firms Monday, bringing the
Italian investor closer to gaining control of Societe Generale de
Belgique SA, Belgium's biggest holding company.
   De Benedetti, Belgian industrialist Andre Leysen of Gevaert NV
and Pierre Scohier of Cobepa SA, a Belgian investment firm, said
they agreed to form a new holding company with 4.5 million, or
about 16 percent, of Societe Generale shares.
   The group's aim is to control a stake of 20 to 25 percent of
Societe Generale shares, Scohier said.
   De Benedetti, together with allies, already claims to control 45
percent of Societe Generale's 28.2 million shares but it was
unclear Monday whether the new partnership could give him a
majority stake in the company at the expense of an alliance of
mainly French and Belgian companies that claims 52 percent of the
shares.
   The alliance, built around the French investment Cie Financiere
de Suez and Belgium's biggest insurer, Groupe AG, wants to keep
Societe Generale, which has a stake in a third of the Belgian
economy, anchored in Belgium.
   De Benedetti wants to use the 166-year-old firm as a platform
for a pan-European holding company.
   But in the deal with the two Belgian companies he seemed more
willing to let Societe Generale maintain its Belgian identity.
   De Benedetti's French investment firm Cerus SA will have a stake
of 55 percent in the new holding company and Gevaert and Cobepa
holdings of 22.5 percent each.
   Scohier said Copeba, the Belgian subsidiary of the French
investment group Paribas, currently did not own shares of Societe
Generale, but that it planned to buy about 1 million. He did not
elaborate.
   Paribas and Suez are fierce competitors on the French investment
market and are in opposing camps in the battle of Societe Generale.
   The three parties said in a statement the new holding company
will ensure that Societe Generale will have a Belgian base and
invited other Belgian as well as international investors to join
the holding company.
   Societe Generale has interests in some 1,400 companies
world-wide and in about half of Belgium's top 50 firms. It has such
pervasive influence in the national economy that it is sometimes
identified with Belgium itself.
   Leysen told the West German magazine Der Spiegel the importance
of Societe Generale was reflected in its stake in ``all vital
economic sectors of Belgium: the energy sector, gas, electricity,
petroleum and (Belgium's) largest bank.''
   The announcement further said that De Benedetti will be
president of the new holding company with Leysen and Scohier
vice-presidents.
   De Benedetti's insistence on having personal control over at
least day-to-day management of Societe Generale had been a
stumbling block when he failed to forge a partnership with Leysen
last month.
   But the statement released Monday said ``the decision-making
center of the company will remain in Belgium and the essential
interests of Belgium will be preserved,'' which had been a constant
demand by Leysen.
   De Benedetti said prior to Monday's agreement he controlled 45
percent while the alliance opposing him claims 52 percent.
   Maurice Lippens, managing director of Belgium's Groupe AG, said
on Belgian RTBf radio the shareholders meeting would not be called
to assess the size of the two factions trying to take control of
the company.
   Lippens further said he and officials of the Suez group, which
holds the largest single known bloc of shares within the coalition,
had met with Belgium's caretaker prime minister Wilfried Martens
over the weekend.
   No details of the meeting were available.
   The battle for control of Societe Generale started Jan. 18 when
De Benedetti announced he was seeking effective control of the
holding company in view of the completion of the European internal
market of 1992.
   By that date, the Common Market hopes to free all movement of
goods, services and people within the 12-nation European Economic
Community.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Continued Improvement In Farmland Values In Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of Midwestern farmland is up
about 7 percent from depressed 1986 levels, but still is little
more than half what it was seven years ago, the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago says.
   The bank says its survey of about 500 agricultural bankers in
five Midwestern states shows farmland values rose 3.2 percent
during the last three months of 1987 _ the fourth consecutive
quarterly increase.
   ``The reversal last year of the long downtrend in farmland
values stems largely from the improving income trend of the
sector,'' said Peter Heffernan, an analyst for the Chicago bank.
   Net farm income in 1987 rose 20 percent from the previous year's
level, said Heffernan.
   ``While much of the improvement in farm-sector earnings is
attributable to large government payments, strong livestock returns
over the past few years and sharply curtailed production expenses
have also contributed to the sector's improved income
performance,'' said Heffernan.
   The most substantial increases in farmland values during the
fourth quarter of 1987 were the 5.8 percent reported in Indiana and
4.9 percent in Iowa, the survey showed.
   Illinois bankers reported a 2.1 percent increase in farmland
values during October, November and December, and Wisconsin bankers
reported a 1 percent increase.
   Michigan bankers said there was virtually no change from
third-quarter values.
   Heffernan said the best annual increase in farmland values was
13 percent in Iowa. The others were 8.2 percent in Indiana, 7.2
percent in Illinois and 2 percent in Michigan, with no change
reported by bankers in Wisconsin.
   ``District bankers remain optimistic regarding the farmland
market in 1988,'' said Heffernan. ``The vast majority of surveyed
bankers _ almost 70 percent _ expect farmland values in their areas
to remain stable during the first quarter of this year.''
   He said 28 percent of the bankers expect farmland values to
continue to rise this quarter, while just 2 percent expect a
decline.
   Even with the latest increase in farmland values, the survey
showed that they are 45 percent below their 1981 peak.

<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 Northern Telecom Ltd. production
and office workers went on strike in five Canadian cities Monday
after the union rejected a last-minute economic proposal from the
company.
   ``We are quite a ways apart on some very basic issues,'' said
Bob White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union.
   White said the company wants to cut cost-of-living allowances by
35 percent and has failed to meet the union's proposal for indexed
pensions. The union is also seeking higher wages and a sweetened
benefit package. Wages now are $15 to $18 an hour.
   The contract expired Sunday at midnight and the strike began
after a deadline of Monday at 11 a.m. EST.
   Affected by the strike are a repair facility in Saint John, New
Brunswick, and manufacturing plants in Ontario at Bramalea,
Belleville, London and Kingston that make wire, cable, telephones
and office telecommunications equipment.
   The company is 52.3 per cent owned by conglomerate BCE, formerly
Bell Canada Enterprises, and has 24 plants and repair operations.
Fourteen of the company's plants are located in the United States.

<TEXT>
   The number of oil and gas rigs working in the
United States posted a small increase of five this week to total
983, Baker Hughes Inc. announced.
   The total reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil
as of last Friday, not the number rigs producing oil. The previous
week, the count had increased by 10 to total 978.
   A year ago, the rig count was 801, Baker Hughes announced Monday.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number
of working rigs and the count is the widely-watched industry index
of drilling activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged this year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981 _ the height of the oil boom. But as oil prices plunged to
less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, the count
fell to 663, the lowest since Hughes began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Oklahoma gained 12 rigs
this week, followed by Texas with 11, Wyoming with three and
Louisiana with one.
   Michigan's count dropped by seven and Ohio and Colorado each
lost three. Kansas and New Mexico were down by two each, while
Pennsylvania and California each lost one.

   Futures prices for corn and soybeans were higher
while wheat prices were mixed at the close Monday in moderate to
good volume on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices closed near 7 cents above Friday's prices.
   Lighter than expected delivery notices for soybeans helped
support higher soybeans prices, said Jerry Gidel, grains analyst
for G.H. Miller & Co.
   Wheat prices were supported by import interest from the
Phillippines, 175,000 tons worth, and talk that the Soviets may be
back in the market, Gidel said.
   Corn prices were restained somewhat by lower than expected
exports for that commodity, said Steve Freed, grains analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   At the close, wheat was } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.15} a bushel; corn was 2{

   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which is vacating its

   Stock prices climbed today in a session
enlivened by brisk takeover activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.22 to 2,044.43
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 986 up, 497 down and
447 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 194.82 million shares with an
hour to go. big chunk of that activity came in a few high-yielding
stocks, representing plays on their impending dividends.
   Analysts said optimistic traders still had their sights set on
the 2,051.89 level in the Dow Jones industrial average, where it
stood Jan. 7 for its highest closing reading since the crash last
October.
   The average failed in a bid to surpass that point last week, but
brokers argued that it might be ready to make another try.
   One concern facing the market is the report due Tuesday from the
Commerce Department on the index of leading economic indicators for
January.
   Analysts generally expect the figure to show a decline. But the
firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. said the 0.2 percent drop
originally reported for December might be revised to show a gain.
   That would mean that the index would no longer have a string of
three consecutive monthly declines, a phenomenon which is
traditionally regarded as a potential recession warning.
   On the takeover scene, Rorer Corp. jumped 10| to 36}. The
company agreed to be acquired by Whirlpool Corp. for $37.50 a share.
   Homestake Mining climbed 3{ to 18. Mesa Limited Partnership made
a $20-a-share offer for the company.
   Stop & Shop gained ~ to 43{. The company, fighting a hostile bid
by Dart Group, reached agreement on a buyout at $44 a share by a
group organized by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.37 to 149.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific Corp., the nation's
seventh-largest bank holding concern, said Monday it has agreed to
acquire San Francisco-based Hibernia Bank for $160 million, or
about 1{ times its book value.
   Hibernia was put on the auction block by its parent, Hong
Kong-based First Pacific Holdings Ltd., last summer. But after
October's stock market crash, First Pacific said it was no longer
actively seeking a buyer.
   Acquisition of Hibernia will strengthen Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific in the northern part of the state.
   Hibernia, the 13th largest bank in California, has 35 branches
in Northern California, including 28 in the San Francisco Bay Area.
At year end, it had $1.2 billion in deposits and more than $1
billion in outstanding loans. It posted a profit of $11.2 million
last year.
   However, the sale of Hibernia doesn't mark a pullout from
California banking for First Pacific, which will continue to own
smaller United Savings Bank, with operations in the San Francisco
and Los Angeles regions.
   Tom Yasuda, one of First Pacific's directors, said the holding
company's plans call for it to expand United Savings.
   First Pacific also owns a bank in Hong Kong, an
investment-banking concern in the Philippines, and a
trade-confirming operation and minority interest in an
export-finance business in England.
   Security Pacific, whose chief subsidiary is Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific National Bank, the second largest in the state,
has assets of more than $72 billion.

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. has completed the

   Sierra Pacific is a privately-held company based in Redding,

the Black Mesa Pipeline.
   Before taxes, the company has taken in $880 million from the
sales, which included Robert E. McKee, a general building
contractor, Bankers Leasing and Financial Corp. and two pipeline

   The government has authorized a 3 percent
increase in the minimum wage in March and ordered a freeze in
official prices and the value of the peso.
   The new measures, announced late Sunday, marked the government's
most aggressive attempt yet to rid the nation of its No. 1 economic
problem, inflation.
   President Miguel de la Madrid told a meeting of labor, business
and campesino leaders, ``The national motto is no increase in
prices in the month of March.''
   Labor leader Fidel Velazquez worried, though, that merchants
would quickly mark up their prices before Tuesday, the first day of
the freeze.
   ``Prices in March are going to try to be checked ... but last
night and today they have been raising them,'' he contended late
Sunday.
   The small increase in the minimum daily wage to 8,000 pesos _
about $3.50 _ was a blow to Velazquez and his 3 million-member
Mexican Labor Federation, which had been pushing for a 10 percent
gain.
   Workers, he said, have agreed to ``put the interests of the
country ahead of their own interests.''
   About half the nation's 25 million workers are estimated to earn
the minimum wage.
   Analysts calculate that the purchasing power of workers' making
the minimum pay has deteriorated to about half of what it was in
1978.
   De la Madrid said he was quickening the pace of his
inflation-fighting program, unveiled in mid-December, because fresh
price figures showed ``an important de-acceleration'' in February.
   Consumer prices, the president predicted, would rise in February
at about half the record 15.5 percent of January. Last week, the
government announced a a gain of 8.7 percent in prices in the first
half of February.
   Jonathan Heath, senior economist at the forecasting firm of
Macro Asesoria Economica, predicted an inflation rate of about 8.5
percent in February and 5 percent to 5.5 percent in March.
   The new economic program, he said, appears to be successful so
far. But, he added, ``we can't look at short-run indicators.''
   ``We want to see if it is a permanent drop and the government is
not inducing a temporary, artificial drop. We want to make sure
it's a permanent, once-and-for-all drop in inflation,'' he said.
   The government had been expected to release a target level that
would be used, starting Tuesday, to index wages and prices. The
indexation plan was designed as the centerpiece of the
anti-inflation program, called the Economic Solidarity Pact.
   The government drew up the Solidarity Pact because of worries
the nation was on the verge of hyper-inflation. Consumer prices
skyrocketed a record 159.2 percent last year.
   But in a surprise move, the president's office authorized the
smaller-than-expected increase in the minimum wage and ordered a
freeze on the prices of government-regulated and -controlled itms.
Such products range from gasoline and electricity to tortillas and
milk.
   It also urged private companies to join in the freeze,
refraining from marking up prices to make up for higher wage costs.
   Moreover, officials said the exchange rate for the peso will be
held steady in March at Monday's level. The Bank of Mexico, the
nation's central bank, trimmed the currency's value against the
dollar by 3 units each trading day in February.
   At midday Monday, the peso in free-market trading ranged from
2,300 pesos to the dollar to 2,360 pesos at the private firms. It
was 2,237-2,267 on Friday. The free rate is used in tourism and
border transactions.
   A second rate regulated by the government was 2,281 pesos to the
dollar. This rate, used in about 75 percent of all commercial
transaction, stood at 2,270 on Friday.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Suits in Atomic Test Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to revive
lawsuits that charged the government and federal contractors with
negligently causing deaths and disease among people exposed to
open-air atomic tests.
   The court, without comment, let stand a federal law that
effectively spared the government from having to defend itself
against claims seeking billions of dollars.
   In another case, the court asked the Reagan administration for
its opinion of a ruling that states indirectly may tax interest
paid to financial institutions from investments in Federal Home
Loan Bank (FHLB) bonds.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before saying whether it will review fully a challenge to a
Maryland bank franchise tax.
   In other cases dealing with economic or business-related issues,
the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether the U.S. Customs Service may force
applicants for drug enforcement jobs to be tested for drugs. A
federal workers union challenged the tests, calling the taking of
urine samples from employees a humiliating invasion of privacy.
   _Let stand rulings that warrantless searches of Illinois
racetrack employees' on-grounds living quarters violate
constitutionally protected privacy rights.
   _Said it will decide whether employees of a Pentagon
intelligence agency are entitled to administrative hearings when
the government fires them as security risks.
   _Agreed to consider letting the federal government apply
retroactively a formula that limits reimbursement paid to hospitals
treating Medicare patients. The court said it will hear Reagan
administraion arguments that some hospitals could reap a windfall
from the ban on retroactive application of the formula.
   _Asked the Reagan administration whether it thinks high-stakes
bingo games run by Indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes.
The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before it says whether it will review an attempt by Oklahoma
officials to tax revenue from a bingo game in Tulsa run by the
Muscogee Creek Nation.
   The atmospheric nuclear tests that gave rise to the case
involving the government and federal contractors took place between
the closing days of World War II and the adoption of a treaty
between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1963 banning
open-air testing.
   Suits were filed on behalf of 29 people _ civilians and members
of the military _ including 26 who died from cancer or
cancer-related causes. The suits alleged that the health problems
were caused by radioactive fallout from the explosions.
   Charged with negligence were the University of California, which
operated the Los Alamos, N.M., project; Lawrence Livermore
laboratories, which helped develop the atomic bomb; Sandia Corp.,
which provided engineering for the weapons program; and Reynolds
Electric Engineering Co., which helped build and operate a test
site in Nevada.
   The suits accused the private contractors of failing to take
adequate safety precautions at the test sites, and also said the
government was responsible for failing to enforce its own safety
standards.
   If the suits were successful, the government ultimately would
pay the claims because it had insured the private contractors for
any losses.
   But in 1984 Congress passed a law supported by the Reagan
administration that says only the U.S. government may be sued for
negligence allegedly caused by a private contractor in the atomic
weapons testing program.
   The result was to bar the claims since the government is immune
from such suits unless it surrenders immunity under the existing
Federal Tort Claims Act.
   In the FHLB bond interest case, the Maryland National Bank
challenged the tax, seeking a refund of $197,310 it paid under
protest to the state for the years 1979 through 1982.
   During that period, the bank reported $2.82 million in interest
from FHLB bonds.
   The sum was included in the bank's earnings that were subject to
Maryland's franchise tax, which is imposed on financial
institutions for the privilege of doing business in Maryland.
   The difficulty over whether earnings from FHLB bonds are taxable
arises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws.
   The 1932 law that created the FHLB generally exempts the bonds
from taxes.
   But a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a
``non-discriminatory franchise tax'' on ``stocks and obligations of
the United States government'' that generally are exempt from state
and local taxes.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the state franchise tax,
ruling in October that the 1862 law takes precedence.

Injuries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court
ruling that blamed defective design of a Winchester rifle for an
accidential firing that injured two New Hampshire teen-agers during
a 1977 hunting trip.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments from
the manufacturer of the rifle, Olin Corp., that a federal judge in
New Hampshire erred when he held the company liable for the
shooting.
   Damages were not an issue in the appeal, but the victims, Henry
Fortier and Raymond Croteau, were awarded a total of $560,000 as
part of the Sept. 16, 1986, decision by U.S. District Judge Martin
F. Loughlin.
   Fortier and Croteau suffered foot wounds when a third teen-ager,
Paul Croteau, stumbled and fell during the hunting trip near
Berlin, N.H. The rifle discharged when it hit the ground, and the
bullet passed through Raymond Croteau's left foot then pierced
Fortier's right foot.
   ``It could reasonably be concluded from the evidence that the
defective design made the rifle unreasonably dangerous for the
purpose sold _ to be used as a hunting weapon,'' the appeals court
said in a decision published Thursday.
   ``There was evidence that defendant, despite its denial, had a
consumer product safety committee which was aware that there could
be an accidental discharge caused by a hunter falling while
carrying a rifle in a position similar to that of Paul Croteau on
the day of the accident,'' the court said.
   Howard B. Myers, the New Hampshire attorney who represented the
Connecticut-based company, did not immediately return telephone
calls from The Associated Press on Monday. An Olin spokesman said
he did not know if the company would appeal.
   At the New Hampshire trial, three firearms experts who testified
for the victims blamed the accident on the design of the Winchester
Model 94 rifle, a commemorative replica of the original 1866
Winchester. One of them testified that because of its weight, the
firing pin was thrust forward when the rifle hit the ground and
caused the bullet to discharge even though the gun was half cocked,
which acts as a safety on the rifle.
   Two of the experts testified that they had tested the rifle and
said it would fire, even when in the half-cocked position, if
rapped with a hand or a rubber mallet.
   The victims also introduced evidence that Olin conducted tests
on the rifle in 1974 and 1976 to determine if it would fire when
dropped to the ground. The tests indicated that the gun fired a
small percentage of the time.
   Also introduced as evidence by the victims was a 1976 letter in
which an Olin weapons engineer said it would cost between $1.75 and
$2.50 a rifle to add an additional safety.
   In 1982, U.S. Repeating Arms of New Haven, Conn., which had
obtained licensing rights to the Winchester name from Olin,
introduced a modified version of the rifle with a lighter weight
firing pin. U.S. Repeating Arms since has been purchased by another
company.

<HEAD>Fidelity Announces 800 Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual
fund firm, said Monday it would lay off 800 workers hired to handle
the rapid growth it enjoyed before October's stock market crash.
   The firm said it would base the need for future cuts on the pace
investors return to mutual funds.
   ``We will be monitoring business conditions,'' said spokeswoman
Karen Ernst. ``We don't anticipate anymore layoffs at the moment,
but that will depend on the market.''
   Fidelity attributed the 10.5 percent work force reduction to a
slump in new stock transactions and slower money management
business since the Oct. 19 crash.
   Also, the company reported a drop in individual retirement
accounts due to new federal laws limiting the tax deductability of
IRA contributions.
   Ernst said most of the dismissed Fidelity workers were from
corporate staff departments and ``volume-sensitive'' jobs, such as
telephone representatives, order takers and mail processers.
   ``These were the people directly affected by a decline in new
business,'' she said.
   Approximately 530 workers were laid off in Boston area offices,
with about 150 in Dallas and about 50 in New York. The remainder of
the cuts are from other offices around the country.
   The action reduces Fidelity's nationwide staff to approximately
6,850, about the same number of workers employed by the firm in
mid-1987. Fidelity operates 53 U.S. offices and one in London.
   Ernst said Fidelity's Boston headquarters was most affected by
the cuts since it was one of the company's largest growth areas
during its rapid expansion.
   Since 1982, Fidelity increased its work force four-fold to about
7,800 while assets swelled from about $19 billion to a peak of
about $85 billion dispersed among nearly 100 funds, including the
extremely popular Magellan Fund.
   The firm also branched to other ventures, such as real estate, a
discount stock brokerage and institutional pension management.
   Eric Kobren, a former Fidelity employee who publishes an
independent newsletter that monitors the company, said Fidelity may
be forced to reduce services and bring additional layoffs if
business does not accelerate.
   ``This is a first step,'' said Kobren. ``I would not be
surprised if we see further cuts after the IRA season if business
stays at the same pace. This may be the first round of cuts, and
they will digest it and see how they are doing then proceed with
others.''
   The company dismissed about 300 part-time and 50 full-time
workers Feb. 11, including 50 in Boston and 125 each in Dallas and
Salt Lake City.
   Earlier this year, Fidelity laid off 32 workers at investment
centers nationwide.
   While mutual fund activity is less than one-third of last year's
bull market levels, there has been a steady resurgence since the
crash, according to Kathryn Morrison, spokeswoman for the
Washington, D.C.-based Investment Company Institute.
   Net mutual fund sales have risen from minus $5.8 billion in
October to $1.8 billion in January, she said. The figures reflect
total sales minus redemptions, said Morrison.
   Morrison said there are approximately 2,000 funds available.
   In money market accounts nationwide, total assets have risen
from $241.3 billion in September to about $280 billion in January.
   ``There's $40 billion on the sidelines now waiting to see what
happens with the market,'' said Morrison. ``There's no shortage of
assets out there, it's just not in mutual funds like before.''

<HEAD>Security Pacific to Pay $160 Million for Hibernia Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific Corp., the nation's
seventh-largest bank holding concern, said Monday it has agreed to
acquire San Francisco-based Hibernia Bank for $160 million, or
about 1{ times its book value.
   Hibernia was put on the auction block by its parent, Hong
Kong-based First Pacific Holdings Ltd., last summer. But after
October's stock market crash, First Pacific said it was no longer
actively seeking a buyer.
   Acquisition of Hibernia will strengthen Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific in the northern part of the state.
   Hibernia, the 13th largest bank in California, has 35 branches
in Northern California, including 28 in the San Francisco Bay Area.
At year end, it had $1.2 billion in deposits and more than $1
billion in outstanding loans. It posted a profit of $11.2 million
last year.
   However, the sale of Hibernia doesn't mark a pullout from
California banking for First Pacific, which will continue to own
smaller United Savings Bank, with operations in the San Francisco
and Los Angeles regions.
   Tom Yasuda, one of First Pacific's directors, said the holding
company's plans call for it to expand United Savings.
   First Pacific also owns a bank in Hong Kong, an
investment-banking concern in the Philippines, and a
trade-confirming operation and minority interest in an
export-finance business in England.
   Security Pacific, whose chief subsidiary is Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific National Bank, the second largest in the state,
has assets of more than $72 billion.

   Anheuser-Busch Beverage Group Inc. announced
Monday that its aSante and Saratoga sparkling water brands and its
Zeltzer Seltzer natural soda brand are up for sale.
   The decision follows the company's recent discontinuance of the
Dewey Stevens wine cooler brand due to a declining rate of growth
industrywide in cooler sales.
   Terry Poulos, vice president and general manager of the group,
said that without the Dewey Stevens sales, ``total Beverage Group
volume was reduced below the level necessary to financially support
our continued production of these brands.''
   Anheuser-Busch will continue to support the brands through
current distributors until they are sold, Poulos said.
   He also said that since the introduction of the non-beer
beverages, competitive distribution methods had changed from the
primary use of wholesalers to direct shipments from producers to
major retailers. Therefore, the brands no longer fit
Anheuser-Busch's wholesaler system as originally envisioned, he
said.
   The company will continue to market Master Cellars keg wines and
Anheuser & Fehrs, an imported German wine. The test marketing of
the imported Ballygowan Irish sparkling spring water also will
continue, Poulos said.

   Stock prices rose sharply today, reaching new
highs since the crash last fall.
   Analysts said traders were heartened to see the Dow Jones
industrial average surpass the 2,051.89 level, where it stood Jan.
7 for its highest closing reading since the crash.
   The average failed in a bid to climb past that point last week,
but no significant selling pressure resulted, suggest to many
analysts that it was primed to make another try.
   One concern facing the market is the report due Tuesday from the
Commerce Department on the index of leading economic indicators for
January.
   Analysts generally expect the figure to show a decline. But the
firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. said the 0.2 percent drop
originally reported for December might be revised to show a gain.
   That would mean that the index would no longer have a string of
three consecutive monthly declines, a phenomenon which is
traditionally regarded as a potential recession warning.

<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union flight attendants for Northwest
Airlines were told by Teamsters officials Monday that a company
proposal to delay the promotion of B-scale workers to the
higher-paid A-scale bracket is the only major issue separating the
two sides in contract talks.
   About 150 of the company's 6,700 flight attendants were informed
of the situation at a rally at a Teamsters office less that two
miles away from the corporation's headquarters.
   An 11 p.m. Friday strike deadline passed without a settlement in
talks aimed at bring former Republic Airlines employees and their
Northwest counterparts under one contract. The employees have been
working under separate contracts since Northwest acquired Republic
in the fall of 1986.
   Talks broke down Saturday at dawn after an all-night bargaining
session with a federal mediator. But flight attendants have not
been called on to strike and the company has not exercised its
right to impose a contract on the flight attendants.
   Jeff Musto, a spokesman for the Teamsters, said Monday that no
talks have been held since Saturday and none are scheduled.
   ``We're still on red alert to strike,'' Musto. ``We want to keep
the company guessing.''
   As Musto explained, the one major issue left unresolved in the
negotiations are wages, which are governed under a two-tiered scale.
   All Northwest flight attendant were paid under one scale before
a 1982 contract created the B scale. All new employees hired since
then have started as B-scale employees at rates of pay lower than
the old system, Musto said.
   But the 1982 contract called for B-scale employees to jump to
A-scale levels in their sixth year of employment. The company has
proposed extending that wait until the ninth year of employment,
Musto said.
   For the average flight attendant, that would mean a loss of
$16,776 over the three years, Musto said.
   The company said the hourly wages it has proposed for the flight
attendants would make them the second-highest paid in the industry.
Musto said he agrees with that assessment, but he added that the
union has a commitment to flight attendants hired under the B-scale
not to break ``our promise'' that they would be promoted to the
A-scale in their sixth year.
   ``They could see light at the end of the tunnel,'' Musto said.
``Now all of a sudden the company is dangling the carrot out in
front of them a little further.''
   About a third of the company's flight attendants are at the
B-scale level, Musto said. By delaying their promotion to A-scale,
the majority of flight attendants would be under the B-scale when
it is time to negotiate the next contract.
   Then the company could win support for cutting the wages of
A-scale flight attendants because A-scale employees would be in the
minority, Musto said.
   Under Northwest's latest contract offer, base pay for senior
flight attendants would be about $35.18 an hour based on a 78-hour
work month, about half of what most Americans work. That would
increase to $36.60 an hour by May 1, 1991, the company said.
   William Wren said a large number of senior flight attendants
make more than $40,000 a year, plus meal payments when they're
working.
   Most entry-level flight attendants are making about $15,000 a
year, Wren said.
   The chief negotiator for the flight attendants, William Genoese,
was denied a request Monday to meet with Steven Rothmeier, chairman
and chief executive officer of the airline, Musto said.
   There was no further word Monday on whether pilots and mechanics
at Northwest would honor picket lines by the flight attendants.
Officials from the unions representing pilots and mechanics have
said they will wait to make a decision.
   Wren has said the mechanics are barred from sympathy strikes
under their contract and pilots are barred from sympathy strikes
under the Railway Labor Act.
   Wren said the company was operating under its normal flight
schedule Monday. About 2,000 non-union flight attendants are on
call to fill in if a strike is called, he has said.

<HEAD>AT&T To Make Its Unix Available Equally to All</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said Monday
it will make sure that its widely used Unix operating system, the
internal traffic cop of computers, is readily available to all the
computer hardware companies that want to use it.
   Some major computer companies had charged that AT&T was playing
favorites by giving early information about future versions of Unix
to Sun Microsystems Inc., a Silicon Valley maker of engineering
workstations that is a close partner of AT&T.
   ``People have had a big misconception about what the nature of
the agreement has been,'' Bill Klinger, an AT&T executive in charge
of Unix product management, said in an interview.
   Klinger said it would be a mistake for AT&T to play favorites
because that would delay the spread of Unix, an operating system
that is used mainly for scientific and engineering work.
   Motorola Inc. said Monday that the London-based UniSoft Group,
working closely with AT&T, would work to make sure that Unix runs
on computers that contain microprocessors made by Motorola.
   ``Combined with AT&T's support, this will ensure Motorola's
customers the same full and timely access as early as any
competitive architecture,'' Gary Tooker, Motorola's chief operating
officer, said in a news release.
   Motorola claims that 80 percent of all Unix-based computer
programs run on computers containing its microprocessors.
   Motorola's goal is to have programs run without modification on
any computer that uses one of its microprocessors.

   Simon & Schuster Inc. said Monday it had
acquired a group of travel publications from Rand McNally & Co. for
an undisclosed price.
   The Gulf & Western Co. publishing and information services unit
said it had acquired Rand McNally's campground directories and
national park guides and other travel location products including
the Places Rated series, which rates cities according to
quality-of-life attributes.
   Rand McNally retains its map-related travel publications.
   The titles will become part of Simon & Schuster's Prentice Hall
Trade division which publishes and distributes travel guides and
other travel-related products under such imprints as Access,
Frommer and Mobil.
   Steven Murphy, president of Prentice Hall, said the acquisitions
represent ``a perfect fit in terms of product and strategy.''
   ``It will not only add new destinations to our travel title list
but will greatly enhance our capabilities in the development of new
product for the travel market,'' he said.
   Roger Wildermuth, president of the Rand McNally publishing
group, said the divestiture is part of a strategy of concentrating
its consumer publishing resources on road atlases, road maps, world
atlases and other map products.

   American Express Chairman James D. Robinson
III on Monday suggested creation of a new international financial
organization to help ease the debt crisis of developing nations by
buying their loans.
   Robinson, in remarks prepared for a meeting of the Overseas
Development Council, said the organization, which he named ``The
Institute of International Debt and Development,'' would buy
outstanding Third World loans at a discount.
   One possibility, he suggested, would be for the loans to be
acquired at about 60 percent of face value.
   The organization would then offer the banks which had held the
loans ``new, long-term, high-quality obligations,'' including bonds
and certain forms of stock, Robinson suggested.
   ``I hope it (the proposal) will at least serve as a catalyst to
start an active dialogue,'' he said. He said new approaches were
needed because ``the risk of a debt crisis still hovers over the
fianancial markets.''
   Under Robinson's proposal, the new organization would oversee
and manage many facets of refinancing of loans owed by Latin
American and other developing nations.
   Total Third World debt now stands at about $1.2 trillion.
However, Robinson's proposal would be targeted to some $250 billion
owed to commercial banks by developing governments.
   Because the plan involves purchase of outstanding loans at a
discount, it would involve partial write-offs of the loans.
   Such an approach has been a part of some previous proposals,
including those advanced by Sen. Bill Bradley, R-N.J., and Rep.
John LaFalce, D-N.Y., but long opposed by the Reagan administration.
   Instead, the administration favors instead a rival plan by
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III that calls for new lending to
developing countries on a nation-by-nation basis, both by
international organizations like the World Bank and by commercial
banks.
   But, Robinson said: ``The case-by-case approach has bought time
and set the stage for a solution. But many believe it has not
helped the (developing country) debt problem get much better.''
   Robinson long has been active in international financial matters
and he had previously advanced earlier versions of his proposal for
a new international debt agency.
   He said the new agency should be a joint venture of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund and that major industrial
nations would provide start-up capital for the organization
totaling about $12.5 billion.
   Under the existing formula by which the United States
contributes 20 percent to the funds of the IMF, this would result
in a U.S. share of about $2.5 billion.
   ``The current strategy of case-by-case negotiations ... has so
far held a crisis at bay ... But it has not brought with it
adequate resources to support sustained growth in (developing)
economies,'' Robinson said.

   The stock market climbed to its highest level
since the October crash with a broad advance Monday that gathered
momentum as the session progressed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 48.41 to
2,071.62, posting more than half its gain in the last hour of
trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,255 up, 351 down and 374 unchanged.
   Big Board volume reached 236.05 million shares, against 191.09
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index gained
2.76 to 150.46.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $44.95 billion, or
1.73 percent, in value.
   Analysts said traders were heartened to see the Dow Jones
industrial average vault past the 2,051.89 level, where it stood
Jan. 7 for its previous highest closing reading since the crash
last year.
   The average failed in a bid to surpass that point last week, but
no significant selling pressure followed, suggest to many analysts
that it was primed to make another try.
   One concern facing the market is the report due Tuesday from the
Commerce Department on the index of leading economic indicators for
January.
   Analysts generally expect the figure to show a decline. But the
firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. said the 0.2 percent drop
originally reported for December might be revised to show a gain.
   That would mean that the index would no longer have a string of
three consecutive monthly declines, a phenomenon that is
traditionally regarded as a potential recession warning.
   The Dow Jones industrials finished February with a gain of
113.40 points. The average stands some 333 points above its close
of 1,738.74 on Black Monday Oct. 19.
   Observers said enthusiasm for stocks was fueled by continuing
brisk takeover activity.
   On the takeover scene, Roper Corp. jumped 10} to 36~. The
company agreed to be acquired by Whirlpool Corp. for $37.50 a share.
   Homestake Mining climbed 3{ to 18. Mesa Limited Partnership made
a $20-a-share offer for the company.
   Stop & Shop picked up ~ to 43{. The company, fighting a hostile
bid by Dart Group, reached agreement on a buyout at $44 a share by
a group organized by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co.
   Point-plus gainers among the blue chips included General Motors,
up 3[ at 72\; Merck, up 4| at 165]; International Business
Machines, up 1} at 117{; General Electric, up 1~ at 45{, and
International Paper, up 1| at 44].
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 265.09 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 6.80 to 309.43,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 5.36 at 267.82.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 3.55 to 366.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 288.46, up 4.14.

   Investment losses and high interest
expenses for money it borrowed to buy Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp. stock gave Henley Group large deficits for the fourth quarter
and all of 1987.
   However, the losses were 44 percent less for the quarter and 35
percent less for the year compared with the year-earlier periods,
the investment company said Monday.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company said it lost
$197 million on revenues of $863 million, compared with a $354
million lossk on revenues of $825 million in the final period of
1986.
   For the full year, the company said it lost $278 million on
revenues of $3.52 billion, compared with a loss of $426 million on
revenues of $3.17 billion in 1986.
   The 1987 results reflected investment losses of $112 million for
the fourth quarter and $102 million for the year, plus higher
interest expense for loans to acquire 15.1 million shares of Santa
Fe, the Chicago-based railroad and natural resources concern that
Henley has been seeking to take over.
   In all, Henley owns 24.6 million, or 15.7 percent, of Santa Fe's
157.3 million shares.
   The 1986 results included $286 million in pretax restructuring
charges related to writedowns and asset revaluations.
   For nearly a year, Henley has been courting Santa Fe, but the
Chicago company has repeatedly spurned its unsolicited overtures.
   The 1987 results represent Henley's first full year as an
independent company.
   Henley was formed in 1986 from 35 construction, environmental,
energy, chemical, manufacturing and finance businesses spun off 1{
years earlier by Allied-Signal Corp., which itself was formed by a
$5 billion merger in mid-1985.
   Henley has focused on paring costs and improving results of the
operations, then spinning them off at a profit.

   Futures prices for livestock plunged Monday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, and analysts blamed it on a ``nervousness''
over slaughter house shutdowns.
   Prices fell as much as 127 points, or 1.27 cents, and only one
contract, live hogs for delivery in December, managed to finish
higher.
   Selling interest in cattle was heightened by inactive cash
markets, traders said.
   ``Packers, with squeezed margins, have reduced their slaughters.
They're closing some plants and there's nervousness in market,''
said Tom Morgan, head of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington
Heights, Ill.
   Live hog prices followed a lower cash market, and prices for
frozen pork bellies followed the lead of traders in the live hog
pit, Morgan said.
   Live cattle settled .40 cent to 1.12 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in April at 71.50 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .45 cent higher to 1.27 cents lower with March at 79.75
cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent higher to 1.07 cents lower
with April at 43.25 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25
cent to .63 cent higher with March at 51.85 cents a pound.
   Futures prices for corn and soybeans were up sharply while wheat
prices were mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Some soybean contracts closed more than 10 cents above Friday's
prices.
   Lighter-than-expected delivery notices for soybeans helped
support higher soybeans prices, said Jerry Gidel, a grains analyst
in Chicago for G.H. Miller & Co.
   Wheat prices were supported by import interest from the
Phillippines, 175,000 tons worth, and talk that the Soviets may be
back in the market, Gidel said.
   Corn prices were restained somewhat by lower-than-expected
exports for that commodity, said Steve Freed, a grains analyst in
Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.15{ a bushel; corn was 2\
cents to 3 cents higher with March at $2.03} a bushel; oats were 2\
cents to 4\ cents higher with March at $1.94{ a bushel; and
soybeans were 8{ cents to 10{ cents higher with March at $6.36 a
bushel.
   Energy prices finished higher in moderate volume on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   The heating oil contract for March rose 1.46 cents because it
had been oversold at the end of last week, said Peter Beutel, a
petroleum analyst in New York with Elders Future Inc.
   Crude oil prices were supported by a recently published report
that production by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
was lower than expected, he said.
   Crude oil settled 12 cents to 23 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in February at $15.49 a barrel; heating oil was .38
cent to 1.46 cents higher with February at 45.85 cents a gallon;
and unleaded gasoline was .41 cent to .70 cent higher with March at
45.71 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver prices climbed higher on the Commodity Exchange
in New York.
   A technical adjustment, known as a short-covering rally, in
platinum trading _ where futures prices rose $25 a troy ounce _
triggered the higher prices in precious metals, said Marty McNeill,
a metals analyst in New York with Dominick & Dominick.
   In a short sale, a trader sells borrowed contracts in hopes of
replacing them _ or ``covering'' the sale _ later with others
bought at a lower price.
   ``Grains were up sharply, that always helps,'' he said. ``Oil
prices were rising, and the dollar was mixed among foreign
currencies. That played a part in the market, too.''
   Gold settled 10 cents to 90 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at $430.50 a troy ounce; and silver was 8.4 cents
to 9.7 cents higher with March at $6.23 a troy ounce.

   Gold prices tumbled Monday in Europe but
rebounded sharply in New York, based on a stunning rally in
platinum that traders ascribed to fear of unrest in South Africa, a
leading producer of precious metals.
   The dollar vacillated in a narrow range in sluggish foreign
exchange transactions, reflecting what brokers called the lack of
economic news and a typical trading slowdown at month's end.
   European gold traders sold the metal aggressively, based on an
underlying fear that gold was becoming a less attractive investment
because of evidence of eased inflation.
   In London, gold fell $6.50 a troy ounce from Friday levels to
$425 and in Zurich it fell $5.50 an ounce to $426. Earlier in Hong
Kong gold was down about 15 cents to $430.19.
   Later in New York gold recovered the loss, and by 4 p.m.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $430.50 a troy
ounce, up from $429.50 Friday. On the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery was quoted at $430.50 an ounce,
up 90 cents.
   ``The one word to explain it was platinum,'' said John Norris, a
precious metals analyst at Citibank in New York. ``We saw a sharp
rally in platinum, based on continued unrest in South Africa, and
that helped firm gold prices.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for current
delivery surged $25.30 a troy ounce to $475.
   Silver prices also advanced on the New York Comex, up 8.4 cents
from Friday to $6.24 a troy ounce. Earlier in London, silver fell
to $6.14 a troy ounce, down from $6.20 late Friday.
   Currency brokers said dollar trading was uneventful and there
were no financial developments to influence the currency's
behavior. But some said government reports later in the week
providing evidence of the U.S. economy's direction might affect the
dollar.
   ``Traders got fed up with the market today,'' said Toshihiko
Masaki, a foreign exchange trader at the New York office of Japan's
Sanwa Bank. ``There was no economic data, no news, no factors.
People got bored.''
   The dollar fell in Tokyo to 128.12 Japanese yen from 128.35 yen
at the close Friday. Later in London, the dollar edged higher to
128.35 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York, the dollar
was quoted at 128.24 yen, down from 128.37 yen late Friday.
   In London, the British pound eased to $1.7725 from $1.7730 late
Friday. But later in New York the pound was worth $1.7742, up from
$1.7715 quoted late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Friday
included: 1.6874 West German marks, down from 1.6887; 1.3931 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3863; 1.2592 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2634;
5.7155 French francs, down from 5.7170; and 1,243 Italian lire,
down from 1,245.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday
included: 1.6875 West German marks, down from 1.6895; 1.3903 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3897; 5.7150 French francs, down from 5.7175;
1.8945 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8965; 1,244.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,245.45; 1.2622 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2838.

   United Parcel Service announced Monday
that its wholly-owned subsidiary, UPS Italia Srl, has entered into
a contract to acquire one of Italy's leading domestic and
international package carriers.
   The purchase price for Alimondo was not disclosed. The
transaction is expected to be completed in April.
   Founded in 1907, Greenwich-based UPS handles about 10 million
parcels daily in combined ground and air service around the world.
   Since September 1986, UPS and Alimondo have been service
partners in a delivery service between Italy and the United States,
and between Italy and West Germany.
   John W. Rogers, UPS chief executive officer, said the
acquisition is ``an evolution of a successful service partnership.''
   Alimondo managing director Roberto Pacchiono said the
acquisition will enable his firm to benefit from ``the long
experience and expertise of one of the most qualified operators in
the parcel delivery field.''

<HEAD>Propose Optional Blockout of Adult Phone Messages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   All ``dial-a-porn'' telephone messages would be
placed under one exchange and customers would be allowed to block
all calls to that exchange at no charge under a plan announced
Monday by New York Telephone Co.
   ``It will give parents a means of preventing their children from
calling these companies,'' company spokesman Steve Marcus said of
the plan which has been proposed to the state Public Service
Commission.
   The proposal is similar to plans now being implemented elsewhere
around the country as phone companies have sought legal ways to
pull the plug on sexually explicit telephone dial-up messages.
   New York Telephone proposed that adult messages be grouped under
the 970 exchange. Customers in the New York metropolitan calling
area could control how their phones are used by having the phone
company block that exchange.
   The metropolitan calling area includes area codes 212, 718, 516
and part of 914. Calls from other points in the state to the 970
exchange would be blocked automatically, the company said.
   Customers would also have the option of blocking all calls to
group bridging services, numbers which allow several customers to
participate in the same conversation.
   There would be no charge for ordering the block for 90 days
after the plan becomes effective _ March 11 if the PSC approves.
After that, residence customers would pay $5 for instituting the
block and business customers $10.
   Currently, adult messages and other mass announcement services
are spread over the 540, 550, 970 and 976 exchanges. The phone
company supplies the lines but does not control the content.
   New York Telephone has about 4.2 million residential customers
in the metropolitan area. About 26 percent of them would require a
number change to implement a block because not all exchanges have
the updated switching equipment required for the move. Those
needing a number change would be given it free of charge, the
company said.

   MCorp officials on Monday reached a definitive
agreement to sell the company's 80.1 percent interest in MTech to
Electronic Data Systems Corp. for about $281 million in cash and
securities.
   Gene H. Bishop, chairman and chief executive officer of MCorp,
and Les Alberthal, EDS president and chief executive officer, made
the joint announcement.
   The Dallas-based EDS is a wholly owned subsidiary of General
Motors Corp.
   ``We are particularly pleased to reach this agreement with
EDS,'' Bishop said in a prepared statement. ``The transaction will
allow MCorp to realize significant value which has been previouosly
unrecognized.''
   The agreement's terms call for MCorp to get about $30 in cash
and securities for each MTech common share. The transaction,
subject to GM approval and satisfaction of other conditions, was
expected to be completed by April 15.
   Holders of MTech common stock and convertible debentures would
be offered the same package of cash and securities as that received
by MCorp. Public holders of MTech common stock would also get a
``cash election'' for payment entirely in cash at the rate of $30
per MTech share.
   Holders of MTech convertible debentures will be offered the
opportunity to receive $1,000 plus accrued interest for each
debenture.
   MTech has been an EDS competitor for some time, said EDS
spokesman Roger Still. MTech does business in 18 states with 1,400
financial institutions.
   ``We have no intention of laying off anybody,'' Still said.
``There's a lot of good talent at MTech. It would be really
premature to talk about any changes in their assets or management
structure.''
   About 19.9 percent of MTech is owned by individual stockholders,
said Still.
   MCorp is a financial services company with assets of $20.2
billion as of Dec. 31.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stop & Shop Cos. Inc. announced Monday it has
agreed to be acquired in a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout by the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc., but Dart Group Corp.
said the news will not deter its attempt to gain control of the
retailer.
   Stop & Shop said a Kohlberg Kravis subsidiary, SSC Holdings
Corp., will purchase at least 66 percent of the 28 million
outstanding Stop & Shop shares at $44 each.
   If all outstanding stock were purchased, the leveraged buyout
would total $1.23 billion. In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow
heavily to buy out a company and then pay off the debt with the
target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.
   Dart, which launched the hostile takeover bid in January,
extended until March 9 an offer of $37 a share for all outstanding
Stop & Shop stock and indicated it planned to go ahead with a proxy
fight to replace Stop & Shop directors later this month.
   Dart spokesman Jeffrey Gast said the Landover, Md.-based firm
planned to continue the cash tender offer past March 9 on a day to
day basis.
   However, Harry Wells, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill in
Boston, said it was unlikely Dart could match the $44 a share offer.
   ``I think it's over,'' said Wells. ``You've got to be able to
support the debt with some level of safety ... and ($44) is about
as much as one can reasonably afford to pay (for Stop & Shop).''
   Stop & Shop has rejected as inadequate Dart's $1.03 billion
offer and filed suit in federal court, seeking to block Dart.
   A countersuit filed by Dart claiming Stop & Shop illegally
withheld corporate information was rejected last week by U.S.
District Court Judge Rya Zobel, who ordered that the suit must be
filed in state courts.
   Dart, which purchased nearly 730,000 shares through its
Jefferson Acquisition Corp. subsidiary, announced Feb. 26 it
received approval from at least 10 percent of Stop & Shop
shareholders to call a special shareholders meeting on March 30.
   At the meeting, Dart wants to remove the Stop & Shop board and
replace it with Jefferson nominees.
   Under the deal with Kohlberg Kravis, Stop & Shop said it will
retain its present management and remain based in Braintree.
   The sale, which must be approved by a majority of Stop & Shop
shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission, is
expected to commence on or before March 4, Stop & Shop said.
Kohlberg Kravis has received a financing commitment from
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., the retailer said.
   Other companies reportedly have been interested in Stop & Shop,
including Thomas H. Lee Co. of Boston, and Riordan, Freeman &
Spogli Inc. of Los Angeles.
   Stop & Shop has 113 supermarkets and 169 Bradlees in 12 states
in the Northeast.
   The company's stock has gone up more than $25 a share since Dart
first announced its takeover intent in January. It rose 87{ cents a
share in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, closing at $43.50.
   Dart is known for a series of unsuccessful but profitable bids
to gain control of other companies, and its chairman, Herbert Haft,
and president, Robert Haft, have acquired reputations as corporate
raiders.
   In its most recent bid, Dart dropped an attempt for
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. following the October stock
market crash.
   Other Dart takeover attempts include a 1986 bid for Safeway Co.
and Supermarkets General last year.
   Kohlberg Kravis, which acquired Safeway following the failed
Dart bid, has conducted about 33 leveraged buyouts since forming in
1976, including a $6.2 billion deal that took Beatrice Cos. private
in 1986.
   Last week, Kohlberg Kravis acquired New York-based Seaman
Furniture Co. for $350 million. In July 1987, the firm obtained
control of Jim Walter Co., a Florida construction material
manufacturer.

   John M. Stafford resigned as head of
Pillsbury Co. Monday, and will be replaced by former chief
executive William H. Spoor, who will come out of retirement to
assume those duties, the company said.
   The announcement was made in a prepared statement, which did not
indicate why Stafford resigned as chairman, president and chief
executive officer, nor why Spoor was elected by the company's board
of directors to replace him.
   Spokesmen for the company did not immediately return a
reporter's phone call seeking comment beyond the statement.
   Spoor, 65, returned to the company last September as chairman of
the executive committee. He had retired in 1985 after spending his
entire career with the company, the last 12 years as chairman and
chief executive.
   Spoor said shareholders and employees will long remember the
many contributions made to the company by Stafford.
   ``Jack Stafford has been totally dedicated to the success of
Pillsbury and to the values that make it great. We deeply
appreciate everything that he has achieved for this company over
the past decade,'' Spoor said.
   In addition to the above action, the board of directors
appointed a search committee to seek a chief executive for the
company to succeed Spoor.

<HEAD>Steel's Dead, Move On, Planners Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>

   Pittsburgh-area residents should wake up if
they're still dreaming that empty steel plants will come back to
life, say city planners from an international architecture
conference.
   ``You've got to face reality. They're gone,'' said Tony McGann,
whose hometown of Liverpool, England, lived through the decline of
dockyard industries. ``If you wait for the steel industry to come
back, you'll wait forever.''
   The planning team, 12 Americans and five Britons, toured
Monongahela Valley communities whose economies have been gutted by
the decline of steelmaking. They addressed about 100 Mon Valley
residents Saturday in Homestead and released a report Monday
suggesting how the once-thriving steel centers of Homestead,
Duquesne and McKeesport could recover.
   The planners' effort was organized by the American Institute of
Architects, a sponsor of this week's Remaking Cities Conference in
Pittsburgh. Britain's Prince Charles, an advocate of better city
planning, is scheduled to address the conference Saturday.
   Plants last operated by USX Corp. in Homestead, a river gateway
to Pittsburgh, could be leveled and replaced by five-acre flower
plots like those featured in European garden festivals, the
planners recommended.
   ``We can't use all the land at once. But if it looked green it
would be easier to sell,'' said team leader John Clarke of Trenton,
N.J.
   The planners envision turning one old ironmaking blast furnace
into a museum, developing the riverbank as a yacht landing and
perhaps within a decade building luxury riverfront homes.
   ``It's the greening of industrial America,'' British architect
Richard Burton said.
   ``It sounds innovative, anyway. Most of us around here though
were looking for things that were going to create more jobs,'' said
Robert Anderson, a founder of Homestead's Rainbow Kitchen, which
feeds about 100 unemployed people per day and distributes groceries
as needed to about 600 households.
   At its peak, about 15,000 workers were employed at the Homestead
plant. The last steel was rolled in May 1986.
   ``Few white knights are likely to ride into the Mon Valley and
bring thousands of jobs at once,'' the report said.
   The report recommended that a former USX plant site at
McKeesport be used for sports events, a giant flea market, a
discount sales center and a factory outlet.
   ``It's better than using it for a warehouse. It would employ
people and bring activity to downtown McKeesport,'' Clarke said.
   Duquesne seems best suited as a center for recycling trash or
converting it to energy, the report said.
   Homestead Councilwoman Betty Esper and Mike Stout, a member of
the Steel Valley Authority and Tri-State Conference on Steel, were
among the town meeting speakers who said steel plants should not be
redeveloped so quickly because the industry might need them again.
   ``You have to move forward. This is like a lingering divorce
that, until it is finally settled, is very painful, and even after
it's settled will be painful,'' said architect Michael Swartler of
New York.
   Longstanding dependence on one industry has left Mon Valley
communities with little experience in developing their economies,
Clarke said.
   ``We have heard from mayors who don't know what role they play
in development of the sites,'' he said. ``Our work is an
illustration of how to embark on that process.''

<HEAD>Whirlpool Buys Ga.-Based Appliance-Maker for $350 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. said Monday it has
reached an agreement to buy Roper Corp., an Augusta, Ga.-based
manufacturer of appliances and lawn equipment, for $350 million.
   Whirlpool, one of the nation's leading appliance makers with
$4.2 billion in sales last year, will pay $37.50 a share for all
outstanding stock in Roper, Whirlpool said.
   ``Acquiring Roper is a major step in our strategic plans for
growth and is evidence of our commitment to the major home
appliance marketplace,'' said David R. Whitwam, chairman and
president of Whirlpool.
   Charles Ryan, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, said the
two companies were a ``good fit'' and each offered something that
the other needed.
   ``Ranges has been one of the weak areas for Whirlpool,'' which
now will have an internal source for them, he said. Roper, on the
other hand, faced the threat of a hostile takeover and found a
friendly suitor in Whirlpool, he said.
   Whirlpool had net income of $191.9 million in 1987, down from
$199.7 million one year earlier. Earnings from the two years were
the company's best of the last decade.
   Under the agreement, Robert Cook will remain as president of
Roper and will become a vice president of Whirlpool, Whitwam said.
   ``This new relationship with Whirlpool is outstanding for the
future of both companies and is excellent for our stockholders,
employees and customers,'' Cook said.
   Roper employs about 4,750 people at plants and offices in
Lafayette, Dalton, McRae and Swainsboro, Ga.; Kankake, Ill.;
Orangeburg, S.C.; Chattanooga, Tenn., Mississauga, Ontario. It had
sales of $703 million in the 12 months ending July 31, 1987.
   Roper produces electric and gas ranges, tillers, lawn mowers and
lawn and garden tractors.
   Like Whirlpool, Roper is a major supplier to Sears Roebuck &
Co., the nation's leading retailer. The companies produce
appliances that are sold under the Sears brand name.
   ``Joining forces with another reliable supplier of quality goods
to Sears can only serve to enhance the Whirlpool-Sears
relationship,'' Whitwam said.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. plans a major management
overhaul in its retail division, but will not reveal what the
restructuring will include until the changes are described to the
company's headquarters staff, a Sears spokesman said Monday.
   Philo Holland, the company's national public affairs manager,
said Sears Merchandise Group officials would meet with employees in
Chicago this week to discuss the restructuring, ``which will take
place over the next several years.''
   Holland said he could neither confirm nor deny a report in
Crain's Chicago Business that the nation's largest retailer planned
to transform its 27 merchandise buying groups into independent
business units and lay off some headquarters personnel.
   ``We need to hold these meetings this week with our own people
to lay out the plans,'' he said. ``I can't confirm or deny (the
Crain's report) until we're able to talk to our employees. For them
to read it in the newspaper before we tell it to them would be
inappropriate.''
   Crain's, a weekly newspaper, reported in its editions out Monday
that Sears planned the overhaul because of sluggish sales and
profits.
   Quoting a Sears source it did not name, Crain's said the company
planned significant workforce reductions among its headquarters
personnel through layoffs or attrition.
   While Holland declined comment on the company's future plans, he
said, ``There will not be any layoffs announced this week.''
   Crain's reported that, as part of the restructuring, Sears would
reorganize buying groups for every product line and scrap its past
policy of using one management structure for each unit.
   The company also plans to analyze the competitiveness of each
product line, from hard goods like washing machines to soft goods
like fashion, to see if its profits are at an acceptable level in
individual areas.
   While Wall Street analysts said they did not know what Sears
executives had in mind, they said the company could be trying to
reposition itself in the retail industry as well as cut costs.
   ``They've been an underperforming group for the company,'' said
Karen Sack, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Corp., of the Sears
Merchandise Group. ``They've turned in a really mediocre
performance and it's a difficult retail market for at least 1988.''
   ``They're going to have to do something to become more flexible
and responsive to the changes in what's going to be a very
lackluster sales environment,'' she said.
   Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.,
said Sears has been considering a shift toward more fashion
retailing.
   He added, ``They're trying to get rid of some of the fat.''
   Crain's also reported that Sears would promote three executives
to newly created management positions to oversee the restructuring,
but Holland said that step was not planned.

<HEAD>Japan's Unemployment Rate Rises To 2.7 Percent In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment in Japan fell to a seasonally-adjusted
2.7 percent in January from 3.0 percent a year earlier, but was up
0.1 percentage point from the previous month, the government
announced Tuesday.
   The number of job holders rose during the one-year period by
1.12 million to 58.28 million, an increase of 1.9 percent,
according to the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister's Office.
   Bureau officials said the number of people employed rose sharply
in the latter half of the year as the economy recovered from the
effects of the higher value of the Japanese yen. The strong yen
curbed overseas sales and earnings and forced Japanese
manufacturers, particularly shipbuilders and steelmakers, to slash
production and manpower.
   After hitting a record 3.2 percent last May, Japan's
unemployment rate has drifted lower as manufacturers adjusted to
the high yen.
   Japan's unemployment rate would be higher if calculated by U.S.
and European methods.
   In Japan, members of the armed forces and people who worked more
than one hour during the last week of the month are counted as
employed. In the United States, military personnel are not included
in the work force and those who work less than 15 hours a week are
considered unemployed.
