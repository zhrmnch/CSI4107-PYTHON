   President Joaquin
Balaguer said Thursday he will call out the army if necessary to
quell disturbances that cost three lives in two days.
   Balaguer also asked for his entire Cabinet's resignation, saying
it had to be ``restructured to respond to the present
circumstances.''
   In the central and northeastern provinces, police battled
demonstrators who blocked the main avenues in the cities and threw
rocks at police and commercial establishments.
   Late Thursday, authorities said a 72-hour strike had ended in
east-central Sanchez Ramirez province, where protests started 11
years ago. Peasants there demonstrated against alleged cyanide and
sulfur contamination of rivers from a state-owned gold mine.
   Earlier, company officials denied any contamination existed but
said that up to 130 families would be moved to a farm inside the
province away from the mine.
   The protests, which grew to include other issues, have been the
worst since Balaguer took office 1{ years ago in this Caribbean
island nation of more than 6.5 million people.
   In Azua, 75 miles west of the capital city of Santo Domingo,
protesters detonated homemade bombs and burned tires in some areas,
but police said most of the town was under control.
   A 15-year-old newspaper vendor shot in Azua on Wednesday was
reported to have died. Two other people were killed Wednesday.
   More than a dozen people have been reported wounded by gunfire
and an undetermined number have been arrested in the eight
provinces affected by the unrest.
   Much of the country's commercial activity has been paralyzed and
schools remained closed.
   The protests spread to other parts of the country, where
residents demanded capital improvements and government action to
control inflation estimated at about 30 percent annually.
   Balaguer went on television to deliver his message from the
National Palace shortly after midnight Wednesday. He said the
government would tolerate public protests as long as they were
peaceful but would not accept acts of vandalism and violence.
   ``If the circumstances demand it ... we will confront these
demonstrations and use all the military and physical power the
state has to stop them,'' he said.
   He added, however, that his government would not repeat the
events in 1984, when soldiers shot and killed almost 100 people
demonstrating against price increases.
   ``We won't have a slaughter like the one April 23, 24 and 25,
1984,'' he said.
   There was no word on whether the Cabinet had submitted its
resignation and no replacements were announced.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls For Drastic Measures To Cope With $172 Million Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Art Agnos on Friday said the city
faces a whopping $172 million budget deficit next year that will
require layoffs, ``painful'' cuts in service and possibly tax
increases and fare hikes.
   ``This is the worst budget crisis in the modern history of San
Francisco,'' declared Agnos, who was inaugurated in January.
   ``To close this kind of gap, we have to consider big cuts _
things like closing hospital wards, clinics and mental health
programs, freezing city employee pay, shutting branch libraries and
cutting back bus runs,'' he said.
   Agnos, flanked by his fiscal advisers, said at a news conference
that the latest, revised budget analysis indicates the city faces a
$172.4 million deficit, nearly $100 million more than was forecast
in November.
   ``At the same time we were contemplating these kinds of painful
service cuts, we could be asking citizens to put up with higher
Muni fares, parking rate hikes, added business levies and increased
fees for city services,'' Agnos said.
   The mayor said the $172.4 million deficit is the equivalent of
more than 5,000 city jobs. He offered no specific targets in regard
to layoffs.
   The more than doubling of the deficit was blamed largely on an
estimated drop in revenue of $28 million; $40 million in judgments
against the city from employee litigation, and rising costs of
employee health benefits and other programs.
   ``There is no easy way out of this problem,'' the mayor said.
``Everyone in this city is going to have to bear some pain to get
our fiscal house back in order.''
   Agnos stopped short of blaming his predecessor, Dianne
Feinstein, for the financial crisis but said the city's surplus of
$150 million in 1982-83 ``has dropped to ground zero.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Says Chinese Troops Landed on Disputed Islands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has accused China of landing
troops on two coral reefs of a South China Sea archipelago claimed
by both countries, according to a Vietnamese newspaper report made
available Saturday.
   The Communist Party newspaper, Nhan Dan, said Chinese military
forces had landed on Chu Thap and Chau Vien, two coral reefs in the
Truong Sa, or Spratly archipelago.
   ``The situation in the Truong Sa archipelago and the eastern sea
as a whole is becoming dangerously tense due to the Chinese
authorities' brazen violations of Vietnam's territorial sovereignty
there,'' the newspaper said in a front page article Friday.
   On Feb. 20, Vietnam charged that four Chinese warships
``provoked and obstructed'' operations of its cargo vessels Jan. 31
off the Spratly group. Beijing has denied the accusation.
   The latest Vietnamese report gave no further details of the
alleged Chinese troop landings.
   Several countries claim the Spratly group as well as the
Paracels, an archipelgo called Hoang Sa by the Vietnamese. Large
oil deposits are said to be located in the vicinity.
   China stations troops in the Paracels while Vietnam holds a few
islands in the Spratlies. But claims on parts or all of the two
chains have also been made by Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.
   China and Vietnam fought a bloody border war in 1979 and have
since accused each other of frontier violations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican revealed its financial statement
for the first time in history Thursday, disclosing that the
administrative headquarters for the world's 840 million Roman
Catholics ran an operating deficit of $56.7 million in 1986, The
Washington Post reported in Friday's editions.
   The statement was made public by the Washington-based National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, ending centuries of secrecy.
   Cardinal John Krol said a 15-man council of cardinals on which
he sits decided last October to release the information in the hope
such openness would stimulate the faithful to contribute more to
the church.
   The deficit was met by taking $32 million from Peter's pence,
the Vatican's annual worldwide collection intended for charitable
purposes, and $24.7 million more from the fund's reserve, the Post
said.
   The Peter's pence collection for the first nine months of 1987
totaled $35.8 million, an increase attributed at least in part to
repeated pleas for help, the newspaper said.
   The document revealed that Vatican expenses in 1986 totaled
nearly $114 million, with the largest chunk, $58 million, spent for
personnel. That included $50.6 million for the Vatican's 2,395
employees and $7.3 million for pension payments to 885 retirees.
   Other major expenses included $11.7 million for publishing, $11
million in expenditures related to investments, $10.4 million for
equipment and operating costs of Vatican Radio and $9.7 million for
administrative expenses ranging from stationery to the costs of
worldwide synods of bishops.
   Operating income comes from investments, publishing, endowments
and Vatican Radio's sale of tapes of papal speeches and radio
programs.
   ``We need complete accounting,'' Krol told U.S. bishops at their
annual meeting here last fall. ``It's the only way to go.''
   Krol retird last month as head of the Philadelphia archdiocese
but continues to head special fund-raising efforts for the church.

<HEAD>Facts and Figures on Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Here are facts and figures on Panama:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Panama is an S-shaped isthmus that links Central
America and South America. It is bordered on the west by Costa Rica
and on the east by Colombia. With 29,208 square miles, it is a
little larger than West Virginia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The country has about 2.2 million people, 70
percent of them a mixture of Spanish and Indian descendants.
Fourteen percent are West Indian, 10 percent are Caucasian and 6
percent are Indian. Spanish is the official language but English is
widely spoken. The predominant religion is Roman Catholicism.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ The government is headed by President Eric
Arturo Delvalle, a civilian who previously was first vice
president. He became president on Sept. 28, 1985, after Nicolas
Ardito Barletta resigned under pressure from the military after 11
months as the country's first democratically elected president in
16 years.
   Although Delvalle is president, there has been little question
that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the armed forces chief, runs the
country.
   Noriega inherited command of the military from Gen. Omar
Torrijos, who seized power in 1968 and died in a plane crash in
1981.
   The Reagan administration called for Noriega to resign after
U.S. grand juries indicted him and others on drug trafficking
charges on Feb. 5. However, there had been U.S. pressure for him to
leave for some time.
   In June, Noriega's former second-in-command sparked the
country's most serious unrest in years when he publicly accused
Noriega of election fraud, drug trafficking and the assassination
of a political opponent.
   Noriega denied the charges.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CANAL _ The 51-mile Panama Canal, connecting the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans, was built by the United States from 1904 to
1914 on territory leased from Panama.
   Treaties signed by then-President Jimmy Carter and Torrijos in
1977 transfer control of the canal and its defense to Panama on
Dec. 31, 1999.
   The 10-mile-wide canal zone was turned over to Panama after the
treaties went into effect in 1979.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Panama is a leading international financial
center, with more than 120 banks holding roughly $30 billion in
assets.
   U.S. officials have complained that the secret bank accounts the
country offers have helped make Panama a haven for laundering
illegal drug money.
   The country's main crops are bananas, pineapples, cocoa, corn,
coconuts and sugar.
   The official currency is the U.S. dollar, but it is called the
balboa.

   An Army helicopter caught fire and crashed
in a pasture Thursday, killing nine soldiers and seriously burning
nine, authorities said.
   Two soldiers fell 35 feet after leaping from the burning
twin-rotor CH-47D Chinook as it hurtled toward the ground about 50
miles from Fort Worth, said state Department of Public Safety Sgt.
Robert Rankin. One of the soldiers died.
   The other soldier said that a fire had broken out at the back of
the helicopter based at Fort Sill, Okla., and that those aboard had
tried to move to the front to get away from the flames, according
to Rankin.
   ``We do have some witnesses who said they saw parts falling off
back toward Chico (several miles away), and some of the witnesses
said it was on fire before impact,'' he said.
   Nine soldiers were killed and nine injured, said Fort Hood
spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Miller. Eighteen people were aboard,
said Rick Brink, a Fort Sill spokesman. The injured were listed in
serious and critical condition.
   Many of the soldiers suffered third-degree burns, some over
their entire bodies; others were wrapped in body bags after
firefighters extinguished the grass fire, authorities said.
   Seven soldiers died at the scene of the afternoon crash, which
sparked a grass fire, said Lt. Brad Schuldt of Carswell Air Force
Base. Another soldier died at Parkland Memorial Hospital, said
administrator Paula Sears.
   A ninth soldier died at Bridgeport Hospital, said Justice of the
Peace Dawayne Kennedy.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. A team of
investigators from Fort Rucker, Ala., was en route Thursday night,
said Col. Herbert Blanks.
   In 1985, the Army grounded its entire fleet of 63 of the giant
CH-47D helicopters after an accident in Honduras injured eight
soldiers. The order was lifted after a month and a half.
   Wendell Berry, a farmer, said he saw the copter skid about 75
yards before breaking apart in flames Thursday. He said he tried to
fight the flames with a fire extinguisher and helped douse burning
bodies scattered about the wreckage.
   ``We put a lot of fire (on people) out,'' Berry said. ``We
couldn't do very much but get 'em out of the way. We actually could
do very little. Nobody could really do anything.''
   ``One was up walking around, the rest were out on ground. I cut
the pilot or the assistant pilot. I cut his seatbelt loose,'' he
added. ``He was wanting me to cut him out of there and I did that.
He was conscious talking to me.''
   The copter was returning to Fort Sill from Fort Hood in central
Texas with five soldiers from Fort Sill and 12 from Fort Hood
aboard, said Capt. Tim Vane of Fort Hood. The Chinook can carry
more than 33 combat-equipped soldiers.
   Winford McDaniel, supervisor of a rock-crushing business two
miles from the crash site, said a large part fell from the copter
and landed near the plant.
   ``It looks like an exhaust pipe,'' he said. ``It's a round piece
about three feet long and three feet across.''
   ``I was driving west of Chico and saw smoke coming out of the
helicopter and knew it was going to crash,'' said James St. John.
``I drove out there and it had already crashed. I seen it when it
was going down, but not when it crashed.''
   The CH-47D is a modernized version of the earlier models of the
Chinook, which for years has been a part of the Army inventory.
   In the Honduras accident, a transmission bearing failed on a
CH-47D taxiing to a refueling depot. The failure caused one of the
copter's main rotors to stop turning; the other rotor began hitting
it and the helicopter tore itself apart.
   The Chinooks's main rotors mesh as they turn, and therefore must
be synchronized.
   Eight soldiers were killed in April 1986 when a CH-47 and
another helicopter collided at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia.

   Israeli analysts say riots in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip began spontaneously 11 weeks ago, but the PLO
and Islamic groups are playing an increasing role in the unrest.
   President Reagan said at a news conference Wednesday that
``terrorists'' and ``outsiders'' were behind much of the violence.
   Yasser Arafat, chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
said in an interview with Swedish television earlier this month
that he planned and controlled the Palestinian uprising.
   All indications point to a spontaneous beginning of riots Dec.
8, when an army truck killed four Palestinians outside the Jabaliya
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.
   The accident occurred the day after an Israeli was fatally
stabbed in Gaza City, and rumors swept the camp that the truck hit
the Arabs on purpose.
   Israel's U.N. Ambassador Benyamin Netanyahu told reporters the
rumor was helped along by a PLO broadcast on Baghdad radio.
   Jabaliya residents held an overnight march and the first
casualties were recorded Dec. 9: two Arabs killed and 18 wounded by
Israeli soldiers.
   Journalists on the scene discover that many clashes are started
by such local incidents as army arrest raids or the funerals of
Arabs shot during protests.
   Ohers begin after announcements from the loudspeakers of
mosques, usually untrue, that say Jewish settlers are headed for
villages or towns on vigilante rampages.
   Brig. Gen. Arieh Shalev, military governor of the West Bank in
1974-76, said control of the protests was split among several
groups: Arafat's mainstream PLO, Syrian-backed Palestinian groups
and local Islamic fundamentalist organizations.
   They use leaflets, radio broadcasts from Iraq and Syria, and
orders relayed by telephone to activists in the West Bank and Gaza,
he said in an interview.
   Shalev said the PLO had strong influence as a symbol but its
organizational structure was weak in the territories, partly
because of an army crackdown that has jailed nearly 2,000 activists
since December.
   As a result, he said, local groups would follow PLO directives
only if they were deemed reasonable.
   ``If they ordered people to stop working at jobs in Israel
altogether, people would not pay attention because they have no
alternative,'' the general said.
   Reporters sometimes have seen highly organized local responses
by Palestinians.
   At Gaza City's Shifa hospital in December, community leaders met
in the director's office to plan strategy while youths piled up
stones in the courtyard. Demonstrators handed reporters printed
lists of grievances.
   In Jerusalem, journalists saw Arab medical teams arrive from
neighboring areas as youths set up makeshift barricades and
prepared to attack soldiers with stones.
   Amnon Linn, chairman of a parliamentary subcommittee on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, said 80 percent of the riots now result from
PLO leaflets.
   ``They call on people to revolt and kill anyone who makes an
attempt to negotiate with Israel or has any relations with Israeli
authorities,'' said Linn, former head of the Labor Party's Arab
department.
   Nahum Barnea, editor of the leftist magazine Koteret Rashit,
said: ``The PLO was suprised by the start of the riots. It was not
initiated by the PLO.''
   Barnea said in an interview the PLO stepped in later with
directives for commercial strikes and boycotts.
   He said PLO influence sometimes helped restrain young Arabs from
escalating the violence with knives, guns and bombs, so ``in a way
it is a positive sign. The PLO has never before had the power to
control events.''
   Col. Yoni, an Israeli commander in the West Bank whose full name
could not be used in keeping with army regulations, told a reporter
last week: ``Most of the disturbances are now deliberate attacks on
soldiers.''
   The army has reported attacks in the past week that indicate
Palestinians may be moving up from stones to knives and other
deadly weaspons.
   A military vehicle was ambushed Tuesday night in the Gaza Strip
by Arabs who exploded a roadside bomb and opened fire with guns. No
one was hurt.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is a
shrewd, tough politician who has shown he can hold on tightly to
his position as the de facto ruler of Panama.
   Supporters call Noriega, in English, ``The Man,'' a takeoff on
his initials. Critics call him, in Spanish, ``Cara de Pina'' or
``Pineapple Face,'' because of his pocked and jowly visage.
   The United States calls him a fugitive from justice, a man who
put himself and his country up for sale to drug traffickers and
made millions of dollars in the process.
   Indictments returned by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., on Feb. 5 accuse Noriega of using his position as the
commander of the Defense Forces to permit Colombian drug
traffickers to make Panama a base for smuggling cocaine and
marijuana into the United States.
   Noriega was born into poverty and raised by foster parents from
the age of 5.
   Details of Noriega's early life are scarce and even his birthday
is in dispute. His official biography lists his age as 50, but high
school records put it at 54.
   After attending a military college in Peru on a scholarship,
Noriega entered the Panamanian National Guard in 1962 as a
lieutenant. He quickly became acquainted with a rising young
officer named Omar Torrijos.
   Torrijos took power in Panama in a 1968 coup and less than a
year later named Noriega, then an obscure major in charge of the
country's northernmost province, as his chief of intelligence with
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
   In his new position, Noriega began collecting dossiers on
everyone who counted in Panama, friends and enemies alike. He also
had jurisdiction over the country's customs and immigration
departments, long a source of funds for the military.
   When Torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981,
Noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top command
ahead of several more senior officers. It took him two years.
   Panama has been rocked by protests since last June, when
Noriega's recently retired second in command publicly charged the
general with drug trafficking, electoral fraud and the
assassination of a political opponent.
   Noriega also has been accused of having his finger in a wide
variety of other enterprises, some legal and others operating on
the fringes of the law. They are said to include duty free liquor
stores, maritime services, banks, gambling casinos, newspapers, a
television station and 12 radio stations.

<HEAD>Shrieking Comic Sam Kinison Sued for $5.6 Million by United

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Artists Pictures has filed a $5.6
million lawsuit against screaming comedian Sam Kinison, claiming he
``acted with despicable conduct'' when he allegedly breached an
obligation to appear in a film.
   UA's suit, filed Thursday in Superior Court, contends that
Kinison refused to appear as the title character in the film
``ATUK'' after he developed the movie.
   The lawsuit, which seeks $4.6 million in actual damages and $1
million in punitive damages, say Kinison's representatives told the
studio that he had approved approved the screenplay and would
appear in the film.
   However, the comic, who has appeared on NBC's ``Late Night with
David Letterman'' and had his own cable television special, began
demanding revisions in the screenplay, the suit states.
   When the studio failed to meet his demands, the suit says
Kinison said he ``would walk through his role during the filming of
the picture and thereby deliberately give an uninspired and
substandard performance.''
   A message seeking comment was left Thursday night for Kinison at
The Comedy Store, a Sunset Boulevard nightclub where he frequently
appears.
   UA also announced Thursday that it is cancelling production of
``ATUK,'' which began filming in New York on Feb. 16.

   The first people to reach the cow pasture
where an Army helicopter crashed Thursday described the scene as a
``war zone'' that smelled of burning oil and flesh.
   Nine soldiers died and nine were injured when the CH-47D Chinook
went down northeast of Chico, officials said.
   Two men who raced to the helicopter when they saw it puff smoke
and descend onto a neighbor's field said they pulled one pilot from
the wreckage and doused flames on the soldiers.
   Jack Souther, a 54-year-old pipeline worker, said he used a
small fire extinguisher he carries in his pickup truck to put out
the flames on at least six soldiers.
   ``I couldn't fight any fire with it,'' Souther said. ``The only
thing I could do was put the fires out on the bodies. I went from
body to body trying to put them out.''
   Souther said two teen-agers arrived at the crash just before he
and his son-in-law, John Karch, did.
   One of the teen-agers, Dale Christopher, 17, said he told one of
the victims that he was lucky. ``He said `What do you mean?' and I
said `Man, there's people scattered everywhere,''' Christopher said.
   Christopher said the smell of the burning metal, oil and flesh
was overwhelming. ``It was the smell of death,'' he said.
   Wendell Berry, 53, who lives a half-mile from the crash and
arrived just after Souther and Karch, said he cut the seat belt
from a pilot who was trapped in the cockpit. ``He was conscious and
talking to me,'' Berry said.
   Volunteer firefighters who were dousing a grass fire west of
Chico responded to the crash, said firefighter Blane Rice.
   Souther said the victims were scattered in all directions from
the helicopter, but that most were caught in a fire in front of the
wreckage.
   ``It was a war zone. Bodies were scattered everywhere. There was
just a couple of bodies out of the fire area,'' Souther said.
   He said that after they doused the fires on the victims, they
made them lie where they were until firefighters and medical
personnel arrived.
   ``I know it was probably hot laying there. But I think it was
better that they stayed still,'' Souther said.
   Berry said he saw the crash but his view was partially blocked
by trees. ``He slid about 75 yards before he blew up,'' he said.
``Between my eyesight and the copter was a tree.''
   Souther said he and Karch could tell by the way the craft was
flying that it would crash. ``You could see it puffing smoke. I
told my son-in-law, `Let's go. That thing is going down,''' Souther
said.

   NBC said it will introduce three new
television shows next month and shift several current programs in
the first phase of a mid-season programming change.
   The new series are ``In the Heat of the Night,'' based on the
1967 Academy Award-winning motion picture, ``Aaron's Way'' and the
returning ``Bronx Zoo.''
   Carroll O'Connor and Howard E. Rollins star in the new version
of ``In the Heat of the Night,'' which tells the story of the
grudging cooperation between a Southern white sheriff and a
Northern black detective.
   The two-hour preview of the series will be presented on Sunday,
March 6. The regular series will make its debut on Tuesday, March
15, in the 9-10 p.m. EST time slot behind ``Matlock.''
   ``Aaron's Way,'' starring Merlin Olsen as an Amish farmer who
moves from his Pennsylvania home to California's wine country, will
have a two-hour preview Wednesday, March 9. The series will begin
at 8-9 p.m. EST on Wednesday, March 16.
   ``The Bronx Zoo,'' starring Edward Asner as a tough high school
principal, will have its premiere telecast on Wednesday, March 30,
at 10-11 p.m. EST.
   In other changes announced Thursday by Brandon Tartikoff,
president of NBC Entertainment, ``Hunter,'' currently telecast on
Tuesdays, will move to 10-11 p.m. EST Saturday on March 12. It will
replace ``J.J. Starbuck,'' which will return at a later date.
   ``A Year in the Life'' will move back one hour to 10-11 p.m. EST
from March 9-23, returning to its regular time slot of 9-10 p.m.
EST on April 6.
   ``Highway to Heaven'' will move back one hour to 9-10 p.m. EST
Wednesday from March 16-30, then return at a later date.
   ``St. Elsewhere'' will be telecast on Wednesday, March 2, then
leave the air until a later date. This is the final season for
``St. Elsewhere.''

<HEAD>Colorado Considering Daylight-Saving Time as Anti-Pollution Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There is an old cowboy saying that daylight-saving
time is like making a blanket longer by cutting off one end and
sewing it on the other.
   Some Colorado lawmakers, however, are trying for the second time
in two years to shift the state to year-round daylight-saving time
to ease metropolitan Denver's air pollution problem, said to be the
nation's worst.
   Sen. Bill Schroeder, the Republican sponsor of the measure,
wants to keep the state on daylight-saving time from the end of
October to the first part of April, when it normally reverts to
Mountain Standard Time.
   Schroeder said the measure, which cleared the state Senate by an
18-15 vote on Monday and now goes to the House of Representatives,
would give Colorado an extra hour of daylight in the winter. That
would mean another hour for polluting auto emissions, which often
are trapped at ground level by a warmer layer of air, to escape
into the upper atmosphere, he said.
   Don Barbarick, a meteorologist with the Colorado Health
Department, sees year-round daylight-saving time in Colorado as a
way to put Denver air pollution ``in step with Mother Nature.''
   Denver is on an arid, high plain a few miles east of the
Rockies, and is noted for its dry climate and cool nights, a
perfect setting for shifting afternoon rush-house traffic back an
hour, Barbarick said.
   Schroeder said studies have shown that if there were
daylight-saving time, there would be a 7 percent reduction in
violations of federal air pollution standards in metropolitan
Denver.
   If the proposal passes the Legislature, is signed into law by
Gov. Roy Romer and authorized by Congress, Colorado would become
the first state to adopt such a time variance.
   Arizona stays on standard time year-round, and counties in
Indiana can elect to remain on Eastern Standard Time continually,
but no other state has embraced daylight-saving time on a
year-round basis. Because no state has made such a time change,
Congress would have to pass a resolution authorizing it.
   The proposal pits urbanites who must deal with Denver's air
pollution problem against rural and small-town Coloradans.
Opponents say schoolchildren would have to rise long before
daylight to get to school on time.
   ``We shouldn't have little kids standing around in the dark
waiting for buses,'' said Sen. Al Meiklejohn, who champions
educational issues. ``There are going to be some major disruptions.
This is not a good idea.''
   Schroeder, however, says school districts may reschedule
classroom hours around actual daylight hours if they wish.
   Last year, one resolution supporting a time shift died in the
Colorado House and another cleared the House but died in the Senate.
   Opponents say too much is made of Denver's problems, and they
point to this year's two-month switch to oxygenated fuels as an
example of urban problems spilling into rural areas.
   Oxygen-rich additives make gasoline burn cleaner, with less
carbon monoxide emissions, but fuel refiners and distributors said
it would have been too complicated to supply the special fuel just
to metropolitan areas.
   Since the fuel switch, there have been loud complaints from
rural senators. Republican Sen. Ray Powers said some of his
constituents have complained that oxygenated fuels make their
chainsaws sputter.
   Barbarick said the time change is no cure-all for air pollution.
   ``Some days it won't work for you at all,'' he said. ``But it's
getting in step with Mother Nature. It's an an attempt to get in
step with something that happens nearly every day (during the
winter).''

   The White House is scrambling to untangle some
of President Reagan's news conference answers, offering details,
emphasis and elaboration but no retractions.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was hit with a barrage of
questions at his regular press briefing Thursday about what the
president meant on several subjects during his nationally televised
news conference the night before.
   Fitzwater avoided saying that Reagan had misspoken on any
subject. But he played down Reagan's comment that outsiders were
stirring up trouble in Israeli-occupied territories, and he also
said an apparent contradiction with Secretary of State George
Shultz on Iran arms sales was a matter of ``interpretation.''
   Reagan had been asked at the news conference about violence in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the beatings and
shootings of Palestinians by Israeli forces.
   He replied that ``there is every evidence to believe that these
riots are not just spontaneous and home-grown. ... We have had
intimations that there have been certain people suspected of being
terrorists, outsiders coming in, not only with weapons, but
stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those areas.''
   Shultz, en route to the Middle East, gave a decidedly different
slant, blaming the unrest on longtime Israeli occupation of the
territories.
   ``Its fundamental origins are essentially indigenous,'' he told
reporters aboard his plane.
   Shultz said intelligence material showed ``a mixed picture''
with ``interaction with outside force.'' But he added, ``There is
an underlying problem consisting of a large number of people in
occupation who haven't had the basic rights of governance.''
   In his news conference answer, Reagan did not mention the
Israeli occupation, saying merely that the United States wants ``a
solution representing justice for all.''
   Fitzwater said the comments of Reagan and Shultz ``are totally
consistent as far as we're concerned.''
   He added, ``The president said the same thing (as Shultz) ...
that they were partly influenced by outside sources.''
   Reagan, however, did not use the word ``partly.''
   When it was noted that the president had made no mention of
``indigenous'' origins of the problem, the spokesman replied: ``No,
he didn't use those words, but that's clear.''
   Fitzwater said he could not elaborate on the identity of any
outside forces or quantify the extent of their involvement.
   Reagan also raised questions Wednesday night by saying Shultz
and former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger had not objected
to the secret sale of arms to Iran on the grounds that it was an
arms-for-hostages deal.
   Shultz and Weinberger have said otherwise, and their statements
have been supported by the Iran-Contra report issued by Congress.
   Shultz said Wednesday night he had testified ``endlessly'' on
the subject and ``I am not going to go over it any more.''
   Fitzwater said he did not feel that Reagan's statement needed
any reconciliation with the record on Shultz's comments. ``These
are all matters of interpretation,'' he said. ``I'm not going to go
into that. I don't have anything to add.''
   Asked whether Reagan regretted having said the kidnappers of
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon ``would have a hard time
getting secrets'' from him, Fitzwater declined to comment. ``I
don't want to say anything that might inflame the situation,'' he
said.
   Fitzwater said he could not elaborate on Reagan's remark that
there is ``a great division even among the (black) people who are
being oppressed (in white-ruled South Africa).
   ``It is a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy, and
that is one of the most difficult parts here,'' Reagan said
Wednesday night.
   Asked to explain, Fitzwater said, ``I don't remember that
specific reference. I don't have any elaboration on that.''
   On another matter, Reagan had told reporters that the question
of Soviet participation in an international trade organization was
``being reviewed,'' not mentioning that his administration
staunchly opposes its participation.
   Fitzwater said the president was saying the matter was under
review ``in the sense that we review it every year as part of that
(annual national security) report, but the conclusion of that
review is that their economy is not compatible'' with membership in
the group, known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Asked if he agreed that Reagan had failed to make the point
about the United States opposing Soviet participation, Fitzwater
drew laughter by saying, ``I would say the president expressed it
with great clarity.''

   The Reagan administration has made ``no secret
deals'' on Afghanistan and will arm guerrillas there ``until that
support is no longer needed'' to gain permanent withdrawal of
Soviet troops, a senior official told Congress.
   ``We will not abandon the Afghan resistance,'' Robert Peck,
deputy assistant seceretary of state, said Thursday in testimony
before the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific
Affairs.
   Peck also welcomed a statement by resistance leaders that they
would agree to an interim government consisting of some Afghans
currently in Kabul, possibly non-Communist members of the Kremlin's
client government.
   Peck denied charges by some resistance leaders and conservative
members of Congress that the administration has agreed to a deal
that would cut off aid at the beginning of a Soviet withdrawal,
possibly allowing the Red Army or the Afghan regime to slaughter
the insurgents.
   A proposed U.N. agreement to end the Afghan war contains
provisions the administration understands would bar the Kremlin
from arming its clients in Kabul or waging offensive operations
against the guerrillas, Peck said.
   Continued military aid or offensive operations by the Soviets in
Afghanistan would violate provisions of the U.N.-sponsored accord
guaranteeing ``non-interference and non-intervention,'' he said.
   Soviet officials have said they expect U.S. aid to end 60 days
after an agreement is signed, but have not said when they would
stop aiding Kabul.
   ``It is a matter on which we are not completely satisfied, and
we intend to pressure them,'' Peck said.
   But the administration would oppose any congressional resolution
calling for the president to continue military aid to the
guerrillas until the departure of the last of the estimated 120,000
Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan, Peck said. Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif., and Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, are preparing such
resolutions, congressional aides said.
   ``The president wishes not to have his hands tied,'' Peck said.
``We will continue our assistance to the Afghan resistance until
that support is no longer needed. But the question of when to cut
off aid is one that should be left to the president.''
   Peck denied that administration officials agreed in December
1985, without President Reagan's knowledge, to abide by the U.N.
agreement before final details were worked out.
   ``There have been no secret deals,'' Peck said. ``No deals at
all.''
   The United Nations-sponsored talks, in which Pakistan is
representing the guerrillas and the Kabul regime is representing
the Soviets, are to resume next Wednesday. Kremlin leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev has said that if the talks produce an accord, Soviet
troops will start leaving by May 15 and be gone within 10 months.
   Pakistani officials, who originally demanded Soviet withdrawal
over three months, now say eight months is acceptable, but they
want the parties to agree on the formation of an interim government.
   Soviet negotiators have accused Pakistan of introducing new
demands at the last minute, a charge echoed by Rep. Stephen J.
Solarz, subcommittee chairman.
   ``It may not be possible to fashion such a government, in which
case it would be a tragedy if, as a consequence of such a
condition, we ended up without an interim government but with the
continued presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan,'' said Solarz,
D-N.Y.
   ``It does seem somewhat incongruous that after having pushed the
Soviets for eight years to get out of Afghanistan, Pakistan at the
11th hour introduced new conditions that may make such a withdrawal
more difficult,'' Solarz said.
   The Pakistani demand is neither unreasonable nor likely to
prevent a Soviet withdrawal, and may be discussed _ if not resolved
_ in negotiations seperate from the U.N. talks in Geneva, Peck said.
   Resolution seemed closer, he said, following a statement this
week by resistance leaders in Peshawar, Pakistan, that they would
take part in a 28-member cabinet, seven of whose ministers could be
Moslems now in Kabul. The formula, he said, appears to open to door
to moderates within the Communist-dominated government.
   ``We are delighted that they have now produced a detailed
alliance proposal,'' Peck said. ``We await a response from the
other side.''

   Bob Dole wants to believe that the key
southern test in the Republican presidential race will occur not on
Super Tuesday, but next August in New Orleans.
   That's a strategy heavily dependent on a strong assist from Pat
Robertson, who has the potential to muddy the outcome on March 8,
when 20 states, most of them Southern and border states, will hold
Republican primaries or caucuses.
   ``I've got a feeling we may be headed all the way to New
Orleans,'' the Kansas senator says at every campaign stop in the
South, referring to the Republican National Convention next August.
   Dole may just be whistling ``Dixie'' as he tries to negotiate an
electoral minefield that appears to favor Vice President George
Bush.
   There were two key events. The first was New Hampshire where a
Dole victory would have completely altered the picture in the South
where Bush has a strong organization and benefits from President
Reagan's popularity.
   But the Kansas senator, a big winner in Iowa, fell short in New
Hampshire and had to devise a strategy based on the assumption that
Bush will be the big popular vote winner on Super Tuesday.
   The next test that could change the current outlook for March 8
is the South Carolina Republican primary that occurs three days
before Super Tuesday.
   ``The name of the game now is delegates,'' was the cry from Dole
aides.
   Eddie Mahe, a Republican political consultant not involved with
any presidential campaign, agreed with that approach.
   ``If I was advising any of these people, I would say, `Don't
worry about the next day's headline (about who carried the popular
vote in how many Super Tuesday states), worry about the following
day's delegate-count story, that's the story that counts,''' he
said.
   ``It's going to be relatively difficult for the Bush forces to
come out with much more than a bare majority at best, the other
delegates being split between Robertson and Dole,'' said Dole
adviser David Keene, as the Dole entourage flew South after his
victories in the South Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses on
Tuesday.
   Within 24 hours, however, Keene and Donald Devine, another
senior campaign adviser, were fired in a dispute with campaign
manager William Brock, the former Tennessee senator and secretary
of labor.
   But the strategy outlined by Keene still appeared to offer the
clearest hope for Dole to survive until the campaign moves back to
the Midwest where he has trounced Bush in three states.
   Bush and former television evangelist Robertson look like the
most formidable competitors in the South, an assessment Dole and
his advisers do not dispute.
   In addition to the Southern and border states voting on Super
Tuesday, the schedule includes balloting in Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Nevada, Oklahoma and Washington.
   Keene named North Carolina, Oklahoma, Missouri, Washington and
``possibly Florida'' as the states Dole had the best chance to win
on Super Tuesday. That's not a very long list.
   But most states elect their delegates by congressional districts
and can be viewed as a series of district elections. That means it
is possible that while Bush would easily carry the popular vote,
his rivals would carry a lot of districts and their delegates.
   South Carolina stands alone on March 5 and it is open to every
registered voter. In addition, the Democrats don't hold caucuses
until a week later, so there is no Democratic contest to distract
voters from the GOP primary.
   Mahe said a lot of Republicans don't see a lot of difference
between Bush and Dole and also are very concerned about the
possibility of Robertson emerging as the nominee.
   A Robertson victory in South Carolina could have a major impact
on those voters.
   ``People who genuinely have a sense of concern, whether they
should or they shouldn't about Pat Robertson, who saw George Bush
lose again to Pat Robertson in South Carolina where he had the
governor going for him, seemingly everything going for him, they
might say, well, maybe we ought to go with Bob Dole,'' said Mahe.
   The same logic says that a Bush victory in South Carolina could
open the gates for a big Super Tuesday win for the vice president.
   Dole has South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond on his side and also
supports legislation to limit textile imports, a popular stand in a
state where 45 percent of the jobs are in the textile industry.
Bush opposes the bill.
   Dole has a similar advantage on a highly visible issue in
Louisiana where the Kansan supports an oil import fee while Bush
opposes it. Glen Beauerman, Dole's campaign manager in Louisiana,
said surveys say 70 percent of people in the oil and gas producing
state support an import fee.
   But it's the Robertson factor rather than issues that could keep
Bush from harvesting enough Super Tuesday delegates to make him
unstoppable.
   ``Up and down East Texas Pat Robertson is a real threat in a lot
of districts,'' said Mahe. ``But there's enough Bush-type people in
those districts for George to win all of them if they turn out and
vote. They have not been turning out in very good numbers.''

   The political establishment is astonished over
how easily Republican presidential hopeful Pat Robertson has sown
the wind without reaping the whirlwind.
   Political experts say a string of controversial pronouncements
that would have damaged most politicians has only strengthened
Robertson's ties with his natural following, conservative Christian
fundamentalists.
   ``My guess is that Pat is deliberately playing to his South
Carolina constituency,'' says University of Virginia sociologist
Jeffrey Hadden, a Robertson biographer. ``He doesn't care if folks
in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles think he's crazy at this
point. If he can get the press bashing him a bit, it would help
ignite his followers.''
   But Republican consultant Ed Mahe disagrees: ``I can't believe
this reflects any kind of strategy. What we have here is a
talk-show host here who doesn't understand the power of talk; after
all, when you're a talk-show host you toss these things out and who
cares.''
   Even Ronald Reagan, who has often stood corrected, ridiculed
Robertson's claim that his Christian Broadcasting Network had
information about the location of hostages in the Middle East.
   ``Isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever
apprised of that?'' asked the president at his news conference
Wednesday.
   Robertson bounced back, saying he could not understand the big
flap. ``I used that as a throwaway line,'' he said.
   He also complained Wednesday in the Atlanta Constitution that
he's being put under undue scrutiny.
   ``The press of the nation is holding me to an incredible
standard of conduct,'' he said. ``They want me every time I open my
mouth to be accompanied by a press aide, a lawyer and a librarian
with at least a thousand volumes to back up every word I've said.''
   Just as Robertson's campaign has weathered the hostage crisis
this week, it weathered the missile crisis earlier this month _
when Robertson claimed there were Soviet missiles in Cuba.
   The Pentagon denied it, the White House denied it, even Fidel
Castro denied it. Robertson shrugged off the outcry, saying he
hoped those doing the denying were right.
   Robertson also suggested he saw the sinister hand of Vice
President George Bush behind the timing of the disclosures of
sexual misbehavior by a fellow fundamentalist preacher, Jimmy
Swaggart. And he accused television anchorman Tom Brokaw of
engaging in ``religious bigotry'' when he referred to Robertson, a
former television evangelist, as a former television evangelist.
   Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution student of the press and
politics, says Robertson's ability to weather attacks on his
credibility _ ``the Teflon factor'' _ exists because the press has
been easy on him.
   ``The media gets tough on people when they become important,''
he says.
   Adds Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia who has followed Robertson for decades: ``The other
Republican candidates are hesitant to attack him. Even Bush his
done so gingerly. The Republicans know they need his constituency
in the fall; they know these people are easily offended and will
stay permanently offended.''
   Moreover, he says, reporters, with few evangelical Christians in
their ranks, are shy about attacking Robertson: ``They know they're
subject to a charge of cultural bias.''
   ``At first he was getting a good press,'' says Hess. ``There was
a surprise about Robertson. We expected Elmer Gantry and instead we
got Robert Young.''
   The more the press challenges Robertson, the more his natural
constituency _ Christian fundamentalists _ rallies around, says
Anson Shupe, an Indiana sociologist and co-author with Hadden of a
forthcoming book, ``Televangelism: Power and Politics in God's
Country.''
   ``He's playing to a different audience,'' says Shupe. ``There is
a real conspiratorial, paranoid theme running through fundamental
Christianity. They see the world almost as a conspiracy against
Christians. What to someone else may look like a way-out statement
plays a lot better with his following and may even help him.''
   But, says Shupe, Robertson's unproven statements will isolate
Robertson from mainstream voters. ``Ultimately this could be his
upending,'' he says.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Would Open Alaskan Wilderness to Oil Drilling</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS last graf to CLARIFY that Bradley is referring to the

<TEXT>
   The Senate Energy Committee approved 11-8 on
Thursday a bill that could open up for drilling a potentially
oil-rich section of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
northeastern Alaska.
   The measure, bitterly contested by environmentalists but eyed by
industry as an oil bonanza rivaling the development of Prudoe Bay,
would authorize the Interior Department to open up 1.5 million
acres on the coastal plain of the refuge, which totals 19 million
acres.
   The Energy Committee's approval followed a lengthy series of
mark-up sessions in which various amendments designed to weaken or
kill the legislation were turned back.
   A day earlier, the committee rejected 10-4 an attempt by Sen.
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., to force oil companies to prove that
exploratory drilling would not prove incompatible with the region's
primary purpose as a fish and game refuge.
   The Interior Department has estimated that there is a one in
five chance that the northern tip of the refuge contains
economically recoverable oil. If there is any, the department says,
it's 50-50 whether the amount totals more than 3.2 billion barrels,
and a 5 percent chance that it totals 9 billion barrels.
   Prudhoe Bay contained a little more than 9 billion barrels when
it was tapped in 1975. It's now at peak production, 1.8 million
barrels a day, and inevitably will start to decline soon.
   The United States uses about 6.2 billion barrels a year, so 3.2
billion barrels would represent about 188 days' worth.
   The Energy Department calls the Interior estimates conservative,
and the oil industry says the coastal area offers the best drilling
prospect left in the United States. The region is within 65 to 100
miles of the Alaska Pipeline, so extensive work would not be
required to bring the oil to market.
   The bill, backed principally by Chairman Bennett Johnston,
D-La., and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, faces a difficult floor fight
in the Senate and even more uncertain chances in the House, where
Interior Chairman Morris Udall, D-Ariz., is a staunch opponent of
disturbing the arctic refuge.
   Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, the Wilderness
Society and the Natural Resources Defense Council are particularly
disturbed about the potential effect of oil development on a herd
of 180,000 porcupine caribou, whose calving grounds fall within the
prime oil area.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., told the Senate committee that ``what
is at stake is far more than the well-publicized Porcupine (area)
caribou (herd). The coastal plain is also vital to polar bears,
grizzly bears, wolverines, and muskoxen, the survivors of the Ice
Age. Millions of swans, snow geese, northern pintail and other
water fowl spend their summers on this stretch of the Arctic
coast.''

There</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midnight was fast approaching as the
twin-engine plane flew at treetop level, its lights and radio
turned off, into a combat zone in darkest Angola.
   With the small air strip illuminated only by kerosene lanterns
set down moments before, the plane landed at the stroke of midnight
and out stepped, of all people, former Virginia Gov. Charles S.
Robb.
   Since leaving office in 1985, Robb has become an adventurer of
sorts, traveling to many a Third World hot spot while attempting at
the same time to encourage fellow Democrats at home to embrace his
cautiously hawkish foreign policy views.
   Robb clearly feels uncomfortable with the ``isolationist''
sentiments of some party leaders and he has been imploring
Democratic candidates to pursue a more ``traditionalist'' approach
to international issues.
   He would support any party candidate who gets the nomination but
in a field dominated by liberals, it is not surprising that Robb
finds Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee the most ideologically
congenial of the lot.
   Robb himself is considered by some a possible candidate for
national office one day, but for now his principal short-term
ambition is election in November to the Virginia Senate seat being
vacated by Paul Trible, a Republican.
   If miles traveled are a qualification for election, Robb should
win in a landslide.
   He has been within earshot of hostile fire in Iraq and along the
Afghan-Pakistan border. His other wanderings seem like a travel
agent's dream: Japan, Korea, the Philippines, the Soviet Union,
India, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina,
Chile, Brazil, Zaire, Ivory Coast all of Western Europe and
Scandinavia. This is a partial list.
   To understand the stakes involved in a particular area, Robb
said in a recent interview, there is no substitute for actually
being there. No amount of reading or discussion, he said, could
prepare him for the visual impact of the Israeli-held Golan Heights
and the degree to which Israelis in the valley below would be
vulnerable if it were returned to its historic owner, Syria.
   To hear Robb tell it, few experiences were more rewarding than
his visit last fall to Angola where the Soviet-backed government
has been challenged for more than a decade by anti-communist rebels
who receive U.S. backing.
   At the time, the leader of the UNITA rebel group, Jonas Savimbi,
was directing a military operation in Mavinga. A UNITA pilot flew
Robb there, shutting off the lights and radio, lest the flight be
detected by loyalist forces manning anti-aircraft equipment.
   Robb discussed military tactics with Savimbi, drawing on his own
combat experience two decades ago in Vietnam where he volunteered
for service as a young Marine officer after marrying Lynda Johnson,
daughter of President Lyndon Johnson.
   Robb spent five hours with Savimbi before flying out in the
pre-dawn darkness.
   His most memorable Angolan experience was in Jamba, the UNITA
headquarters and stronghold in southeastern Angola. There he saw
hospitals with operating rooms, a plant where captured Soviet tanks
were being rebuilt, and a ``most remarkable'' education system
involving thousands of children.
   A prime Robb interest these days is the state of the Democratic
Party, which he believes has lost its way in recent years, partly
because of too many comfortable assumptions about the intentions of
America's adversaries.
   ``I spend a lot of time trying to find ways to nudge our party
and our presidential candidates ... to take what for me and for
many other Democrats would be regarded as a more responsible view
on foreign policy,'' he said.
   Robb goes to considerable lengths to avoid use of terms like
``conservative'' and ``liberal,'' preferring such words as
``responsible.''
   ``I try not to put things in an ideological or philosophical
context because I don't want to be constrained or restricted by a
label,'' he said. ``I go to great lengths to avoid being
pigeonholed.''
   On Central America, Robb believes the Reagan administration has
overemphasized the need for military force while too many Democrats
underemphasize it. He believes United States should support both
the Central American peace plan and the Nicaraguan Contras as well.
   He said the Democratic Party has come a long way since 1984, a
year when he felt that unswerving support for a nuclear freeze was
a politically chic stand within the party but not among the public.
In the presidential election that year, the Democratic ticket
carried one state.
   ``We're on more responsible ground now. But we haven't moved as
far as we should have if we're going to reoccupy the high ground
that the party used to be able to occupy in previous decades,''
Robb said.

   Before Republican-hunting Capitol police
carried GOP Sen. Bob Packwood onto the Senate floor during
filibuster of a campaign finance bill, they found Sen. Lowell P.
Weicker Jr. sitting quietly in his office.
   But the Connecticut Republican, a political heavyweight in more
ways than one, was apparently too big for the posse led by Senate
Sergeant-at-Arms Henry Giugni to handle when they entered Weicker's
office at 12:45 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``I think Henry took a look at the 6-6 and 240 pounds and
figured it was a long trip from the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate
floor,'' Weicker said Thursday in a telephone interview. ``I could
see the wheels turning.
   ``Henry came in and indicated that I was arrested, and I told
him that was no time of day to arrest anybody and I was comfortably
ensconced on my couch and had no intention of moving,'' Weicker
said.
   Weicker quoted Giugni as saying on his way out the door,
``(expletive), I hate this job.''
   ``It was very good natured and there was no hint of
confrontation other than there he had been, here he was and here he
was going to stay,'' said Weicker aide Steve Snider. ``He and Henry
Giugni know each other very well.''
   Giugni did not return a series of telephone calls Thursday. An
aide said he would no longer talk about the bizarre night.
   Packwood, who was hauled off about 45 minutes later, is seven
inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Weicker.
   The incident occurred when Democrats, angered that Republicans
were trying to filibuster a campaign finance reform bill without
having a quorum on the Senate floor, ordered Giugni to forcibly
bring GOP members to the chamber. Democratic sponsors of the bill
have been unable to muster enough votes to end the filibuster.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet troops headed home from
East Germany and Czechoslovakia taking with them the first nuclear
missiles dismantled under the superpower treaty scrapping
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   The Soviet soldiers left two bases in East Germany and one
garrison in Czechoslovakia Thursday after a ceremonial send-off
highlighted in the communist countries' state-run media.
   Both of Moscow's allies lauded the pullout of some shorter-range
SS-12 missiles as evidence of the Kremlin's sincere intent on peace.
   Czechoslovak radio said the Soviet soldiers loaded missiles on a
train Thursday morning at the railway station at Hranice, a
garrison town 180 miles southeast of Prague.
   Battling driving snow, the Soviets loaded 19 missile launchers
onto trains and then attended a ceremony at which they received
decorations from the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defense, the radio
said.
   The Soviet commander of the missile forces said the weapons were
to be taken to an unspecified ``liquidation'' site in the Soviet
Union. He said they will not be destroyed until Congress ratifies
the treaty signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan last
December in Washington.
   ``If the agreement is not ratified, the responsible officials
will decide about future steps,'' Lt. Col. Vyacheslav Granovsky
told the state news agency CTK.
   The arms treaty covers nuclear missiles with ranges of between
300 to 3,100 miles. The SS-12 missiles, known in the Warsaw Pact as
OTR-22s, have a range of 300 to 600 miles.
   Western diplomats expressed skepticism about Thursday's
ceremonies. They said that until the superpower treaty goes into
effect there are no formal provisions for verifying how many
missiles were withdrawn.
   ``Until the arms treaty is in place, there is no way of
confirming what we are seeing, and what we are being told is
actually what it all appears to be,'' said one Western diplomat,
who spoke on condition he not be identified further.
   In East Germany, Western reporters were invited to bases at
Waren and Bischofswerda, where Soviet soldiers were sent off with
music, speeches by local officials and gifts of flowers and candy
from residents.
   Czechoslovak media said about 60 journalists watched the
withdrawal from Hranice, but no Western reporters were invited.
   Granovsky said that 39 SS-12 missiles and 24 mobile launchers
had been deployed in Czechoslovakia after NATO installed Pershing 2
and cruise missiles in Western Europe in 1983. It was the first
time such figures were released.
   NATO installed its missiles to counteract Soviet SS-20 weapons
stationed on Soviet territory.
   Czechoslovak television showed film clips of snow-dusted missile
launchers being loaded onto rail cars for the ride back to the
Soviet Union.
   The commander of missile units and artillery, Lt. Gen. Jan
Krizan, was quoted as saying that Hranice, a town of about 12,500
people, was the only place where the SS-12s were deployed.
   Krizan stressed that Czechoslovakia has no nuclear weapons of
its own.
   Missiles that had been based in the East German town of
Bischofswerda, about 15 miles east of Dresden, also left on a train
for the Soviet Union Thursday.
   Western reporters saw a train loaded with about 32 containers
leave Bischofswerda.
   A total of five launchers, eight missiles and four practice
missiles were stationed at the East German base, but it was not
known how many missiles left Thursday.
   At Waren, about 90 miles northwest of Berlin, there were 22
missiles, nine launchers and seven training rockets, according to
information released before the superpower treaty was signed.

<HEAD>Army Private Convicted Of Being AWOL, Gets Bad Conduct Discharge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. soldier was acquitted of desertion
and given a bad conduct discharge for fleeing his West German base
to live in the Soviet Union, shocking prosecutors who had expected
him to do prison time.
   Courtroom spectators, mostly military personnel, gasped when
presiding judge Col. Earl Pauley ordered Pfc. Wade E. Roberts, 22,
of Riverside, Calif., released from military custody Thursday.
   ``I feel great!'' Roberts said after he was convicted of a
lesser charge of being absent without leave and given a bad conduct
discharge.
   Roberts, described by a superior as ``the most reprehensible,
casual soldier'' in his command but as ``confused'' by his
attorneys, said he will live in West Germany with his wife, Petra
Neumann, and their 3-month-old son.
   The military pressed hard for a conviction of desertion during
the 1{-day courtmartial at Fort Dix. That offense carries a maximum
penalty of a dishonorable discharge and three years' imprisonment.
   ``I'm shocked,'' said Capt. Daniel Shaver, chief military
attorney. He said the Army expected Roberts to be sentenced to the
maximum AWOL penalty of a dishonorable discharge and one year's
imprisonment.
   When the sentence was read, Roberts and his attorneys broke into
wide grins, and the soldier and his wife embraced and kissed.
Shaver's jaw dropped, and he stared at the judge.
   To prove desertion, the Army had to demonstrate that when
Roberts left his base at Giessen, West Germany, last February, he
never intended to return to the Army.
   The prosecution produced a half-dozen witnesses in an effort to
show Roberts didn't like the Army, talked about leaving, didn't get
along with his superiors and had disciplinary problems.
   But Roberts' attorneys argued their client fled his unit because
was harassed by his superiors for, among other things, dating Ms.
Neumann because she was German.
   When he took the stand Thursday, Roberts told how one of his
sergeants told him to stay away from German women. Roberts said he
``panicked'' because he didn't want to leave Ms. Neumann, and
scaled a fence at the base.
   When they went to the Soviet Union, they were put to work on a
snake farm, but quickly became disenchanted with Soviet life.
   After getting Soviet approval, Roberts and his wife flew to
Frankfurt, West Germany, on Nov. 4 and was told by a U.S. embassy
official to turn himself over to the military the next day. Before
he could, however, he was arrested by the Army.
   Roberts' civilian attorney, Ronald Kuby, asked for lenient
treatment. ``Private Wade Roberts is not cut out for the Army. He
doesn't need the Army. The Army doesn't need him,'' Kuby said.
   Roberts returned to the Philadelphia Naval Yard brig, where he
has been held for the past several months, to pick up his
belongings, and went to an undisclosed location with Ms. Neumann,
officials said.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Giving States More Leeway to Permit Chemical Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is proposing that
states with approved groundwater protection plans be given
discretion to permit use of some pesticides that otherwise would be
banned.
   The proposal was unveiled Thursday in the form of a draft
strategy released for public comment.
   Groundwater provides drinking water for half the U.S. population
and for 97 percent of people living in rural areas. EPA says it
expects to complete a survey in 1990 on the extent of contamination.
   EPA licenses new pesticides, and is gradually re-licensing all
the old ones. As it makes those licensing decisions, it tries to
take into account the chemical's ability to leach into groundwater
_ which can depend on many things, including soil permeability and
application method.
   EPA expects to ban the use of some chemicals in specific states
or counties, while allowing use in others. The new strategy is
designed to allow states facing such bans to overturn them provided
they show that groundwater supplies will not be contaminated
significantly.
   John A. Moore, EPA's assistant administrator for pesticides and
toxic substances, said the agency's ``ability to do something at
these levels (counties and below) is not good.''
   States with plans could employ geological, land use, crop
pattern and water data to justify decisions that would run counter
to EPA determinations.
   ``Where found appropriate, EPA would consider modifying the
federal registration to accommodate the state program,'' the agency
said.
   In making decisions, both EPA and the states would use current
drinking water standards, where they exist, for chemicals that
don't cause cancer. For carcinogens, the agency would permit
contamination to a level that would mean a one-in-a-million chance
of cancer over a lifetime.
   If there are no drinking water standards _ only six have been
established for pesticides, with another 10 in the pipeline _ then
EPA would determine the permissible pesticide concentration in
groundwater supplies.
   Though several other federally mandated environmental programs
are run by states _ one example is strip mine reclamation _ Moore
acknowledged that ``there are no good models'' of states being
allowed to make exceptions to federal rules like what EPA is
proposing for pesticides.
   He said EPA would ``periodically revisit and reassure ourselves
that what the state had put together was being maintained,'' Moore
said.
   He singled out California, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Florida
as states with active pesticide-groundwater programs, generally
combining state agriculture, health and environmental protection
departments.
   Moore said he expected cooperation from farmers and their trade
groups: ``If there's been one area where I haven't had to convince
the user community they should pay attention, this is it. It's
their wells and their children drinking the water,'' Moore said.
   Pesticide contamination of groundwater is a relatively new
issue, and as recently as 10 years ago most government officials
and scientists believed it didn't happen. They thought the
chemicals didn't last long enough or penetrate far enough down.
   The first serious contamination cases were reported in New York
and California in 1979.
   Two years ago, EPA said 19 pesticides had been found in
groundwater in 24 states; today, said Patrick Holden, team leader
of the groundwater project in EPA's pesticides office, 50 to 60
different chemicals have been found in wells in 30 states. Iowa has
found pesticides in half the wells serving cities.
   Pesticides are not the only contaminants. Fertilizers, waste
disposal wells and leaking underground tanks all can contribute
substantially.
   EPA plans to adopt a groundwater strategy that would require
states to classify supplies, known as aquifers, in a three-tier
priority system _ high priority protection, drinking water sources,
and water needing little protection.
   Many environmentalists object to the plan, saying it would write
off a substantial percentage of groundwater supplies.
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., on Thursday introduced at least
the 10th bill this session calling for minimum federal standards
for all aquifers.
   The senator said he would have to study EPA's proposal for the
states. An aide, Jimmie Powell, said that ``to the extent you can
manage pesticides for their leaching ability, it could be a
reasonable proposal'' to let states make detailed, area-specific
management decisions along the lines EPA is proposing.
   But Rick Hind of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said
EPA's use of a one-in-a-million standard for carcinogens is ``too
soft.'' He also said the drinking water standards for
non-carcinogens is based ``partly on the cost of cleaning it up''
and thus inappropriate for a strategy of protecting public health.

<HEAD>US Farm Exports To Reach Four-Year High In Fiscal 1988</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>

   The outlook for U.S. farm exports continues to
improve as the Soviet Union begins a new round of corn purchases.
   Overall, the Agriculture Department says the value of U.S.
agricultural exports will rise to a four-year high of $32.5 billion
in the 1988 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Spurred by recent heavy sales of grain to the Soviet Union and
China, partly under a special export subsidy program, the new 1988
forecast is up $500 million from $32 billion indicated on Dec. 17.
   Steve MacDonald of the department's Economic Research Service
said the Soviet Union may account for $1.7 billion of the total
export value this year, the most since 1985 when Moscow's purchases
totaled $2.5 billion. Soviet purchases last year were valued at
about $700 million.
   China's U.S. purchases are expected to be around $500 million,
more than double the $200 million of 1987, he said.
   The new export forecast came Thursday as the department
announced another cash sale of corn to the Soviet Union, the second
in two days.
   With a shipment value of $32 billion, this year's exports would
be up 16 percent from $27.9 billion in 1987 and 24 percent from a
decade low of $26.3 billion in 1986. Agricultural exports were
valued at $31.2 billion in fiscal 1985 and $38 billion in 1984.
   ``Most of the increase (from the earlier estimate) stems from
additional wheat sales under the Export Enhancement Program ,'' the
department said. ``Since the December forecast, EEP offers were
announced for 2 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union
and 1.2 million tons to China, among others.''
   Under the EEP arrangement, private exporters get free surplus
commodities from the Agriculture Department as subsidies so they
can sell grain and other products overseas at reduced prices.
   On the basis of actual volume, 1988 exports were indicated at
142.5 million metric tons, up from 141 million forecast in December
and 129.2 million tons shipped last year.
   ``The U.S. share of the world market, particularly in grains and
cotton, is rising,'' officials said in their report. ``Relatively
low world prices and improved U.S. competitiveness through lower
(price support) loan rates, the EEP and a lower dollar have reduced
production incentives for foreign competitors.''
   Meanwhile, private exporters reported the sales of 601,600 tons
of corn for delivery to the Soviet Union this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries.
   On Wednesday, the Soviets bought 350,000 tons of corn, the first
substantial amount since last October. Corn sales are not qualified
for EEP subsidies, however.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 601,600 tons of
corn would be about 24 million bushels, having a farm value of
around $44 million at recent prices of about $1.82 per bushel.

   Shipments of federally inspected reindeer
steaks across the country would be allowed under a proposal being
considered by the Agriculture Department.
   There is mandatory federal inspection of cattle, hogs, chickens
and turkeys at slaughter plants, which allows those carcasses to be
shipped across state lines.
   In addition, regulations permit the voluntary inspection of
certain exotic animals slaughtered for human food. Those include
the American bison, or buffalo, and the cattalo, a cross between
cattle and the buffalo.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said Thursday producers of exotic animals have
asked the inspection list be expanded to include reindeer, elk,
deer, antelope and water buffalo.
   ``This proposal is a response to their request and could
facilitate the sale and export of the carcasses, meat and meat food
products from these animals,'' he sad. ``Once the animals and
products are inspected and passed, they can be sold interstate or
exported.''
   Producers of the animals would pay fees to receive the optional
inspection service. Crawford said fewer than 2,000 exotic animals
are slaughtered annually at the present time and that the slaughter
level is not expected to increase much if the exotic list is
expanded.
   By comparison, he said, annual cattle slaughter has been running
at more than 32 million head.
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent by April 26 to:

   United Airlines Inc. has paid an $11,000 civil
penalty to settle 1987 charges by the Agriculture Department that
it violated federal transportation standards for shipments of live
animals.
   The penalty was assessed by the department in an administrative
action stemming from nine shipments of dogs and monkeys in 1985 and
1986. A complaint was filed against United last year by the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which
administers the Animal Welfare Act.
   James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the agency, said
Thursday the complaints alleged that United had accepted dogs in
shipping kennels that did not conform to size requirement, and that
the airline ``either failed to observe and care for the dogs
properly'' or stowed them in cargo space without sufficient
ventiliation.
   Two dogs died during shipment and another was killed by highway
traffic after it escaped shipment, Glosser said. The airline also
was cited for having ``allegedly accepted a shipment of 50 monkeys
in cages that were not structurally sound'' and had no markings to
tell they contained wild animals, he said.
   Glosser said United also consented to an order against future
violations of the act and agreed within a year to buy a training
film approved by USDA and show it to all employees who handle live
animal cargoes.

<HEAD>Dukakis Warns He May Strike Back At Gephardt If Attacks Continue</HEAD>

   Michael Dukakis, urged by his aides to begin
returning campaign fire, says Democratic presidential rival Richard
Gephardt ``better watch out'' if he persists with his sharp attacks
in the battle for the party's nomination.
   ``I've been in negative campaigns before and I can tell you if
people want to be negative, I know what to do,'' the Massachusetts
governor said Thursday as he opened a three-day campaign trip
through Dixie.
   ``I hope we don't go down that road,'' he said, adding that
negative attacks during the nominating battle would only damage
Democrats' chances of capturing the White House.
   Dukakis issued his warning one day after Gephardt unleashed a
stinging attack, the latest in a string that the governor's aides
believe may be taking a toll. The Missouri congressman said Dukakis
and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had ``hardly a dime's worth of
difference'' on economic issues.
   Gephardt said Dukakis' foreign policy experience consisted
mostly of ``negotiating with the governor of New Hampshire over the
use of nuclear power.''
   And he summarized Dukakis' campaign bitingly, calling him ``the
candidate with the most money and the least message.''
   Gephardt also has attacked Dukakis in television commercials.
   Yet with the campaign in an intensive phase leading to the 21
Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses set for March 8, Dukakis so
far has declined to respond with anything approaching the vehemence
used by Gephardt.
   Instead, he has replied with indirect attacks and issued a
series of increasingly stern warnings.
   ``If people want to get negative, I've had experience with
negative campaigns,'' he said at a news conference in Boca Raton,
Fla. ``If you've got a record as vulnerable as his is, you'd better
watch out, that's all I can say.
   The Massachusetts governor also chided Gore and Gephardt for
``going at each other'' in a mananer resembling Republican
presidential rivals George Bush and Bob Dole.
   ``I don't think this `prince of darkness' routine is going to
sell,'' he said.
   But some aides say they believe that negative television
commercials played a role in Gephardt's victory in the South Dakota
primary on Tuesday, a conclusion also reinforced by some public
opinion polls.
   And with the critical Southern primaries approaching, the
governor is getting advice to respond more sharply to Gephardt.
   ``We have to knock this negative campaigning out of the box,''
said S. Stephen Rosenfeld, Florida campaign manager for Dukakis.
``My own view is that it comes home to roost, but we've got to make
it come home to roost (for Gephardt) sooner rather than later.''
   Rosenfeld said he has told Dukakis as much and the governor
``made it very clear that it's important to respond.''
   But so far, Dukakis has passed up every opportunity.
   When he and Gephardt shared a stage to discuss long-term health
care before a group of senior citizens, his most biting comment was
a mild jab.
   Askdd if he had flip-flopped on the issue, Dukakis replied:
``There's the flip-flopper over there. I'm not the flip-flopper.''

<HEAD>Captive Shipper Case Will Face Court Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A railroad rate case initiated eight years ago
by a group of Montana farmers may play a pivotal role in the way
the Interstate Commerce Commission determines when certain shippers
are being overcharged.
   The case involves ``captive shippers'' who must rely on a single
railroad for transporting their goods _ in this case wheat and
barley being sent from Montana to shipping points along the
Northwest coast.
   The ICC earlier this month concluded that the Burlington
Northern Railroad had overcharged the farmers and directed that the
railroad make refunds _ as much as $30 million, according to some
estimates _ and use a new method to determine fair rates.
   The Montana ruling, known as the McCarty Farms case after one of
the farmers, is being appealed by the Burlington Northern. It may
not be settled until it goes to the U.S. Supreme Court, say both
railroad and shipping experts familiar with the case.
   But if it stands, the case may spawn a new method of determining
when captive shippers are being overcharged.
   ``The McCarty case is the first attempt to do this in a live
case,'' said Daniel Campbell, the ICC's deputy general counsel.
``If we've done it successfully and it's accepted by the courts it
has implications for other (captive) shippers.''
   In the Montana case, the ICC sought to establish a shorthand
approach to determining whether a shipper is being overcharged by
comparing a railroad's revenue to its operating costs.
   The ICC already has used the same method of determining an
overcharge in a case involving generators being shipped for
Westinghouse Corp., and shipments of sugar, according to ICC
officials.
   But neither the railroads nor groups representing shipping
interests are particularly happy about the methods the ICC
developed in the Montana case.
   ``It sets up a very nasty test for any future shippers,''
suggested Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer
Federation of America, who has studied railroad ratemaking as it
applies to captive shippers.
   Cooper said he is concerned that in the Montana case the ICC
decided to use average rates when determining whether the Montana
farmers were being charged too much.
   If the same practice is used in other ratemaking cases, shippers
who are being charged exceedingly high rates might be denied relief
because they are lumped in with other shippers whose rates are
lower, suggested Cooper.
   Other critics say the Montana case exemplifies the problems a
shipper faces in challenging railroad rates.
   ``The case is an absolute modern horror story,'' maintains
Robert Szabo, the executive director of the Consumers Union for
Rail Equity. ``It has taken (these farmers) seven years ... and
they spent over a million dollars.''
   Szabo's group, known as CURE, has been battling the railroads
for years on behalf of primarily coal companies and electric
utilities over rates to captive shippers.
   With the Montana case, suggests Szabo, the ICC has tried to head
off continuing criticism in Congress that the ICC has been moving
too slowly to deal with shipper grievances.
   Spokesmen for the Association of American Railroads declined to
comment on the case except to reiterate its position before the ICC
that it opposed using the new procedure to determine maximum rates
and that it did not consider the Burlington Norther rates excessive.
   The Montana case began in 1980 when Richard McCarty, a grain
farmer from near Plentywood, Mont., and a few other farmers filed a
class action suit accusing Burlington Northern of price gouging in
shipping crops to West Coast markets.
   A federal judge referred the case to the ICC where an
administrative law judge ruled in 1981 that the farmers qualified
for relief under the Staggers Act, which deregulated much of the
railroad industry in 1980. The ICC concluded the case Feb. 12.

<HEAD>Siegan Confirmation Creates Bork Redux</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The face had changed and some views were
different, but senators might have imagined Robert H. Bork was back
when they held a confirmation hearing for the most controversial
judicial nominee before them.
   Bernard Siegan, nominee for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, spent his confirmation hearing Thursday defending what one
senator called his ``remarkably extreme views.'' Bork did the same
during confirmation hearings on his Supreme Court nomination.
   And like Bork, Siegan pledged over and over that he would cast
his personal constitutional views aside if confirmed, and follow
Supreme Court precedent.
   So did Bork.
   The players were the same, too, in the Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing room.
   Liberal Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt., both major opponents of Bork, were highly critical of
Siegan, a 63-year-old professor of constitutional law at the
University of San Diego.
   Conservative Sens. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, and Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, two of Bork's most ardent backers, jumped to Siegan's
defense.
   And People For The American Way, the civil libertian group that
ran a controversial anti-Bork television spot narrated by Gregory
Peck, promptly issued a news release attacking Siegan.
   Siegan, the group said, ``spent the morning distancing himself
from his entire body of legal scholarship.''
   Siegan's views do not always parallel those of Bork, but he is
just as controversial.
   He wrote that the Supreme Court reached the right conclusion in
outlawing school segregation but used faulty reasoning. He said
prayer in schools could be constitutional, although the Supreme
Court has said otherwise. He gave equal weight to property rights
and human rights. And he said the framers of the 14th Amendment,
which governs due process rights, never intended its scope to be as
broad as that defined by the Supreme Court.
   Leahy _ who conducted the confirmation hearing because committee
Chairman Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., is recuperating from brain
surgery _ said afterward that Siegan's almost total lack of
experience in the courtroom and his ``remarkably extreme views''
make him ``one of the more difficult ones for the Senate to
approve.''
   ``The last time you were in federal court I was 12 years old,''
Leahy said.
   Asked about Siegan's promises to follow Supreme Court precedent,
Leahy said, ``There is a feeling there may be a confirmation
conversion here, too.''
   The senator used the same term during Bork's hearing, accusing
the nominee of changing many of his controversial positions in
order to win confirmation. Bork proved to be unconvincing, and the
Senate rejected his nomination 58-42.
   ``In many ways Bork would be easier to accept because he had
judicial experience and federal court experience,'' Leahy said.
   During the hearing, Hatch listed many of Siegan's controversial
writings, and repeatedly gave the nominee the chance to say he
would ``observe the law of the land'' and resign if unable to do so.
   ``I hope people will give you a fair shake,'' Hatch said.
   The 9th circuit, on which new Supreme Court justice Anthony
Kennedy served, covers Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam and the Northern Mariana
Islands.
   Siegan told the committee: ``There are times I will rule
contrary to my own feelings. It would be a direct violation and
contrary of my oath to push my position ahead of the Supreme
Court.''
   Metzenbaum told Siegan, ``I'm concerned that if confirmed, you
will find a way to implement your views. Circuit courts are often
the courts of last resort.'' He said there would be a ``great
risk'' if the Senate confirmed Siegan.
   Siegan said his lack of courtroom experience would not be a
problem, commenting: ``A circuit court judge is given scholarly
duties to see if what the lower court did was right. I have spent
20 years of my life in scholarly activities. Even a lawyer with
trial experience may not know how to write an opinion.''

<HEAD>NHTSA Quizzes GM Over Recall Withdrawal Recommendation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Board is
asking General Motors Corp. to explain why its engineers withdrew a
recommendation that 703,225 cars be recalled because of possible
sudden acceleration problems.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often at odds with
the automakers and their regulators, contends that the engineers
were pressured to change their position. GM has denied the
allegation.
   NHTSA is asking GM to describe the company's Product Problem
Evaluation Committee in Flint, Mich., which made the recommendation.
   A NHTSA letter released Thursday also asked GM to state whether
the committee memo withdrawing the recall recommendation
``constitutes a legitimate PPEC report.''
   NHTSA is investigating alleged throttle problems that produce
sudden acceleration in the 1986-87 Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Buick
LeSabre, and the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville.
   The agency has received 573 complaints of alleged sudden
acceleration in the cars, resulting in reports of 343 accidents,
145 injuries and one death, said Joe Collins, NHTSA spokesman. None
of the reports has been substantiated by the agency, Collins said.
   GM spokesman David Hudgens said it was ``preposterous'' to
suggest the engineers were pressured.
   ``We don't do business that way,'' Hudgens said.
   The automaker was preparing a response to NHTSA, Hudgens said.
``In the NHTSA letter and our response, the question of pressure
doesn't come up,'' he said.
   The Center for Auto Safety said the engineers' decision to
withdraw their recall recommendation was suspicious because it came
just 18 days before GM would have had to tell NHTSA of the
recommendation.
   The timing ``suggests the clear possibility that the GM
engineers' change of heart may have been less than voluntary,'' the
center said in a petition to NHTSA.
   NHTSA declined to comment on the GM investigation, citing agency
policy.
   The GM memo, part of the public record of the NHTSA engineering
analysis, was in the form of a two-page handwritten note dated Oct.
23, 1987, saying, ``Withdraw recommendation for lack of data
support of a trend or high frequency'' on one page, and, ``Withdraw
recommendation to conduct field actions on throttle cables on all
cars for lack of data to conclude there is a problem'' on the other.
   The committee on Aug. 24, 1987, had recommended a recall.

UPDATE with White House having no immediate comment on vote to

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Thursday night
greeted with caution news that the president of Panama has ousted
military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said administration
officials ``want to reiterate our unqualified support for civilian
constitutional rule in Panama.''
   ``There is but one legitimate sovereign authority in Panama and
that is the Panamanian people exercising their democratic right to
vote and elect their leadership in a free society,'' Fitzwater said
in a formal statement released not long reports surfaced from
Panama City saying that President Eric Arturo Delvalle had
dismissed Noriega.
   There was no immediate comment from the White House or State
Department early Friday after the Panama's legislative assembly
removed Delvalle and the vice president from office.
   A senior U.S. official said that as of Thursday night, the major
unanswered question was whether Noriega would attempt to fight his
ouster.
   Initial reports indicated that Noriega did not intend to go
quietly, the official said, citing a television newscast in Panama
in which a member of the Defense Forces said that if anyone is
removed from power, it should be Delvalle.
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said it was his
understanding that Col. Marcos Justine, Noriega's designated
successor, is almost as tainted by corrupt activities as is Noriega.
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who participated in a
congressional investigation of Noreiga, said U.S. military
intervention might be in order to support Panama's civilian
government if Noriega decides to cling to power or attempts a coup.
   But he said he has no indication whether the Reagan
administration might initiate military action against Noreiga or
act on any request from Delvalle.
   ``We're not without leverage,'' D'Amato said in an interview.
``There are 10,000 U.S. troops under arms in Panama'' guarding the
Panama Canal.
   ``I am suggesting that there have been times in the past when we
have been asked to intervene by a legitimate government,'' D'Amato
said. ``I don't think we should write off that possibility. That's
a very real option.''
   At the Pentagon, a spokeswoman said the U.S. Southern Command in
Panama had issued a ``personnel movement'' alert Thursday night as
a precaution.
   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas said the command had issued a ``Bravo''
alert, which orders American military personnel and dependents to
``decrease their visibility.''
   A Bravo alert specifies that ``some civil disturbance activity
is probable. Reduce the amount of time spent in public areas of
Panama. If you do not live on a defense site or military area of
coordination, stay around your residence unless traveling to and
from work or conducting personal business in a non-affected area.''
   LaLuntas said there are two higher levels of alert, one which
orders travel to be confined to essential business and another
which suspends travel.
   She said the U.S. Southern Command in Panama had received
reports of scattered demonstrations in and around Panama City.
   ``U.S. personnel ... are also being reminded that under the
terms of the (Panama Canal) treaty, we are not to interfere in the
internal affairs of Panama,'' she said.
   Delvalle's move was applauded on Capitol Hill, but with some
reservation.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., head of the House Select Committee
on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said he believed the Delvalle move
was a direct result of Noriega's indictment in the United States on
drug charges.
   ``That was a foreign policy objective, but we used our Justice
Department to do it,'' Rangel said. ``That's not the normal way to
do things. ... Are we going to conduct foreign policy by
indictment?''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called Delvalle's action
``courageous.''
   ``It is constitutional and it deserves the support of
freedom-loving people throughout this hemisphere,'' Kennedy said.
``There is no doubt about the wishes of the Panamanian people:
President Delvalle must be supported and Gen. Noreiga must go.''
   ``If Gen. Noreiga persists in power, he will become an outcast _
now and for all time _ in Panama and throughout the world,''
Kennedy said.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called the announcement ``very
important news'' and said the United States should be prepared to
help Delvalle.
   ``I think we have a number of options,'' said Kerry, chairman of
a Foreign Relations subcommittee which held hearings earlier this
month on Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking
   ``The first (option) for the Congress of the United States to
immediately move to a full economic embargo of the country. ...
Hopefully, the business community and others in Panama who
recognize the impossibility of surviving in that situation and
Noriega himself will find it impossible for him to govern.''
   During a nationally broadcast news conference Wednesday night,
President Reagan, when asked whether the United States would
consider dropping the federal indictment if Noriega stepped aside,
replied:
   ``No, and I'm not going to comment on something of this kind.
This man has been indicted by a federal grand jury, and so I'm not
going to make any comment of that kind. Nor have we made any
advances or suggestions of that kind to the government of Panama.''
   Reagan said that ``what we would like to see is a return to
democracy and a civilian government in Panama, and not this
domination by literally a military dictator.''

<HEAD>Crewmen Say Drug, Alcohol Use Are Widespread in Rail Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boredom, peer pressure and bad management
create a climate for widespread drug and alcohol use by the
nation's railroad workers, two crewmen involved in last year's
fatal Amtrak crash say.
   The former Conrail workers told the Senate Commerce Committee on
Thursday of co-workers who consumed as much as a case of beer a
day, brought bottles of liquor to work, or used marijuana, cocaine,
amphetamines and other drugs.
   ``Overall, drinking was encouraged on the job, especially when I
was hired on,'' said Ricky L. Gates, who was the engineer of the
three connected Conrail locomotives that on Jan. 4, 1987, collided
with a crowded Amtrak passenger train.
   Sixteen people were killed and 175 injured in the accident, the
worst in Amtrak history, which occurred in Chase, Md.
   Gates, an admitted alcoholic, and brakeman Edward W. Cromwell
have admitted to smoking marijuana in the locomotive cab shortly
before the accident.
   Gates was charged with 16 counts of manslaughter but was allowed
to plead guilty to just one count in a plea agreement Feb. 16.
   He faces sentencing March 29. Cromwell, who testified
separately, was prepared to testify in court against Gates and was
not charged in the disaster.
   The Conrail engines went through a stop signal and into the path
of the New York-bound Amtrak train. The National Transportation
Safety Board has blamed the accident on marijuana use.
   Gates told the panel that he believed 10 percent or 20 percent
of rail workers drink or use drugs on duty. Cromwell said the
figure was more like 40 percent or 50 percent.
   The two men also said that when they began their railroad
careers 14 years ago, as many as 80 percent of their fellow
employees used drugs or alcohol during working hours.
   ``At times you may be sitting in a caboose for 12 hours without
even a wheel turning,'' Cromwell said. ``The boredom of the job
together with the lack of concern from some supervisors makes it a
common thing for some employees to drink or smoke marijuana while
on duty.''
   Gates, 33, said that once ``years ago,'' he was forced to report
to work even though he told the official who telephoned him that he
was drunk. He said a friend had to drive him to work after he was
told that if he did not report, he would be cited for refusin duty.
   ``Unless a climate is created where it is acceptable to come
forward and seek treatment, the employee assistance program (that
some railroads have) will not work,'' Gates said. ``That climate
does not exist in the rail industry.''
   Daniel W. Collins, assistant general secretary of the United
Transportation Union, told the committee that perhaps 10 percent of
rail workers on duty or subject to being called in to work are
under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
   He said the estimates that 80 percent of workers used drugs or
drank years ago have ``never been true in the history of the
industry.''
   Spokeswoman Carol Perkins of the American Association of
Railroads said in an interview that rail workers had the same
percentage of alcohol or drug use as the rest of society.
   ``Railroads have improved their policies and are more sensitive
to the problem,'' Perkins said.
   The Senate has approved a bill that would require several types
of drug and alcohol testing for railroad, airline, truck and bus
industry workers. The House has yet to approve similar legislation.
   The most controversial types of testing are examinations of
randomly chosen workers.
   Supporters say it is the best way to deter drug and alcohol use.
Opponents _ led by labor unions and civil liberties groups _ say it
could be abused by management officials out to get particular
workers, and is an invasion of privacy.
   The government already has rules allowing some testing of rail
workers, but not random tests.

   State lawmakers say they believe they will
be able to approve a holiday to honor slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. after the impeachment trial of Gov. Evan
Mecham.
   ``I promised the (acting) governor (Rose Mofford) that after the
trial's over that'll be one of the first things we'll try to do,''
Senate government committee chairman John Mawhinney said Thursday.
   Mecham, who rescinded the state's first King holiday in 1987,
goes on trial Monday in the Senate on a 23-count impeachment,
accused of concealing a campaign loan, misusing state funds and
trying to thwart an investigation.
   Acting Gov. Mofford supports a federal-style King holiday, and
lawmakers narrowed their focus on Thursday when the Senate rejected
a proposal to have voters decide whether to create a paid King
holiday.
   The vote leaves untouched two other measures more acceptable to
supporters of the holiday: a straight, federal-style holiday and a
``cafeteria bill'' that would late state workers pick a certain
number of holidays froom a list.
   The state's Republican-controlled legislature killed King
holiday proposals for a number of years, citing the estimated $3
million cost of a paid holiday for state employees.
   Then, Democrat Bruce Babbitt, about to launch a presidential
campaign, decided in 1986 to end his term as governor by bypassing
the legislature and creating a paid King holiday through executive
proclamation.
   Mecham, Babbitt's successor, promptly rescinded the order in
1987, citing an attorney general's advisory opinion that only
lawmakers or voters _ not governors _ could declare such holidays.
   Mecham's decision triggered international boycotts of the state
by musicians and convention groups, and the House approved a
federal-style King holiday last year, only to see the measure die
in committee.

   House Democrats and House Republicans are
offering different reasons for why a vote on the Democratic plan to
send $30.5 milllion in aid to the Nicaraguan Contras was postponed
until next week.
   Democrats say they wanted time to explain better how the package
differs from a rival Republican version. Republicans sa the
Democrats feared the package would have lost if had been voted on
Thursday, as originally scheduled.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said he planned to bring the
measure before the chamber for a vote next Thursday, and both sides
appeared likely to continue to fine-tune their aid packages to pick
up votes.
   ``Too many members have complained that they don't know what's
in it,'' Wright said Thursday.
   The Democratic version includes some $16 million in food,
clothing, shelter and medical aid to the rebels fighting
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, and $14 million to set
up a medical aid fund for children who are victims of that
country's seven-year civil war.
   Current aid to the rebels, which includes authority for the CIA
to deliver previously stockpiled weapons and ammunition, ends Feb.
29.
   But the House GOP leader, Robert Michel of Illinois, said the
scheduled vote this week was postponed because Democrats feared
they would lose, the Republican package would have been approved,
``and that would have aced out the speaker.''
   The $36 million Republican plan offered somewhat more aid to the
rebels, included non-lethal military items like jeeps and radios,
and adopted the Democratic plan's call for a ``children's survival
fund.''
   But the primary difference between the two proposals lay in the
conditions they set for the next showdown over a military aid
proposal that both sides expect President Reagan to offer later
this year.
   Democrats want to make any future military aid proposal
contingent on a finding by the House Intelligence Committee
sometime after June 1 that the two warring sides in Nicaragua have
not agreed to a cease-fire because the Sandinistas did not make
good-faith efforts.
   If such a determination is made, the new aid package would be
designed and controlled by the House Democratic leadership. There
would be no guarantee that the package would be offered, or if it
were, that the Senate would be forced to act quickly on it.
   But the GOP version would leave the determination of whether to
offer a new aid proposal up to Reagan, and would contain much
stricter rules to make sure the package would be quickly acted on
in both the House and the Senate. The president could act anytime
after April 15, under this version.
   Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the chief House Democratic vote
counter, said failure by Congress to pass some form of aid would
increase pressure for a vote later in the year on more weapons for
the Contras.

<HEAD>Burnley Says New Airport Security System Is Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest airports would have to
install new security systems to screen the movements of airport and
airline workers, under regulations the government is drafting, the
secretary of transportation says.
   The secretary, James H. Burnley IV, told Congress on Thursday
that the proposed regulations should be ready ``reasonably
quickly,'' and would take effect after allowing the airports time
to install the equipment.
   Under the new system, employees would carry magnetized
identification cards similar to automatic teller cards.
Computer-controlled gates set up throughout the airports would
admit only certain workers during specified hours, and could be
programmed to bar admission to people who leave their airport jobs.
   ``You can de-program a person out, limiting access to certain
areas,'' Burnley told the Senate transportation appropriations
subcommittee.
   He did not mention a cost or say how many airports would be
affected. A similar system is already in use at Washington Dulles
International Airport.
   Last Dec. 7, a fired USAir employee boarded a Pacific Southwest
Airlines jet after flashing his expired identification card to
airport security workers and shot his former boss and the plane's
crew in flight. The aircraft, bound to San Francisco from Los
Angeles, crashed in central California, killing all 44 people on
board.
   Burnley said he ordered the FAA to begin writing the new airport
security rule before Christmas.
   In other testimony, the secretary said the FAA will not be able
to meet the congressionally mandated level of 10,450 fully trained
air traffic controllers by Sept. 30. Instead, he projects that
9,932 so-called full-performance level controllers will be at work
at that date.
   He also said his agency is talking with the Air Force, which
plans to reduce its work force because of budget constraints, about
hiring air traffic controllers who lose jobs there.
   He also repeated the Reagan administration's refusal to rehire
any of the controllers fired after their 1980 strike, saying,
``They not only broke the law, they left the American people very
much in the lurch.''
   The government plans to have a total of 15,900 air traffic
controllers at work by Sept. 30, including trainees and
supervisors. It usually takes three to four years for a newly hired
controller to reach full-performance level.

   The pilot of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727
was forced to take evasive action and dive when an unidentified
small aircraft passed 100 feet over the jetliner Thursday night,
officials said.
   ``I don't know the exact distance but it was close. He took
evasive action. He dove to avoid collision,'' said Lou Cancelmi,
spokesman for Alaska Airlines said from Seattle, Wash. ``The pilot
took the plane down to get underneath it.''
   The pilot filed a a near-collision report with the Federal
Aviation Administration following the 6:36 p.m. incident over this
community 35 miles east of Los Angeles, said Dick Tornquist, an FAA
officer in Los Angeles.
   ``A pilot files a near-miss report when he fears his aircraft is
in jeopardy,'' the FAA official said.
   The incident occurred as the Alaska Airlines jetliner was
departing Ontario Airport en route to Seattle with 62 passengers
and seven crew members aboard, Cancelmi said.
   The Boeing 727 was flying at 7,000 feet when the unidentified
aircraft passed 100 feet overhead, Cancelmi said.
   The plane landed safely in Seattle and no injuries were
reported, he added.

<HEAD>Top Justice Official Tells Department to `Polarize Debate' on
Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Department officials have been
directed to ``polarize the debate'' on key legal questions this
year including AIDS, which an internal memo says is ``not a civil
rights or privacy issue.''
   The document says issues such as AIDS and drugs should be
discussed not as questions of individual rights but as ``public
health or safety issues.''
   The memo was sent Monday to various Justice Department officials
under the initials of William Bradford Reynolds, the counselor to
Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Reynolds also is assistant
attorney general in charge of the civil rights division.
   ``We must polarize the debate,'' it says. ``We must not seek
`consensus,' we must confront. Of course, we must confront
sensibly, in ways designed to win the debate and further our
agenda.''
   The memo was adopted from a document assembled several months
ago by Terry Eastland, the department's director of public affairs,
who said he wrote it to stimulate discussion on how to approach
various Justice Department issues.
   The contents of the memo were disclosed in Thursday editions of
the Baltimore Sun and subsequently confirmed by Eastland.
   The document recommends that the death penalty be defended as
necessary for ``deterrence, retribution and incapacitation (i.e.
decapitation).''
   Eastland said the department is not in favor of decapitation as
a method of capital punishment, but that he used the word to make
``incapacitation'' seem ``less abstract and professorial.''
   The memo says that ``AIDS is not a civil rights or privacy
issue, but one of public health and safety'' and recommends that
the department press lawsuits that seek to counter ``the privacy
advocates who challenge AIDS testing.''
   Regarding obscenity, it says that the department ``must attack
the idea that those trafficking'' in it ``have a right to practice
their trade.'' It suggests that public health laws, building codes,
and health and safety rules be used to attack obscenity, along with
laws making sale of obscene items a crime.
   Entitled ``A Strategy for the Remaining Months,'' the document
says the drug issue should be confronted by advocating a ``tough
approach'' emphasizing strong law enforcement and drug testing, as
opposed to ``the soft, easy way that emphasizes drug treatment and
rehabilitation.''
   The memo supports construction of more prisons instead of
alternatives to imprisonment and says that ``to polarize the issue
we must attack those by name (such as Sen. Paul Simon) who take the
other approach.'' Simon is a Democratic presidential candidate.

<HEAD>Bush Unlikely to Catch Dole Unawares on Tax Issue, Observers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's characterization of Republican
presidential rival Bob Dole as a supporter of tax increases is
unlikely to work as it did in New Hampshire because Dole is more
vigilant now, political and economics analysts say.
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said
Bush's New Hampshire commercial depicting Dole as straddling the
tax issue succeeded only because the Kansas senator ``chose not to
respond to it.''
   Martin Anderson, a domestic policy adviser during President
Reagan's first term, said the vice president damaged Dole's chances
in New Hampshire with the ad raising doubts about the Kansas
senator's tax intentions. But Anderson also said that Dole did
himself in by refusing to accept Pete du Pont's debate challenge to
sign a no-tax pledge.
   Economist Barry Bosworth of the liberal-oriented Brookings
Institution said Bush's accusations about Dole are specious, but
said the vice president adroitly played to an issue of great
sensitivity to people worried about their pocketbooks.
   ``I think Dole has learned from that (New Hampshire loss) and
you probably won't see this happen again,'' Bosworth said in an
interview.
   Several economists and political analysts were asked whether
Bush would be able to campaign successfully in the ensuing months
as an opponent of tax increases while characterizing Dole as a
tax-hike proponent.
   ``Bush has no record. Dole has a record which includes both
revenue increases, in concert with the (Reagan) administration, and
deficit reduction,'' said Bob McIntyre of the private group,
Citizens for Tax Justice.
   The question of whether Bush will be able to score political
points out of the tax issue arose in the wake of the vice
president's successful use in New Hampshire of a television
commercial which raised doubts about Dole's tax intentions.
   In the aftermath of his loss in New Hampshire, Dole acknowledged
that he should have responded immediately to Bush's ads. And on
Thursday, Dole announced the departure from his campaign staff of
consultants David Keene and Donald Devine.
   A check of the Republican presidential candidates' records shows
that while Bush succeeded in raising doubts in people's minds about
Dole's stance on taxes, neither man has a record of unqualified
opposition to tax hikes.
   Bush, last November, muted his disagreement with a
deficit-reduction package in which President Reagan and
congressional leaders, including Dole, signed a compact aimed at
slashing the federal deficit by $76 billion over the next two
years, in part with $22 billion in tax increases.
   Bush seemed to dissent when he told a crowd in Iowa that while
he didn't like the tax hikes envisioned in the package, ``I'll
support whatever compromise the president makes.''
   Bush had slipped a month earlier by launching his presidential
campaign with an uncompromising pledge to not raises taxes, only to
subsequently leave the door slightly ajar.
   In an Oct. 15 interview on Cable News Network, Bush backtracked
from the Oct. 12 Houston promise.
   ``What I have said is, if I were convinced that all spending
that could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place, then and
only then would I consider a tax increase,'' he said. Later the
same day, when pressed for an explanation, Bush replied, ``I'm not
going to raise taxes, period.''
   The Dole campaign promises to perform some political ``truth
squad'' work on Bush's commercials during the balance of the
campaign, and the Bush camp continues to deny that it distorted the
senator's position on taxes.
   But with both Dole and Bush, the record is full of
inconsistencies regarding both general tax increases and the
question of imposing an import fee on foreign oil.
   Dole supported the sweeping reduction in tax rates in 1981, but
helped enact a $98.3 billion tax hike a year later.
   During the 1980, Bush labeled as ``voodoo economics'' Reagan's
pledge to restore U.S. military might while cutting taxes and
balancing the budget. But the record shows no evidence of a Bush
dissent from tax increases that Reagan has signed in the ensuing
years.
   The record shows that Dole supported various deficit-reduction
tax hike proposals, including the $98.3 billion package, a $50.6
billion program in 1984 and the $22 billion in hikes contained in a
plan Reagan agreed to last Nov. 20 in the wake of the Wall Street
crash.
   Bosworth said that in times of general economic prosperity,
candidates for political office score big points by suggesting an
opponent would raise taxes.
   ``I think Dole has probably learned from this (loss in New
Hampshire),'' he said. ``It appears Republicans voted for Bush
there because he appeared to be more adamant about not raising
taxes than Dole was.''

<HEAD>Senators Doom Lamb Import Curbs, Sugar Money As Trade Bill Heats
Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate conferees have stripped lamb import
quotas and government payments of $365 million to sugar refiners
from a proposed trade bill that lawmakers want to have ready for
President Reagan by Easter.
   Also abandoned Thursday was a move to end favorable tariff
treatment for Romania because of the government's anti-Jewish
policies. Critics said foreign policy issues should be kept out of
trade bills.
   Removal of those and other politically sensitive provisions
represented a major step for the 1,000-page trade bill as lawmakers
began to make the tough, long-delayed decisions needed to get it to
the president's desk.
   The trimming was done in a response by Senate Finance Committee
conferees to their counterparts on the House Ways and Means
Committee. The House conferees on Tuesday produced a wide-ranging
proposal to iron out differences between the two rival versions of
the bill they have passed.
   The lamb provision was the only product-specific quota in the
legislation. Sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., it would have
clamped on a quota if imports surged over 110 percent of a formula
level based on multiyear averages.
   The House panel moved earlier to drop the lamb provision, which
was contained only in the Senate bill.
   The sugar provision would have meant $365 million in payments to
sugar refining companies, mainly to three giants of the industry:
Amstar Sugar Corp., Imperial Sugar Co. and Savannah Food and
Industries Inc.
   Under current law, companies may obtain refunds known as
drawbacks on any duties they paid on products they imported as long
as the products were re-exported within five years of the original
imports.
   The provision, which was in both versions, would have extended
the rules to enable refiners who claim drawbacks on cane sugar
imported as early as November 1977.
   Critics said customs records were lacking and there would be a
problem with customs fraud. Proponents said the measure was a
refund that would cost taxpayers little and help maintain sugar
industry jobs.
   ``This shows that we want a very positive, strong trade bill
that opens markets but is in no way protectionist,'' Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Thursday.
   No fewer than 17 joint committees are negotiating over scores of
issues contained in the complex bill, which has been three years in
the making. It represents a response to huge trade deficits and
joblessness at home caused by competition from imports.
   The measure aims at streamlining the machinery under which the
United States retaliates against unfair practices by trading
partners and imposes curbs on imported goods that threaten to
injure American industry.
   Among the multitude of issues yet to be resolved is the
House-passed Gephardt amendment, which would require 10 percent
annual rollbacks in ``excess and unwarranted'' Japanese surpluses
in trade with this country.
   Lawmakers are indicating they may wait to tackle that issue
until after the March 8 ``Super Tuesday'' primaries in which the
sponsor, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is campaigning for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Illinois, has been saying that Gephardt will be among the
negotiators when a compromise is reached with the Senate, which did
not include such a measure in its version.
   The Senate panel's response varied little from what the House
outlined in its proposal Tuesday.
   It moved to strike from the bill provisions to step up
enforcement of customs fraud laws, which critics called unworkable.
It went the House one further in eliminating its own proposal to
give private citizens the right to file lawsuits against unfair
foreign trade practices.
   ``I am impressed with the Senate counteroffer,'' Rostenkowski
said in a statement. ``The House made some painful decisions to
drop special interest items in favor of a national trade policy.
The Senate has upped the ante on that approach.''

   U.S. officials will visit Portugal next week
to talk about giving the Portuguese surplus American military
equipment as a means of offsetting budget cuts in military aid, the
State Department says.
   Gen. Charles Brown, chief of the Defense Security Assistance
Agency, will head the delegation leaving next Monday for Portugal
to talk about what kind of military equipment the United States
could provide.
   The United States has suggested giving Portugal surplus
equipment to make up for budget cuts that have forced a reduction
in aid below levels promised under a 1983 agreement allowing the
U.S. military to use bases in Portugal.
   The announcement Thursday came a day after Portuguese Prime
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva met with President Reagan to complain
about the lower aid levels and call for a formal review of the
bases agreement.
   ``Portugal wants the military bases to continue,'' Cavaco Silva
reiterated in a speech on Thursday to the National Press Club,
``and we don't want to reduce the American facilities in Portugal.''
   ``Our decision is a result of difference in interpretation of
our mutual agreement, and we don't want that this point of friction
will continue until 1991,'' he said. ``That is the end of this
agreement.''
   The agreement, an extension of an original pact stemming from
1951, ``is out of date,'' Cavaco Silva said.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said U.S. officials
were pleased that Cavaco Silva didn't want a reduction in American
military presence in Portugal, unlike the insistence of neigboring
Spanish officials that the United States remove F-16s that had been
based in Spain.

   Young families with children have suffered the
most dramatic income drop since 1970 of any family group in
America, while the elderly have seen the sharpest rise, according
to a new congressional analysis.
   The study of family income trends by the Congressional Budget
Office found that median income for families with children, in
which the head of household was under 25, plummeted 43 percent from
1970 to 1986.
   For those over 65, including people living alone, income went up
more than 50 percent.
   A Republican senator and a Democratic congressman independently
requested the non-partisan CBO to do a study of family income
trends, and each offered his own interpretation of the analysis
released Thursday.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., stressed the encouraging CBO finding
that overall, American family income has risen 20 percent since
1970. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., pointed to the plight of
low-income families with children.
   Miller also cited CBO's finding that many families increased
their incomes over the 16-year period not through higher wages but
by adding another wage-earner to the workforce, and with that
wage-earner such added costs as child care and commuting.
   ``In many families, both parents must now work to maintain the
standard of living, which results in increased costs as well as
increased income,'' said Miller, chairman of the House Select
Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   CBO said that the elderly as a group were least buffeted by the
swings of the economy, and that rises in their income were due
primarily to higher Social Security payments.
   Among the findings:
   _While family income for the elderly grew more than 50 percent,
it grew only 26 percent for married couples with children and only
2 percent for single mothers with children. For families head by
someone under 25, including those without children, income dropped
20 percent.
   _Income fell 13 percent for low-income single mothers with
children, with 20 percent of such families having less than half
the cash income needed to live at the poverty level in 1986.
   _Income rose 12 percent to 37 percent for all families with at
least one full-time, year-round worker. For families with children
and no such worker, it fell 10 percent.
   Domenici, senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and a
member of the National Economic Commission, said he was not
surprised by the negative trends among young and single-parent
families. He said any deficit-reduction recommendations would be
screened for their impact on those households.
   However, Domenici said CBO might have found more encouraging
trends among such families if it had taken into account such
non-cash programs as food stamps and the 1986 tax law that took
millions of low-income families off the tax rolls.
   CBO said a lack of family-level data prevented it from including
non-cash programs in its analysis. The agency gave similar reasons
for not taking into account pre-1981 tax hikes, which reduced
disposable income, and said it was impossible to project the net
effect of either omission.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Attorney General Edwin Meese III
say he knew nothing about a plan to use Pentagon money to give
Israel payments to protect a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project.
   The plan was being promoted by Meese's longtime friend, E.
Robert Wallach. Wallach's attorney, George G. Walker, confirmed the
contents of two messages in December 1985 sent by Wallach to Swiss
oilman Bruce Rappaport, a partner in the proposed Iraqi project.
One contains a reference to Meese.
   Wallach was Rappaport's attorney.
   The Washington Post, which on Thursday disclosed the existence
of the proposal to use Pentagon money, said the December 1985
messages plus another Wallach-to-Rappaport telex on Feb. 3, 1986
show that Meese supported the plan and that the late William Casey,
then CIA director, endorsed it.
   ABC News, quoting anonymous sources, reported that under the
plan Israel would have gotten $400 million in U.S. military aid
over four years. The money was to be set aside in a special bank
account as construction of the pipeline began, the network said.
   ``The attorney general was not involved in any plans to utilize
defense department funds for the project, gave no `assurances'
about any such plan, and arranged no meeting for that purpose,''
said a statement by Nathan Lewin, one of Meese's lawyers.
   ``The attorney general has no recollection of anything being
said to him about any such plan,'' Lewin added in an interview.
   Meese's involvement with the pipeline project is under criminal
investigation by independent counsel James McKay, who is trying to
determine whether the attorney general may have violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   That act makes it illegal for U.S. citizens, companies or their
agents to offer foreign officials ``anything of value'' to
influence them and makes the attorney general responsible for
filing civil suits to block such payments.
   Federal investigators also are looking at Wallach's failure to
register as a foreign agent, The Washington Times reported today.
The newspaper quoted Justice Department officials, who were not
identified, as saying the issue could raise conflict-of-interest
problems for Meese.
   It said that when Wallach went to work as a paid lobbyist for
Rappaport, he also was acting as an unpaid personal attorney to
Meese during his confirmation hearings as attorney general.
   A Dec. 16, 1985, message from Wallach to Rappaport says that ``I
have assurance from my friend that if necessary, he will engage new
person on project.'' Wallach usually called Meese ``my friend.''
   But Walker said that rather than being a reference to Meese, the
``he'' referred to in that portion of the telex is someone else,
probably National Security Staff aide David Wigg, who would explain
the pipeline project in general terms to the new national security
adviser, John Poindexter. Poindexter had taken over the post from
Robert McFarlane on Dec. 4, 1985.
   Walker said that in 1985, NSC aide Wigg came up with the idea of
using Pentagon money to make payments to Israel to ensure that the
Israelis would not attack the pipeline.
   Wallach sent a Dec. 12, 1985 telegram to Rappaport relating that
Wigg was attempting to determine whether or not Pentagon financing
for the payments could be provided.
   Wallach said ``the capital DOD (Department of Defense) package''
was to be submitted that day by Wigg to McFarlane, who was wrapping
up his government employment.
   On Dec. 16, Wallach reported in a message to Rappaport that at a
meeting that day with Casey, who was a friend of Rappaport's, Wigg
and Wallach reviewed documents relating to the Pentagon budget plan.
   Wallach said that Casey ``approved the concept with expression
as to it being unique in his experience.'' Walker said the language
stops short of saying Casey endorses the plan, and is simply
expressing a view about the unique nature of the payment plan.
   In a Feb. 3, 1986 message obtained by the Post, Wallach tells
Rappaport Meese will contact Poindexter to arrange a meeting for
Wallach, ``if it is necessary to obtain signature of his
(Poindexter's) superior.''
   Lewin said Meese has no recollection of arranging a meeting for
Wallach with Poindexter nor does he recall being asked to do so.
Walker said he didn't have a copy of the Feb. 3 message and that
Wallach didn't remember sending one.
   Lewin's statement said Meese ``stands by'' a statement he made
Feb. 1 that ``the sum and substance'' of his involvement with the
Iraqi pipeline project consisted of referring Wallach to McFarlane
in May 1985, referring then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres to
McFarlane in October 1985 and discussing the pipeline briefly with
Peres.
   The only other involvement, Meese said, was having the Justice
Department Office of Legal Counsel consider a request in October
1985 on the legality of using U.S. aid money to Israel to help
protect the pipeline from Israeli attack.
   A Sept. 25, 1985 memo from Wallach to Meese says that a portion
of up to $700 million that would go to Israel from the pipeline
would be funneled to the Israeli Labor Party.

   Vice President George Bush holds a strong
lead over his GOP rivals among likely South Carolina voters, a poll
published by The Charlotte Observer indicated today.
   Coming three days before March 8, Super Tuesday, when 20 states
hold primaries and caucuses, the South Carolina primary has assumed
strategic importance in the GOP sweepstakes, despite its prize of
only 37 delegates.
   The poll indicated Bush had the support of 41 percent of those
who said they're likely to vote in the South Carolina GOP primary.
Trailing were Sen. Bob Dole with 29 percent, former television
evangelist Pat Robertson, 13 percent, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New
York, 4 percent. Twelve percent were undecided.
   The poll also indicated Bush had the support of most of the
younger voters: 61 percent of those 18-24 backed the vice
president, as did 45 percent of those from 25-34. But so did 45
percent of those over 65.
   However, 45 percent of the likely voters _ and 47 percent of
Republicans _ said they see little difference between Bush and Dole.
   The telephone poll, conducted by the market research division of
the newspaper, surveyed 687 registered voters who indicated they're
likely to participate in the primary. The margin of error was 3.7
percentage points.
   Meanwhile, a third of those polled said the controversy
surrounding television evengelist Jimmy Swaggart has hurt Robertson.
   And Robertson, who is counting on support from Democrats
eligible to vote in the state's ``open'' GOP primary, was trailing
Dole and Bush among Democratic voters.
   Half the voters said they would feel uncomfortable with a
television evangelist as president. And nearly a third said
Robertson would be hurt by the Swaggart affair. But 56 said they
didn't believe it would affect Robertson.
   One of the country's most popular TV evangelists, Swaggart
stepped down this week after allegations that he had been with a
New Orleans prostitute.
   This week, Robertson lashed out at Bush, suggesting that the
vice president's campaign had something to do with the timing of
the Swaggart revelations _ an implication Bush called absurd.
   At the same time, Dole was winning the endorsement of _ and
stumping the state with _ the state's most revered Republican, Sen.
Strom Thurmond.
   After indications that Dole would downplay the state, Bush
supporters say Thurmond's backing has raised his stakes.

<HEAD>Government Ending Exemption Allowing 17-Year-Olds To Drive School
Buses</HEAD>

   Some 4,700 teen-agers will be ousted from the
drivers' seats of school buses in North Carolina and South Carolina
under a ruling issued by the Labor Department.
   The department, in an effort to crack down on enforcement of
child labor laws, announced Thursday that 17-year-olds must stop
driving school buses in those states after April 1, said department
spokesman Bob Zachariasiewicz.
   For the past two decades, the department had granted both states
annual exemptions from the child labor laws that enabled them to
hire the youths.
   The decision to end the exemptions reflected a failure of the
states to comply with more stringent conditions imposed in December
on the employment of 17-year-olds, the department said in a
statement.
   In January, a 4-year-old West Columbia, S.C., boy was run over
and killed by a 17-year-old bus driver who had a previous speeding
ticket. No charges were filed against the driver due to confusion
over whether he could have seen the child.
   Deputy Secretary of Labor Dennis Whitfield informed the two
states' governors of the decision Thursday.
   Officials from the two states expressed dismay at the ruling.
   ``If this in fact comes to pass, it would cause North Carolina
some very big problems, and we hope the Department of Labor will
send us some bus drivers to go with their order,'' said Jim
Sughrue, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Martin.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said he ``deeply regret(s)
the Department of Labor has seen fit to withdraw South Carolina's
exemption of 17-year-old bus drivers prior to the end of the school
year.
   ``But the department's findings that certain school districts
were ignoring its guidelines did not help South Carolina's position
in this matter,'' the governor added.
   South Carolina has 6,000 school bus drivers, of whom 1,200 are
17 years old, said Charlie Williams, the South Carolina
superintendent of education. A total of 1,000 young drivers had
been fired by December because of bad driving records.
   North Carolina has 13,000 drivers, of whom 3,500 are 17,
Zachariasiewicz said. In the 1986-87 school year, there were 14,350
drivers, of whom 5,000 were 16 and 17 years old.
   The department banned school bus driving by 16-year-olds in
December, he said.
   Employment of any drivers under 18 after April 1 would result in
assessment of monetary penalties and possible court action, the
department said.
   When the states applied for exemptions for the 1987-88 school
year, they were instead given extensions until Dec. 31, 1987, while
they supplied additional data, Zachariasiewicz said.
   In December, the department extended the exemptions through the
1987-88 school year, but three conditions were imposed for the use
of 17-year-old drivers: They had to have been trained and started
driving school buses on or before Aug. 31, 1987; they could not
have received a ticket for a moving violation or been involved in
an accident for which they were responsible _ in a car or a bus _
during the 1986-87 school year; and they had to be students or high
school graduates.
   Investigations by the department of how the states followed
these criteria ``revealed widespread non-compliance, particularly
employment of 17-year-olds with moving violations on their driving
records as student school bus drivers,'' the department statement
said.
   ``In South Carolina, in 14 of 15 school districts investigated,
the department found approximately 200 instances of
non-compliance,'' the statement said.
   North Carolina had received exemptions since 1967 while South
Carolina had received them since 1968.

   Stock prices closed higher on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Friday, with the market's key index posting its 12th
consecutive gain, while the U.S. dollar ended the week at 128.35
yen, unchanged from its opening.
   The dollar's close was 0.45 yen lower than Thursday's closing
level of 128.80 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues ended the day at
25,165.18, up 64.52 points or 0.25 percent.
   Currency traders attributed the dollar's opening weakness to
disappointment that the revised U.S. fourth-quarter gross national
product statistics released Thursday didn't exceed 5 percent, as
some had hoped. The Commerce Department said the revised growth
rate was 4.5 percent.
   At a press conference Friday in Tokyo, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said intervention by central banks was not necessary at
this time since yen-dollar exchange rates were stable. His remarks
appeared to have little influence in the currency market.

   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 64.52

largest brokerage, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Analysts also said many Japanese companies were revising their
forecasts for March because of better business performance.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 128.35 yen,
unchanged from its opening level but down from its 128.80-yen
closing Thursday. Spot turnover totaled $4.5 billion.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a news conference today
that intervention by central banks was not necessary at the present
time because of stable yen-dollar exchange rates.

   The Reagan administration is welcoming reports
from Moscow that a strategic arms agreement could be ready for
signing at a May summit, but says it is doubtful such a timetable
could be met.
   ``We welcome it, if it means the Soviets are going to work at
the negotiations just as hard as we will,'' an administration
official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   And Reagan, in an interview Thursday with The Washington Post,
expressed hope it could be signed by the end of the year although
``the time is too limited'' to complete work on the treaty by the
summit.
   A senior Soviet official in Moscow also said Thursday he
expected a treaty to reduce the superpowers' long-range nuclear
weapons stockpile would be ready for signing at the summit meeting,
the Post said.
   The official, who was not identified, talked to about 20 foreign
reporters at a two-hour meeting. The Post was uninvited but said it
obtained its account from other reporters.
   The official also said that Reagan will stay in the Kremlin
during the visit, which should last for about a week and could
include other cities besides Moscow, according to the account in
today's Post.
   The administration is known to completely discount the
speculation that Reagan would stay in the Kremlin.
   According to administration officials, Reagan's expected trip to
Moscow is likely to mirror in length and style the four-day visit
to Washington last December by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The officials said Thursday that no dates have been fixed for
the president's trip, but that tentative plans continue to be that
it will fall sometime from mid- to late-May to early June.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters this week
he did not expect a summit date to be set until Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze meets in Washington late next month
with Secretary of State George Shultz, who just returned from
Moscow.
   Gorbachev's visit was confined to Washington. In a strict
observance of the rule of reciprocity, Reagan is expected to remain
in Moscow.
   The New York Times, in an account of the briefing published in
today's editions, said the official indicated the Soviet Union
might drop a key objection to the U.S. development of a space-based
missile defense system by permitting the testing of components in
space.

<HEAD>Team Develops Synthetic Peptide That Triggers AIDS Antibodies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of a synthetic peptide that
triggers antibodies to neutralize the AIDS virus in rabbits may
eventually help in combating the fatal disease in humans, a Chicago
researcher says.
   Mark Gurney, an assistant professor at the University of
Chicago, said Thursday that the peptides he synthesized imitate
part of the HIV virus. The HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``The potential is that you could use a peptide to elicit ...
the same type of antibodies in man and these would then attack the
virus,'' Gurney said.
   Peptides are compounds of amino acids, and the ones that Gurney
made were identical in some ways to a portion of the envelope that
surrounds the human immune virus.
   In the experiments, researchers put the peptides into laboratory
rabbits. The immune system of the rabbits produced three antibodies
against the peptides.
   Researchers then exposed these antibodies to several strains of
the HIV virus in test tubes, and Gurney said the HIV virus was
neutralized, or prevented from spreading to other cells.
   The experiment used a peptide that was a chemical mimic of a
portion of the HIV envelope that remains unchanged, Gurney said.
Other parts of the virus change frequently.
   This unchanging portion of the HIV virus does not elicit an
antibody response when it is attached to the whole virus for
reasons that scientists do not understand, said Gurney.
   He said peptide-antibody response is not well understood now and
that experiments in the past have shown that synthetic peptides can
trigger undesirable antibodies, only a small number of which will
attack the target.
   Until this process is further refined, he said, peptides will
not be useful against AIDS.
   He said the researchers also are unable to determine precisely
how the antibodies created by using the peptide are able to
neutralize AIDS in the test tube.
   Gurney worked on the experiment with David D. Ho of the
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Joan C. Kaplan of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and Indre E. Rackauskas
of the University of Chicago.
   A report on the research appears today in Science, the journal
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   AIDS kills by destroying a key part of the human immune system,
leaving the body open to infections. AIDS is spread principally
through sexual contact, but also by the shared needles of drug
abusers and the use of contaminated blood products in transfusions.
Infected mothers may also pass the AIDS virus to their babies while
giving birth.
   As of Feb. 15, AIDS had been diagnosed in 53,814 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 30,158, have died since 1981, according to
the federal Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to have
recovered from AIDS.

   Rock superstar Bruce Springsteen walked
onstage, threw a bouquet of roses into the crowd, stepped up to a
microphone and yelled, ``Ready for a date?''
   Nearly 13,000 people, most standing as they would throughout the
concert, roared back that they were.
   Springsteen and his 12-piece E Street Band then went to work,
and the Boss' nationwide ``Tunnel of Love'' tour _ his first in
nearly 2{ years _ got under way Thursday night at the Worcester
Centrum.
   ``I'm excited,'' said Cynthia Swienton of Simsbury, Conn.,
standing up in her seat 12 rows from the back of the auditorium.
She and her companion, John Smedick of Torrington, Conn., paid $300
for their two tickets.
   Although the concert was sold out, hundreds of people milled
around outside before the show began, hoping to buy tickets.
   According to the Worcester Telegram newspaper, ticket scalpers'
prices were generally between $150 to $225 a ticket, but one
unidentified person said he was offered a ticket for $750. Tickets
were $20 each when first went on sale.
   Ticket scalping is illegal in Massachusetts.
   The crowd was generally orderly outside the Centrum, said police
Lt. Paul F. Campbell. He said there were a few arrests for unarmed
robbery of concert tickets and one man was charged with being a
disorderly person after he allegedly spit in the face of a
television camerman.
   Police Sgt. John R. Harrington also said two men, one wielding a
crowbar, were arrested for robbing four teen-agers of their tickets
before the show began.
   Several celebrities were among the 12,800 people attending the
show, including basketball star Kevin McHale of the Boston Celtics
and Miami Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen's lead guitar player until
1981.
   ``A lot of the guys (Celtics) like Springsteen,'' McHale said,
taking time to sign autographs while sitting in a middle section of
the auditorium. ``The '84 tour, they seemed to be touring a lot of
cities that we were playing in. We'd play on one night, they'd come
to our game; we'd go to the concert next night. It worked real
nice.''
   Dressed in tight black jeans, black boots, vest and a white
shirt buttoned to the neck, Springsteen later took off the shirt to
reveal a black T-shirt, and his hair was lathered with sweat 3
hours and 25 minutes later.
   ``Do you want me to get a heart attack? On the first night?'' he
asked the crowd before he and the band did a 15-minute encore of
such rock favorites as ``Devil with a Blue Dress on,'' ``Good Golly
Miss Molly'' and ``CC Rider.''
   He opened the show with ``Tunnel of Love.''
   Springsteen, 38, will perform again Sunday and Monday in
Worcester before the tour moves on to Chapel Hill, N.C.

   Although he will have all the functions of president, under
Panama's Constitution Solis Palma, 71, will have the title Minister
in Charge of the Presidency of the Republic rather than president.
   He will fill out the current presidential term, which ends in
October 1989. Elections are scheduled for May 1989.
   According to the constitution, selection of a new chief
executive goes to the Cabinet and the title is changed because the
country no longer has a vice president.
   Delvalle was first elected vice president on a ticket with
President Nicolas Ardito Barletta and assumed the presidency when
Ardito Barletta stepped down after 11 months in power.
   Panama has been rocked by protests since June, when Noriega's
recently retired second in command publicly charged the general
with illicit activities ranging from drug trafficking to electoral
fraud and the assassination of a political opponent.
   A flight of money from Panama followed.
   ``Today the country is virtually at siege economically by
external pressures and tensions,'' Delvalle told the nation
Thursday. ``I have to consider with sadness that many of the
successes that had been obtained are vanishing in the past eight
months.''
   The Defense Forces have about 15,000 soldiers and police under
their command in this nation of 2.2 million people.
   Relations between the United States and Panama have deteriorated
since the anti-Noriega demonstrations broke out last summer.
   Noriega has demanded removal of the Southern Command, which the
Pentagon and the White House have rejected, saying American troops
are legally in Panama and will remain there to protect the canal
until it is handed over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega later said he was referring only to the headquarters
unit responsible for U.S. strategic military planning. American
military sources said that would involve the removal of only about
300 officers and men.
   During his birthday speech this month, Noriega received an
ovation when he declared: ``If they want me out, they'll have to
kill me.''
   The Reagan administration looks upon Noriega as the main
obstacle in its goal of an eventual transition in Panama to a truly
civilian government.
   Delvalle assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances
which strongly suggested that Noriega forced the ouster of
Delvalle's predecessor.
   It was a constitutional succession, but Delvalle has been widely
perceived as no more than Panama's titular head.
   Noriega has maintained that executive authority rests with
Delvalle and that Panama has achieved a full transition to
democracy. He says his U.S. critics are campaigning against him
with the aim of annulling the Panama Canal treaties, under which
the waterway reverts to Panamanian control.
   U.S. officials said Wednesday that Delvalle's extensive business
interests and family could be threatened if he were to break with
Noriega. In addition, Delvalle's health is said to be tenuous
because of a heart operation.
   However, they said Delvalle was increasingly disturbed by his
ties to Noriega.
   Noriega entered the Panamanian National Guard in 1962 as a
lieutenant after attending a military college in Peru on a
scholarship. He quickly became acquainted with a rising young
officer named Omar Torrijos.
   Torrijos took power in Panama in a 1968 coup. Less than a year
later he named Noriega, then an obscure major in northernmost
Panama, as his chief of intelligence with the rank of lieutenant
colonel.
   The job put Noriega in touch with U.S. intelligence agencies
concerned over any potential threats to the Panama Canal.
   When Torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981,
Noriega began shouldering his way to the top command. He took power
in 1983.
   On an official salary of $60,000 a year, Noriega lives in a
two-story, colonial-style mansion in an exclusive district of
Panama City and maintains a fleet of expensive cars. He is reported
to own at least a dozen properties, including an apartment in Paris
and a chateau in the south of France.

   Isolated snow showers lingered in the Northeast today and a few
light rain showers dampened Northern California, but fair weather
prevailed across the nation.
   A weak storm moving across Lake Ontario was expected to drop 3
to 6 inches of snow on New York state east of the lake, and a snow
squall warning was in effect.
   Clouds extended from California to Texas and over Washington
state and Oregon. Partly cloudy skies prevailed from the Great
Lakes to the middle and northern Atlantic Coast.
   Today's forecast called for scattered snow showers across
eastern Upper Michigan, the eastern Great Lakes and upper Ohio
Valley; rain showers over the southern Pacific Coast and mild
weather for most of the nation, with mostly sunny or partly cloudy
skies.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s or 60s across
much of the country; the 20s from northern sections of the Great
Lakes through northern and central New England; the 30s and 40s
from the eastern Dakotas and upper Mississippi Valley into the Ohio
Valley and the mid-Atlantic region; the 70s across Southern
California and from southern and eastern Texas into Oklahoma and
southwest Kansas; and around 80 degrees across the desert Southwest.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 88 degrees at Palm Springs,
Calif. Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees at Montpelier, Vt., to 68 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Actor Jimmy Stewart drew cheers and tears at a
ceremony honoring him for what first lady Nancy Reagan described as
his ``wonderful life.''
   ``Your own story could be an entire museum,'' Mrs. Reagan told
Stewart and about 1,000 Stewart fans at the Thursday night ceremony
sponsored by the American Museum of the Moving Image, the nation's
first large-scale film and television museum, scheduled to open
here in May.
   The first lady also revealed that she developed a crush on
Stewart after he visited her family in California and entertained
them with his guitar.
   ``In my teen-age years I had a huge crush on Jimmy,'' she said.
``For a 16-year-old to have Jimmy Stewart for a weekend was too
much. I was overcome. I was gone. You know that crush has grown
into a real love.
   ``I have a twinge of jealousy for those who had the honor to
perform with him,'' the former actress added.
   Colleagues such as Kirk Douglas, Richard Dreyfuss, Brooke
Shields and Janet Leigh spoke about how Stewart had become as much
a source of inspiration as his movies, which include ``It's A
Wonderful Life,'' ``The Spirit Of St. Louis'' and ``Mr. Smith Goes
To Washington.''
   ``I doubt you know who you really and truly are Mr. Stewart,''
Dreyfuss said. ``You have taught and trained me as an actor. You
have inspired me as a storyteller and you have come to personify a
part of this nation, to symbolize the American man who is gentle,
ironic, self-depreciating, tough and emotional.''
   Douglas drew chuckles from the audience at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel ballroom when he said he was in awe of the 79-year-old man
who has ``been an inspiration to all of us young actors.''
   Stewart spoke briefly, praising the museum.
   ``I'm really astounded at what all of you have done here to
create and bring to reality all you have done in the American
Museum of the Moving Image,'' said Stewart, whose wife, Gloria, and
two daughters also attended.
   The $11.4 million museum will feature exhibits that explore the
art, history and technology of all moving image media.
   The most moving part of the evening occurred when the audience
was shown a segment from ``The Tonight Show'' in which Stewart read
a poem about his dog Bo.
   Although the poem began with comical recollections of the dog,
it ended with a tearful Stewart describing how the dog died and how
he missed having it beside him.
   Miss Shields, who was choked up as she started to speak after
watching the film clip from the podium, told the audience she too
had a dog named Bo.

<HEAD>Traficant Petitions Ruled Invalid in Two Ohio Districts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. James A. Traficant Jr., whose
avowed campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has yet
to take shape, has failed to make the ballot in two more Ohio
congressional districts.
   The problems disclosed Thursday brought to four the number of
Ohio districts in which Traficant's name will not be on the ballot.
Ohio has 21 congressional districts.
   In the sprawling 6th District of Southern Ohio, Traficant needed
150 signatures, and 159 were submitted. Every signature was ruled
invalid, said Nancy Stapleton, director of the Warren County Board
of Elections.
   Elections officials in the 2nd District in suburban Cincinnati
said Thursday that Traficant did not meet petition requirements
there, either. Traficant already was off the ballot in two other
districts.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Objects To Columnist's Request To Rate Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett
responded with a stern ``no'' to a columnist's request that Cabinet
officers rate Vice President George Bush as to his presidential
timber.
   Bennett took umbrage at a request from Dale Van Atta, co-author
of the Jack Anderson column, who sought the impressions of all 34
present and former Reagan Cabinet members who have served with Bush.
   Calling Bush ``a mystery to the voters,'' the columnist asked
for instances where Bush influenced policy decisions or actions,
and warned that a failure to reply ``may send a negative message
about Mr. Bush.''
   Bennett's wrote back that it was ``nonsense'' to call Bush a
mystery to the voters. He also said he would not violate the
confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, or ``the president's
injunction to all his Cabinet members to stay neutral in the
presidential race.''

   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, a
Democratic presidential candidate, wants to speak to the Oklahoma
Senate but Senate President Pro Tempore Bob Cullison doubts Duke
will get the chance.
   Democrat Cullison said a man identifying himself as a
representative of Duke, one of 12 Democrats on the Oklahoma primary
ballot, came to his office this week and asked if the candidate
could address the Senate next week.
   The Senate leader said he told the man Duke could talk if he
could get a Senate sponsor and there were no objections.
   Cullison said Senate rules require unanimous consent requests
before a non-senator can address the legislative body. He said such
requests are routinely approved, but he did not think that would be

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma
was sworn in as Panama's new chief of state early Friday to replace
President Eric Arturo Delvalle, removed from office after he
ordered the country's military strongman to step down.
   Legislative Assembly President Alberto Aleman Boyd administered
the oath of office to Palma Solis at the assembly building shortly
before 4 a.m. EST.
   Delvalle said he rejected his removal, which came after the
military challenged his order dismissing Noriega and the man named
as new chief of the Defense Forces refused to take the job.
   Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment as a drug trafficker, is
regarded as the real power behind the civilian government in
Panama, headquarters for U.S. military operations in Latin America.
   Opposition lawmakers did not attend the 10-minute emergency
legislative session during which DelValle and Vice President
Roderick Esquivel were removed from office. The actions were by
unanimous vote of the 38 members of the 67-seat assembly in
attendance.
   The Cabinet, which Delvalle said he fired today, then named
Solis Palma chief of state to complete Delvalle's term. Elections
are scheduled for May 1989.
   At his home, Delvalle said he fired all 12 Cabinet members and
called the resolution ``something legally despicable that only
fulfills a formality in the mind of those who want to grasp power
at any cost.
   ``They will not receive acceptance from any country that takes
pride in being democratic, '' Delvalle said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Bob Hall said the White
House would have no comment until morning. An official at the State
Department also had no immediate comment.
   The National Democratic Union, which backs the military, holds
45 seats in the assembly. The rest are held by the Democratic
Alliance of the Opposition, none of whose members attended the
session.
   In its resolution, the assembly said Delvalle did not follow
constitutional procedures and laws of the Defense Forces in
removing Noriega.
   In addition, it said, in announcing his decision, Delvalle
mentioned the U.S. charges against Noriega, showing that ``this
conduct of the president occurs with the object of permitting the
intervention of the government of the United States in the internal
affairs of Panama.''
   It said Delvalle's action damaged national sovereignty and
endangered the peace and security of the country, also violating
the constitution.
   It said Esquivel had abandoned his post Sept. 8, 1987, in
violation of the constitution.
   There was no immediate comment from Noriega, who has said he is
innocent of all charges against him.
   Delvalle said earlier that Col. Marcos Justines, the chief of
staff, would replace Noriega as head of the Defense Forces.
Thursday night, Justines said, ``I reject that order.''
   The police chief for the Defense Forces, flanked by colonels and
lieutenant colonels at the forces' central garrison, told
Panamanian TV no officer would replace Noriega.
   ``He (Delvalle) is going first,'' Col. Leonidas Macias said.
   ``None of us wants the (Panamanian military) command, the
commander stays, and we all stay. The president goes.''
   Justines, also at the garrison, told television reporters: ``We
have been conversing with him (Delvalle) constantly, and he knows
that our position has been that there is too much American
interference in this Panamanian affair.''
   ``We are not here denying or refusing this post because it's not
our place, because we have a commander _ commander Noriega,''
Justines added.
   The government's Radio Nacional called Panamanians to a Thursday
night rally supporting Noriega at a downtown park near the National
Palace, but apparently few people responded. Downtown streets were
nearly empty.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had issued a statement in
Washington Thursday saying,``We understand that President Delvalle
today dismissed Gen. Noriega from his position as commander of the
Panama Defense Forces.''
   ``At this time, we want to reiterate our unqualified support for
civilian constitutional rule in Panama.''
   Washington called for Noriega's resignation after U.S. grand
juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., indicted him and others on drug
trafficking charges Feb. 5.
   The indictments accuse Noriega of using his military position to
let Colombian drug traffickers use Panama as a base for smuggling
cocaine and marijuana into the United States. The charges said
Noriega received a healthy kickback from drug profits.
   The military command late Thursday ordered closure of Channel 5
television station, owned by Delvalle, said an employee who spoke
on condition of anonymity for security reasons.
   The opposition daily La Prensa also was closed by military
order, according to its news editor, Alfredo Jimenez. He said an
army officer arrived at the newspaper offices at 7:30 p.m. and
``told me we had 10 minutes to vacate the building.''
   Pentagon spokeswoman Capt. Nancy LaLuntas said in Washington
that the U.S. Southern Command in Panama received reports of
scattered demonstrations in and around Panama City. She said the
command issued a ``Bravo'' alert, which orders American military
personnel and dependents to ``decrease their visibility.''
   The command, initially created to protect the Panama Canal, has
become the center for U.S. military operations in Latin America
from fighting rebels to drug smugglers. There are 10,000 U.S.
soldiers and 20,000 dependents here.
   Delvalle said in a nationally broadcast message Thursday that he
asked Noriega days ago to step down voluntarily so an investigation
could begin of charges that he engaged in illicit activities. He
said Noriega refused.
   The president said, ``There is no other alternative but the use
of the powers that the constitution gives me, to separate Gen.
Noriega from his high command and to encharge the leadership of the
institution to the current chief of staff, Col. Marcos Justines.''
   Some drivers honked their horns shortly after Delvalle made his
announcement, and some groups could be seen waving white
handkerchiefs. Both are signs of protest used by Noriega's
opponents.
   Later, at his home, Delvalle told The Associated Press, ``I am
very calm, because I have had to take a very difficult decision,
having to do with a person (Noriega) with whom I have worked for
nearly two years, with a great deal of respect and consideration.
   ``However, his little will to take that decision ... which I
suggested to him, obligated me to take it for the health of this
country.''
   About 10 anti-riot police then arrived and remained on guard.
   In the evening, about 100 people _ relatives, friends and
journalists _ gathered at Delvalle's home.
   Earlier Thursday, Roman Catholic Archbishop Marcos Gregorio
McGrath visited Delvalle and commented, ``It seems to us that we
should give our support to President Delvalle. It is a step taken
after many consultations.''
   Delvalle smiled when reporters asked if he feared the military
would remove him from office. ``If good judgment doesn't prevail,
no president has the force to defy the arms that ... we entrusted
to them so that they might take care of us,'' he replied.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis showed up for a few minutes. ``My
presence here is to show my support to the government, because we
always have supported the civilian government and we are going to
continue doing so,'' he said.
   Asked if the U.S. government would recognize a replacement for
Delvalle, Davis replied: ``We cannot do that.''

   Panama's president risked challenging the authority
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega because he heard the ``outcry of the
people'' against the military strongman, says a leading Panamanian
exile.
   The Central American nation's legislative assembly removed
President Eric Arturo Delvalle and the vice president from office
during an emergency session early today.
   Roberto Eisenmann, 50-year-old exiled publisher of Panama's
leading independent newspaper, La Prensa, said earlier that either
way the power struggle went, ``Noriega will lose.''
   ``I don't think he will find any nation that would recognize his
government (in the event of a coup),'' said Eisenmann, who said his
newspaper was shut down Thursday by the military.
   Delvalle's decision to challenge Noriega was made after seven
weeks of negotiations here between the president and half a dozen
opposition leaders, participants in the talks told The Miami Herald
in a story published today.
   The last stage leading to the decision began in early January,
when the then-Panamanian consul to New York, Jose Blandon, met with
several opposition leaders in the home of former Panamanian
Ambassador and anti-Noriega crusader Gabriel Lewis Galindo in the
Miami suburb of Kendall.
   ``Blandon had just spent 10 hours with Delvalle in New York,''
Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian Democratic
Party, told the Herald. ``He told us the president was ready to
oust Noriega, but that he wanted to do that as of Aug. 12.''
   That date marked the fifth anniversary of Noriega's rise to the
helm of Panama's Defense Forces.
   But the opposition politicians told Delvalle that if Noriega was
given that much time, he would be able to regroup.
   On Feb. 16, the opposition counseled the president to go to
Washington, convene an emergency session of the Organization of
American States and announce Noriega's dismissal, the Herald
reported.
   A week ago Wednesday, Delvalle met with U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Elliott Abrams, whom he informed he would fire Noriega,
but in Panama, not in the United States.
   ``The thing that worked on him was the enormous outcry of the
people,'' Eisenmann told ABC's ``Nightline'' Thursday night.
``There was pressure from his family not to go down the tubes with
Noriega.''
   Noriega was indicted three weeks ago in Tampa and Miami on
federal charges of aiding drug smugglers, and has been under
pressure to step down as military chief.
   Gilbert Mallol, who directs the National Civic Crusade, a
Panamanian opposition coalition of 192 organizations, predicted
Thursday during a visit to Miami that Delvalle's move would force
Noriega into seizing power and remove the ``facade of democracy.''
   Mallol, a 32-year-old engineer, lived here in exile after
eluding military police and fleeing Panama last summer. His group
was accused last August of plotting against Noriega, but Mallol
recently had returned to Panama.
   A prosecutor in Noriega's drug case said he knew of no U.S. deal
to drop charges in order to encourage Delvalle to challenge the
military leader.
   Richard Gregorie, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Florida's
southern district, said if Noriega were to leave Panama, ``We would
attempt to extradite him like any other dope dealer.''
   The Feb. 4 indictments charge Noriega and 15 others with taking
at least $4.6 million in payoffs to protect shipments of Colombian
cocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drug
kingpins.
   The indictment also alleged that Noriega was allied with the
Medellin cartel, the organization reputed to supply much of the
cocaine in the United States, and once enlisted the help of Cuban
leader Fidel Castro to mediate a dispute with the cartel over drug
money.
   Castro, who was named in the indictment but not charged, angrily
denied the any role in an interview with NBC News aired Thursday
night.
   If Noriega is ever brought to trial and convicted of all
charges, he could face up to 145 years in prison and fines of more
than $1.1 million.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo has
proposed that a new round of peace talks between the leftist
Sandinista government and Contra rebels be held in Guatemala March
10-12.
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of Managua, who is mediating
efforts to establish a cease-fire, suggested the dates Thursday in
response to a letter from President Daniel Ortega.
   He made no reference to Ortega's request for three days of
negotiations beginning today and did not explain why he was
suggesting different dates.
   Obando y Bravo suspended the last round of negotiations Feb. 18
in Guatemala after presenting a proposal for breaking a deadlock
that arose in the talks' first hours.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco accused the cardinal,
Nicaragua's Catholic leader, of breaking off the talks before the
government could deliver its formal, conditional acceptance of the
proposal.
   In his letter, Obando y Bravo asked Ortega if the president's
letter of Tuesday was ``a rejection of the acceptance in principle
that your delegation belatedly gave'' to the proposal.
   There was no immediate response from the government to the March
dates or Obando y Bravo's letter.
   The cardinal said representatives of the Nicaraguan Resistance,
the umbrella group for the rebels, told him Thursday they ``are
willing to continue discussing the proposal the mediator made Feb.
18 in Guatemala.''
   The proposal asks the Contras to accept a 30-day truce in
exchange for four concessions they have long sought from the
government _ changes in the draft law, a complete amnesty, an
easing of press restrictions and a reopening of talks with the
internal political opposition.
   The cease-fire effort is part of a regional peace plan signed
Aug. 7 in Guatemala by Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala
and Costa Rica. It also calls for amnesties, democratic reforms and
an end to outside aid to insurgencies fighting in the region.
   The Reagan administration has supported the Contras' 6{-year-old
insurgency, which has claimed about 40,000 lives. But on Feb. 3,
the U.S. House of Representatives turned down a request for an
additional $36.2 million in Contra aid.

record, ``Amnistia.''
   ``It's a vehicle to get the word across to all the people who
haven't applied to let them know that they really should come out
of hiding,'' said the author, INS employee Art Zuniga.
   His Spanish song will be used in a stepped-up campaign the INS

residency to certain aliens as the May 4 deadline approaches.
   Zuniga, 38, who grew up in the lower Rio Grande Valley in a
family of farm workers and writes songs for a country-and-western
band, said he wrote the song because he understands people who come
to this country seeking work.
   ``Well, my friend, the time has come for those who have lived a
long time in the country inhabited by Americans,'' he sings in
Spanish. ``Recently, a law was passed. ... This opportunity will
not come again in your lifetime.''
   Two of the Valley's most popular Spanish stations already have

   A strong earthquake was recorded in the
southern Indian Ocean today but there were no reports of damage,
the Hong Kong Royal Observatory said.
   The quake was recorded at 2:30 p.m. and registered a preliminary
reading of 6.9 on the Richter scale, the observatory said.
   The epicenter was about 1,110 miles east-southeast of the South
African port city of Durban, it said. The observatory said it had
received no reports of tsunamis, or huge waves generated by
earthquakes at sea.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   An earthquake registering 7 is capable of widespread, heavy
damage in populated areas, but today's quake was centered far from
land.

   A 79-year-old who burst into a board
meeting at the retirement home that evicted him and gunned down
four former neighbors was in custody today, booked for
investigation of attempted murder.
   ``Apparently, they had a board meeting and one former resident,
who was apparently disgruntled, walked into the board room and
started shooting'' at the 15 or 16 people gathered there, said
police spokesman Dee Anderson.
   Gunfire from a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle wounded four
people and a fifth person suffered a heart attack in the 11 a.m.
attack Thursday at the Masonic Home for the Aged, authorities said.
   The wounded, treated for minor gunshot wounds, were listed in
fair condition today at Arlington Hospital, but the heart attack
victim was in critical condition, a hospital spokesman said.
   The suspect, whose name was not released, had lived at the
Masonic Home for three years, but was evicted in September 1987 for
breaking rules, officials said.
   The man burst into the monthly board meeting with two rifles,
one slung around his neck with twine, and opened fire. He fled to a
nearby kitchen and surrendered peacefully to police, who booked him
on investigative charges of attempted murder.
   At the Arlington Villa retirement home, where the suspect has
lived since Dec. 1, officials expressed shock.
   ``He is a good resident, very congenial and sociable,'' said
administrator Gennie Pace.
   Masonic home employees shut out all visitors and referred all
questions to board chairman Sam Hilburn, but refused to say where
he could be contacted.

<TEXT>
   A 98-year-old Oklahoma law stating that a
husband is head of the household and his wife must live where he
does is headed toward repeal in the state Legislature, but not
without debate.
   The bill to change the 1890 law was approved by the House 67-26
Thursday and moves to the Senate.
   ``I want to bring Oklahoma from the 19th century into the 20th
century before the 21st century gets here,'' said the bill's
sponsor, Rep. Freddie Williams.
   If the law were enforced, Mrs. Williams said, an appeals court
judge would have to step down from the bench because she lives on
one side of the state and and her husband lives on the other.
   Even so, opponents of repeal heatedly argued that the law is
based on biblical teachings about the family.
   ``I think there should be a difference between a man and a
woman, and when we get to where there's not a difference in it,
we're going to have all kinds of problems, whether it's war or what
it is,'' said Rep. Bill Smith.
   Rep. Leonard Sullivan contended he had ``never heard any lady''
call for repeal of the law.
   ``If it's not broke, don't fix it,'' Sullivan said. And ``if
it's not being enforced, why worry?''
   Rep. Ken Harris, a supporter of the bill, said, ``Even having to
argue about this bill is a sad, sad commentary.''
   Mrs. Williams and Harris pointed out that the law had been
declared unconstitutional by a former attorney general.
   Rep. John Monks said the attorney general who made the ruling
never married and ``never had the responsibility for a family.''

<HEAD>Dollar Lower In Moderate Trade, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in moderate European trading this
morning on indications the U.S. economy is expanding slower than
the market expected, dealers said.
   Gold prices were mixed in quiet trading.
   Dealers said economic data released in the past few days showed
the American economy slightly less robust than expected, weakening
the dollar.
   ``The data has made dealers a little more selling oriented,''
said one trader with a U.S. commercial bank in Milan.
   Dealers noted the dollar had been moving higher since
mid-February, after the report that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed
in December for the second consecutive month.
   But recent economic data disappointed the market, especially
Thursday's report that the U.S. gross national product grew by 4.5
percent in the fourth quarter, lower than market expectations of a
5 percent rise, dealers said.
   As a result, traders said, the market feared the U.S. trade gap
might not be shrinking quickly enough, eroding sentiment for the
dollar.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 128.35 yen, down from 128.80 yen on Thursday.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 128.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates:
   _ 1.6895 West German marks, down from 1.6945
   _ 1.3895 Swiss francs, down from 1.3935
   _ 5.7165 French francs, down from 5.7315
   _ 1.89595 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9020
   _ 1,244.00 Italian lire, down from 1,248.25
   _ 1.2649 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2650
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7715 from $1.7665 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $434.20 a troy ounce. At
midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $$432.65. Both were up from late Thursday's
428.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $432.60, down from $433.00 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 88 cents to close at a bid
437.23.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.21 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's 6.15.

   She soared west across the Atlantic on a
celebrated dare 52 years ago, and then fell into obscurity.
   But decades after flier Beryl Markham was forgotten, Hollywood
is showing a renewed interest in the heroine. Several movies of her
wildly adventurous life are underway or planned, including a
four-hour CBS-TV special starring Stefanie Powers, and at least two
feature-length films.
   In 1986, public television presented the film, ``World Without
Walls: Beryl Markham's African Memoir,'' shortly after her death at
the age of 83. The movie reconstructed her life from old film
footage and interviews with her gossipy contemporaries in Kenya,
where she once hunted barefoot with African friends.
   ``She represented some kind of magical-like past, something that
a woman did but that can't ever be done again because the world in
which that took place is gone,'' said George Gutekunst, who
rediscovered Markham's memoirs, ``West With the Night,'' and helped
get them republished in 1983.
   The book chronicled her Kenyan childhood and historic flight.
Praised by Ernest Hemingway as ``bloody wonderful,'' it became a
best seller in both Britain and the United States when it was
republished. ``She's caught the imagination of much of this country
and the world since then,'' Gutekunst said.
   Gutekunst met Markham in Kenya before her death. With his
partner, Albert del Masso, he later secured movie rights to the
book.
   In some cities, such as San Francisco, fascination with Markham
approaches cult status, according to Berniece Green, a New York
publicist for CBS, which in January began filming in Africa on
``Beryl Markham: Shadow on the Sun.''
   Markham was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in England,
and was brought to Kenya at age 4 by her divorced father, retired
British Army Capt. Charles B. Clutterbuck, who purchased a farm.
She learned to fly and became a bush pilot.
   By 1936, several planes had successfully crossed the Atlantic
westward from Europe. But all the aircraft had at least two people
aboard. Markham, in a single-engine Percival Gull monoplane,
departed Britain's Abingdon Royal Air Force aerodrome on Sept. 4,
1936. Low fuel forced her to land in a bog in Nova Scotia. She
later received a ticker tape parade in New York, her original goal.
   She had less than four years of formal education but said her
father made her read widely. Later, she was given a crash course in
literature and music by an Oxford-educated aristocrat and
professional hunter, Denys Finch-Hatton, the lover of the Danish
writer Karen Blixen, whose pen name was Isak Dinesen. The Academy
Award-winning movie, ``Out of Africa,'' was based on Blixen's life.
Markham was apparently Finch-Hatton's last love.
   Markham's poetic account of her childhood and famed flight was
largely ignored when first published in 1942. But following its
re-release and then her death, the book's sales soared. It has been
on the New York Times best-sellers list since November 1986,
according to North Point Press.
   In 1936, Markham became the first person to fly solo
east-to-west across the Atlantic, accepting a challenge from
England's Lord John Carberry. She had grown up in Kenya with Masai
children, become a winning horse trainer and also one of the
continent's premier ``bush pilots.''
   Kenya in the 1920s and '30s was a haven for titled Europeans,
and Markham _ who spent much of her youth hunting wild boar and
fending off lions _ lived with them. She took up thoroughbred
training to support herself at 17 when her bankrupt father
immigrated to Peru.
   CBS' story, based on English journalist James Fox's book,
``White Mischief,'' will portray Markham's three failed marriages,
affairs with fliers Finch-Hatton and Tom Campbell Black and her
years in Santa Barbara, where she taught flying for Paramount
Pictures.
   Actress-producer Diane Baker of Artemis Productions, which
optioned the movie rights to Markham's book from Gutekunst and
Masso, said her company plans to begin filming ``West With the
Night'' in Kenya in June.
   Nelson Films plans to film ``The Lives of Beryl Markham'' this
fall. It is based on a book by Errol Trzbinsky to be published next
year, according to producer Anthony Rufus-Isaacs, who knew Markham
in Africa.
   No stars have been named for either film project.
   Lindsay Wagner has optioned Mary Lovell's 1986 biography of
Markham, ``Straight On Till Morning,'' for a possible leading role
for the actress, according to St. Martin's Press.
   Markham's ``amazing freedom'' in the African outback is what
captivates people, said Lovell in a telephone interview from her
home in England.
   An accountant who quit her job to travel to Kenya to meet
Markham, Lovell found the flier in 1985 living in a tiny house
outside Nairobi at a track where she had trained some of Kenya's
greatest race champions.
   ``Here was a woman who I found had lived the way we all would
have if we had the courage,'' she said.

   A top American wine merchant was killed
in a two-car collision near Siena, the U.S. consulate said today.
   Louis Iacucci, 52, of the New York City borough of Queens, was
taken Wednesday evening to a hospital in Siena, where he died four
hours later of abdominal injuries, a consulate official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition her name not be used,
quoted a Siena police report.
   Iacucci, an authority on Italian wines, owned Goldstar Wine and
Spirits in Forest Hills, Queens. He was on a trip from Grosseto to
Siena, two wine-producing areas in the province of Tuscany. The
other driver, an Italian, was unhurt, the consulate said.

   As a lawyer and vice president of W.C. Fields
Productions, Everett F. Fields has sound economic reasons to be
worried about products that make unauthorized use of W.C. Fields'
name and image.
   As a grandson, he told state legislators Thursday, he finds the
merchandising of W.C. Fields' legacy to be ``very offensive ...
personally.''
   Fields joined the sons of Clark Gable and John Wayne in
supporting a bill that would give them exclusive rights to the
commercial use of their dead relatives' names.
   ``I think that my father's public image was his most valuable
asset,'' said Michael Wayne, son of the screen star and president
of John Wayne Enterprises. ``The most important thing for us _ the
Wayne family _ is to control how the John Wayne image is used.''
   John Clark Gable, a 26-year-old pickup-truck racer from Los
Angeles, became angry as he cited a greeting card that depicted his
late father in an embrace with another man.
   ``The guy that (created) that, I'd like to tear his head off,''
Gable said following his appearance at the legislative hearing.
   Other examples that were cited at the hearing included a Spanish
cigarette billboard showing Wayne, a heavy smoker who died of lung
cancer, smoking a cigarette; Albert Einstein party favors; a
Sigmund Freud cookbook; and ``Dead Marilyn,'' a male rock singer
who dresses to resemble Marilyn Monroe.
   The bill being considered would ban any unauthorized commercial
use of the name or image of dead celebrities, but wouldn't prohibit
``accurate'' biographies, news accounts or parodies of stars.
Proponents said it would simply give heirs the same protection that
celebrities enjoy while they are alive.
   The measure was opposed by representatives of magazine and
newspaper publishers, television and radio stations and advertising
agencies. The opponents said the measure is unnecessary and it
would be difficult to determine which uses of a celebrity's name
were legitimate.
   ``The problem is, the cure is worse than the disease,'' said
Richard Winfield, a lawyer for Time Inc.
   Jerome Wilson, another attorney representing Time, suggested
that the heirs of Al Capone would be able to sue for some of the
proceeds of ``The Untouchables,'' the movie in which Capone was a
major figure.
   Similar laws have been enacted in eight states, including
California, and have been established by precedent in two others,
New Jersey and Georgia, according to J. Thomas McCarthy, a law
professor from the University of San Francisco who testified at the
hearing.
   McCarthy said there have been no challenges to the
constitutionality of the other states' laws, although he said there
have been some successful challenges to specific applications of
the laws.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo approved a
sweeping amnesty today for 1,731 political dissidents and labor
activists to demonstrate his determination to build a democratic
government.
   A time bomb was found today in a U.S. government building in the
southern city of Kwangju and police said radical students planted
the device.
   The bomb was found in the public library of the U.S. Information
Service and people in the building were evacuated while army bomb
experts were brought in to defuse the device, U.S. diplomats said.
Police said the device was faulty.
   Five students armed with homemade bombs and knives briefly
seized the service's library in Seoul on Wednesday and detonated
two of the devices before being overpowered by police. Nobody was
hurt in the attack.
   Roh approved the freeing from prison or restoration of civil
rights to the dissidents after meeting with his Cabinet for the
first time since he was sworn into office Thursday. The government
said the measure was designed to build public trust.
   ``The government wants all the people to join in building
democracy,'' said Information Minister Chung Han-mo after
announcing the measure.
   The political and labor cases were included in an amnesty for
7,234 people, most of them convicted of ordinary criminal offenses.
   It was not immediately clear how many of the dissidents were
still in prison, but it appeared many have been released in earlier
amnesties. Those still in prison were to be freed Saturday.
   But several imprisoned prominent dissident leaders, including
Kim Kun-tae and Chang Ki-pyo, were not to be released because of
their role in violent protests, according to Korean news reports.
   Opposition groups contend about 1,500 people are being held for
political offenses.
   The amnesty did not affect people still awaiting trial on
political charges.
   The measure restores the civil rights of many prominent
dissidents who lost them after serving jail sentences for
anti-government activity. Loss of civic rights bans citizens from
politics.
   Roh's announcement, which had been expected, came after the two
main opposition parties agreed to reunite following months of
bitter quarreling and present a united front to the new government.
   Officials of the Reunification Democratic Party and the Party
for Peace and Democracy announced they had reached agreement on
reuniting the parties that split in October.
   Party officials said a convention is scheduled by March 5 to
formally reunite the groups. Committees representing both sides
start work today on ironing out remaining differences, they said.
   Elections for National Assembly seats are to take place by April.
   Roh was formally inaugurated Thursday as the country's sixth
president, succeding Chun Doo-hwan.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
Thursday, ``We welcome Korea's first peacetime transfer of power in
recent times, and congratulate President Roh on his inauguration.''
   The two opposition parties split after opposition leaders Kim
Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung failed to reach agreement over who would
run for president in elections last December.
   Roh won the election with 36.6 percent of the vote after the two
Kims split the opposition vote.
   The opposition claimed after the Dec. 16 election that Roh had
won through massive vote fraud and said they would not recognize
his government. But many Koreans rejected the fraud claims, instead
blaming the two Kims for splitting opposition support out of
personal ambition.
   About 1,000 workers went on strike today at South Korea's
largest ship engine plant, protesting a company decision banning
election of a militant union leader, company officials said.
   Officials of Hyundai Engine and Machinery Co. said their plant
in Ulsan, 185 miles southeast of Seoul, stopped production
following the strike which began early today.
   Hyundai Engine is a subsidiary of the Hyundai group, one of the
largest business conglomerates in South Korea.

   A former firefighter who helped
authorities battle a $6.5 million series of fires in two churches
and the elementary school he once attended has confessed to setting
the blazes, authorities said.
   Okanogan County Prosecutor Jack Burchard planned to file six
counts of first-degree arson today against Adrian J. Howe, 23, who
was ordered held on $250,000 bail. Each count carries a maximum
sentence of life in prison and a $50,000 fine.
   The fires, which did an estimated $6.5 million damage, began in
December when Omak North Elementary School was hit twice within
eight days. Two Omak churches and a church house also were burned
in one week earlier this month.
   Burchard and Sheriff Jim Weed said there was no apparent motive
for the fires. Investigators have no reason to believe Howe, a high
school dropout, had any animosity toward his elementary school,
Burchard said.
   Howe reported the first blaze Dec. 6 at the elementary school,
helped set up barricades at a Dec. 14 fire, and was seen by police
at three other blazes, Burchard told Superior Court Judge James R.
Thomas.
   Howe lived in a trailer court across the street from the school
in December, then moved to an apartment across from one of the
churches before the February fires, Burchard said.
   He was arrested by investigators of a special 12-member arson
task force Wednesday and confessed to all six fires, Burchard told
Thomas.
   A lifelong resident of Omak in central Washington, Howe was
employed at a lumber mill on the Colville Indian Reservation and
fought range fires for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in past summers.
   Friends who knew Howe from several bars he frequented described
him as a loner who used to get into fights. But they said they
didn't believe Howe was responsible for the fires.
   ``I don't think that he had anything to do with it,'' said Brian
Marbach, a friend for 19 years. ``He'd be the last person I'd ever
think would do something like that.''
   Howe recently had been trying to reconcile with a girlfriend by
whom he had a daughter, about 2 years old, Marbach said.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's impeachment
prosecutors, brought together in a shotgun marriage of Republican
and Democratic politics, say they are working well together on the
case to remove the governor from office.
   Attorney William French said he didn't expect to be teamed with
another lawyer, particularly one he'd never worked with, when House
Speaker Joe Lane, a Republican, hired him in October to look into
allegations against Mecham, also a Republican.
   French, 56, was joined by co-counsel Paul Eckstein, 47, after
House Minority Leader Art Hamilton insisted that French could not
be expected to represent Democratic interests because he was hired
by the Republicans.
   French, a former U.S. Justice Department attorney and Maricopa
County Superior Court judge, has also been accused of bias because
he is a registered Democrat who signed a Mecham recall petition. He
maintains he is largely apolitical.
   Eckstein is managing partner of a law firm that represents
Arizona's First Amendment Coalition, a journalism rights advocacy
organization. Until recently he chaired Democrat Carolyn Warner's
campaign against Mecham in the May 17 recall election.
   The two men, who took the Arizona bar exam at the same time in
1965, say they will draw on each other's strengths and rely on
methodical hard work to prepare for Arizona's first gubernatorial
impeachment trial Monday.
   Mecham was accused by the House of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund
by lending it to his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official.
   Mecham also faces a March 22 criminal trial on charges of hiding
the $350,000 loan. He has denied any wrongdoing.
   French said he and Eckstein have had no major conflicts.
   ``I think we sort of sized each other up to see if we were going
to play it straight,'' French said. ``And within a matter of hours
I was satisfied that the politics had been left outside of the
door.''
   Their courtroom manner _ French, precise of speech both in word
selection and in timing for dramatic impact, and Eckstein typically
dry as he worked in French's shadow _ has contrasted sharply with
the combative, theatrical style often shown by Mecham attorney
Murray Miller.
   But Lane noted, ``we have not seen them under any stress
situations. It's going to be interesting when it gets really hot''
during the Senate trial.
   Both lawyers say they are ready to start the trial and figure
they're as well-equipped to handle it as anyone would be. ``There
aren't any `impeachment lawyers' around,'' Eckstein said.
   He said he probably will defer to French on some matters because
his elder partner was on the case first.
   French ``does bring the experience of a judge,'' but has a
relative lack of experience in politics and dealing with the media,
Eckstein said.
   Despite the political nature of the trial, Eckstein added,
``it's just practicing the law in a careful, workmanlike way.''
   ``We're trying to try it as if you would try it in the
courthouse,'' French said. He said the lawyers have had no contact
with the 30 senators, who essentially are serving as judges and
jurors in the case.
   French has been receiving state police protection since his law
office was damaged in an arson fire a week before he made the
report that led to Mecham's impeachment.
   Mecham was impeached Feb. 5 on a 46-16 House vote, forcing him
to temporarily hand over power to Secretary of State Rose Mofford,
a Democrat. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required
to remove him from office permanently.

   A construction worker who underwent a
rare procedure in which his severed hand was attached to his
abdomen until doctors could sew it back on his arm says the
technique might help other people even if it doesn't work for him.
   After Mike Thomas' left hand was ripped off when he grabbed a
cable in a 70-foot fall from a girder last November, doctors used a
vein from his leg to attach the hand to an artery in his abdomen to
try to keep the tissue alive.
   Two weeks ago, they put the hand back on his arm.
   ``If it doesn't work, at least they know they can put a hand on
an abdomen and maybe use the procedure'' to help someone else,
Thomas, 31, said Thursday before leaving University Hospital for
his home in Cleveland, Ala.
   The procedure has been done twice before in Yugoslavia, once
successfully. Hospital spokesman Hank Black said doctors at the
hospital knew of no other such procedure in this country.
   Thomas' doctors said it will be months before he knows whether
he has any feeling in the hand, but the worker said that was not
what mattered.
   ``The hand was a minor detail when I first fell because I was
worried about living,'' said Thomas, who suffered internal injuries
in the fall.
   ``I have no feeling in the hand now, but the blood supply is
fine,'' he said. ``It will be six months to a year before I know
whether I have any feeling.''
   Thomas said he became accustomed to the hand not being there
``and now I've got to get used to it being back.''
   In reattaching the hand, the doctors connected two nerves, with
another operation needed to restore a third nerve.
   One of the physicians, Paul Sauer, said a therapist will work on
the hand twice a week for a few months.
   ``I have to keep the hand exercised,'' Thomas said, ``and
protect my arm like it was a child.'' His bandaged hand is in a
sling.
   He said one of his first priorities was to get some barbecue.
Later, he said, he wants his doctors to visit Blount County so he
can ``introduce them to farm life and take them bass fishing.''
   Another doctor, Michael Chernofsky, said that Thomas and his
wife, Loretta, had maintained a positive attitude and a sense of
humor.
   ``He is very lucky to be alive,'' Chernofsky said. ``The hand is
icing on the cake. He has done extremely well, and we're hopeful
things will continue in that trend.
   ``We have great hopes for Mr. Thomas. He promised to take us
fishing.''

   South African air attacks and heavy
artillery fire have killed hundreds of civilians in southern Angola
over the past week, the Angolan defense ministry said today.
   A statement reported by the official Angolan news agency ANGOP
said women and children were among several hundred civilians killed
by South African strikes around four southern towns. The ANGOP
report was monitored in Lisbon.
   South Africa's military headquarters, which says its recent
bombardments and air strikes have been aimed at military targets,
described the Angolan claim as ``blatant propaganda.''
   ANGOP said three South African Mirage war planes were shot down
between Sunday and Wednesday during the attacks in the southern
provinces of Cunene and Cuando Cubango. South Africa has confirmed
the loss of one plane.
   Residential areas close to the towns of Cuito Cuanavale, Onjiva,
Cuvelai and Mulondo were bombed by South African aircraft,
inflicting severe material damage along with the casualties, the
defense ministry said.
   It said long-range G-5 artillery pieces also were used to shell
Angolan army positions around Cuito Cuanavale, a strategic garrison
for the Angolan government's offensive against the South
African-backed rebel movement UNITA.
   South African aircraft on Thursday also began bombing the
outskirts of the city of Lubango, in Huila province, north of
Cunene, the ministry added.
   The statement said the attacks were part of a South African
operation aimed at cutting off supply routes to Cuito Cuanvale and
Onjiva, ANGOP reported.
   Angola accuses South Africa of engaging in a major military
incursion and occupying large areas of southern Angola to support
UNITA, the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola.
   The rebels, also supported by the United States, have been
fighting since 1975 to force Angola's Soviet- and Cuban-backed
government to share power.
   South African war planes struck Saturday at Lubango and Onjiva
in what it said were Angola bases of the South-West African
People's Organization, a guerrilla organization fighting for the
independence of neighboring South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   South Africa said the attacks were in retaliation for a bomb the
day before, allegedly carried out by SWAPO, that killed 23 people
at a Namibian bank.

<HEAD>Cancer Researcher Toned Down After Tobacco Company Donations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A researcher who conducted some of the
earliest studies linking cigarettes to cancer was muffled by his
superiors about the time a tobacco company began making donations
to his institute, according to a confidential document released in
a cigarette liability trial.
   In the document, a top Philip Morris Co. executive also praised
the director of the Sloan-Kettering Institute, a leading medical
research center, for expressing ``his doubt that smoking is
implicated'' in causing cancer.
   The opinion of the director, Dr. Frank Horsfall Jr., was
``beneficial'' to the industry, according to the Nov. 23, 1964,
memo, which was released Thursday in federal court here.
   Morris decided to contribute $25,000 to the New York cancer
research institute Nov. 8, 1962, and made $25,000 donations the
following two years, according to the memo written by James C.
Bowling, who was identified in court as an assistant to the
company's chairman.
   ``Substantial contributions'' from five other tobacco companies
followed, the memo said.
   In the fall of 1962, Horsfall and other institute officials
began subjecting the researcher, Ernst Wynder, to a ``more rigorous
screening procedure before letting him speak in the name of the
Institute,'' the memo said.
   ``This has had a proper and pleasing effect,'' Bowling's memo
said.
   Wynder, one of the first researchers to demonstrate that smoking
leads to tumors on mice, was a leading anti-smoking advocate, the
memo said.
   The memo did not say that Horsfall's attitude or Wynder's
``screening'' was a reason for the contributions.
   Marc Z. Edell, an attorney representing Antonio Cipollone,
introduced the document and about a dozen others in an attempt to
show that tobacco companies treated early studies of smoking's
effect on health as a public relations problem.
   In addition, Edell said the companies performed or sponsored
research to deflect charges that smoking caused cancer and other
health problems.
   Edell maintains that Philip Morris Co., Lorillard Inc. and
Liggett Group Inc. were liable for the death of Cipollone's wife.
Rose Cipollone smoked brands made by the three companies for 40
years before she died at 58 in 1984.
   Edell contends the companies were liable for her disease by
failing to do enough research, tell customers what they knew or put
a safer product on the market.
   He introduced the documents Thursday while questioning Morris'
former president and chairman emeritus Joseph F. Cullman III for a
third day.
   The tobacco industry viewed itself as waging ``war'' against
opponents of smoking who linked cigarettes to health hazards in the
1960s, according to another document.
   That Feb. 12, 1963 memo from the scientific director of a
tobacco research group to a public relations official spoke of
``two `fronts' in our war.''
   The memo identified those fronts as activity by the American
Cancer Society and Britain's Royal College of Physicians, and a
study by the surgeon general, Edell said.
   Both the American Cancer Society and the Royal College of
Physicians were concerned about the health effects of smoking, and
the surgeon general published a report citing the dangers of
cigarettes in 1964.

<HEAD>Hampshire College Occupation Continues; MIT Students Submit
Demands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Hampshire College denied
agreeing to the demands of students who took over an office to
protest alleged indifference to racial issues, while black students
at MIT submitted a list of demands to officials there.
   About 50 black graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in Cambridge surprised President Paul Gray on
Thursday with the list at an informal regular session held by the
school's head.
   Among the demands were calls for regular meetings between campus
minority groups and administrators and for a statement condemning
racist graffiti that appeared near the black graduate student
lounge more than a year ago.
   In western Massachusetts, meanwhile, more talks were scheduled
today between Hampshire College President Adele Simmons and
representatives of black, Hispanic, Inian and other minority
students holding a dormitory office.
   An estimated 40 students took over the Dakin House office
Tuesday to protest what they alleged to be the administration's
indifference to their concerns. Their demands included the hiring
of a racial harassment officer and a policy statement condemning
racism.
   Spokesmen for the protesters described Thursday's talks as
``active'' but said no decisions were made in the meeting.
   ``The administration has agreed in principle. However, further
negotiations are necessary before we are satisfied,'' according to
a statement read by student Sydney Deberry, 19.
   Simmons denied agreeing to the students' demands, but said they
were justified in feeling frustrated. ``They are right in
suggesting we need to move their concerns higher up in our
priorities,'' the president said.
   She said some of the demands, such as a call for a policy on
racial harassment, have been in the works for several months. ``The
timetable will be moved up a bit because of this,'' she said.
   In Cambridge, the MIT students also demanded that Gray apologize
for his ``self-admitted inadequate performance'' in minority
recruitment and appoint a black vice president.
   ``When will we get a formal apology from you for admitting your
failures?'' asked Ron Francis, co-chairman of the Black Graduate
Student Association.
   Gray responded: ``I didn't come here to be harassed.''
   The president acknowledged, however, that ``MIT needs to take a
greater part in enabling pluralism. ... I'm not satisifed in the
measured levels of black undergrads here nor am I satisfied in the
measured levels of black faculty here.''
   He agreed to meet with a smaller group in two to three weeks to
discuss the demands.
   Earlier this month, students occupied a building at the
University of Massachusetts for six days to protest racial violence
at that campus. The occupation ended Feb. 17 when Chancellor Joseph
D. Duffey reached agreeement with protesters on such demands as
increased resources for Third World programs.

<TEXT>
   A music promoter allegedly bribed radio
station employees with cash and cocaine to get his records on the
air, according to a federal payola indictment, lawyers said.
   Federal agents arrested Ralph Tashjian, 39, of San Mateo and his
wife, Valerie, in front of their children at their home Thursday,
said Anthony Brooklier, the promoter's Los Angeles attorney.
   Tashjian allegedly paid nearly $42,000 in cash and gave
undisclosed quantities of cocaine to three radio station workers
from 1980 to 1985 in exchange for air time for his records,
Brooklier said. The stations were in Fresno and El Paso, Texas.
   The indictment handed up by a Los Angeles federal grand jury
Thursday was announced by Brooklier and David Kenner, the
Tashjians' attorneys, who said their clients are innocent.
   ``We absolutely deny any wrongdoing on the Tashjians' part,''
Brooklier said. ``They were arrested at their home, in front of
their children, even though we had offered to surrender them (to
authorities).''
   The indictment charges Tashjian with three counts of payola, one
count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, one count of obstruction
of justice and three counts of corporate income-tax fraud,
Brooklier said.
   Mrs. Tashjian was arrested for alleged corporate tax evasion.
They both face arraignment today in San Francisco, Brooklier said.
   Federal prosecutors at the Justice Department's Organized Crime
Strike Force in Los Angeles, which is handling the case, withheld
announcement of the indictment.
   Tashjian is an associate of Joseph Isgro, a Los Angeles-based
record promoter who has been investigated by the grand jury but
wasn't named in the indictment.
   Tashjian worked out of Isgro's Los Angeles office, but for his
own company, Ralph Tashjian Enterprises Inc.
   The payola investigation began in 1986, with reputed organized
crime figure Salvatore James Pisello, 64, of West Hollywood,
charged in July with three counts of tax evasion. His case is
pending.

<HEAD>Pianist Who Exported The Blues Dead At 72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Memphis Slim, the blues pianist who wrote ``Every
Day I Have the Blues'' and helped spread blues music throughout the
world, died at the age of 72, hospital official said today.
   An official at Necker Hospital in Paris, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Memphis Slim, whose real name was Peter Chatman,
died Wednesday. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   Memphis Slim was born in Memphis, Tenn., on Sept. 3, 1915, and
made his name in Chicago in the 1930s.
   He had lived in Europe since 1961, mostly in Paris where he
played frequently at ``Les Trois Maillets'' and other jazz clubs.
   ``He was one of the originals,'' said Mike Zwerin, a Paris-based
author on jazz and blues music. ``He took blues to the rest of the
world.''
   A wake, open to the public, was scheduled Monday at the
hospital, with funeral services planned later in the week in
Memphis.
   Memphis Slim recorded at least 40 albums during his career on
many labels, including ``Raining the Blues'' and ``The Bluesman.''
   Among his songs were ``Wish Me Well,'' ``Mother Earth'' and
``Beer-drinking Woman.''
   Memphis Slim was among the most well-traveled bluesmen,
attracting international attention with his performance at the 1959
Newport festival.
   He owned a series of Rolls-Royce cars, and was known for
double-parking them outside Paris clubs, where he would stop in for
an hour or two.
   The Paris daily Le Monde said Friday that Memphis Slim's music
``always had powerful expression and irresistable subtlety.''
   ``Until the 1970s, Memphis Slim represented blues to
Europeans,'' Zwerin said. ``He was the only blues man they ever
saw.''
   Many American jazz and blues greats moved to Europe in the 1950s
and 1960s because their music, although created in America, was
more popular in the old world than in the new.
   Memphis Slim, however, often returned to the United States to
play. He was a regular fixture at the Chicago Blues Festival and
other blues gatherings.

   A widely used pair of antibiotics prevented a
deadly form of pneumonia in a group of 30 AIDS patients, while more
than half of the patients in a similar untreated group came down
with it, researchers reported today.
   This dramatic success in preventing one of the leading causes of
death among AIDS patients is not a cure for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, but could prolong the lives of AIDS sufferers,
said the study's principal author, Dr. Margaret Fischl of the
University of Miami School of Medicine.
   ``Any individual that is symptomatic with HIV (the AIDS virus)
should be considered for intervention with low-dose antibiotics to
prevent Pneumocystis,'' said Fischl. ``It's easily available. It's
not expensive.''
   Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia strikes more than half of AIDS
patients, and ``15 percent to 25 percent of individuals will die
with it even when it's recognized and treated,'' she said.
   In a separate development, the anti-AIDS drug AZT was shown to
lower virus levels and improve immune systems in more than
two-thirds of 18 otherwise healthy AIDS carriers, according to a
study done at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
   And, a University of Chicago researcher announced that he had
synthesized a peptide _ a compound of amino acids _ that imitates
part of the AIDS virus and triggered antibodies to neutralize the
virus in rabbits.
   Fischl prevented Pneumocystis with a pair of sulfa drugs called
trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, marketed under a variety of
trade names including Bactrim and Septra. They are used for kidney
infections, bladder infections, traveler's diarrhea and, at high
doses, for treatment of Pneumocystis in AIDS victims, she said.
   After three years, Pneumocystis had not struck any of the
treated group of 30 patients who had Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin
cancer, but had not had any of the so-called opportunistic
infections _ including Pneumocystis _ that strike AIDS patients,
Fischl reported.
   In a control group of 30 untreated AIDS patients, 16 got
Pneumocystis, she said. A report of the findings appears today in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   When the experiment concluded, 42 percent of the treated group
was still alive, compared with only 10 percent of the untreated
group, Fischl said.
   That was clear evidence that the preventive treatment was
prolonging lives, but exactly how long it might prolong life could
not be determined, she said.
   Half of the treated patients suffered from side effects,
including nausea, vomiting, itching, redness of the skin and fever.
   The results of the Dutch study on AZT, reported in the Feb. 20
issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal, were described as
promising. But they fall short of what doctors would need to
recommend that healthy AIDS virus carriers begin taking AZT to
prevent AIDS, Dr. Samuel Broder, the director of AIDS drug testing
at the National Cancer Institute, said Thursday.
   Nevertheless, Broder said, it suggests that a recently initiated
American study of AZT in healthy carriers ``needs to proceed
urgently.''
   ``It's very important not to rush out and start using AZT in a
situation in which its use has not been proven,'' Broder said. He
noted that AZT can have life-threatening side effects.
   The study found that levels of the AIDS virus ``declined
significantly'' in 13 of 18 men who had longstanding AIDS virus
infections but no symptoms of AIDS.
   Levels of white blood cells called T4 cells _ which are a
necessary component of the immune system and are killed by the AIDS
virus _ rose in 14 of the 18 subjects. No serious side effects were
observed, said the study's authors: Frank de Wolf, Jan van der
Noordaa and others from the University of Amsterdam, The
Netherlands.
   The aim of such studies is ultimately to determine whether AZT
might prevent or delay the development of AIDS in healthy carriers,
or reduce its severity.
   Based on their results, the Dutch team said ``prevention of more
serious HIV-related disease may be feasible.'' HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus, is the virus responsible for AIDS.
   Enlarged lymph nodes are a common sign of AIDS infection. The
researchers reported ``striking regression of lymph node sizes'' in
patients given AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir.
   As of Feb. 18, 1,158 subjects had been enrolled in a nationwide
trial of AZT in healthy AIDS carriers in the United States, said
Sandra Hecker, spokeswoman for the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., which is coordinating the
trial.
   The study is aiming for about 1,500 volunteers and is expected
to last about three years, she said.
   In the research by University of Chicago assistant professor
Mark Gurney, rabbits given the synthetic peptide produced three
antibodies against the compound. Scientists then exposed these
antibodies to several strains of the HIV virus in test tubes, and
Gurney said the HIV virus was neutralized, or prevented from
spreading to other cells.
   A report on the research appeared today in Science, the journal
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Gurney cautioned that the peptide-antibody response is not well
understood now and that experiments in the past have shown that
synthetic peptides can trigger undesirable antibodies, only a small
number of which will attack the target.
   Until this process is further refined, he said, peptides will
not be useful against AIDS.

   Demonstrators continued to occupy the
University of Dayton president's office early today, demanding an
end to Central Intelligence Agency recruiting on campus.
   Brother Raymond L. Fitz, president of the Roman Catholic school,
met with members of the Democratic Socialists of America and
Plowshares for Peace in the office for about 90 minutes during the
night to hear their demands.
   About 50 members of the groups took over the office shortly
after 10 a.m. Thursday, but the number had dwindled to 30 by this
morning, university spokeswoman Valerie Galloway Elijah said.
   She said another eight students were outside holding up signs
and a few were standing at the end of a stairwell and blocked by
university officials from joining the demonstrators.
   Jon Wentz, co-chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America,
described Thursday night's meeting as ``very positive. Brother Fitz
was very cooperative with us.''
   He said they talked about establishing a forum on the CIA and
that the students demanded a one-year moratorium on any CIA
recruitment.
   ``We seem to be very confident that we will get that
moratorium,'' Wentz said. ``We're not going to leave until we are
guaranteed there is a moratorium.''
   Fitz said he would have to talk with his vice presidents and
faculty before he could commit the school to a moratorium. He also
said he was not yet committed to a forum and expected to meet again
with the students later today.
   Fitz would not say whether he would order the students removed.
   William C. Schuerman, dean of the school, met with student
representatives for about an hour Thursday evening.
   ``I think we've been very clear that we're offering the students
an opportunity to discuss the issues they're raising,'' Schuerman
said. ``What we're not prepared to do is to meet the demands
they've indicated.''
   The CIA was recruiting at the nearby Kennedy Union on campus,
but a statement issued by the protesters said they did not appear
there because they did not want to infringe on the rights of
students to interview with the agency.
   The students had been told they had to leave by 4:30 p.m.
Thursday or they would face charges. Schuerman said they were
allowed to stay past that deadline to avoid provoking them.
   Those who remained at St. Mary's Hall were charged with
disruption under the student conduct code and later would be
charged with trespassing under the code, spokeswoman Teri Rizvi
said. Penalties could range from a token fine to expulsion, she
said.
   The protesters demanded that if university organizations invite
the CIA to recruit, even off campus, the school should provide a
mandatory course for those seeking CIA jobs that would detail
alleged atrocities committed by the agency.

   The chief U.S. delegate to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission, former Cuban political prisoner Armando Valladares,
today rejected Cuban allegations that he lied about being
mistreated in Cuban prisons.
   ``They have had a disinformation campaign against me since
before I left prison,'' Valladares told a news conference.
   The Cuban government Wednesday distributed information in
Geneva, Washington and Mexico City saying Valladares had been a
police officer under the Batista government and that he had been
arrested and jailed in 1961 because he belonged to a terrorist
organization.
   Valladares and the U.S. State Department deny that he was a
police officer, and maintain that he was arrested and sentenced to
30 years in prison for making anti-communist statements.
   Valladares served 22 years of his sentence before being released
after the intervention of French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Since his release, he has spoken out about what he says are
human rights violations in Cuba, in particular torture and inhumane
treatment of prisoners.
   Valladares told the press conference that the Cuban government
resorted to personal attacks against him because ``they are not
able to deny the accusations'' of human rights violations. He spoke
in Spanish, and his remarks were translated into English.
   The Cuban deputy foreign minister, Raul Roa Kouri, said at a
press conference Wednesday that Valladares was lying when he said
he was mistreated in prison.
   Valladares, asked about Kouri's statement, showed reporters
scars on his hands which he said were from rat bites, and took one
reporter's hand and ran it along his head where he said he had a
scar from being beaten.
   The United States on Thursday submitted a resolution for the
second year in a row attempting to get the commission to examine
alleged human rights violations in Cuba.
   This year's resolution appears to be worded more softly than
last year's, which was blocked by one vote, and Valladares said he
was optimistic that it would pass.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today urged
Secretary of State George P. Shultz to move slowly on Palestinian
self-rule in the violence-torn West Bank and Gaza Strip, informed
sources said.
   Shamir told Shultz at a two-hour meeting that there should be
``a time of testing'' for up to three years before negotiations are
held on a final settlement in the occupied territories, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Shultz also met with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, leader of
the liberal faction of Israel's coalition government and Shamir's
political rival.
   Shultz is promoting a U.S. plan that calls for negotiations on
an overall settlement by December. But the sources said he applied
``no pressure whatsoever'' on Shamir.
   Israeli soldiers today killed two more Palestinians in
anti-Israel protests in the occupied territories, bringing the
death toll in 11 weeks of violence to 67.
   A U.S. official said today that some Palestinians have accepted
invitations to talk with Shultz, despite a Palestine Liberation
Organization ban and death threats. The meeting was set for tonight
in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
war.
   The official said 15 moderates had been invited, and a few had
agreed to come although he declined to specify the number or
identify invitees. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Shamir later told reporters his session with Shultz was ``very
friendly and thorough'' and said they discussed ``the aspirations
of all of us for getting peace.''
   He said he hoped that the end result would be some ``positive
outcomes.''
   ``I think there are many openings,'' said Peres, who has
previously endorsed most elements of Shultz's proposals. ``I think
there is a great deal of work to be done.''
   Shultz said he agreed and added: ``As always it is a great
benefit to come and have a good long bull session about it all and
hear your views that have been very helpful.''
   Shultz scheduled two more sessions with Shamir on Sunday after
he will have been to Jordan and Syria to assess Arab positions.
   In the talks today, sources said Shamir reiterated his
objections to an international peace conference that would assign
an active role to the Soviet Union.
   Shultz told reporters on his way here Wednesday from Washington
that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze have voiced interest in such a conference in their
meetings in Moscow. But Shultz said it was ``not a way to go for
substantive results.''
   Shamir's position would keep alive the 1978 Camp David formula,
which calls for a five-year period to see if the Palestinians and
Israelis can live side-by-side.
   Negotiations on a final settlement would begin after the third
year. The options would include statehood or linking the West Bank
and Gaza to Jordan in a confederation.
   But, Egypt, Jordan and several other countries have told the
United States that they rejected negotiations based on the formula.
The accords produced the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
   Jordanian Prime Minister Zaid Rifai, who will meet with Shultz
in Amman on Saturday, said ``we are against any project that deals
with partial solutions, a dividing approach or projects that deal
with Palestinian autonomy.''
   Autonomy would mean self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians
who live in the West Bank and Gaza, but they would not have control
over their security or conduct foreign relations, two key
attributes of statehood.
   Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir said ``one shouldn't make a
dramatization out of this one meeting. It's part of a process that
will continue in Washington when the prime minister goes there'' in
mid-March.
   Prominent Palestinian moderates had said they would not meet
with Shultz tonight because the United States had not fulfilled a
PLO demand to consult with Palestinians living outside Israeli-held
territories.
   They said this was an indication the Americans were really
seeking to create an alternative Palestinian leadership to the PLO.
   ``I told (Shultz) I regret I cannot accept because the
Palestinian people have decided that we have to have a delegation
reflecting the true composition of the Palestinian people,'' said
Al Faj newspaper editor Hanna Siniora, who met with Shultz earlier
this month in Washington.

   The California Supreme Court has rejected
an appeal by environmentalists and removed a major obstacle to
drilling for oil below scenic bluffs on the Southern California
coast.
   Occidental Petroleum Corp., which first applied for a permit 18
years ago, can begin exploratory drilling within a few months,
unless another court intervenes.
   ``The (Supreme) Court now is less environmentally concerned than
it used to be,'' charged Roger Diamond, a lawyer who represented
residents of the Los Angeles neighborhood challenging the drilling.
   The court Thursday denied a hearing on an appeal of a ruling
last November that upheld the city's 1985 approval of the drilling
project. Justice Stanley Mosk, whose son, Richard, is one of
Occidental's lawyers, did not participate in the Supreme Court
action.
   ``Occidental is obviously very pleased,'' said Arthur Groman,
senior member of the company's board of directors.
   ``This field, which we think may be as much as 60 million
barrels of oil, is a vital resource of the United States,'' he said.
   Diamond, in claiming the court had less concern about the
environment than it used to, noted that the court had blocked
another version of the Palisades project in 1974.
   The lawyer, also a board member of the environmental group in
the case, said opponents will ask a Los Angeles judge next week to
block the drilling while a challenge to the project's Coastal
Commission permit is pending.
   Opponents suffered another setback Monday when a Los Angeles
City Council panel voted 3-2 against a proposal by Councilman
Marvin Braude, who represents the Palisades area, to withdraw city
approval of the project.

   The treasurer of the United
Democratic Front today became the last leader of South Africa's
biggest anti-apartheid organization to be silenced by the state.
   Police came to the house of Azhar Cachalia this morning and
served him with an order prohibiting him from speaking to the press
and participating in the front's activities.
   In the east coast city of Durban, 14 white women, members of the
volunteer civil rights group Black Sash, were arrested as
demonstrations continued against the new restrictions on major
black opposition groups.
   The move against Cachalia means that every national executive of
the front group, which represents 600 affiliates with 2 million
members, is either in jail, in hiding or restricted by the
government.
   At the University of Cape Town, 2,000 students and staff
gathered to protest the new bans. About half marched around the
campus carrying banners and singing ``God Bless Africa,'' which
many South African blacks regard as their national anthem.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, told the gathering that nationwide protests
against the government's clampdown must begin immediately.
   Leaders of churches, which like most white opposition groups
were not targeted by the government's restrictions, already have
called for protest services in nations across the country on Sunday.
   ``The battle has only just begun,'' Boesak said. ``We have
decided we will resist. Our commitment starts right now.''
   When the government prohibited the front and 17 other opposition
groups from political activity on Wednesday, it also issued
restrictive orders against 18 senior black leaders, including front
presidents Archie Gumede and Albertina Sisulu.
   Mrs. Sisulu is the wife of imprisoned African National Congress
leader Walter Sisulu.
   About half of the front's leadership is underground. Many others
are in detention without charge, awaiting trial or on trial in
connection with treason charges.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   In Cape Town, at least one person died and five were injured
during a clash between rival black factions in a squatter camp near
Crossroads.
   The fighting between militant youths and the management
committee of the KTC squatter camp, both considered anti-apartheid
groups, broke out at 3 a.m. with gunfire and stone-throwing,
residents told journalists. By 7 a.m. 20 shacks had been burned.
   Police reported one dead and two injured, but residents in the
part of the camp controlled by the youths said four people were
treated at a hospital for injuries. The Argus newspaper reported
two deaths.
   The fighting in the camp began last month and hundreds of shacks
have been burned in the feuding reminiscent of the May-June 1986
battles in the Crossroads-area squatter camps.
   In that violence, 70,000 people lost their homes and scores of
people died in battles between conservative ``vigilantes'' and the
squatter-camp groups.
   But this year the fighting is between two groups who had fought
together against the ``vigilantes'' in 1986, and appears to involve
an attempt by the militant youths to gain more power in the
administration of the squatter camp.
   Police reported three blacks were killed in violence in two
Natal province towns, where feuding between supporters of the
United Democratic Front and the Zulu political organization,
Inkatha, has steadily spread from the townships surrounding the
provincial capital, Pietermaritzburg.
   More than 400 blacks have died in the past year in the Natal
fighting.

   A 19-year-old woman who has spent a record
488 days in a small wooden box perched atop a telephone pole says
she'll remain three-stories high for another month to raise
$100,000 for cancer research.
   ``I'm not sure what's in store for me, but I'm getting pretty
excited,'' Mellissa L. Sanders said an hour before overtaking a
Canadian's record at 2 p.m. Thursday.
   Miss Sanders of Tucson, Ariz., climbed the pole Oct. 26, 1986.
Last week, she rode out 75 mph winds in her swaying box.
   The 42-square-foot box doesn't quite have all the comforts of
home, but it's almost as well-equipped. She regularly runs up $300
telephone bills, watches television and has a hair dresser who
makes box calls. She bathes in a children's plastic pool.
   Her stunt has required commitment and sacrifice, she said.
   ``I gave up a good job, visiting with friends, driving my car,
walking around and all kinds of things for this,'' she said.
   She plans to remain in the box another month, hoping a local
radio station's support will help her raise the money necessary to
meet her goal.
   ``I've only raised $6,000 so far. It still needs to grab
people's attention,'' said Miss Sanders, whose sister, Rebecca, is
a cancer patient who has been in remission four years.
   ``If people see it's for a good cause and take two minutes to
put some money in an envelope, I could make my goal,'' she said,
``I've seen telethons do it in about five minutes.''
   Even if Miss Sanders has not attained her goal when she descends
on March 24, her mother, Mauri Rose Sanders, says her daughter is a
winner.
   ``I'm proud enough to burst. I feel like we both did it,'' said
Mrs. Sanders, who broke a similar record in 1959 by sitting 211
days, 9 hours and 33 minutes above another Indianapolis corner in a
publicity stunt.
   Indianapolis radio station WZPL-FM has joined the Sanders'
effort, and morning disc jockey Steve Stiles says he expects next
month's live broadcasts and other planned activities to put the
fund-raiser closer to her target.
   ``Mellissa's commitment has never wavered, but people weren't
paying any attention,'' said Stiles, who climbed the pole to visit
her Thursday afternoon.

   A new law requiring consent of parents or a
judge for an unmarried woman under 18 to have an abortion has been
effectively blocked from being enforced this year by a ruling of
the state Supreme Court.
   The law, sponsored by anti-abortion groups, had been barred from
taking effect Jan. 1 by a judge's order in response to a lawsuit by
doctors and family-planning organizations.
   On Thursday, the high court denied the state's request to lift
that order in a unanimous decision.
   The law would make it a crime for a doctor to perform an
abortion on an unmarried woman under 18, living at home, who did
not have written consent from one parent. As an alternative, the
minor could get a ruling from a judge that the abortion was in her
best interest or that she was mature enough to make the decision on
her own.
   Many other states have similar laws.
   The lawsuit, filed by medical and family planning organizations,
contends the law violates the right to privacy under the state
Constitution by restricting minors' ability to decide whether to
give birth or have an abortion.
   Some minors would be intimidated into bearing unwanted children
and others would be delayed in getting abortions, increasing the
medical danger, the suit said.
   The constitutional dispute is far from resolved and could return
to the Supreme Court at a later date. But lawyers in the case say
the next legal action is likely to be at least a year away, either
in appellate court proceedings or in a Superior Court trial.
   Until then, minors ``can continue to obtain the health services,
including abortions, that they need without the necessity for
consent of a third party,'' said Abigail English of the National
Center for Youth Law, one of the lawyers who filed suit.
   State officials say some 34,000 women under 18 had abortions in
1985, the latest figures available. Under the old law, which
remains in effect, a woman of any age can consent to an abortion as
long as her doctor concludes she understands the procedure and is
consenting voluntarily.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who personally supports
abortion rights but as the state's top law enforcement officer is
the lead defendant in the suit, had a low-key response to the
court's action, his office said.
   ``We don't see this as a significant ruling on the overall
merits of the litigation,'' said Deputy Attorney General Allen
Ashby, press spokesman for Van de Kamp, who said the attorney
general would proceed with an appeal.

<HEAD>Eight Judges Removed from Bench in Roofers Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court has permanently
removed six judges and barred two others from completing their
elected terms because they took cash gifts ranging from $200 to
$500 from a union leader.
   A year ago, the eight judges were suspended from the bench after
the allegations of taking cash surfaced during an FBI racketeering
investigation of the Roofers Union.
   Chief Justice Robert N.C. Nix Jr. said taking cash from the
union affected the judges' impartiality and ordered that the
judges' salaries, roughly $80,000 a year, cease immediately.
   Only one judge denied receiving the cash; the others said they
considered the money a gift, not a bribe.
   The judges had collected their salaries and benefits while the
Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board considered the
cases. Last August, the board recommended removal from the bench.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, holding that ``a public trust
has been betrayed,'' concurred unanimously Thursday in a 43-page
opinion.
   District Attorney Ronald Castille hailed the decision.
   ``It is a strong message to judges everywhere that this kind of
conduct is totally inappropriate. This is an important first step
in rebuilding the citizen's confidence (to) get justice back in
City Hall,'' he said.
   Mark A. Aronchick, a lawyer for Common Pleas Judge Mary Rose
Fante Cunningham who was permanently removed from the bench, said
Cunningham was ``just saddened about the whole thing.''
   James C. Schwartzman, a lawyer for Common Pleas Judge Michael
Wallace who was permanently removed, said the penalty was far too
severe.
   Stephen P. Gallagher, a lawyer for Municipal Judge Thomas
Dempsey who was barred from completing his term, said he had not
talked with his client, ``but I'm sure he'll be unhappy.''
   And Charles Cunningham, a lawyer for Common Pleas Judge William
Porter who was barred for the rest of his term, said the court had
drawn a ``significant distinction'' with its sentence for Porter
and Dempsey, since they will be allowed to try to return to the
bench in the future.
   The case and other bribery scandals, in which three judges have
been convicted, have rocked the Philadelphia court system in the
past year.
   Six other judges, also suspended last year, are under
investigation.
   The eight judges were accused of accepting $200 to $500 from
1983 to 1985 from Stephen Traitz Jr., former leader of Roofers
Union Local 30-30B.
   Traitz and 18 other union members were convicted last year of
extortion and bribery. They had been accused of trying to bribe
more than 50 public officials.

<TEXT>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association's
drug testing program does not violate a student's privacy rights, a
federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Walter McGovern's decision Thursday also
upheld the University of Washington's right to enforce the drug
test program.
   On the lawsuit brought by cross country and track athlete Betsy
O'Halloran, 19, McGovern said, ``The invasion of her privacy
interest by the specimen collection procedures of the drug-testing
program is outweighed'' by the NCAA's interest in protecting
student athletes' health, reducing temptations to use drugs and
ensuring fair competitions.
   ``I think the decision is correct in all particulars and
accurately stated the law,'' said Jack Kitchin, a lawyer for the
NCAA in Kansas City, Mo.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit on
behalf of O'Halloran and another athlete who later joined the case,
will likely appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said
Kathleen Taylor of the ACLU.
   ``It's a defeat in a way,'' O'Halloran said. ``But I think we've
got a great chance in the 9th Circuit. I really don't think his
arguments are very good.''
   O'Halloran initially filed suit against the university for its
mandatory drug testing program, and a King County superior court
judge ruled in July that the university program was a violation of
both state and U.S. constitutional privacy rights.
   But that oral ruling was never formally entered, and the NCAA
was ordered to be a defendant in the case, which was then moved to
federal court.
   Last month, the University of Washington dropped the mandatory
aspect of its drug testing program, revising it so that testing was
voluntary and required only for those athletes suspected of drug
use.
   The claim against the university program was then dismissed,
with the claim against the NCAA program and the university's
participation in it remaining.
   UW athletes are still required to sign a drug testing consent
form required by the NCAA. Mike Lude, the university's athletic
director, said O'Halloran would be welcomed back if she complies
with the NCAA rules and signs a consent form.
   ``I will not do that,'' O'Halloran said Thursday night.
   Under NCAA rules, students must consent to be tested before
regular season competition begins, although the random testing
would not occur until post-season playoff time.
   Students who refuse to sign are prohibited from regular season
competition.
   O'Halloran asked McGovern to grant her a preliminary injunction
allowing her to compete for the women's track team this spring.
   But McGovern denied her request, saying any harm done to her by
being barred from competition was outweighed by the potentially
greater harm to the NCAA if its ``effective regulation of
intercollegiate athletics was to be impaired.''

   The Shiite Moslem Amal militia today
dismissed its security chief in a rift in the forces searching for
kidnapped U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in south Lebanon.
   Ousted security chief Mustafa Dirani issued a statement that
made no mention of his dismissal, but claimed that Higgins and
other United Nations peacekeeping officials in Lebanon were paid by
NATO to gather information about terrorists.
   Amal said in a terse statement that Dirani was ``relieved from
his responsibility as head of the central security system.'' It did
not elaborate.
   Higgins, 43, was abducted Feb. 17 near Tyre, 50 miles south of
Beirut. Higgins headed an observer group assigned to the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, a peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
it abducted Higgins and alleged he was a CIA spy. U.S. and U.N.
officials denied the accusation.
   Higgins is one of nine Americans among 25 foreigners missing and
believed kidnapped in Lebanon.
   ``Regarding the American officer, I would like to stress that we
have confirmed information that NATO is seeking to confront what it
calls terrorism ... by forming security systems specialized in
Lebanon to gather information in preparation for acts of piracy in
the future,'' Dirani said.
   ``For this purpose, NATO uses some U.N. officers and some UNIFIL
officers,'' he said in the handwritten statement.
   Dirani criticized Amal for seizing members of the fundamentalist
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon during
the dragnet for Higgins. Amal is fighting the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah for control of south Lebanon. Tyre is an Amal stronghold.
   ``We denounce the security arrangements that followed the
abduction of the American officer,'' Dirani said.
   Amal's military commander in Tyre, Daoud Daoud, has been leading
a massive search for Higgins. His militiamen have rounded up at
least 42 Hezbollah members.
   Daoud told reporters today that ``we believe Higgins is still in
the south.'' He made no comment on Dirani's allegations.
   An Amal spokesman in Beirut said Lebanon's senior Shiite cleric,
Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddine, is involved ``in a quiet effort
to release Higgins.'' He refused to elaborate and spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite zealots loyal to Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, is believed to be an umbrella for pro-Iranian
factions holding most of the 25 missing foreigners.
   Amal, the main Shiite militia led by Justice Minister Nabih
Berri, is more secular and is backed by Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon. The two Shiite factions have been vying for
control of south Lebanon.
   The longest held hostage in Lebanon is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. he was seized
in west Beirut on March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops, who have
been asked to make special efforts to help whittle down the
Vatican's annual budget deficit, have released new detail on the
church's worldwide expenses.
   The record 1986 deficit of $56.7 million included spending of
$114 million and income of $57.3 million, said a statement sent to
U.S. bishops for use in making fund-raising appeals in their areas.
The statement was released Thursday.
   The picture for 1987 looked better at the time church leaders
met in Rome to discuss the situation last October, according to an
accompanying letter to U.S. bishops from leading cardinals.
   Contributions were up for the first nine months of 1987,
totaling $35.8 million compared with $32 million for the same
period of 1986, said the letter, which was signed by 10 cardinals,
including John Krol of Philadelphia and John O'Connor of New York.
   The letter spoke of ``a heartening response'' to earlier
appeals, but it also said the bishops were ``once more invited to
continue their generous efforts to make the faithful aware of the
Holy See's economic problems.''
   The biggest 1986 expense by far was for personnel _ $57.9
million, including $50.6 million to pay the Vatican's 2,315
employees and $7.3 million in pension payments to 885 retired
people.
   The Vatican statement said the next largest expense was $11.7
million for publishing activities, followed by $11 million for
expenses on investments.
   The investment expenses, including management of Vatican
investments and interest paid to depositors in Vatican accounts,
left a net income on investments of $17.8 million when deducted
from gross investment income of $28.8 million.
   Other expenses included:
   _$10.4 million for Vatican radio, including $3.9 million for
operating costs and $6.5 million for modernization of equipment.
   _$9.7 million for administrative expenses, ``from the most
elementary ones (stationery and printing supplies) to the most
complex (consultencies of all sorts).''
   _$9.6 million for depreciation and restoration of endowment
funds, to help cover the previous year's deficit and to deal with
inflation.
   _$2.1 million for electricity, water, heating and other
utilities.
   _$1.6 million for maintenance work on office buildings and taxes
on rented buildings.
   As for Vatican income, investment income was the largest item at
$28.8 million, followed by $17.1 million from publishing activities
and lesser amounts from other activities.
   The Vatican has been in the red every year since 1979, when it
first made financial details public. The deficit at that time was
about $20 million.

   Classes were canceled today for nearly 73,000
pupils in Ohio's largest school district after teachers rejected a
contract offer and set up picket lines.
   Talks were scheduled to resume at 1 p.m. today, according to
federal mediator Jack Buettner.
   Principals and administrative staff will reopen four high
schools Monday for 3,600 seniors, Superintendent Alfred Tutela
said. Teachers had planned to strike Thursday, but the district
declared a snow day and closed all buildings.
   School officials and Cleveland Teachers Union members declined
to discuss the school board's latest offer, which was made at 6:30
a.m. Thursday after two days of negotiations.
   At a regularly scheduled school board meeting Thursday evening,
Mildred Madison, board president, said she believed the board had
made a fair offer.
   More than 100 students and teachers attended the meeting, and
many were unhappy over negotiating efforts by school officials.
   ``It's the students who really need the education here,'' Reubin
Fitzhugh, a senior at Cleveland's Aviation High School, told the
board. ``You have your education. Why can't we have ours?''
   The school board reportedly has dropped its demand that a
mandatory career ladder system be included in the new contract,
leaving wages as the major unresolved issue. A career ladder system
would have linked teacher advancement and pay raises to performance
evaluations.
   The school board initially offered a one-time 2 percent bonus
payment, with further raises contingent on passage of a tax levy.
Union president Eugene Kolach said the board had revised its offer
to a 2 percent raise retroactive to September, and another 1
percent raise retroactive to Jan. 1. A pay raise in the second year
would be linked to a levy approval.
   Beginning Cleveland teachers are paid $17,600 a year. The
average teacher makes $29,000 annually and the highest paid teacher
makes just more than $34,600. Of the 5,093 union members, 2,559 are
classroom teachers.
   The last teachers strike in the district lasted 11 weeks in 1979.

   A Soldier of Fortune magazine ad, subject of a
negligence suit that seeks millions of dollars in damages, does not
fall under First Amendment protection because the ad represents a
commercial form of speech, a federal judge says.
   U.S. District Judge David Hittner issued the written opinion
Thursday, elaborating on a pre-trial decision that refused to
dismiss the $22.5 million suit filed against the magazine by the
family of a Texas woman slain in 1985.
   In an eight-page decision, Hittner cited several federal rulings
that allowed negligence suits where commercial speech was the issue.
   According to the judge, the magazine acknowledges that the ad
fell into the realm of commercial speech and to allow dismissal of
the suit under First Amendment grounds ``would afford to commercial
speech a broader protection than that given core speech.''
   Gary Black, 18, and Marjorie Einmann, 64, are suing the
self-styled ``Journal for Professional Adventurers'' for running a
classified ad that led to the killing of Sandra Black, Gary Black's
mother and Mrs. Einmann's daughter.
   Robert Black is on Texas' death row for paying John Wayne Hearn
$10,000 to kill his wife at her Bryan home in February 1985. Hearn
is serving three life terms in Florida for the Black slaying and
two others in that state.
   Hearn's ad appeared in four issues of the magazine in late 1984,
offering services of former Marine and Vietnam veterans and weapons
specialists with jungle warfare expertise for ``high-risk
assignments'' in the United States or overseas.
   Attorneys for the magazine do not dispute that the ad brought
Hearn and Black together, but insist that Soldier of Fortune
publisher Robert Brown had no way of knowing the ad was for illegal
activity. Brown has testified he would have halted the classified
ads for personal services if he had known they were linked to
crimes.
   Brown, publisher and founder of the Boulder, Colo.-based
magazine, was expected to return to the stand today as the trial
completed a second week. He was called last week as an adverse
witness for the plaintiffs and his attorneys reserved
cross-examination until later.
   A former top editor at the magazine testified Thursday he
favored elimination of classified ads from the publication because
they were journalistically unprofessional.
   William Guthrie, now a free-lance writer living in Idaho, said
the ads continued despite his objections because Brown thought they
lent an air of mystique to the publication.
   ``Certain kinds of classified ads appeared to trivialize the
magazine,'' said Guthrie, who was executive editor before leaving
in 1986. ``If Soldier of Fortune was trying to look like a
legitimate military news magazine, to have ads for brass knuckles
and so forth seemed inappropriate.''
   Guthrie said he was not aware that any of the ads may have been
linked to criminal activity.

   A judge dropped contempt-of-court
citations against 34 firefighters, but ordered their union to pay a
$25,000 fine for a three-day sickout.
   The president of the union Thursday read a letter of apology to
the court for not doing more to comply with a back-to-work order
issued on the first day of the sickout that eventually involved 110
firefighters.
   Leo J. Miller, the president of Local 799 of the International
Association of Firefighters, also promised to ``monitor all sick
leave that appears to be excessive'' in the future.
   Later, Miller said the apology was not an admission that
firefighters had participated in any type of job action. Job
actions by municipal employees are illegal under Rhode Island law.
   Superior Court Judge Americo Campanella told Miller he was
fining the union ``in order to impress upon you ... the importance
of a court order.''
   The 34 firefighters failed to appear before Campanella on Monday
afternoon, after they were served notice by the city to appear in
court.
   City labor lawyer Vincent Ragosta Jr. said he was pleased with
the ruling, but said the city will press a civil suit to recover
$100,000 spent on overtime during the sickout. The fire department
kept its night shift on duty throughout the sickout; no major fires
occurred during the three days.
   The city said the firefighters called in sick _ 50 out of 51 on
Saturday and all 60 on Sunday _ to protest what they believed were
unilateral changes made in their contract by the city. The walkout
ended Tuesday.
   The city has yet to sign the agreement ratified by the union in
December, though it has been honoring wage and benefit increases.
   The dispute, according to Fire Chief Michael F. Moise, concerned
the union's insistence that rescue truck crews have the highest
level of emergency medical technician training.

   An honors student was fatally stabbed
by two teen-agers after a quarrel over a girl, but before the
victim died he was able to warn a brother and call his girlfriend,
police reported.
   ``After the stabbing he called his girlfriend and said, `I
probably won't be seeing you again,''' said Madison County Sheriff
Bob Churchich.
   Christopher A. McDonald, 18, also was able to tell his father
what had happened and to identify his assailants before he died a
short time later Wednesday at Anderson Hospital in Maryville,
police said. An autopsy found he had been stabbed in the chest and
the abdomen.
   The boy's father, Gary McDonald, said his son had been visited a
few days earlier by a girl who apparently was a friend of one of
the suspects.
   The elder McDonald told police that Christopher and his
12-year-old brother were home alone when the quarrel and attack
occurred. Christopher had been on the first floor and the younger
brother was upstairs, he said.
   ``They threatened to kill our family, but Chris stood up to
them, and they stabbed him to death,'' Gary McDonald told the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch.
   The younger brother did not hear the fight, but Christopher was
able to stagger upstairs and warn him to lock his bedroom door,
McDonald said.
   He said he was returning home when the suspects' car sped out of
the driveway ``and almost hit me.''
   Alec MacDonald, 17, of rural Edwardsville, and Dennis M. Miller,
16, of rural Worden, were charged Thursday with first-degree
murder, home invasion and armed violence, said Assistant State's
Attorney Randy Massey.
   Authorities refused to say which suspect was believed to have
stabbed Christopher or whether the weapon had been recovered.

   Outnumbered Senate Republicans held ranks
today, scuttling a last-ditch Democratic attempt to force a vote on
a divisive campaign finance package that kept lawmakers talking for
53 straight hours.
   The GOP victory, capping a sometimes bitter filibuster that
included the parliamentary arrest of Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore.,
came as the Senate voted 53-41 not to invoke cloture, which would
have cut off debate and brought the legislation to a vote the
majority Democrats would win.
   The cloture attempt failed because at least 60 senators must
agree to force a vote. It was the eighth time since June that
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., had lost a cloture motion on
campaign spending.
   The defeat seemingly doomed any chance of Congress passing the
Democratic plan this year to impose voluntary spending limits for
Senate campaigns. But Byrd left the door ajar.
   ``We will revisit the issue in one form or another,'' he said
before the vote. ``It's not going to go away.''
   Acting minority leader Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said the
Republicans would be waiting.
   ``There will be other proposals like this. When they come up,
they will be dealt with like this,'' Simpson said.
   This week's struggle centered on a plan advanced by 52 senators,
including Republicans Robert Stafford of Vermont and John Chafee of
Rhode Island, to attack the escalating cost of campaigns by
imposing spending limits.
   Limits for a Senate general election race would range from
$950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a state's population. In
1986, the average campaign cost $3 million _ up fivefold from 1976
_ with some big state races topping $10 million per candidate.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., one of the bill's authors, said that
to build a $3 million warchest, a senator must raise $10,000 every
week from the time he or she arrives in Washington until the end of
the six-year term.
   A candidate observing the limit would be eligible for subsidized
mailings, rock-bottom radio and TV ad rates and money from the
Treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or the candidate was
the target of heavy spending by independent groups.
   The legislation also takes aim at the increasing role of
special-interest political action committees, which in 1986
provided over half the campaign money raised by more than 200 House
and Senate candidates, most of them incumbents. Under the plan,
PACs could supply no more than 20 percent of the candidate's
spending limit.
   Except for Stafford and Chafee, Republicans are having no part
of the proposal, which they say would favor Democrats and doom them
to continued minority status in heavily Democratic states,
particularly in the South.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., calls it ``the incumbent protection
act'' because, he said, it would hamper challengers with little
name recognition or financial resources.
   ``Everyone in politics knows that with these limits, what we
absolutely say to most challengers is, `you've had it,''' Rudman
said.
   Democrats rejected this argument, saying that the real question
was the public perception of senators scurrying for contributions
to fuel increasingly expensive campaigns.
   ``We have to spend our time running around the country looking
for a handout,'' Byrd said. ``How can we blame anyone from
perceiving us as corrupt? The system is corrupt and we're trying to
reform it.
   ``The Senate should not be owned by an aristocracy of money,''
he said. ``Campaign reform gives the little guy an equal share. ...
This business of the golden handshake _ nobody likes it. Senators
don't want to spend all their time going from fund-raiser to
fund-raiser with their hand out begging for money.''
   Republicans were forced into the filibuster at 2 p.m. Tuesday
when Byrd placed the legislation before the Senate. Within 12
hours, things turned bitter with the parliamentary arrest of Sen.
Robert Packwood, R-Ore.
   Acting on the orders of Democrats, Capitol police pushed into
his office and carried him feet-first into the chamber, giving Byrd
the quorum _ at least 51 present members _ he needed to keep the
filibuster going.
   Republicans talked of ``banana republic'' tactics. Byrd called
them ``crybabies'' and castigated them for deserting the chamber en
masse in an effort to abort the talkathon.
   ``This was a calculated effort to obstruct the Senate from doing
its work,'' Byrd said. ``I was forced to do it (order arrests) to
get a majority of the Senate present so the Senate could do its
business.''
   Byrd forced the filibuster in an effort to get the GOP to
negotiate. Republicans said they were willing to talk about curbing
PAC money, but they steadfastly drew the line at spending limits.
   At the start of the filibuster, Byrd said he was ready to keep
the Senate in continuous session through the end of next week.
   But by midnight Wednesday, he and GOP leaders had agreed to end
the siege Thursday evening, let everyone get a night's sleep and
return for today's cloture vote.

   A top UAW official says he will give
local unions permission to strike on a plant-by-plant basis in an
attempt to discourage the company from selling its $1 billion
parts-making subsidiary.
   More than 1,000 angry workers massed outside Chrysler
headquarters in 20-degree temperatures Thursday chanting ``Strike!
Strike!'' to protest the proposed sale of Acustar Inc., which
employs 28,000 workers and represents nearly a fifth of Chrysler's
worldwide operations.
   ``You do whatever you need to do _ and you know what to do,''
UAW Vice President Marc Stepp told the demonstrators. The rally
followed a special meeting of the 140-delegate Chrysler bargaining
council representing the company's 49 UAW locals.
   Although the union can't legally call a national strike against
Chrysler over Acustar, Stepp said he will give local UAW unions
permission to strike on a plant-by-plant basis over unresolved
issues such as health-and-safety grievances.
   A series of local strikes at key Chrysler plants could shut down
the company nationwide.
   At least seven Chrysler locals have voted to seek strike
authorization and one, a key 4,000-worker stamping plant in
Sterling Heights, should receive authorization as early as next
week, Stepp predicted.
   Stepp said the possible Acustar sale, which Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca confirmed in early February, threatens the jobs of all
Chrysler workers by weakening their bargaining power and reducing
work opportunities within the corporation.
   The council unanimously passed a resolution calling for
suspension of all joint labor-management programs that require
trust and cooperation, including special team-concept agreements at
six plants, unless Chrysler decides not to sell Acustar.
   Chrysler has begun implementing the so-called Modern Operating
Agreements at plants in Huntsville, Ala., and in Indianapolis and
Newcastle, Ind.
   Local union leaders said they immediately will stop attending
labor-management plant meetings.
   Similar agreements, in which workers share tasks as part of a
team, have not yet taken effect at plants in Detroit; Newark, Del.;
and Trenton, N.J., Stepp said.
   Chrysler has said it may sell Acustar because it doesn't want to
invest in the research needed to upgrade some operations. Chrysler
already buys 70 percent of its parts from outside sources.
   Workers say they are angry at the possible sale because they
made concessions and helped Iacocca win loan guarantees from the
federal government to rescue the company from the verge of
bankruptcy at the beginning of the decade.
   Stepp will lead negotiations with Chrysler this summer to
replace its contract, which expires Sept. 14. Stepp said Chrysler
already has made talks more difficult with its announcement last
month that it will close its assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., by
the end of the year.

<HEAD>CDC Says Inspections Have Markedly Curtailed Illnesses</HEAD>

   Passengers aboard cruise ships that have passed
federal sanitation inspections are less likely to suffer diarrhea
during their vacations, federal health officials said.
   ``Travelers ought to be aware that these are very tough
inspections, far tougher than the usual restaurant inspections done
ashore,'' said Dr. Vernon Houk, director of the national Centers
for Disease Control's Center for Environmental Health.
   But Houk cautioned against reading too much into the inspection
reports.
   ``The individual traveler should not look at a single inspection
report and make that the determinant whether he'll travel on that
ship or not,'' he said. ``It seems to me the useful question is,
`What is the past history of this ship?'''
   CDC researchers said Thursday that ``ships that consistently
have the highest sanitation scores are less likely to have an
outbreak of diarrheal disease than ships with lower average
scores.''
   On the average, for every 10 million passenger-days _ one
passenger, sailing one day _ fewer than two of the ships scoring in
the top 20 percent reported diarrhea outbreaks between 1975, when
the sanitation program began, and 1985.
   That compares with outbreaks aboard more than eight of the ships
scoring in the bottom 20 percent, the CDC said.
   The CDC considers an outbreak in progress if 3 percent of the
passengers and crew are ill. Sanitation inspections monitor water
quality, food storage and preparation, potential for food
contamination, cleanliness and other matters.
   The CDC has no power to block a ship from sailing, but does
distribute the results of its inspections.
   The agency also said the percentage of ships passing inspection
rose dramatically over the program's first decade, while the number
of intestinal illness outbreaks among passengers declined.
   In 1975, cruise ships reported 7.7 outbreaks of diarrhea for
every million passenger-days sailed, Houk said. By 1985, the figure
dropped to 2.7 outbreaks.
   ``This has been a cooperative effort between us and the cruise
ship industry, and ... (the study) clearly shows it has been
working,'' Houk said. ``Things are going in the right direction.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III said today that he called on the government here to speed up
appreciation of its currency to help reduce the growing U.S. trade
deficit with South Korea.
   Baker said he also discussed other trade issues, including the
lifting of a ban on imports of U.S. beef, an easing of restrictions
on American cigarettes and protection of U.S. intellectual property
rights.
   Baker, who visited South Korea for President Roh Tae-woo's
inauguration, said in an airport news conference before leaving
that his talks with South Korean officials were friendly and useful.
   Baker said South Korea's currency, the won, was undervalued
against the dollar, but did not say how much it should be revalued.
A higher value for the won would make South Korean products more
expensive and less competitive overseas.
   South Korean officials said Baker pointed out that the won's
appreciation has been slower than that of the Japanese yen and
Taiwanese dollar, which both gained close to 30 percent against the
U.S. dollar last year. The won rose only 8.7 percent.
   Finance Ministry officials said they told Baker that South Korea
would actively adjust the won's value by taking into account the
value of the dollar on international money markets and the impact
on domestic industries.
   Local newspapers reported that Baker asked for a 15 percent to
20 percent rise in the won and for South Korea to open its stock
market to foreign investors.
   Baker said that ``problems have developed that need to be
addressed in a spirit of cooperation by the two countries.''
   He said the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea grew 39 percent
last year following a 57 percent increase in 1986, and that it was
approximately equal to South Korea's entire current account
surplus, which hit a record $9.78 billion last year.
   He said the United States should be given more access to the
South Korean market because while the U.S. market ``is nearly
completely open to Korean goods, some of our exporters experience
serious impediments to their access to the Korean market.'' He
cited high tariffs, other trade barriers and an undervalued
exchange rate.

   An Army helicopter nosedived into a cow
pasture and skidded about 75 feet before it broke apart in a sheet
of fire, killing 10 men and seriously burning eight others,
authorities and witnesses said.
   Two soldiers leaped about 35 feet to the ground from the burning
twin-rotor CH-47D Chinook before it crashed about 50 miles from
Fort Worth on Thursday, said state Department of Public Safety Sgt.
Robert Rankin. One of the soldiers died.
   The other soldier said that a fire had broken out at the back of
the helicopter based at Fort Sill, Okla., and that those aboard had
tried to move to the front to get away from the flames, Rankin said.
   Residents raced to the scene, pulling casualties away from the
raging grass fire sparked by the crash.
   ``Some of them were just sitting there screaming,'' said
17-year-old Dale Christopher, a Chico High School student who was
among the first on the scene. ``And they kept asking us `Help us.
Help us.' And then we'd say `Help is on the way.' That's all we
could do for them.''
   A three-person team of investigators from the Army Safety Center
at Fort Rucker, Ala., was investigating the crash today.
   The Chinook CH-47D has a history of problems and the Army
grounded its entire fleet of 63 of the big transport helicopters
for 1{ months in 1985 after an accident in Honduras injured eight
soldiers.
   Witnesses said the helicopter was tilted forward at a 45-degree
angle, puffing smoke and descending rapidly when it crashed about
3:29 p.m., slicing through a power line.
   ``All of a sudden a little thin streak of smoke came out of it
and there was a small explosion on the right side underneath it,''
said Joe Haworth, who was working at a nearby plant. ``Then it put
out a little more smoke and it flew straight for a ways, then parts
went to coming out of it.''
   The craft skidded about 75 feet before breaking apart in a sheet
of fire, said Wendell Berry Sr., 53, who watched the accident from
his home a half-mile away.
   Berry cut the seat belt away from a crewman strapped to the
remains of the cockpit.
   ``There was only one guy still in the helicopter who was either
the pilot or the co-pilot, and he was conscious,'' Berry said. ``He
was so conscious that when I cut his seatbelt he said, `That feels
better _ thanks.'''
   Jack Souther, 54, used a small fire extinguisher from his pickup
truck to douse burning bodies. ``The only thing I could do was put
the fires out on the bodies. I went from body to body trying to put
them out,'' he said.
   The copter, carrying 13 passengers and five crew members, was
returning to Fort Sill from Fort Hood in central Texas, Fort Sill
spokesman Rick Brink said.
   Fort Sill officials said today that two pilots and a flight
engineer from the post were among the 10 killed, and that two of
the injured were also from Fort Sill.
   Fort Sill spokesman Richard Brown identified the three dead as
Staff Sgt. Raymond T. Hill, 31, of New Baltimore, Mich.; Chief
Warrant Officer 4 Ronald W. Bender, 40, of Rockville Center, N.Y.,
and Chief Warrant Officer 4 Scott J. Temple, 43, of Irving, Texas.
Bender was the command pilot and Temple was a pilot. Hill was a
flight engineer.
   Of the 10 dead, six died at the scene, one died in Parkland
Hospital in Dallas, one died in Bridgeport Hospital and another
died early today at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio.
Another soldier was found dead at the crash site after dark
Thursday.
   Three soldiers remained hospitalized at Parkland Memorial
Hospital this morning, one of them in critical condition with skull
fractures and lacerations on his thigh, said spokesman Tom Geddie.
A second was in fair condition with a hip fracture and a third was
in good condition with a broken leg and cuts on his face.
   Four soldiers who had been initially taken to Parkland late
Thursday were moved to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio,
but one died shortly after arrival, a spokesman said today.
   Fort Hood soldiers Paul Stroud and Calvin Turner were in serious
condition at Harris Methodist Hospital in Fort Worth early today,
said spokeswoman Mandy Goad.
   The CH-47D, which has a troop capacity of 44, is a modernized
version of earlier models of the Chinook, which was used in Vietnam.
   In the Honduras accident, a transmission bearing failed on a
CH-47D taxiing to a refueling depot. The failure caused one of the
copter's main rotors to stop turning; the other rotor began hitting
it and the helicopter tore itself apart.
   The Chinook's main rotors mesh as they turn, and therefore must
be synchronized.

   Vice President George Bush, during a
campaign stop here, said the United States should do ``whatever is
necessary, including military force'' to protect American interests
in Panama.
   Bush stopped short of calling for military intervention in
Panama in the wake of the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle,
saying that the United States' past history of intervention in
Latin American affairs is ``what's hurting us in some areas now.''
   He told the South Carolina Press Association: ``We will do
whatever is necessary to protect American interests in Panama.
We've got treaty interests on the (Panama) canal. I don't want to
rattle any sabers. ...
   ``But we would obviously as the United States, and I would,
reserve the right to do whatever is necessary, including military
force, to protect America's sacred interest in that region of the
world.''
   The vice president, given a strong South Carolina lead in a poll
published today, was heading for Atlanta after a day of campaigning
Thursday in South Carolina, whose Republican presidential primary
is Saturday, March 5.
   A poll by The Charlotte Observer indicated Bush was the favorite
in the state's GOP contest, with the support of 41 percent of those
likely to vote in the primary.
   Sen. Bob Dole trailed with 29 percent; former television
evangelist Pat Robertson had 13 percent; and Rep. Jack Kemp had 4
percent. Twelve percent were undecided.
   On Thursday, Bush seemed to be confidently raising the stakes as
he declared, ``South Carolina is going to stand alone as the
forerunner of who is going to be president, in my view.''
   Bush traveled by motorcade through the state's northwestern
corner, stopping at colleges, technical schools, a high school,
popular restaurants and a sidewalk crowd in nearby Greenwood.
   At one of his first stops, Bush addressed head-on the issue of
the region's major textile industry and the calls by its leaders
for limits on foreign imports. Textile leaders contend the industry
has been damaged by cheap imports and they want legislation
imposing limits on foreign products brought into the United States.
   Bush referred to that as a ``pure, all-out'' protectionist
policy that may cost three other jobs while saving one. He said
existing trade laws are adequate if enforced.
   ``That's not the answer,'' Bush said. ``The answer is, we can
compete if the playing field is level. I will enforce the laws. I
will guarantee you that there is every effort made towards fair
trade.''
   A day earlier rival Bob Dole campaigned in the state and pledged
to support the legislation in the Senate _ similar to legislation
that President Reagan vetoed over textile-state objections two
years ago.
   Bush argued that South Carolina's economy has been growing and
pointed to figures he said show 62,000 new jobs were created in the
state last year, including 2,700 in textiles. He contended currency
differences with Japan are improving and that manufacturing and
agricultural imports have climbed recently.
   ``We're seeing improvement out there,'' he said.
   Bush cited evidence of economic improvement at most every stop
but didn't repeat his opposition to the textile import limits until
asked. ``There have got to be some changes before I'd be for it,''
he said.
   Bush rode in his armored limo for most of the day but spent one
leg of the trip on a bus with about 40 active supporters from the
area.
   He said that Dole's endorsement by Sen. Strom Thurmond ``makes
the stakes higher for Dole'' in South Carolina. Thurmond, however,
didn't provide enough help to make a difference for his GOP primary
favorite eight years ago _ Texan John Connally.
   Bush was accompanied by South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell
Jr., his state chairman, and national campaign manager Lee Atwater,
a native South Carolinian.
   Atwater attached much significance to the state's primary even
while arguing Bush could withstand a loss here. He said that if
Robertson fails to beat Bush in South Carolina he won't win a
single state.
   And Atwater said if Dole finishes third in South Carolina, ``I
think he's going to lose every single state on Super Tuesday'' when
20 states including all the rest of the South hold primaries.
   The Observer's poll, conducted by the newspaper's market
research division, surveyed 687 registered voters who indicated
they were likely to participate in the primary. The margin of error
is 4 percentage points, the newspaper said.

   A member of a street gang opened fire at a
member of a rival gang on a crowded city bus, seriously wounding
the 15-year-old boy and three other teen-agers, police said.
   ``This is every day,'' bystander Mary James said at the scene of
the shooting spree Thursday afternoon. ``I wouldn't mind seeing the
National Guard around here.''
   Witnesses aboard the packed Southern California Rapid Transit
District bus said two teens on the bus asked passengers if they
were members of a rival gang, said police Lt. Joseph Freia.
   The passengers said they weren't, but one of the two youths
pointed to another teen-ager and identified him as a rival gang
member, Freia said.
   The youth singled out then pulled a .45-caliber pistol from his
waistband and shot the challenger in the chest, said police Lt.
Bruce Hagerty.
   He fired at random and wounded three other 15-year-old boys
before he fled on foot into the South Central Los Angeles
neighborhood, police said. A search of the neighborhood turned up
no suspects, police said.
   The shooting occurred in an area of the city that is plagued by
gang violence and drug dealing. More than 300 gang-related killings
occurred in Los Angeles County last year, many of them in the
neighborhoods of South Central.
   On the north side of the city, a man was stabbed in the neck
late Thursday when he drove his pickup into a residential
neighborhood just as a fight between 25 to 50 alleged gang members
broke up, said police Lt. Don Brown.
   ``A couple of gang members jumped in the back of his truck'' and
rode for about half a block, Brown said. When the victim stopped
his truck, one pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the neck,
narrowly missing his jugular vein, officials said. The victim was
in stable condition today. No one was arrested.
   The street violence stirred up political tensions in the city
after a 27-year-old Long Beach woman was gunned down by gangs in
the trendy Westwood area last month.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates deployed more officers to the area,
prompting complaints by residents of the gang-plagued poorer
neighborhoods that they don't receive the same attention.
   Earlier this week, county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn suggested
National Guard troops be called in to quell the epidemic of gang
violence.

   Cuban President Fidel Castro called a Panamanian
military aide's assertion that Castro was an active partner in
alleged drug operations with Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
``lies, all lies.''
   In an NBC News interview broadcast Thursday, Castro sharply
denied claims by Jose Blandon, a former Panamanian Defense Forces
aide and the country's former consul general in New York.
   Blandon told a congressional committee two weeks ago that Castro
was involved in the alleged drug operations with Noriega, Panama's
military strongman. Federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.,
indicted Noriega earlier this month in connection with cocaine and
marijuana trafficking.
   NBC also reported Thursday that U.S. officials say they have
solid evidence that Cuban MiG fighters and Cuban coast guard boats
have been involved in escorting and protecting cocaine shipments on
their way from Colombia to the Florida Keys via Cuba.
   In a related development, the Miami Herald reported today that a
federal grand jury has returned sealed indictments against 17
people it accuses of using Cuba as a way station to smuggle cocaine
from Colombia to South Florida.
   The indictments describe four cocaine loads totaling 3,800
pounds, two that came through Cuba, one through Haiti and one
through the Bahamas, federal law enforcement sources told the paper.
   The grand jury returned two indictments, one charging five
people and another 12. Neither accuses Cuban officials of
wrongdoing, sources told the Herald.
   NBC also reported that the Miami grand jury was ready to hand up
the indictments.
   Castro said Blandon ``has accused Noriega of bypassing the
blockade (the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba), of warning Cuba
before the invasion of Grenada, of being a spy, of drug
trafficking, of asking me for advice to return some money, and all
those are lies and slander.''
   ``What he says is lies, all lies,'' Castro said through an
interpreter in the interview taped Wednesday in Havana.
   Blandon also testified that Castro mediated a dispute between
Noriega and a Colombian drug cartel.
   Castro denied he ever talked to Noriega about the dispute. ``I
have documents on archives that this type of conversation never
took place. It's a lie from top to bottom,'' he said.
   Blandon also accused Noriega of acting as a double agent.
   ``He said that Noriega sells CIA secrets to us. He has never
given U.S. confidential information to us,'' Castro said.
   Castro denied that there is drug trafficking of any type in
Cuba: ``Cuba is the cleanest country in the world.''
   However, the network reported that Colombian pilots have been
landing at Havana International Airport and a nearby Cuban air
force base with loads of cocaine, which are then shipped into
Florida.
   NBC interviewed a Colombian pilot who said he was working
undercover for the FBI as part of an investigation into the alleged
drug operation.

<HEAD>White Man Sentenced To NAACP Work Charged In New Racial Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white man sentenced to perform community
service work for the NAACP after he harassed two blacks was charged
in a second alleged racial incident, an assault on a pregnant woman
with an Hispanic surname, police said.
   James Kalafut Jr., 21, was charged Thursday with ethnic
intimidation, battery and violation of his court-supervised
sentence after he allegedly punched a pregnant woman in the stomach
and shouted racial slurs at her, police said.
   A court hearing was scheduled today on the new charges.
   Virginia Flores suffered minor injuries but the fetus was not
harmed, said a spokesman for Holy Cross Hospital, where she was
treated and released.
   On Tuesday, Cook County Circuit Judge Stuart Nudelman said
Kalafut had been ``taught to hate blacks'' and sentenced him to
perform 200 hours of community service for the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People and one year of court
supervision.
   Kalafut had pleaded guilty to ethnic intimidation and aggravated
assault for an Aug. 16, 1987, incident in which a group of whites _
brandishing baseball bats, hurling bottles and shouting racial
slurs _ chased two blacks from a predominantly white neighborhood
on the city's Southwest Side.
   Nudelman issued two warrants for Kalafut's arrest after the new
incident late Wednesday night. ``I feel terrible about it,'' the
judge said.
   ``I was trying to stop the cycle of hate,'' Nudelman said of his
decision to sentence Kalafut to community service work for the
NAACP. ``This is very unfortunate.''
   Ms. Flores, said she was ``a white Caucasian American'' who had
some Spanish in her family history.
   Chicago police said that the incident occurred while Ms. Flores,
27, who is 4{ months pregnant, and Kenneth Kolokowski, 25, were
walking past the Kalafut home and having an argument.
   The couple alleged that Kalafut came out of his house, yelled at
them and then got into a struggle with Kolokowski. Kalafut then
allegedly punched Ms. Flores in the stomach and shouted a racial
slur at her, police said.
   The defendant's father, James Kalafut Sr., 45, then allegedly
came out of the house, dressed in pajama bottoms, and exposed
himself to the woman, said police Sgt. Jerry Dusek.
   The elder Kalafut also was charged with ethnic intimidation and
battery in the alleged incident.
   Barry Silver, the younger Kalafut's attorney, said he was
concerned that his client, sentenced for one racial attack, might
have been ``framed'' in the new incident.
   ``I don't know what to believe at this point,'' Silver said. ``I
question the credibility of the persons who filed the charges. But
if the charges are true, it's extremely disheartening.''

   President Reagan was ``just being realistic''
in saying that there isn't enough time to finish work on a
U.S.-Soviet strategic weapons treaty before his planned summit
meeting in Moscow, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today.
   Reagan, in an interview published in today's Washington Post,
also said he believes it is still possible for the treaty to be
completed and signed before he leaves office in January.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiatiors had hoped to have the treaty ready
for Reagan to sign with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when the
two meet in Moscow in May or June.
   Fitzwater said the president's statements did not represent any
major change in the U.S. position.
   ``The president said the same thing that I have said here many
times, that Secretary (of State George) Shultz and others have
said, and that is that we are working on a START agreement; if we
can get one that will be done in time to sign at the summit, that
would be great; but, realistically, it doesn't appear that's likely
to happen.''
   ``The president was just being realistic,'' Fitzwater said.
   During a 30-minute Oval Office interview with the Post on
Thursday, Reagan was asked whether he expected to sign the treaty
to reduce strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons by 50 percent
during the summit.
   ``That would be nice, if it could happen, but I have to tell you
that common sense indicates that the time is too limited for us to
really think that we could bring a treaty ready for signature to
that meeting,'' Reagan said.
   ``We're not at this moment anticipating that it would be ready
for signature then,'' he said.
   Reagan said the negotiations being conducted by representatives
of both sides at the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks in Geneva are
far more complex than those that preceded the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty, which was signed by the two leaders during
the Washington summit in December. The INF treaty eliminated
short-and intermediate-range missiles from Europe. It is awaiting
action by the Senate.
   ``This one is so much more complicated with regard to
verification and everything else than the INF Treaty, which we were
able to bring together. But even that took a few months to do,''
Reagan said.
   ``I believe with the amount of time that would still be
remaining that, if there is sincerity on both sides with regard to
getting such an agreement _ and I think there is _ I think that
could be done ... before my time expired,'' he said.
   He reiterated that he would not use the Strategic Defense
Initiative _ known as Star Wars _ as a bargaining chip in
negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   ``I have told him (Gorbachev) every time. ... If it is that
good, we are going to deploy it. We see it as the basis then for
eliminating the strategic ballistic missiles on both sides. And I
have even told him that I would be willing to see this shared,''
the president said.
   Reagan also said National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell
and Secretary of State George P. Shultz are convinced the Soviets
want to pull out of Afghanistan, where they have been battling
U.S.-backed rebels.
   ``I think that a large part of that could be the economic
situation in the Soviet Union and the fact that, after going on
nine years, it's still a stalemate. So I think that there's reason
to believe that they really want out,'' he said.
   A group of senators back from a tour of NATO capitals said they
won assurances from Reagan on Thursday that the strategic arms
treaty would not be rushed through simply to have it ready for
signing at the Moscow summit.
   ``I am very concerned that the START agreement not be based on
the calendar, the day of the month, that it not be governed by
meeting a deadline,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va.
   He said he was assured that would not be the case.
   On Monday, during Shultz's talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow,
U.S. and Soviet negotiators at the START talks in Geneva had been
directed to prepare within a month three draft agreements for a
treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50
percent.
   Draft accords on verification, disposing of weapons and exchange
of information are to be ready for the next meeting between Shultz
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, scheduled for
March 22-23 in Washington.
   Other issues covered during the Post interview included:
   _The U.S. budget deficit: ``It's a burden. There's no question
about that. But ... not the disaster some people proclaim. ... One
of the major factors in our budget right now is the interest. But
who gets that interest? And you find out then that a great many
institutions, universities, educational institutions of all kinds,
that part of their endowment are government bonds. And so a lot of
that interest is going to them ... (and) to individual Americans.''
   _Former White House aides Michael Deaver, convicted of perjury
for lying about his lobbying activities, and Lyn Nofziger,
convicted of illegal lobbying, and Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, who is being investigated by an independent counsel: ``Of
course, I am saddened. ... I found all those individuals to be the
very soul of integrity in the more than 20 years that I have known
them.''

<TEXT>
   For three long minutes, air traffic
controllers at the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center were
without radar systems to track planes in parts of nine Western
states, relying instead on manual calculations.
   The primary computer system used to track air traffic failed at
6:14 p.m. Thursday, and controllers were unable to switch to the
backup system until 6:17 p.m. because it had been taken apart for
maintenance, said Lee Fryer, a duty officer for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Seattle.
   During those three minutes, air traffic controllers had to keep
the traffic separated by using manual calculations.
   A controller who was working during the shutdown said that the
equipment failure lasted longer than three minutes. ``Three minutes
is optimistic on the FAA side,'' he said. Safety at the center was
``most definitely compromised,'' said the controller, who asked
that his name not be used.
   However, Fryer said that a three-minute shutdown was not long
enough to cause a safety problem. Keeping track of the aircraft
``was not a serious problem,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cuomo Says Brawley Lawyers' Conditions ``Don't Mean Anything''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to update with Cuomo saying Brawley
lawyers ``making up'' conditions and with report that Tawana
Brawley not talked to own lawyers about case.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo today accused lawyers for a
black teen-ager who says she was assaulted by six white men of
``making up conditions'' as part of their continuing refusal to
have the young woman testify about the case.
   Meanwhile, the teen-ager's aunt was quoted today as saying the
girl hadn't even talked about the case with the lawyers
representing her.
   Tawana Brawley, 16, missing for four days in November, was found
wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and covered with feces, with
racial insults scrawled on her body. She said she was assaulted by
six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge.
   Miss Brawley, of Wappinger's Falls north of New York City, and
her family have refused to be questioned further on the advice of
attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. of New York City,
the lawyers who used a similar tactic to get a special prosecutor
appointed in the Howard Beach manslaughter case.
   Cuomo had nothing good to say about those lawyers at an
impromptu news conference today.
   ``They said they had reasons they could not cooperate. ... It's
clear now they don't really,'' Cuomo said of the two lawyers.
``These conditions obviously don't mean anything. They keep making
up new conditions.''
   Maddox and Mason were on the road this morning and not
immediately available for comment on Cuomo's statements or today's
report in the Middletown Times Herald Record newspaper that Miss
Brawley hadn't talked to the lawyers about the case.
   Cuomo said again today that he was willing to meet with Miss
Brawley if it would help push the stalled investigation along.
However, he said he would do so only if her lawyers approved and
state Attorney General Robert Abrams, Cuomo's special prosecutor in
the case, said it would be helpful.
   In her interview with the Middletown newspaper, Juanita Brawley,
who helped raise Tawana for eight years and who has spent time with
her since her attack, said she is the only one who knows enough
about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girl's mother
informed.
   ``I know a few things that no one else knows,'' she said in an
interview at her home. She said of Maddox: ``He has not talked to
Tawana. He does not need to talk to Tawana.'' She did not elaborate.
   On Thursday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said the Brawley family would
go to jail before testifying before a grand jury empaneled by
Abrams.
   Sharpton, a minister from New York City who has said he is
advising the family, said Cuomo is using ``macho politics'' in
trying to compel Tawana's testimony.
   On Wednesday, Cuomo had called on Abrams to ask a grand jury
when it convenes Monday in Poughkeepsie to force Miss Brawley and
her family to cooperate with investigators.
   ``Someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a
young girl who has already been abused,'' Sharpton said of Cuomo.
   This morning, Cuomo said that whatever happened with the grand
jury, he thought it was ``very unlikely'' that Tawana would be sent
to jail even if she continued her refusal to cooperate with Abrams'
investigation.
   On Thursday, Cuomo had told New York City radio station WLIB
that he can't understand why the Brawley family will not cooperate
with authorities.
   ``I see no reason, no common-sense reason, no
difficult-to-understand reason, why there is not cooperation,''
Cuomo said. ``At one point you have to ask yourself, why aren't
they cooperating with the prosecutors?''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today made an unprecedented
public appeal for calm in the protest-plagued republic of Armenia,
but thousands ignored him and took to the streets in a ``sea of
banners,'' witnesses said.
   For the past five days, protesters have jammed the center of
Yerevan, Armenia's capital, to demand that a region of the
neighboring republic of Azerbaidzhan, Nagorno-Karabakh, whose
population is more than three-quarters Armenian, be made part of
Armenia.
   The Communist Party Central Committee, over which Gorbachev
presides as party general secretary, rejected the call earlier this
month. That sparked street protests in Yerevan in numbers without
precedent in the 70 years of Soviet history.
   Sergei Grigoryants, an Armenian dissident, said a speech from
Gorbachev was read over Armenian state-run radio at 11 a.m. by
Vladimir I. Dolgikh, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo.
It was later read by Dolgikh over local television, said Gevorg
Mirozyan, an editor at Armenian Gostelradio, the state broadcasting
authority.
   ``Gorbachev called on the Armenian people to be calm, and said
there were a lot of unresolved problems, including that of
Nargorno-Karabakh, and that a patient approach is required,''
Grigoryants told The Associated Press by telephone from Yerevan.
   The 15-minute speech also was broadcast over loudspeakers at
Yerevan airport and elsewhere in the city, said Grigoryants, a
Moscow resident who arrived in Armenia earlier today.
   Demonstrators also watched the address on TV monitors that had
been set up on in Yerevan's streets, said Valery Aidinyan, chief of
the propaganda department at the local Communist Party newspaper
Kommunist.
   Gorbachev said the Central Committee intends to devote one of
its next plenary meetings to examining relations among the
country's more than 100 ethnic groups.
   The Soviet Union has recently faced ethnic problems among the
Baltic republics and in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan,
where three people were killed and 200 injured in rioting Dec.
17-18, 1986.
   Armenia, the smallest of the 15 Soviet republics in area, has
3.4 million people.
   Grigoryants said Gorbachev's speech was more conciliatory and
soothing than ``combative'' remarks made Wednesday night in Yerevan
by Dolgikh, but he said it failed to sway protesters.
   ``The numbers in the streets have grown to more than 1 million
today,'' Grigoryants said. ``Columns are marching along the major
streets, and there is a sea of banners.''
   Several hours later, Aidinyan said the demonstrators had begun
to disperse. A worker at the Yerevan Hotel, speaking on condition
of anonymity, confirmed that by nighfall, virtually all of the
demonstrators had left the city center.
   ``There is no disorder. Everyone is working again,'' he said by
telephone.
   Factories, scientific institutes and the Armenian telegraph
agency reportedly went on strike in sympathy with the protest.
Armenians who had served with the Soviet army in Afghanistan were
said to be among the protesters, throwing away their medals and
their Communist Party membership cards.
   The protests in Yerevan, now in their fifth straight day,
constitute a clear challenge to Gorbachev's campaign for greater
democratization and openness. Gorbachev's personal appeal showed
how seriously the Kremlin regards the situation.
   There has been no official estimate of the number of protesters,
and the state-run travel agency Intourist has refused to allow
Moscow-based reporters to travel to Yerevan.
   Ayrikyan said that before midnight Thursday, 1,500 Soviet
paratroopers had been flown into Yerevan, and were ferried in a
40-vehicle motorcade to the Dynamo sports hall and other locations
around the republic's capital.
   ``They came with full equipment, including clubs,'' Ayrikyan
said. He said paratroopers were told by officers aboard their
transport planes that an ``uprising for national independence'' was
under way in Armenia, but would not say how he obtained the
information.
   Ayrikyan, a former political prisoner who spent 17 years in
labor camps and exile for alleged nationalist behavior, called the
arrival of the paratroopers ``an interference in Armenia's
affairs.'' Each of the Soviet Union's 15 republics is ostensibly
independent.
   Mofses Gorgisyan, 26, a member of an Armenian underground group
called the Alliance for National Determination, told the AP by
phone from Yerevan Thursday that other soldiers took up positions
in the city's downtown area and stationed tanks in the outskirts.
   A 17-year-old resident of Nagorno-Karabakh said after arriving
in Moscow Thursday that virtually the entire Armenian population of
the region, about 120,000 people, has been demonstrating daily in
the main city, Stepanakert, since Feb. 13.
   The student, who spoke on condition she not be identified, said
protests were continuing round-the-clock and that schools and
businesses were closed in a strike.
   She also said some Armenians in her region had been killed by
Azeris, members of the dominant ethnic group in Azerbaidzhan, but
that she had did not know how many or the circumstances.
   Soviet officials have said there were ``victims'' of the unrest,
but did not give other information.

   On the eve of what would have been the
greatest challenge of his 30-year legal career, the man who has
been impeached Gov. Evan Mecham's lead lawyer for months has
resigned.
   Murray Miller, 60, who with his son has defended the governor
through impeachment proceedings as well as Mecham's criminal
indictment, said in a brief interview today that ``I was fully in
charge of the case'' as late as Wednesay night, after his
appearance before the Senate impeachment court.
   Miller still was acting for the governor Thursday evening in
filing motions with the Senate challenging the adequacy of the
impeachment charges, but he would say today only that the decision
to withdraw came Thursday night and that he hoped the Senate would
not suspect that he had deceived it.
   As for Mecham, Miller, said, ``My main concern is that the
governor gets a fair legal shake.''
   Earlier Miller had said a ``lynch mob atmosphere'' was
undermining his fight to save the governor from an impeachment
conviction.
   ``They're trying to sandbag the governor,'' Miller had said,
referring to Mecham's foes in and out of the state Senate which is
scheduled to convene as a court Monday.
   ``If they convict him, they can also stamp the Dracula clause,''
said the metaphor-prone attorney. ``They can bar him from holding
office for life _ putting the stake through his heart.''
   Miller declined to discuss the reasons for his resignation.
However, Mecham hired five additional attorneys early this week,
including Jerris Leonard, a Washington attorney and former
congressman, and Miller said earlier the Leonard move came as a
surprise.
   ``That was the first time I met him, when he walked in here on
Tuesday,'' Miller had said with a shrug. ``I spoke with the
governor and he said he was bringing (Leonard) on board for
advice.''
   The Senate dealt Leonard a setback Wednesday night, however,
rebuffing his plea for a delay to let him catch up on the case but
agreeing to let Leonard join the defense team. Miller had said at
the time he would be the lead counsel ``at the beginning'' because
he was most familiar with the case.
   Leonard resigned from the Washington law firm of Manatt, Phelps,
Rothenberg, Tunney and Evans because of his decision to take the
case, Charles T. Manatt, a senior partner, confirmed today.
   ``Jerris Leonard informed the firm last week that he had been
contacted by Gov. Mecham concerning representation,'' Manatt said.
``We made it clear that the firm was not interested in representing
Governor Mecham, and Mr. Leonard informed us that he has resigned
from the firm.''
   The 23-count impeachment accused Mecham of concealing a campaign
loan, diverting money from the governor's protocol fund for private
use and obstructing justice in the investigation of a death threat
allegation.
   Miller said he believes Mecham is innocent, but that it is
impossible for the Republican governor to get a fair trial even
though the GOP controls both houses of the Legislature.
   ``You really have a lynch mob atmosphere in the city,'' Miller
said.
   ``You're not dealing with a neutral jury,'' he said. ``You're
dealing with senators who may be predisposed against the governor.
... I'll try to beseech them to keep an open mind. But, politicians
being what they are, I'm not sure that's going to be possible.''
   If Mecham faces difficult odds, he had in Miller an attorney who
knows how it feels to be an underdog.
   Described by colleagues as talkative and tenacious, the New
York-born lawyer is the son of European immigrants and was the
youngest of six children raised in a one-bath, two-bedroom Brooklyn
tenement.
   Miller recalled nostalgically how he waded through snowdrifts to
carry his father's lunch to his upholstery shop.
   ``Oh, Dad, you're telling those stories again,'' chided his son
Rick, 28, who joined his father's law practice a year ago. Another
Miller son is a court stenographer and a third is about to enter
law school.
   Miller was sent by the Army to New Mexico where he met and
married Zelda Cohen, a registered nurse, and attended the
University of New Mexico.
   A job selling X-ray equipment brought them to Arizona, where he
decided to try law school. Mrs. Miller worked to pay his tuition at
the University of Arizona, and in 1958 he set up a one-man practice.
   ``We were really broke,'' he recalled of the days when he
accepted any case that came along.
   His current clients include Max Dunlap, a contractor who is
suing Phoenix for $650 million over his subsequently reversed
conviction in the car-bomb slaying of newspaper investigative
reporter Don Bolles.

   Two Soviet cosmonauts conducted a 4-hour,
25-minute walk in space Friday to replace a solar battery on the
outside of their Mir space station, the official Tass news agency
reported.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov completed their work ``with the
highest level of professionalism,'' and they were feeling well
after the activity, Tass said.
   They have been aboard the space station since Dec. 21, when they
blasted off from the Central Asian cosmodrome with a third spaceman
aboard the Soyuz TM-4 capsule.
   It was the first space walk from the Mir since Titov and Manarov
took over from cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko, who set a space endurance
record of 325 days during his 1987 mission. Romanenko returned to
Earth on Dec. 29.
   The Mir station, the newest of the two Soviet research complexes
in orbit, was launched Feb. 20, 1986.

   A construction crew working on the
grounds of a plutonium-refining plant found an unexploded World War
II bomb in a load of soil they had just dumped onto a truck,
officials said.
   Explosives experts safely disarmed the 110-pound U.S.-made bomb
after moving it to a wooded area, said Christiane Kohl, spokeswoman
for the Hesse state Environment Ministry.
   The crew was digging the foundation for a new building at the
Alkem nuclear-reprocessing facility in Hanau, 12 miles east of
Frankfurt, she said.
   The excavator's metal shovel scooped up a chunk of earth ``and
loaded it onto a truck,'' she said, and the crew then noticed the
bomb amid the dirt.
   Work at the scene was halted and police and atomic safety
officials were informed, an Alkem statement said.
   ``Detonation experts said there would have been no danger to
stored nuclear materials had the bomb gone off'' because of the way
the facilities at Alkem are constructed, Ms. Kohl said.
   The bomb was unearthed about 80 yards from production buildings
at the reprocessing facility, she said.
   Manfred Popp, state secretary for the Hesse Environment
Ministry, said experts will search the grounds for more ordnances
before work resumes.
   The Alkem nuclear facility produces radioactive fuel rods for
nuclear power plants.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up 0.3 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in
January, about the same rate of inflation as through 1987, but a
large decline in energy costs cloaked hefty increases in many other
areas, the government reported Friday.
   The January increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index followed a revised December increase of 0.2 percent. The
December rise initially been reported as 0.1 percent.
   The advance was equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 4.2
percent, according to department analysts. That compares to the 4.4
percent actual rate of inflation posted for 1987 and is also in
line with the Reagan administration's projection of 4.3 percent
inflation for 1988.
   But, while most analysts do not see a major acceleration of
inflation this year, January's figures showed particularly steep
increases in the category of services.
   Medical care services rose 0.8 percent, its steepest increase in
two years. The cost of hospital rooms was up 1.2 percent,
physicians' bills were up 1.0 percent.
   Rent costs rose 1.1 per cent, auto insurance prices were up 1.5
percent and entertaintment costs rose 0.9 percent.
   Analysts said that many of the price increases may reflect
one-time-only increases timed to coincide with the beginning of the
year.
   But Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist who
specializes in price activity, called the report ``a bit
worrisome.''
   ``We didn't expect that much of a rise in services,'' he said.
``It does appear that there was some aggressive pricing going on in
January. We should see some calming in February.''
   In another economic reports Friday:
   _The Commerce Department said Americans' personal incomes and
consumer spending both rose at moderate rates of 0.3 percent in
January, less than half the 0.7 gains both posted in December.
Economists expect weakening consumer spending this year as the
economy slows down.
   _A real estate trade group said sales of existing homes fell 3.6
percent in January, the third consecutive monthly decline. The
National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing
single-family homes were at their slowest pace since June 1985.
   January's consumer inflation level would have been higher had it
not been for the second consecutive monthly decline in energy costs.
   In fact, subtracting the usually volatile food and energy
categories, consumer prices for all other goods and services rose a
sharp 0.5 percent in January _ equivalent to about a 6 percent
annual inflation rate _ after a 0.2 percent increase in this
category in December.
   Overall, energy prices fell 0.7 percent in January after a 0.8
percent drop in December.
   Gasoline prices fell 1.6 percent, heating oil costs were down
0.8 percent, natural gas prices dropped 0.1 percent and electricity
charges were down 0.3 percent.
   Food prices, meanwhile, rose but not as much as they had in the
previous month _ up 0.3 percent after December's 0.6 percent gain.
   Overall, grocery prices were up 0.2 percent while restaurant
meal costs climbed 0.3 percent. After climbing sharply through the
fall, the index for fruits and vegetables fell 0.4 percent last
month. Beef prices were down 1.4 percent, pork prices fell 0.5
percent.
   Poultry prices, however, climbed 1.0 percent while cereal and
bakery products rose 1.1 percent.
   Although import prices have been rising recently under the
pressure of a weaker U.S. dollar, the January price report did not
show much evidence of dollar-related inflation.
   And, despite the surge in service prices in January, most
economists stuck to their predictions of relatively little price
acceleration for 1988.
   ``There were a lot of price increases that come at the first of
the year, but I'm not overly alarmed,'' said Lawrence Chimerine,
chairman of The Wefa Group, a Philadelphia-area forecasting service.
   ``Services are clearly a major source of inflation. But I think
that in the months to come, we'll see less inflation from services
and more from import price increases,'' Chimerine added.
   The Labor Department gave these other specifics of January price
behavior.
   _New automobile prices were down 0.2 percent; used automobile
prices fell 0.1 percent.
   _Housing expenses were up 0.4 percent.
   _Apparel costs gained 0.1 percent.
   _Tobacco products rose 2.8 percent.
   January's increase left the CPI at 115.7, meaning that a
selection of goods and services that cost $100 during a 1982-84
base period cost would have $115.70 last month.
   The department recently abandoned a 1967 base period in favor of
the 1982 standard. Under that earlier base period, a selection of
goods and services costing $100 in that year would have cost
$346.70 last month _ which is $1.56 more than the same goods cost
in January 1986.
   The overall index is not adjusted for seasonal variations while
other figures in the report are.

<TEXT>
   Soviet concerns about President Reagan's
proposed space-based missile defense system are diminishing,
possibly opening the door to wider testing of the ``Star Wars''
program than Moscow previously said it could accept, according to a
report published today.
   In what was described as a highly unusual luncheon in Moscow
with reporters, a high-ranking Soviet official said his country
only opposed the deployment of the space-based system and would
want assurances that the United States would not use a testing
program to disguise actual deployment.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``If
they have new moves or new proposals, we will certainly take a look
at them.''
   The New York Times said the Soviet official spoke freely
Thursday during the meal of caviar and filet mignon with reporters
on the condition he not be identified or quoted directly, as senior
American government officials often do.
   The official said technical problems with the system made it
unlikely a workable system could be produced by the end of the
century.
   He added that Moscow remains committed to a strict
interpretation of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, which
includes prohibitions on the development of space-based weapons
envisioned under Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   It was unclear if the new position was a genuine change in
Soviet policy or merely a hint of possible compromise, the Times
said.
   A revised Soviet position on testing of components of the system
could alleviate one of the main obstacles to completion of a treaty
reducing long-range, strategic missiles.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham's chief attorney has
resigned, just days after other lawyers were brought in to handle
the governor's impeachment trial opening next week before the state
Senate.
   Murray Miller said today during a brief interview at his office
that the decision to withdraw from the case came Thursday night. He
declined to elaborate on the decision but he said he hoped members
of the Senate would not suspect he had deceived them.
   As late as Wednesday night, after his appearance before the
Senate, ``I was fully in charge of the case and defending the
governor,'' Miller said.
   ``I feel uncomfortable that the impeachment court (the Senate)
may think I knew about the withdrawal at the time I appeared and
that I was being deceptive. I want them to be asssured that is
totally not the case.''
   Miller said he thought that Washington attorney Jerris Leonard,
hired earlier this week by Mecham to be the lead lawyer for the
impeachment trial, is now in charge of Mecham's case.
   Miller said he did not know whether the new Mecham legal team
would be able to proceed with the impeachment trial as scheduled
Monday, but assumed they would if so ordered.
   ``My main concern is that the governor gets a fair legal
shake,'' said Miller.
   Another lawyer hired by Mecham this week, Thomas Crowe, said
today that Leonard would be at the Senate on Monday.
   ``How ready he'll be I don't know, but he will be there,'' Crowe
said. He also said the attorneys had not decided whether they would
go to court today in an effort to delay the impeachment trial.
   The Arizona Daily Star of Tucson today quoted the governor as
saying: ``Murray withdrew from the case. We parted friendly, but
that's really all. You'll have to ask him why.''
   Mecham and Leonard did not immediately return phone calls this
morning.
   Leonard resigned from the Washington law firm of Manatt, Phelps,
Rothenberg, Tunney and Evans because of his decision to join
Mecham's defense, said Charles T. Manatt, a senior partner in the
firm.
   ``Jerris Leonard informed the firm last week that he had been
contacted by Governor Mecham concerning representation,'' Manatt
said. ``We made it clear that the firm was not interested in
representing Governor Mecham, and Mr. Leonard informed us that he
has resigned from the firm.''
   Manatt, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
was asked why his firm wasn't interested in being associated with
the Mecham case. ``Lots of reasons, you can well imagine,'' he
replied.
   Miller said Wednesday he did not know additional attorneys were
being hired until Leonard walked into his office Monday.
   The beleaguered Mecham also faces a May 17 recall election and a
March 22 criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   The Senate on Wednesday refused to delay the impeachment trial.
Miller said then that he expected to remain the lead attorney until
Leonard could get acquainted with the case.
   Mecham hired Miller on Oct. 21, the day it was disclosed that
the attorney general's office was investigating Mecham's failure to
disclose the $350,000 campaign loan made in 1986.
   On Thursday, Miller filed a motion asking the state Senate to
dismiss the impeachment case.
   Lawyers in the case also raised the possibility that the
governor would go to state or federal court today in an effort to
delay the Senate trial. Senate counsel John Lundin told lawmakers
he expected any challenge to be filed in the state Supreme Court.
   If Mecham's attorneys ask a court to delay the trial, the Senate
is expected to argue that courts have no jurisdiction over a
legislative impeachment.
   The motion filed Thursday said, ``This impeachment article
should be dismissed and the governor should be permitted to govern
this state as mandated by the will of the people in the last
election.''
   Miller has contended that the Republican governor's impeachment
trial should be delayed until after his criminal trial, on grounds
that the criminal jury would be prejudiced by the publicity
surrounding an impeachment trial.
   Mecham was impeached Feb. 5 on a 46-16 House vote. Several days
later the House approved 23 impeachment articles outlining details
of three broad charges against the governor: that he concealed the
$350,000 campaign loan, misused $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership, and tried to
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state
official.
   Miller argued that the claim regarding the alleged death threat
was a ``tempest in a teapot'' that had ``given the prosecutors the
unbridled license to wildly charge crimes against the governor in a
vindictive and persecutorial manner.''
   Miller said Mecham cannot be convicted for allegedly concealing
the $350,000 loan because a campaign financial report on which the
loan was lumped with other funds was made on Dec. 5, 1986, before
Mecham took office. The state constitution says officials may be
impeached only for acts committed while in office, Miller said.
   Miller said the $80,000 loan to Mecham Pontiac violated no laws
and was ``nothing short of a prudent investment'' that earned
higher interest than the money would have gotten in a bank.

   A woman has reached a $925,000
settlement of her suit against a hospital and nursing company
charging a nurse incorrectly hooked up a pump, causing air pressure
that blew a hole in the woman's intestine.
   Juanita Johns continues to suffer infections and has a
disfiguring scar on her stomach, one of her attorneys, Wayne
Alford, said Friday.
   Mrs. Johns, 53, reached the settlement this week with University
Medical Center and Medical Personnel Pool of Northeast Florida
Inc., which supplied the nurse under a contract with the hospital.
Mrs. Johns' malpractice lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial
next week.
   Mrs. Johns was recovering from lung surgery at University
Hospital in Jacksonville last year when her doctor ordered a tube
placed down her throat to remove intestinal gas.
   However, a private-duty nurse attached the tube to the exhaust
end of a pump and air was pumped into Mrs. Johns, blowing a hole in
her intestines, her lawyers said.
   ``She realized something was wrong when because her stomach
started blowing up like a balloon,'' Alford said of his client.
``She suffered extreme pain. At that point, she ripped this thing
out of her nose and out of her stomach and a doctor later said this
ultimately saved her life.''
   Mrs. Johns was rushed into surgery and was in intensive care for
eight days.
   Under the agreement, the hospital will pay $150,000 and the
nursing pool will pay $775,000, said Alford and fellow attorney
John Kalil. The settlement was reached after a judge ruled that
both the hospital and the nursing firm could be held liable.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly today convened
an emergency session and ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle
after he tried to fire the nation's military chief and de facto
leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In a 10-minute session, 38 legislators voted Delvalle out of
office and accused him of promoting U.S. interference in domestic
affairs by trying to force Noriega out.
   The Cabinet immediately named a new chief of state, Education
Minister Manuel Solis Palma, who was sworn in before dawn. Devalle
called the moves ``legally despicable.''
   Noriega blamed the upheaval on the United States but said U.S.
interests in Panama would be safe. He said the events were
``strictly internal.''
   In Washington, President Reagan said the United States does not
plan military intervention in Panama. ``No, I don't think that's
the answer,'' he said when asked.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis said the U.S. government would not
recognize the replacement for Devalle, who had acted to assert
civilian control over the government.
   Opposition leaders were meeting today to discuss a possible
national strike and the university was closed, but banks and stores
opened and there was no sign of unrest.
   Noriega, under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, said through his Miami attorney, Ray Takiff,
``All American interest in the republic are and shall remain
undisturbed and unharmed.''
   Noriega said he was a friend of the American people, but he
denounced U.S. politicans who he said advocate ``hysteria (and) act
with a wreckless disregard for the truth.''
   In an interview broadcast today by the government's Radio
Nacional, Noriega said of the United States: ``They have been using
a web that includes psychological warfare ... slander, lies,
injury, conjecture, and ... misinformation.''
   Drivers honked their horns and some waved white handerchiefs
immediately after Delvalle announced his plan to oust Noriega. Both
have been signs of opposition to Noriega, who was the target of
nationwide protests and strikes last summer.
   Carlos Ernesto Gonzales de la Lastra, a spokesman for the
opposition National Civic Crusade coalition, said today in a
telephone interview, ``The National Civic Crusade and other
opposition leaders are meeting to reach an agreement, with the
intention of carrying out a national strike.'' He declined to give
more details.
   Officials of the National University of Panama closed the school
and said it was to prevent disturbances. Secondary and primary
schools were out for vacation.
   Delvalle called his own ouster ``something legally despicable
that only fulfills a formality in the mind of those who want to
grasp power at any cost.''
   He urged a trade embargo against Panama but said he opposed U.S.
military intervention.
   Panama, with 2.2 million people, is headquarters for U.S.
military operations in Latin America.
   The U.S. Southern Command has 10,000 troops and 20,000
dependents in Panama. The U.S. garrison was on alert and told
Americans to keep a low profile during any unrest.
   The White House called for Noriega's resignation after his
indictment in Florida on Feb. 5. Delvalle's attempt to oust
Noriega, announced in a nationwide broadcast Thursday night,
received immediate backing from the United States.
   But Noriega and his supporters moved quickly.
   The National Assembly was called into session, although
opposition lawmakers in the 67-member legislature boycotted the 1
a.m. meeting. Both Delvalle and Vice President Roderick Esquivel
were removed from office.
   Noriega, who says he is innocent of all charges, did not comment
publicly on the events.
   Delvalle said of his opponents, ``They will not receive
acceptance from any country that takes pride in being democratic. I
continue to feel that I am president of the republic.''
   From his home, Delvalle said he asked Noriega to ``retire'' as
soon as the U.S. indictments were announced, but the general
refused.
   Defense Forces police chief Col. Leonidas Macias told Panamanian
television Thursday that no officer would replace the general.
   ``He (Delvalle) is going first,'' said Macias, flanked by senior
officers at the Defense Forces' central garrison.
   Delvalle said earlier that Col. Marcos Justines, the chief of
staff, would replace Noriega. Justines refused and told reporters:
``We have been conversing with him (Delvalle) constantly, and he
knows that our position has been that there is too much American
interference in this Panamanian affair.''
   In its resolution, the National Assembly said Delvalle violated
the law in removing Noriega and noted that Esquivel had abandoned
his post in September without resigning.
   The resolution said Delvalle mentioned U.S. charges against
Noriega ``with the object of permitting the intervention of the
government of the United States in the internal affairs of
Panama,'' damaging national sovereignty and endangering national
security.
   The U.S. indictments accuse Noriega of using his authority to
let Colombian drug traffickers use Panama as a base for smuggling
cocaine and marijuana into the United States. The charges said
Noriega received a healthy kickback from drug profits.
   Later, at his home, the president told The Associated Press,
that he ordered Noriega's dismissal ``for the health of this
country.''
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Marcos Gregorio McGrath arrived at the
house and pledged support for Delvalle.

   California's ``Vehicle of the Future''
features a back-seat driver that not only nags but also is capable
of slamming on the brakes.
   A 1977 Dodge van equipped with an experimental radar-based
``collision-avoidance'' system was demonstrated Thursday at a
meeting of the Governor's Regional Transportation Management
Conference.
   The system has a grill-mounted radar dish and a computer under
the dashboard to warn the driver of approaching hazards.
   John Davis, the San Diego engineer who invented and sells the
system, took the van on a demonstration spin.
   ``Watch it! Watch!'' the computer voice snapped as he drove out
of the parking lot.
   ``Look out! Look out!'' it barked as he came too close to a car.
   ``Fall back! Fall back!'' it commanded before finally putting on
the brakes.
   The state has ordered six vehicles equipped with the system,
said interim Director Donald Watson of the state Transportation
Department.
   ``This system will enable more vehicles to move faster at closer
intervals and will substantially increase the capacity of our
highways,'' he said.
   The six experimental trucks and cars will cost about $250,000,
he said.

   Vietnam has told the United States that next
week it will turn over what the Vietnamese say are the remains of
20 American servicemen listed as missing from the Indochina War,
U.S. government sources said today.
   Richard Paul, an aide to Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Ala., a
member of the Senate Veteran's Affairs Committee, said a member of
the Vietnamese delegation at the United Nations told the senator
that Vietnam had information on, or the actual remains of, 23
servicemen.
   A Reagan administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Vietnam was believed to have 20 remains and
information on three others and would provide the bodies and the
information on March 2.
   The official said a U.S. plane would be sent to Hanoi and take
the remains to the U.S. military's Joint Casualty Resolution Center
in Hawaii for identification.
   The United States has been urging Vietnam to account for the
more than 1,700 American servicemen still listed as missing from
the Indochina War. U.S. government leaders have said Vietnam has
been withholding information.

<HEAD>Dissident Discloses Plan for Noriega's Ouster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Panamanian dissident said today that
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle knew in advance his effort to
fire military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega would fail.
   But Jose I. Blandon, a former close associate of Noriega's, said
in an interview that Delvalle's bid to depose Noriega was but one
step in an 18-point plan that is designed to lead to Noriega's
ouster within three weeks.
   ``It is exactly what we thought was going to happen,'' Blandon
said, referring to Delvalle's attempt to replace Noriega with the
second-ranking officer in Panama's Defense Forces and Noriega's
decision to ignore the order.
   Early today, the Panamian legislature voted to remove Delvalle
from office and appointed a successor.
   Blandon said that he and about 10 other opposition leaders have
joined with Delvalle in putting together the plan over the last
several weeks.
   The next steps in the plan, Blandon said, include rallying broad
international support for Delvalle, a general strike in Panama and,
they hope, an embargo by the United States aimed at crippling
Panama's economy.
   These steps, Blandon said, ``will leave Noriega more isolated
than ever'' and force his eventual downfall.
   Blandon said his allies already have been in touch with
authorities in the Dominican Republic to determine whether they
would be willing to allow Noriega to enter the country if and when
he is forced out. He said Dominican officials have responded
positively to the proposal.
   One potential obstacle to Noriega's acquiescence to this
solution is the possibility of his arrest in the Dominican Republic
and his extradition to the United States based on federal drug
smuggling indictments against him, Blandon said.
   He said Delvalle raised last week with Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams the possibility of dropping the U.S.
indictments against Noriega. He said Abrams was unable to make any
such commitment and that a final decision on withdrawing the
indictments would have to be left either to the Justice Department
or President Reagan.
   In any case, Blandon said, the political and economic
circumstances in Panama are such that it is doubtful that Noriega
can survive much longer, especially if the United States and Latin
American countries close ranks behind Delvalle.
   Blandon spoke to a reporter at a local hotel where he is under
24-hour guard by U.S. marshals. He was a key witness earlier this
month in congressional hearings on Noriega's alleged drug smuggling
activities and his ties to the CIA.
   As he spoke, Blandon frequently referred to a folder outlining
the plan to end Noriega's domination of Panamanian politics and to
restore elected civilian rule to the country. The plan was dated
Feb. 22 but its contents had been agreed to weeks earlier by a
broad-based coalition of Panamanian opposition leaders, Blandon
said.

<HEAD>City In Rebirth, Liverpool Ready To Receive Modern Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abandoned rum warehouse has become
the latest symbol of rebirth in this port city that was founded on
cotton, famed for its Beatles and devastated by changing times.
   Contractors on Wednesday handed over the keys of the old
warehouse to Sir Alan Bowness, director of London's Tate Gallery.
   On May 24, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, will come to
the building and open the ``Tate in the North,'' the first endeavor
by a state museum in Britain to show its works on a large scale
outside of London.
   A series of 10-month exhibitions will keep pictures and
sculpture circulating to Liverpool from the Tate's collection of
40,000 works of British and 20th century art.
   It is a bid to attract another 500,000 visitors a year to
Liverpool.
   First to be seen will be surrealist art, the works of American
abstract painter Mark Rothko and British sculpture of the past 20
years.
   ``Liverpool has had a hard time and it's trying to pull itself
up. I hope we can help, not least because I've always felt it was
unacceptable that the Tate should only be in London,'' Bowness told
The Associated Press.
   It will cost about $17.6 million to convert a warehouse in the
Albert Dock, completed in 1846, to a museum. The dock contains five
blocks of five-story, red-brick and cast-iron warehouses
surrounding a 7-acre ``courtyard'' of water.
   The dock area already has a maritime museum and shops. More
shops, restaurants and apartments are being created in the
warehouses, which have been empty since World War II when the dock
fell into disuse.
   Now the dock buildings are considered so valuable as
architectural history that they are state-protected, and Liverpool
Waterfront, stretching 1{ miles along the banks of the
one-mile-wide Mersey river, is being transformed from dereliction
into a major tourist area.
   ``More than 50 million pounds ($88 million) has already been
sunk into the waterfront and we are sure it is going to be a
spectacular success,'' said Diana Day, publicist for the Merseyside
Development Corp.
   Private industry has invested more than $315 million in other
Liverpool projects.
   Liverpool, with 600,000 people 210 miles northwest of London, is
beset by 20 percent unemployment and miles of decaying housing.
Fifteen million people live within one hour's drive from the city,
which was home to the rock group, the Beatles.
   ``Liverpool was once the second port in Britain after London and
the major port of Europe for the Atlantic,'' said Eric
Leatherbarrow, spokesman for Mersey Docks and Harbor Co.
   ``But when Britain joined the European Economic Community trade
tilted from here to southeast England, and containerization saw a
lot of the old shipping lines disappear.
   ``Now we are pulling up because European businessmen are
realizing that Liverpool is still the nearest major port to the
United States. Shipping companies are coming back and our cargo
throughput was up by 1 million tons a year to 11 million tons in
1987.''
   To generate interest for the new museum, ``The Tate in the
North'' has prepared charming and funny posters introducing
Liverpudlians to the world of modern art.
   One radio commercial features Picasso's ``Three Dancers.''
   A male voice explains the painting as follows:
   ``The bloke on the right was married to the woman on the left
who was having an affair with the bloke in the middle who was
obsessed with her, only she lost interest so he invited her to a
restaurant with some friends, they have a slap-up dinner, then he
pulls a gun, fires at her, she ducks, plays doggo, then he shot
himself.
   ``When his mother heard, she died of shock. You see, paintings
talk to you.''
   ``I don't hear nothing,'' a second voice replies.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Assemblies of God said
today they have asked church officials in Louisiana to reconsider a
recommended three-month suspension for fallen TV evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart that hundreds of callers criticized as too lenient.
   Twelve members of the church's highest governing board met for
12 hours at the church's international headquarters in Springfield
today and Thursday to discuss the Louisiana District's proposed
sanctions against Swaggart, who allegedly engaged in voyeurism with
a prostitute.
   Officials of Swaggart's home district recommended earlier this
week that the fiery television evangelist, who confessed to
undisclosed moral misconduct, be prohibited from preaching for
three months and undergo two years of rehabilitation and counseling.
   The state recommendation was criticized by many church members
as too lenient, and the Executive Presbytery's move today was an
indication the board disagreed with the state district's
recommendation.
   Meanwhile, the companion of a prostitute who claims she
performed pornographic acts for Swaggart for about a year said he
was negotiating to sell her story to the mass media.
   ``This is a shot for me and a shot for her,'' said John
Martinez, a carpet cleaner who said he met Debra Murphree, 28, in
West Palm Beach, Fla., about four months ago. ``It's the American
way _ see an opportunity and jump on it.''
   Martinez said he discussed a $100,000 contract to tell Ms.
Murphree' story with the National Enquirer and also contacted
People magazine, ABC-TV's Nightline and other media worldwide, The
Palm Beach Post reported Thursday.
   Enquirer President and Editor Iain Calder confirmed the tabloid
was talking with Martinez, but would say nothing more.
   At the end of the Assemblies of God meeting here, General
Superintendent G. Raymond Carlson said, ``We will not discuss the
content of our meeting.'' He said no final decision had been
reached on Swaggart's punishment and it could be several weeks
until one is made.
   The church constitution provides for the Louisiana District to
reconsider the case and submit new recommendations to the church
headquarters in Springfield, where the final decision will be made.
   Carlson made the announcement with seven board members at his
side.
   Juleen Turnage, a church spokeswoman, said the board met
Thursday with two representatives of the church's Louisiana
District _ Cecil Janway, general superintendent of the state
district and a member of the Swaggart Ministries Board, and Forrest
Hall, treasurer of the Louisiana District.
   Swaggart, who was not at Thursday's meeting, has not made a
public appearance since Sunday, when he tearfully told his
congregation in Baton Rouge, La., that he had committed an
unspecified sin.
   The evangelist, whose Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries gives $12
million a year to the Assemblies of God, has been known for his
harsh denunciation of sexual lapses by other preachers, including
PTL ministry founder Jim Bakker.
   The church's 13-member governing body was considering a
recommendation by the Louisiana district that Swaggart be barred
from preaching for three months and undergo counseling during a
supervised two-year rehabilitation.
   Mrs. Turnage said the international headquarters here has been
swamped with up to 300 calls an hour since Swaggart's televised
confession Sunday. About half of the callers complained that the
Louisiana recommendation was too lenient, she said, while others
were generally supportive.
   Mrs. Turnage said the two-year rehabilitation is standard, but
in cases of moral misconduct on the part of ministers, ``the
precedent has always been that for that first year, the minister is
barred from preaching.''
   Under the church constitution, if the Executive Presbytery
decides to toughen up the state district's recommendation, they
would send the case back to Louisiana for reconsideration.
   The group had no statement after the meeting Thursday, but Mrs.
Turnage said they may release a progress report after more
discussion today.
   ``We cannot put time and expediency ahead of our constitutional
process,'' she said. ``I know that they are really carefully
considering everything.''
   The church, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, has
been shaken by the Swaggart revelations and a sex-and-money scandal
that last year cost Bakker, another prominent Assemblies minister,
his ministerial credentials. He had rejected the option of
undergoing rehabilitation.
   Evangelist Marvin Gorman, who claimed Swaggart falsely accused
him of adultery, for which he was defrocked by the denomination,
reportedly gave the church photographs of Swaggart entering and
leaving a motel room with a prostitute.
   Ms. Murphree told WVUE-TV of New Orleans Wednesday that she met
with Swaggart for about a year at various motels between New
Orleans and Baton Rouge to perform pornographic acts, but did not
have sexual intercourse with him.
   Ms. Murphree has an arrest record in Louisiana and Florida for
prostitution-related offenses. She also is wanted on a drug charge
in Nashville, Tenn., according to police records.

   Eric Arturo Delvalle today insisted
he is still president of Panama and called for a worldwide trade
embargo against his nation and its de factor ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Delvalle, ousted by the National Assembly today after he tried
to fire Noriega, said a trade embargo would create economic chaos,
``but we all have to realize that a country has to suffer to rid
itself of a dictatorship.''
   He said he also he also supports U.S. congressional calls for a
halt to commercial airline flights and to free-zone banking
transactions between the United States and Panama, home of one of
the Western Hemisphere's largest banking centers.
   Delvalle spoke informally to reporters at his home, where he has
remained since he announced Thursday afternoon he was firing
Noriega.
   The assembly is dominated by a coalition of Noriega's supporters
and its brief, post-midnight session was boycotted by minority
opposition members.
   ``I am the president of Panama this morning,'' Delvalle
declared, his eyes baggy and red-rimmed from lack of sleep. ``There
is no doubt about it. There is no legal power in Panamanian laws or
the Constitution that allows the National Assembly'' to dismiss a
president.
   But asked how he intended to exercise the functions of the
presidency, Delvalle shrugged and replied with a tired smile:
``That's a good question.''
   He said he knew that his ``chances were slim'' in calling for
Noriega's departure because ``never has any president ousted the
commander of the Defense Forces in Panama in all our history. It
has always been the other way around.''
   Delvalle said he would take his case to the nation's Supreme
Court, ``where my chances are also very slim, because it also is
controlled by Gen. Noriega.''
   The Cabinet named Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma as the
new chief of state.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of business, professional, labor and
political organization known as the National Civic Crusade was
meeting to consider a call for a nationwide work stoppage.
   Delvalle said he would support ``an indefinite strike'' and
called ``the people of Panama to unite, all for one and one for
all, to struggle for the removal of Gen. Noriega.''
   He said that as soon as U.S. grand jury indictments charging
Noriega with drug trafficking were announced in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., earlier this month, he called Noriega and asked him to step
down.
   ``But he said he didn't think it was advisable.''
   ``I let him consider his answer for a couple of days and then
again I requested his own decision to retire, which he didn't
accept, and that's why I acted today (Thursday.)''
   In a telephone interview with ``CBS This Morning,'' Delvalle
said the United States had not pressured him to fire Noriega.
   Delvalle, 51, spent most of the evening huddled in a back room
with U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis and his personal advisers.
   Between 30 and 40 people, most of them close friends, listened
to radio and television news reports at the Delvalle home and he
occasionally strolled out to chat with them.
   Asked about the naming of another president, Delvalle replied:
``I will fight it out, because there is no reason for me to be
removed from my position. I am acting within the laws and the
constistution of the country.''
   Asked what reaction he expected from the international
community, Delvalle said, ``The reaction of the international
community will be against the Defense Forces.''
   Asked if he had discussed Thursday's action with U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams while in Miami last week,
Delvalle said, ``No, not at all.''
   But Delvalle said he had a four-hour visit from Davis Thursday
evening and ``received State Department support ... stating that
they will back me and support my actions.''
   He said he did not fear for his safety.
   Delvalle had no political experience before he became vice
president in October 1984, after running for the Republic Party in
a coalition with five other parties.
   He was president and general manager of National Sugar, a sugar
producing and refining company owned by his family. He studied in
the United States.
   He and his wife Mariela Diaz have three children.

   Taxpayers who underestimated their income-tax

Service in installments under legislation introduced Friday in the
Senate.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said broad changes in the income tax
law passed in 1986 make it more likely that taxpayers, especially
in families with two wage-earners, failed to deduct enough from
their paychecks to cover their tax liabilities.
   The bill, sponsored by Levin and Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho,
would allow people who underwithheld to pay off their debt to the
IRS, with interest, in three payments after April 15.
   Under the present law, taxpayers unable to pay a lump sum by
April 15 must negotiate terms with the IRS on a case-by-case basis.

<TEXT>
   A top Socialist minister today reversed
his decision to boycott a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of
Nazi Germany's annexation of Austria after President Kurt Waldheim
dropped plans to speak during the event.
   Other Socialists hailed the decision of the president, who
served as a lieutenant in the German army during World War II.
   In a televised interview Thursday, Waldheim announced he would
not give a speech March 11. He said he would give a televised
speech March 10.
   In the interview, Waldheim also said he had considered quitting
the presidency but had rejected the idea.
   The announcement on the speech prompted Finance Minister
Ferdinand Lacina to reverse his decision to boycott the solemn
ceremony.
   Lacina, a Socialist, said Friday that a Waldheim speech would
have led to ``a renewed polarization'' among Austrians and
``criticism coming from other countries.''
   Heinz Fischer, a leader of the Socialist Party, said Waldheim's
decision to drop the speech ``will lead to an easing of tensions on
March 11.''
   Waldheim has been surrounded by controversy since March 1986,
when it was disclosed that he had served as a lieutenant with the
German army in the Balkans during World War II. The United States
and put him on a ``watch list'' of undesirable aliens, barring him
from entering the United States.
   In the interview Thursday, Waldheim said he had a ``clear
conscience'' and repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong.
   Austria is governed by a coalition of Socialists and
conservatives. Waldheim is the ceremonial head of state.
   The head of the government, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' today that it was up to Waldheim
to determine whether he should step down.
   The 69-year-old Waldheim said he will address the nation in a
televised broadcast on March 10, the eve of the ceremony marking
the Anschluss, when Austria was absorbed into the German Reich in
1938. Austria was liberated by the Allies in the spring of 1945.
   Waldheim opponents had promised to take to the streets in
protest if the president went ahead with the talk on March 11 in
the Hofburg Palace.
   Several leading Austrian politicians said a Waldheim speech was
not the way to lead the country into reflecting on its Nazi past.
   There have been calls for Waldheim's resignation since March
1986, when Austrian and U.S. media and the World Jewish Congress
reported that he served as a lieutenant with the Germany army in
the occupied Balkans during World War II.
   The calls intensified after an international historians'
commission issued a critical report earlier this month, which left
open the question of whether he was guilty of war crimes.
   ``If I thought I had done anything false or anything wrong, then
I would have taken the consequences,'' Waldheim said.
   In the controversy over Waldheim's past, ``taking the
consequences'' has come to be synonymous with resignation.
Waldheim's term is scheduled to end in 1992.
   Waldheim was asked if he had considered quitting.
   ``Naturally I thought of it,'' he said. ``Otherwise I wouldn't
be a human being. I'd have to be a piece of wood.''
   But he firmly rejected any notion of stepping down. ``My
resignation would only make things worse,'' he said.
   Waldheim's decision not to speak at the Anschluss commemoration
dominated the front pages of newspapers today.
   ``Waldheim Cancels the Speech at the Remembrance Ceremony,''
said the Salzburger Nachrichten. The conservative newspaper has
strongly criticized Waldheim for his handling of his wartime past.
   Vienna's Kurier tabloid, which also has criticized Waldheim,
focused on conciliatory remarks he made in the interview.
   ``Waldheim: I Apologize for the Misunderstandings,'' the Kurier
newspaper said in a banner headline.
   The March 11 speech originally had been planned as a way to
avoid a political showdown over whether Waldheim would address a
joint session of Parliament to mark Anschluss.

   A 10-day visit to California by Britain's
Prince Andrew and his wife, ``Fergie,'' the Duchess of York, will
be full of public events, but no security problems are expected, a
British Consulate official says.
   The couple, scheduled to arrive late this afternoon, will attend
exhibitions and concerts that are part of UK@LA '88, a
three-month-long British arts festival, said Angus Mackay, the
royal visit press officer. They also will attend banquets and visit
schools, stores, an aircraft carrier and churches from Los Angeles
to Palm Springs.
   When Andrew, the third child of Queen Elizabeth II, visited Los
Angeles four years ago he was a bachelor naval officer who lived up
to a rowdy reputation by playfully turning a paint sprayer on the
press corps. Since then, he married the former Sarah Ferguson, who
is pregnant, so the current visit promises to be more staid.
   The first event planned for the royal couple is a welcoming
ceremony Saturday at Los Angeles City Hall featuring a performance
by the rock group Los Lobos, which gained fame in the movie ``La
Bamba.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Opponent And Other Mothers Should Stay Home With
Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman with two small children who is
running for election to a judgeship says she's surprised her
opponent has made motherhood an issue in their campaign.
   District Judge John McKellips raised the issue at a sheriff's
deputies' meeting while comparing his qualifications with Mary Anne
Bramblett's.
   Bramblett, an assistant county attorney, has less than six years
experience as a lawyer and is seeking to become the county's first
female state judge. Because there is no Republican candidate, the
winner of their March 8 Democratic primary will capture the 41st
District judge's seat.
   The incumbent judge suggested Bramblett and other mothers should
stay home with their young children.
   ``She had to take some time out for maternity leave to have two
small children, so I don't know how much time she's actually spent
working as an attorney,'' he added Wednesday night.
   The judge also linked absent mothers to the problem of
overcrowded jails and prisons.
   ``What do we do (about crowded prisons)? Well, we can start in
our homes,'' he said. ``Mothers can stay home and raise their
children during the formative years.''
   The judge continued the theme Thursday in an interview with the
El Paso Times.
   ``No one who will be truthful will deny the importance of a
mother being with children during pre-school years,'' he said.
``Other persons may try to substitute and mean well, but there's no
substitute for a mother's love.''
   The judge's views were surprising, Bramblett said.
   ``Everybody got the clear message that (McKellips believes) I am
not qualified to be a judge because I'm a woman and a mother,''
said Bramblett, whose children are 3 and 4 years old.
   The judge's comments to the sheriff's deputies association were
made in the context of crime rates and the cause of crime, he said.
   ``I acknowledge it would have been more correct to have used the
term `parent' rather than mother,'' he said in the Thursday
interview. ``The whole point of this discussion is a breakdown of
parental guidance in the home, whether that breakdown is the fault
of the mother or the father.''
   He said, ``As a district judge, one never has a normal life. To
do your job properly requires long hours and extra devotion, and
she would have less time as a judge to be with her family than she
has had in the past. It appears that Mrs. Bramblett's personal
ambitions are more important to her than the lives of her
children.''
   ``It's not true,'' Bramblett said. ``I think my children have a
very good role model to look up to, both myself and my husband.''

<HEAD>Dapper Bandit Strikes Two Banks In One Day To Bring 10-Year Toll
To 24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man dubbed the ``Dapper Bandit,''
disguised with sunglasses, wig and fake mustache, robbed two banks
in one day to bring his 10-year total in Texas to 24, authorities
said.
   In one robbery, the man disarmed an off-duty police officer
working as a guard and escaped with the officer's pistol, police
said.
   Officials would not disclose the amount taken in the robberies
Thursday, which came four hours and two miles apart. The
well-dresssed robber had been idle since striking a bank in east
Dallas last September.
   In addition to the usual disguise, the well-dressed bandit has
been known to wear bandages on his face. He has been photographed
numerous times by bank cameras and a $25,000 reward has been
posted, but there have been no significant leads, police say.
   The first robbery occurred at First RepublicBank, said Arlington
police spokesman Dee Anderson.
   ``We had an off-duty uniformed officer there working security,''
he said. ``He was approached by the suspect, who pulled a gun and
ordered him to drop his weapon.''
   After picking up officer Eddie Bell's pistol, the bandit,
wearing a gray suit and maroon tie, leaped over the tellers'
counter and scooped up money from cash trays, Anderson said.
   Bell slipped outside and told passers-by to call police. He ran
back in time to see the bandit jump into a car and leave, Anderson
said.
   In the second robbery, at Landmark Bank, the robber pulled a
pistol from a leather briefcase, walked around the tellers' counter
and took money from both tellers' drawers, Anderson said. He fled
out a back door and drove away in a different car.
   Police recovered both getaway cars, both of which had been
stolen in nearby Irving, Anderson said.

   The chief game warden in Zimbabwe's
state-controlled national parks was convicted Friday on charges of
fraud and taking bribes from professional hunters.
   Arthur Wood was sentenced to five years in jail on the charges
of fraud and corruption, in which undervalued permits were issued
for hunting trips on state wildlife estates in return for bribes
from foreign and local hunters.
   Magistrate Billy de Beer ruled in Harare Regional Court that
Wood, 56, defrauded the state of the equivalent of $52,000 by
underpricing hunting permits and taling at least $7,100 in bribes.
Wood denied the charges.
   A Zimbabwe-based professional hunter and safari operator
admitted in court he had offered Wood money for a hunting permit.

   Here is a chronology of major events
in Panama leading to the ouster of the civilian president, Eric
Arturo Devalle, in a showdown with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega:
   April 18, 1978 _ The U.S. Senate ratifies the Panama canal
treaty, which turns over to Panamanian control the 50-mile long
waterway and the U.S. military bases on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Oct. 1, 1979 _ Panama assumes sovereignity over the Panama Canal
Zone and is given the right to use portions of the area not needed
for its defense.
   July 31, 1981 _ Gen. Omar Torrijos, head of the Defense Forces,
who came to power in a 1968 coup, dies in a plane crash. Two years
later Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega emerges as the leader of the
Defense Forces.
   May 6, 1984 _ Nicolas Ardito Barletta is elected president on
the ticket of a military-backed coalition, amid charges of fraud.
   Sep. 27, 1985 _ Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces, and other
military leaders force out Ardito Barletta and replace him with

<HEAD>Brink's Robbery Gang Member Seeks Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the 1950 Brink's robbery gang
who seeking a divorce says his wife can have their house, built on
land he purchased with some of his share of the $1.2 million heist.
   Vincent Costa, 74, told Brockton Probate Court Judge Summer Z.
Kaplan that he bought the land for $1,800 on Nov. 10, 1950.
   When asked by his lawyer where he got the money, Costa replied,
``I got it from the Brink's case.''
   Costa, one of the two surviving members of the 11-member gang,
told the judge his share amounted to about $100,000. A son cheated
him out of most of it, he said.
   The Jan. 17, 1950, robbery of the Brink's counting house in
Boston's North End was then the largest in U.S. history. None of
the money was ever recovered.
   Two of the 11 men involved in the robbery two died before the
FBI solved the case in 1956. The remaining nine were sentenced to
life in prison, but had their sentences commuted after serving
various terms.
   Costa didn't admit his involvement until May 1977, when he and
another participant held a news conference to publicize a book and
a movie about the robbery.
   Costa told the judge this week he wants his wife of 54 years,
Nancy, 76, to spend her remaining years in the home. But, he said,
he or his estate would be entitled to half of the proceeds whenever
the house is sold.
   The house, now valued at $125,000, is the couple's only asset,
her lawyer said.
   Mrs. Costa testified she is a devout Roman Catholic and doesn't
believe in divorce but said she won't oppose it. The couple, both
of whom have serious medical problems, have five children.

<TEXT>
   The United States said today it continues to
recognize Eric Arturo Delvalle as president of Panama, even after a
parliamentary vote to oust him.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, reiterating what
she termed ``our support for the supremacy of civilian
constitutional rule,'' said ``we continue to recognize President
Delvalle as the president of Panama.''
   Asked to describe the legal grounds for such recognition, she
said, ``I don't think it's for us to interpret their constitutional
law. We had regarded him as the president, we still regard him as
the president.''
   She described the situation among Panamanian political figures
as one of ``a great deal of political maneuvering.''
   She said Delvalle's decision to fire Manuel Antonio Noriega as
the nation's defense chief _ which precipated Delvalle's ouster by
the assembly _ ``took great courage and we continue with our
policy.''
   The spokeswoman said Delvalle made the decision on his own,
though she acknowledged that U.S. officials were in close contact
with him. She declined to reveal the substance of the discussions.
   Mrs. Oakley also said the United States continues to recognize
Juan B. Sosa as Panama's ambassador in Washington. Sosa has
supported Delvalle.
   ``I informed the state department that I will continue with
him,'' Sosa said, referring to his support for Delvalle.
   ``I'm sure they will try to send another ambassador,'' he said,
adding that he had asked for continued recognition by the U.S.
government.
   Mrs. Oakley said Elliot Abrams, the assistant secretary of state
for Inter-American affairs, met with Sosa this morning, but she
wouldn't reveal details of the discussion.
   ``Many people knew that we had been aware of the actions that
President Delvalle was contemplating doing,'' she said. ``We had
been informed that the decision was President Delvalle's own to
make.''
   ``I'm not going to get into who was behind what; who said
what,'' she said. ``This is obviously an unstable period,
confused.''
   ``The situation there obviously has to clarify,'' she said.
   Asked if the United States had been in contact with Noriega, she
said, ``not that I'm aware of.''

<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson complains that he is being held
to a higher standard than his rivals but the political world is in
awe over how he gets away with controversial statements that would
sink other presidential hopefuls.
   ``The man is Tefloned,'' says Republican consultant Ed Mahe.
``He is Tefloned so well with his base that he's not taking any
hits as a consequence of what he says.''
   But Mahe and other experts say Robertson's controversial
pronouncements are likely to sink whatever hopes he holds of
winning over enough mainstream support in the Republican Party to
be a serious contender for the presidential nomination at the GOP
convention in August.
   ``Ultimately this could be his upending,'' said sociologist
Anson Shupe of Indiana, co-author of a forthcoming book,
``Televangelism: Power and Politics in God's Country.''
   ``If Robertson doesn't make it to the nomination, it won't be
because of a lack of money or grassroots organization or definable
issues or momentum, it will be because he is so far out in left
field with some of these statements that even his followers are
embarrassed,'' Shupe said.
   Even Ronald Reagan, who has often stood corrected, ridiculed
Robertson's claim that his Christian Broadcasting Network had
information about the location of hostages in the Middle East.
   ``Isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever
apprised of that?'' asked the president at his news conference
Wednesday, in a departure from his loyalty to the Republican 11th
Commandment: Speak no evil of any Republican.
   Robertson said his hostage claim was only a ``throwaway line''
to illustrate a point, but he complained wherever he went that he
is being held to an unfair scrutiny.
   ``I have been grossly misunderstood and the press has distorted
what I've said,'' he said in Tulsa, Okla.
   ``I don't go around with a press person on one side and a lawyer
on another and a librarian behind me,'' Robertson said. ``I'm not
used to having to give 200 answers every time there's one little
innocent statement.''
   Exactly right, Mahe said. ``What we have here is a talk-show
host who doesn't understand the power of talk; after all, when
you're a talk-show host you toss these things out and who cares.''
   ``My guess is that Pat is deliberately playing to his South
Carolina constituency,'' said University of Virginia sociologist
Jeffrey Hadden, a student of the television fundamentalist
preachers. ``He doesn't care if folks in New York or Chicago or Los
Angeles think he's crazy at this point. If he can get the press
bashing him a bit, it would help ignite his followers.''
   Just as Robertson weathered the hostage crisis this week, he
survived the missile crisis earlier this month.
   When he claimed there were Soviet missiles in Cuba, the Pentagon
denied it, the White House denied it, even Fidel Castro denied it,
and Robertson merely shrugged off the outcry, saying he hoped those
doing the denying were right.
   He also suggested he saw the sinister hand of Vice President
George Bush behind the timing of the disclosures of sexual
misbehavior by a fellow fundamentalist preacher, Jimmy Swaggart.
   And he accused television anchorman Tom Brokaw of engaging in
``religious bigotry'' when Brokaw referred to Robertson, a former
television evangelist, as a former television evangelist.
   Bush challenged Robertson on Friday to ``prove it'' about his
claim that Bush engineered the timing of the Swaggart disclosures
to hurt Robertson's chances in the March 5 South Carolina primary.
And the vice president said Robertson is ``scaring the American
people'' with loose talk about missiles.
   Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution student of the press and
politics, said Robertson's ability to weather attacks on his
credibility _ ``the Teflon factor'' _ exists because the press has
been easy on him.
   ``The media gets tough on people when they become important,''
he said.
   Moreover, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the
University of Virginia who has followed Robertson for decades:
``The other Republican candidates are hesitant to attack him. Even
Bush has done so gingerly. The Republicans know they need his
constituency in the fall; they know these people are easily
offended and will stay permanently offended.''

<HEAD>Polish Bishops Urge More Rights For Private Enterprise, Unions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops on
Friday said time was running out for communist authorities to bring
sweeping economic and political reforms to Poland.
   Among the reforms they called for are constitutional guarantees
for private enterprise and the right of workers to form independent
trade unions.
   The bishops also said they viewed with ``seriousness and
concern'' the impact of price hikes imposed by the government
earlier this month. They said authorities must protect pensioners,
invalids and poor families from ``further impoverishment.''
   The bishops made their remarks in a communique released after a
two-day meeting of the Polish episcopate in Warsaw presided over by
the Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp.
   The communique reflected growing concern within the influential
church about the authorities' slow pace in introducing political
and economic reforms announced last fall.
   The bishops quoted extensively from the recent encyclical issued
by Pope John Paul II on social action.
   They cited passages saying that the development and well-being
of nations depends on guaranteeing the right to undertake economic
initiatives at the expense of bureaucratic state apparatuses,
respecting human rights including the freedom to set up trade
unions, and reforming unjust political institutions.
   Glemp, in a pastoral letter read aloud in the nation's churches
Feb. 21, said the many ``shortcomings'' in Poland's economic system
had embittered and discouraged people, while the government's
economic recovery program seemed ``incomprehensible'' and
``inconsistent'' to many Poles.
   The bishops said there had been many official announcements
about introducing reforms aimed at allowing more political and
economic initiatives. But they had remained ``in the sphere of
declarations and discussions.''
   ``Administrative practice often goes in the opposite direction,
setting a dam for various economic and social initiatives,'' the
bishops said. ``Time is running out.''
   ``It is only acts that can convince the society about the real
wish of reforms in the economic, social and political life,'' they
said. ``Without them there is a danger of deepening the crisis in
our country.''
   The bishops said the authorities should make it easier for
individuals to set up their own businesses, grant more economic
decision-making powers to local governments, and reject ``political
criteria'' in the selection of managerial personnel.
   ``It is necessary to widen the role of the private sector in the
national economy,'' the bishops said.
   They added that the economic reforms should be accompanied by
``wide reforms ... allowing (the society) to organize independent
social associations and workers' representations.''
   The government has said its political and economic reform
programs advocate many of the same goals supported by the bishops.
   The outlawed Solidarity labor union has called the reforms
inadequate because they fail to loosen the Communist Party's grip
on economic and political decision-making powers.

   President Reagan said today the United States
does not plan any military intervention in Panama and the State
Department reaffirmed U.S. support for that nation's embattled
president.
   At the White House, Reagan was asked about the governmental
crisis in Panama, where President Eric Arturo Delvalle failed in
his attempt to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's
strongman, and was in turn dismissed himself.
   ``There are some limits on what we can do, but we are looking at
the situation to see if there is anything we can do,'' the
president said.
   When asked if military intervention was planned, he said, ``No,
I don't think that's the answer.''
   ``We are not prepared to come up with any answer yet,'' Reagan
added.
   When he was asked whether he thought the 10,000 or so U.S.
troops in Panama were in danger, the president replied, ``No, I do
not. I don't think there is any appetite on the part of anyone
there, including Mr. Noriega, to take on our troops.''
   Separately, the State Department said it continues to recognize
Devalle as Panama's president despite an early-morning
parliamentary vote to oust him.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley reiterated what she termed
``our support for the supremacy of civilian constitutiona rule,''
and said, ``We continue to recognize President Delvalle as the
president.''
   Asked to describe the legal grounds for such recognition, she
said, ``I don't think it's for us to interpret their constitutional
law. We had regarded him as the president, we still regard him as
the president.''
   In other developments:
   _Panama's ambassador to the United States, Juan Sosa, an ally of
Delvalle, said he had informed the State Department he would stay
on, at least for the time being, despite a call from Noriega
telling Sosa he would be replaced.
   Mrs. Oakley said the United States does, indeed, continue to
recognize Sosa.
   _Vice President George Bush said in South Carolina that the
United States should do ``whatever is necessary, including military
force'' to protect American interests.
   Bush stopped short of calling for military intervention, saying
the United States' history of intervention in Latin American
affairs is ``what's hurting us in some areas now.''
   During a presidential campaign visit to South Carolina, he said,
``We will do whatever is necessary to protect American interests in
Panama. We've got treaty interests on the (Panama) canal. I don't
want to rattle any sabers. ...''
   _Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, interviewed on a U.S.
Information Agency program, also said that ``it would be premature
at this time'' to discuss an American military move.
   _Jose I. Blandon, a former Noriega ally but now a leading
Panamanian dissident, predicted that Noriega would be out of power
within three weeks and said Delvalle's allies have already asked
the Dominican Republic if it would let Noriega live there if and
when he is forced out.
   He said Dominican officials have responded positively to the
proposal.
   Reagan said the United States did not instigate Delvalle's
action, but had been ``very much aware of it.''
   When asked whether the United States still wants Noriega to
stand trial on drug trafficking charges on which he was indicted by
a federal grand jury in Miami, the president said, ``I assume so.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier that
Delvalle had consulted with American officials at the U.S. Embassy
in Panama City.
   ``We have had discussions with Delvalle over the past several
days. We assured him of our position, which is that we would like
to see a peaceful transition to civilian rule,'' the spokesman said.
   Asked whether the United States had encouraged Delvalle to
dismiss Noriega, who has been indicted by a federal grand jury in
this country on charges of drug trafficking, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater replied:
   ``I can't elaborate on any of the specific conversations. We did
not urge him to take this action. He did it on his own. ...
   ``We have a precarious position. Yes, we want him (Noriega) to
stand trial. Yes, we want a civilian government in Panama. Yet, we
want to be careful not to unduly intrude upon the affairs of
Panama.''
   Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the United States would ``take steps'' if Americans are endangered
in Panama.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leading Noriega critic,
said, ``Panamanians will take care of that themselves. Just wait
and see what happens if and when the United States takes a
flatfooted stand and tells the Panamanian president, we're with you
and we're against him,'' Helms said.
   He said of Noreiga: ``He's a bum; he ought to be thrown out.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., proposed a trade embargo against
the government under the control of military strongman Manuel
Noriega and called for U.S. troops to be put on full alert to
protect the Panama Canal and 50,000 U.S. citizens in the country.
   Fitzwater said no consideration is being given to a trade
embargo.
   Delvalle, in a telephone interview with ``CBS This Morning,''
indicated he still considers himself president and urged a U.S.
trade embargo against his country as ``the only way that we can get
rid of the dictators of the Americas'' but said he saw no reason
for military intervention.
   The Reagan administration on Thursday voiced ``unqualified
support for civilian constitutional rule'' in Panama after Delvalle
tried to fire Noriega as military chief.

<HEAD>Bush Tells Robertson to `Prove It'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush said Friday that Republican
presidential rival Pat Robertson should produce evidence to back up
rash allegations that the vice president said were ``scaring the
American people.''
   Bush, in a forceful response to the former television
evangelist, recounted several allegations that Robertson has made
against Bush and his Republican presidential campaign.
   Of each he demanded, ``prove it.''
   Bush made the remarks in an address to state newspaper editors.
He was less direct about Robertson moments later in a private
meeting with about two dozen fundamentalist church leaders but told
them ``I believe in Jesus Christ as my personal savior.''
   ``I don't like to feel there's a monolith out there'' that will
back just one candidate for president, he said.
   Bush and Robertson have both targeted South Carolina as a
crucial battleground in their White House bids, with Robertson
saying he must win the March 5 primary.
   A group of 21 congressmen supporting Bush flew into South
Carolina to spend the day campaigning for him as the vice president
departed for Atlanta after a two-day campaign swing here. Appearing
with the congressmen, who donned white baseball-style caps bearing
the words ``Bush '88,'' the vice president said, ``These guys can
talk Southern.''
   South Carolina holds its GOP primary just three days before the
rest of the South votes, and Bush forces hope a win here will be a
indicator of the Super Tuesday vote that follows, when one-third of
the GOP delegates are at stake.
   Answering questions from the South Carolina Press Association,
Bush was asked about Robertson's charges in the state earlier in
the week that the Bush campaign had engaged in ``sleazy''
campaigning and ``dirty tricks'' against the Robertson campaign. He
also was asked about Robertson's suggestion that Bush aides
engineered the release of information about the sex scandal
involving evangelist Jimmy Swaggart to embarrass Robertson.
   ``No,'' Bush said. ``If you make such an allegation, the
American sense of fair play says, prove it.''
   ``I have something to do with arranging for the Assembly of God
(church) to bring out information two weeks before the South
Carolina primary?'' Bush asked, referring to the Swaggart charge.
``Forgive me. Prove it. That's all I say.''
   Bush asked why his questioner was smiling, saying the nature of
the allegations by Robertson were serious. In recounting them, Bush
included Robertson's claim in a debate in New Hampshire two weeks
ago that nuclear missiles are hidden in Cuba.
   ``If you think there's Cuban missiles _ scaring the American
people _ what's your facts?'' Bush said.
   He also cited Robertson's claim in backing out of a debate in
Dallas last week that questions had been leaked in advance and the
audience was stacked against him. ``Prove it,'' Bush said.
   Bush told the church leaders he had ``respect for life'' and had
been frustrated by the administration's lack of success in
supporting prayer in public schools.
   ``I know we're pluralistic. I also know we're one nation under
God. I feel strongly about that,'' Bush said. ``... I would not be
afraid of asking God's help.''
   Before the editors, Bush cited the developments in Panama and
said the United States would use military force if necessary to
protect U.S. interests in Panama following strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's removal of the nation's president.
   ``Noriega's gone bad, and he's proven he's trafficked in
narcotics,'' Bush said. ``... Noriega should go and in my view he
will go.''
   Bush referred to the American hostages in Lebanon and said a
problem in helping recover them has been that ``many of our sources
(in Lebanon) dried up because of the excessive publicity and
exposure'' of the CIA in the 1970s. ``That's hurt us very, very
badly,'' the former CIA director said.

<HEAD>Jackson Was Polite, Ate Flowers During Rehearsals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Michael Jackson showed a real
fondness for flowers, both as decorations and as dinner, when he
stayed at a hotel here for two weeks as he rehearsed for his
national tour, workers say.
   Jackson last week concluded his secretive rehearsals at the
Pensacola Civic Center and kicked off the tour in Kansas City this
week.
   During his stay in the Presidential Suite of the Pensacola
Hilton, workers refused to talk about him, but the wall of silence
lifted when he left.
   ``Michael's chef, Damien, visited my flower shop daily, pointed
and said, `I'll have that, that and that,''' said Gehrig Galloway,
owner of Gehrig's flower shop at the Hilton.
   Spray orchids, anthuriam, birds of paradise, calla and ribrum
lillies were some of the flowers ordered by Damien, a chef from the
Los Angeles Hilton who joined the Jackson entourage 12 weeks ago.
   ``I walked into the kitchen once when Damien was cooking,'' said
Thaisa Betts-Hester, the hotel's room division manager. ``Damien
was cooking with an odd-looking flower with brown petals that he
kept in a Zip-loc bag. I asked him what was in the bag and he said,
`flowers.'
   ``Damien ordered about $50 worth of flowers every day, but I
don't know if Michael ate them all.''
   Jackson also ordered 32 cases of Evian mineral water for
drinking and bathing, baby corn, fresh herbs and sun-dried tomatoes
from Orlando, hotel employees said. He had a portable dance floor
installed in his suite's living room and was a polite guest, they
said.
   Of the famous people who have stayed at the hotel, including
Elizabeth Taylor and Bob Hope, Jackson ordered the most flowers,
Galloway said.
   ``When Michael left, I went up to the Presidential Suite to
collect the vases and they were everywhere, everywhere,'' he said.
   The entertainer, a vegetarian, ate a normal breakfast of orange
juice and toast, but for dinner Damien cooked seven different
dishes for him so he would have a choice, Galloway said. He said
some of Jackson's favorites were vegetable pizza and meatless
Mexican and Cajun entrees.
   ``Damien wrote the names of the food on cards and then decorated
Michael's plates and fruit trays with flowers,'' Galloway said.
   ``He had a nutritionist with him all the time and what he ate
each day depended on his energy output,'' said Ken Dyer, the
Hilton's executive chef.
   While Jackson has a reputation for shyness he wasn't totally
inhibited, said Kathy Dyson, the hotel's executive housekeeper.
   One night, she said, Jackson sprayed a can of purple, gooey
substance down the hallway of the 14th floor.

   Veteran rocker Frank Zappa will be made an
honorary secretary of state next month for the voter registration
drives he stages at his concerts.
   Secretary of State Sherrod Brown said he would present the
Grammy nominee with the title when Zappa plays in Columbus next
month.
   Brown, who talked with the singer Wednesday night, said workers
would have voter registration tables at Zappa's March 6 concert at
Veterans Memorial Hall. He said he might do the same thing at
Zappa's concert in Cleveland the night before.
   ``I don't know a lot of his songs, but I guess he's got a new
song out about fundamentalist preachers called `Jesus Thinks You're
a Jerk,''' said Brown, who confessed to seeing Zappa perform as a
warm-up act to Chuck Berry in 1971.
   Zappa, 46, made national news in 1985 as an outspoken critic of
the Parents Music Resources Center, which wanted to put warning
labels on records with sexually explicit lyrics. His album ``Jazz
From Hell'' has been nominated for Grammys in jazz and rock
instrumental categories.

   The Fund has been working in Mozambique for the past four years,
concentrating particularly on the central province of Zambezia, one
of the areas hit hardest by drought and th 12-year-old guerrilla

   Cassini, 74, the oldest man ever to be given a driving license
in harness racing, led wire to wire on Hi Po Bay Myst Thursday,
said track spokeswoman Lauren Fundler.
   ``I feel great,'' Cassini said in the winner's circle. ``I am

   Cassini, who said he decided to try his hand at professional
racing after doing well in several charity races, was coming off an

physician said the designer's blood pressure was too high after the

   Cassini placed fifth in another outing Thursday.
   Hi Po Bay Myst paid $22.20, $13.40 and $7, Ms. Fundler said.

   Movie producer Darryl F. Zanuck's daughter
has filed a malicious prosecution suit against her late father's
mistress, who had contested the movie czar's will.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in Indio Superior Court by Darrylin
Zanuck de Pineda, seeks unspecified damages against Genevieve
Gillaizeau, 41, of New York, for alleged malicious prosecution. It
also seeks unspecified damages against her attorneys for allegedly
failing ``to investigate the facts and law.''
   Zanuck, a co-founder of the 20th Century Fox studio, died in
1979. According to court papers, he and Ms. Gillaizeau were
romantically involved from 1965 to 1973 while he was married to
Virginia Fox Zanuck.
   Ms. Gillaizeau claimed Zanuck suffered from Alzheimer's disease
and was influenced by his family to change his will in October
1973, eliminating her as an heir to his estate, valued at $3.4
million. An earlier will had left her 40 percent of the estate.
   Ms. de Pineda's suit claims the former mistress falsely accused
her of exerting undue influence on her father to change the 1973
will.
   Zanuck's will was settled Jan. 8, after Ms. Gillaizeau provided
that her claim on the estate would be given to Yeshiva University
in New York. The university received a $50,000 payment.

   Italy's minister of culture says he won't approve
construction of a four-lane highway adjacent to Pompeii's famous
ruins and across the ancient city's unexcavated necropolis.
   Carlo Vizzini, whose ministry protects and preserves
archaeological sites, said Thursday that ``in no case'' will he
approve a project ``that not only edges, but minimally touches''
excavations at Pompeii.
   Some members of Pompeii's city government proposed reducing
traffic congestion in the modern city by linking two existing
highways with a new one streching a little more than a mile along
the famous tourist attraction.
   Opponents argue the exhaust and viabrations will damage the
ancient stones, and that the highway will prevent excavation of
Roman archaeological treasures in the necropolis.
   The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried the city of
Pompeii.
   Guiseppe Galasso, a member of Parliament from the town of
Pozzuoli in the shadow of the volcano, calls the highway proposal
``the kiss of death'' for the ruins.

   Britain has agreed to accept a Chinese offer of

   Foreign Office minister Timothy Eggar told the House of Commons

   Britain had originally claimed $840 million for lost assets in
China, ranging from a chocolate factory and the Shanghai race club
to racing saddles, polo sticks, bathing huts and bonds.
   Britain has settled claims against the world's two major
Communist powers.
   The Soviet Union began payment last year of about $81 million on
claims originally totaling $1.8 billion from the 1917 revolution.
   Communist Bulgaria has agreed to pay Britain $1.76 million.
Claims against Albania and East Germany are still unsettled.

   The founder of a boys acrobatic troupe
that gained a national audience has been charged with 14 counts of
sexual abuse involving youngsters in his organization.
   Robert Lee ``Flippo'' Morris, 35, was indicted Wednesday on five
counts of aggravated rape, six counts of aggravated sexual battery
and three counts of crimes against nature, said District Attorney
General Gary Gerbitz.
   The charges concern nine boys, age 9 to 16, who were members of
the Flippo Morris Tumblers, said Ardena Garth, special child abuse
prosecutor for Hamilton County.
   Over the years, the Tumblers have had as many as 150 members and
gained a wide following, performing at school carnivals and during
halftime of University of Tennessee-Chattanooga basketball games.
In 1982, they appeared at the Knoxville World's Fair and on the NBC
television program ``Real People.''
   Morris, former director of a city recreation center, started his
troupe in 1972 with about 30 boys from Chattanooga's inner city.
His program has been so highly regarded that Hamilton County
Juvenile Court has referred some boys to it and even put some
offenders in his custody.
   An investigation was started when the city received a complaint
in July, said Ms. Garth. When more complaints were made, the
Tennessee Department of Human Services and Gerbitz's office joined
the investigation.
   Morris surrendered Thursday and was jailed in lieu of $90,000
bond.

<HEAD>Texas Incinerator To Burn Cancer-Causing Pesticide Next Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Friday its contractors would begin burning leftover stocks of the
banned pesticide ethylene dibromide, EDB, in Texas next month.
   The agency paid $2.8 million to buy up 328,000 gallons of EDB
after banning the pesticide as an emergency action in early 1984.
Under federal law, EPA must pay for stocks of products that cannot
be sold because of an emergency ban. There have been only three
such actions in the agency's 16-year history of pesticide
regulation.
   EPA has stored much of the EDB at Douglas Chemical Co. in
Liberty, Mo., and will continue to receive certain forms of the
chemical there for transfer to rail cars for shipment to Deer Park,
Texas, about 15 miles East of Houston.
   EDB formulations containing methyl bromide or chloropicrin will
be accepted at the Rollins Environmental Services Co. incinerator
at Deer Park. People holding those stocks should get shipping
instructions in the next two weeks, EPA said.
   EDB is used to kill worms in soil, as a fumigant for grain and
fruit and as an additive for leaded gasoline. It causes cancer and
birth defects, EPA believes.
   A test burn showed that 99.999 percent of the EDB was destroyed
by the incinerator, the agency said.

   ``I've only raised $6,000 so far'' for cancer research, said

   She hopes to remain three-stories high for another month to

   ``If people see it's for a good cause and take two minutes to

fugitive from a college exhibit.
   ``We were sitting by the table eating our evening meal, and here
this snake came crawling over the floor, its red tongue sticking
out,'' said Upstad. ``What would you think?''
   The snake, Lucille, and a companion python, Mr. Twister, were

authorities said Thursday.
   A 17-year-old boy who lived in an apartment across the hall from

Twister was recovered from the youth's apartment, but Lucille
remained at large until she slithered across the Upstads' floor
late Wednesday night.
   Upstad beat the snake with a hoe and later tossed it into a
snowbank, but he learned later it was revived after neighbors
alerted authorities.
   The snakes are favorites of Concordia biology instructor Elinor
Torstveit. She could not be reached for comment Friday, but her
husband, Olaf, said he and another Concordia biology teacher
identified Lucille for police and returned her to the college

<TEXT>
   Politicians said Friday that Kurt
Waldheim's decision not to address the main ceremony will ease
tensions when Austria marks the 50th anniversary of the Anschluss
that made it part of Nazi Germany.
   Two Socialist members of the Cabinet had said they wouldn't
attend the ceremony March ll and two others said they also might
stay away if the president spoke.
   Socialist Party leaders have said it would be inappropriate for
Waldheim, who faces unresolved accusations of war crimes, to lead
the nation in remembering atrocities of the Nazi past. The party is
the senior partner in Austria's governing coalition.
   Waldheim announced Thursday that he was canceling the speech,
and said in a television interview later: ``I thought that with
this decision, which was my own initiative I might add, I would
contribute to the orderly carrying out of the solemn ceremony.''
   Heinz Fischer, Socialist floor leader in Parliament, said Friday
that Waldheim's decision ``will lead to an easing of tension on
March 11'' and it ``certainly was the most reasonable thing'' to do.
   Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina, also a Socialist, withdrew
his decision to boycott the March 11 ceremony.
   In the television interview, Waldheim repeated his intention to
remain in the presidency, which is largely ceremonial, and insisted
that resigning would make matters worse.
   He also repeated criticism of a report on his wartime activities
by an international panel of historians, declaring it ``full of
contradictions'' and errneous presumptions.
   Waldhim concealed his World War II service as a German army
lieutenant in the Balkans until accusations arose during the
presidential campaign in 1986 that he had committed war crimes.
   The United States put the former U.N. secretary-general on a
``watch list'' of undesirable aliens last year, and in September
the government appointed the historians at Waldheim's request.
   They said in their report this month that Waldheim was ``in
close proximity'' to atrocities, knew of them and did not try to
prevent them. The historians said they found no proof that he
committed war crimes, but left the question of personal guilt open.

Vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just
one of many continued steps to resolve this long-standing
humanitarian issue,'' the Pentagon said.
   The upcoming repatriation would be the fourth largest such
transfer since the end of the war. The largest occurred in August
1985, when the Vietnamese returned 26 remains at once.
   There are currently 2,404 Americans still listed as missing in
Indochina as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,767 are listed
as missing in either North or South Vietnam. All told, the remains
of 152 Americans have been repatriated to the United States and
subsequently identified by the laboratory since the end of the war.
   The upcoming transfer would be the third since retired Army Gen.
John Vessey traveled to Hanoi last August as a special presidential
emissary, hoping to step up the process of accounting for missing
Americans.

<HEAD>Outspoken Federal Judge Dead at Age 87</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Harold Cox, a federal judge who
enraged civil rights advocates with his remarks about blacks but
presided over a 1967 trial that convicted eight Klansmen of
murdering three civil rights workers, has died at the age of 87.
   Cox died of natural causes Thursday night at his home here, a
family spokesman said.
   ``He was a real colorful and effective-type judge who was his
own man,'' former Gov. Bill Waller said of Cox. ``He was strictly
independent in interpreting the law and in carrying out court
proceedings as he wanted to do it. He left his mark on the
judiciary of our state.''
   Gov. Ray Mabus agreed, saying Cox ``had an impact on
Mississippi.''
   Cox, the son of a Sunflower County sheriff, built a successful
practice in corporate and civil law before he became a U.S.
District Court judge in 1961. He was an active judge until July
1983.
   In the course of his judicial career, Cox was attacked by the
National Assocation for the Advancement of Colored People and
others for his remarks about blacks, segregation and civil rights.
   During a hearing on a voter discrimination suit in 1964, Cox
said: ``I don't know who is telling these Negroes they can push
people around just by getting into a line and acting like a bunch
of chimpanzees.''
   The remark triggered a demand for his impeachment by U.S. Sen.
Jacob Javits, R-N.Y., and U.S. Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., but there
never was an impeachment proceeding.
   Cox also disdained the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and said in
court, ``I don't know anybody down here who don't oppose it.''
   When a civil rights attorney complained in 1971 that a
decades-old mural behind the bench depicted blacks as serfs to
white people, Cox retorted loudly, ``Well, it will remain in this
court whether you like it or not.''
   In 1967, Cox presided over one of the most famous cases of the
decade _ the trial of eight Klansmen charged in the 1964 murders of
three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Miss.
   After the jury seemed deadlocked for two days, Cox ordered them
to come up with a verdict. The jury found the eight Klansmen guilty.
   Survivors include a son and a daughter.

<HEAD>Immigration Official: Any Cuban Criminal Can Be Deported</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuban immigrants who commit crimes in the United
States can be shipped back to their homeland, even if they have
obtained U.S. citizenship, a top Immigration and Naturalization
Service official said.
   The U.S.-Cuban immigration agreement reached in November does
not limit those eligible for deportation to the 2,500 Cuban
detainees in federal prisons, INS commissioner Alan Nelson said
Thursday.
   His comments appeared in Friday's editions of The Miami Herald.
   Nelson attended an academic conference in Washington, D.C.,
examining the 1980 Mariel boatlift of Cubans to the United States
and the status of Cuban detainees in U.S. prisons.
   ``Any Cuban who commits a crime, whether he is a resident or
citizen of the United States, and if the law so sees fit, can be
deported,'' Nelson said.
   Advocates for Cuban prisoners immediately criticized Nelson's
statements.
   ``Cuban deportation and what Nelson is doing, representing the
government's politics, is scandalous and truly unjustifiable,''
said Steven Donziger, a member of the Cuban Detainees Support
Coalition in Atlanta.
   The immigration pact with Cuba allows the deportation of 2,500
Mariel detainees who have committed crimes in the United States. In
turn, the United States agreed to allow about 20,000 Cubans and
3,000 political prisoners to immigrate every year.
   News of the agreement triggered riots by Cuban detainees at
prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La.
   The pact was aimed at normalizing immigration, Nelson said.
   ``There would be no purpose in sending 2,500 refugees back now
and not be able to deport anyone else in the future for committing
crimes,'' he said.

   The widow of Challenger astronaut Michael
Smith cannot sue the government for $1.5 billion in damages because
her husband was on military duty when the space shuttle exploded,
killing him and six others, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett cited earlier court
decisions holding that military personnel or their dependents could
not sue the government for injury or death while on active service.
   Smith, the Challenger's pilot, was a Navy captain who was
assigned to NASA in 1981.
   ``Smith's death occurred during activity incident to his
military service,'' the judge said in removing the federal
government as a defendant in the suit filed by Jane J. Smith.
   The judge also agreed with government lawyers who argued that
military personnel ``receive generous statutory veterans'
disability and death benefits.''
   Mrs. Smith's lawyers had argued that her husband was not on
regular military assignment and had no military duties at the time
of his death.
   The order, filed this week in U.S. District Court in Orlando,
maintained Morton Thiokol Inc. as the principal defendant in the
civil lawsuit. Morton Thiokol built the solid-fuel booster rocket
blamed for the explosion that destroyed the space shuttle on
liftoff at Cape Canaveral on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since then.
   The families of the other six victims have accepted financial
settlements, four from Morton Thiokol and the government and two
from Morton Thiokol alone.
   Ms. Fawsett also dismissed one count in the Smith lawsuit
seeking to bar Morton Thiokol from supplying NASA with any other
booster rockets. The court, she said, had no jurisdiction in any of
the counts involving the federal government.
   In a separate action on Thursday, the judge denied a request by
Mrs. Smith and her attorneys to transfer her lawsuit from Orlando
to the federal court in Richmond, Va. The judge did not explain the
order.
   Mrs. Smith had sought to move the case because of a heavy
caseload in the court system here and because she now lives in
Virginia Beach, Va.
   Kerry Nesbit, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Smith's lawyer, William F.
Maready, said the lawyer was considering appealing the judge's
order Monday dismissing the federal government from the lawsuit.
   Another defendant named in the Smith lawsuit is Lawrence B.
Mulloy, manager of NASA's solid booster rocket program at Marshall
Space Flight Center at the time of the Challenger disaster. Federal
attorneys have filed a motion seeking his removal from the case,
but Ms. Fawsett has issued no decision.
   U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said the
government contends that Mulloy was acting in an official capacity
for an agency of the government, and therefore cannot be sued.

<HEAD>Wildlife Officials Announce Panther Reintroduction Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five wild cougars or mountain lions
from Texas will be released in a forest in northeastern Florida to
see if the closely related but endangered Florida panther can
survive there, wildlife officials said Friday.
   If the re-introduction plan succeeds, the Florida panther could
be roaming the Osceola National Forest by the next decade, they
said.
   The big cats will be fitted and radio collars and sterilized
before they are released in April or May in the forest north of
Lake City, said Tom Logan, chief of the bureau of wildlife research
for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   The Osceola National Forest was selected because of its size,
habitat and food base. The surviving population of Florida panthers
now is largely confined to southern Florida in the Everglades and
Big Cypress National Preserve, although sightings have been
reported around Lake Okeechobee and inland from Cape Canaveral.
   It is impossible to use Florida panthers for the first phases of
the project because only a few dozen of them survive, Logan said.
   ``We don't have enough to experiment with,'' Logan said.
   After the one-year experiment, the five cougars will be removed
from the area and the second phase of the project will begin, with
the release of captive-born cougars or hybrid offspring of a
Florida panther and a cougar.
   So far, attempts to mate Big Guy, a Florida panther injured
several years ago by a car, with female cougars at White Oak
Plantation near Yulee have been unsuccessful.
   ``He's more aggressive than in past years. We have our fingers
crossed,'' said Chris Belden, an official with the panther project.
   If the first two phases of the project are successful, the final
phase would be the introduction of Florida panthers into the area.
   ``Each phase of the proposed experiment is structured to enable
us to identify and deal with any problems that might come up. And
the radio collars would enable us to locate and remove any of the
cats at any time we believe is necessary,'' Logan said.
   The plan calls for livestock owners to be paid for any losses
caused by the cats.
   Wildlife officials said they plan no special hunting season
restrictions for the benefit of the cats, but said it is unlikely
that people will ever see the animals.
   ``They are very reclusive animals and the likelihood of
interaction is very, very slim,'' said Logan.

   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will not take part
in the Supreme Court's deliberations on the constitutionality of a
federal law authorizing independent counsels to investigate alleged
crimes by government officials, a court spokeswoman said Friday.
   Spokeswoman Toni House said Kennedy, who joined the court on
Feb. 18, removed himself from consideration of the case without
stating a reason.
   His absence creates the possibility of a 4-4 tie when the
court's ruling, expected by July, is announced.
   If that occurs, the deadlock would have the effect of nullifying
the law because it would uphold a decision by the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here that declared the statute unconstitutional
last month.
   The appeals court struck down the Watergate-era law on grounds
that it gives presidential appointment power to the federal courts.
The law authorizes a federal court to appoint a special prosecutor
when the attorney general recommends an independent investigation
of a high-ranking official accused of a crime.
   The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case April 26 in an
appeal by independent counsel Alexia Morrison, who is investigating
former Justice Department official Theodore B. Olson on charges he
lied to Congress.
   The perjury conviction of former White House aide Michael K.
Deaver also could stand or fall depending on the court ruling.
   Kennedy's decision not to take part in the case prompted
speculation that he may have been concerned about old ties to
President Reagan and his aides, including Deaver, who have been
targets of independent counsel investigations.
   Kennedy did some work for Reagan when he was governor of
California. At the time, Kennedy was a lawyer in Sacramento,
Calif., later to be named a federal appeals court judge there.
   Two other investigations that could be affected by the high
court's ruling on the special prosecutor law are a probe of the
Iran-Contra affair and another that resulted in the Feb. 11
conviction for illegal lobbying of former White House aide Lyn
Nofziger.
   But the special prosecutors in both those investigations
received parallel authority from Attorney General Edwin Meese III
that could insulate their investigations from the constitutional
attack on the independent counsel law. There is uncertainty in both
cases because the investigations began before the back-up authority
was conferred.

   A new study shows that sugarbeet production
costs in 1984 were lowest in the Midwest and highest in some
western areas, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The study involved seven regions that produce nearly all the
U.S. sugarbeets. About 8,700 farms produce beets in the seven
regions. Overall, the department's Economic Research Service
reported that it cost an average of $30.30 per net ton to produce
beets. The range, however, was between $24 and $35 per ton.
   ``About 60 percent of the 1984 U.S. sugarbeet crop was produced
at a cost below the U.S. average price support of $31.63 per ton,''
the report said. ``The producers received a weighted average price
of $33.90 a net ton, ranging from $23.30 in Region 3 (Colorado,
Nebraska and southeastern Wyoming) to $37.10 in Region 6 (eastern
Idaho).''
   Most beet producers in Region 3 operated at a loss because of
the closing of several processing plants by the Great Western Sugar
Co., the report said.
   The study of 1984 costs, by region, showed:
   _Region 1, Michigan and Ohio, 10.8 percent of the U.S. sugarbeet
acreage; government support of $27.79 per net ton; actual price
received by growers, $32.95 per ton; average cost of production,
$24.02 per ton.
   _Region 2, Minnesota and eastern North Dakota, 35.2 percent of
the U.S. acreage; support of $32.24 per ton; actual price received
by growers, $36 per ton; average cost of production, $25.66 per ton.
   _Region 3, Colorado, Nebraska and souteastern Wyoming, 12.8
percent of the acreage; support of $31.23 per ton; actual price
received by growers, $23.30 per ton; average cost of production,
$28.06 per ton.
   _Region 4, New Mexico and Texas, was not included in the study.
   _Region 5, Montana, northwestern Wyoming and northwestern North
Dakota, 5 percent of the acreage; support of $31.37 per ton; actual
price received by growers, $35.40 per ton; average cost of
production, $34.26 per ton.
   _Region 6, eastern Idaho, 7.4 percent of the acreage; support of
$31.05 per ton; actual price received by growers, $37.10 per ton;
average cost of production, $34.87 per ton.
   _Region 7, western Idaho and Oregon, 6.5 percent of the acreage;
support of $31.05 per ton; actual price received by growers, $36.90
per ton; average cost of production, $34.68 per ton.
   _Region 8, California, 18.8 percent of the acreage; support of
$32.98 per ton; actual price received by growers, $35.10 per ton;
average cost of production, $34.57 per ton.

<TEXT>
   A former stockbroker was sentenced Friday to 120
weekends in jail and fined $10,000 for his role in the insider
trading scandal that involved a Wall Street Journal reporter.
   Peter Brant also was placed on probation for five years and
ordered to do 750 hours of community service. U.S. District Judge
Charles E. Stewart did not say what the community service would be.
   Brant, 35, a former broker at Kidder Peabody & Co., pleaded
guilty in 1984 to conspiracy and securities fraud. He admitted his
part in a scheme to trade stock in 24 companies on the basis of
information that was to appear in the Journal's ``Heard on the
Street'' column.
   The material Brant received came from R. Foster Winans, a
Journal reporter who wrote the column. During a five-month period,
the scheme netted almost $700,000, of which Winans got $31,000 and
Brant got most of the rest.
   Winans, whose mail, wire and securities fraud convictions were
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court last November, is serving an
18-month sentence. Brant's sentencing was delayed pending the high
court decision and because of his cooperation in other cases.
   Brant's lawyer, Stephen Weiner, pleaded for leniency, asking
Stewart to consider ``the brutal price already paid'' by his
client. Brant, who now works for a telecommunications company in
West Palm Beach, Fla., has agreed to stay out of the securities
business for life.
   The judge said he found the defendant ``at least as guilty as
Mr. Winans and perhaps more so.''
   Stewart could have sentenced Brant to 15 years in prison and
fined him $30,000, but he took into account Assistant U.S. Attorney
Carl Loewenson's request that he consider Brant's cooperation in
prosecuting two major criminal cases.
   One case Loewenson referred to was the prosecutions of Winans,
Winans' roommate David Carpenter, and former Kidder Peabody broker
Kenneth P. Felis who had roles in the Wall Street Journal trading
scheme.
   Felis is serving six months of weekends and Carpenter was placed
on probation and directed to do community service.
   The second case involved former lawyer David W.C. Clark,
convicted last November of embezzling more than $3.7 million from
clients from 1980 to 1984.
   Clark, who died of chronic alcoholism a few days before he was
to be sentenced, used the embezzled funds to trade securities based
on the insider information Brant passed on to him from the Journal
column.

   A plea of innocent to three misdemeanor
counts of vehicular manslaughter was entered Friday for the driver
of a runaway bus that killed three people and injured 15.
   Salvador Orogo was at the wheel of a commuter bus on Jan. 19
when it pulled out of a terminal during rush hour and plowed
through a crosswalk filled with pedestrians.
   Defense attorney Gilbert Eisenberg entered the pleas for Orogo,
53, who was not in court. He is free on $10,000 bail.
   Orogo surrendered Thursday after an arrest warrant was issued.
District Attorney Arlo Smith said charges were filed when ``it was
determined that the cause of the incident was negligent operation
of the bus by Orogo.''
   Orogo said after the crash that his accelerator had jammed and
his brakes had failed, but investigators said the bus showed no
mechanical defects.
   Authorities said there was no justification for felony charges
in the case because there was no allegation that alcohol or drugs
played a role.

   Michael Dukakis jabbed gingerly at Richard
Gephardt on trade and taxes Friday, saying the 1981 tax cut his
Democratic presidential rival voted for was ``one of the biggest
mistakes in recent American history.''
   Dukakis refrained from directly attacking Gephardt as he pressed
his campaign for Southern support in the multi-state primaries and
caucuses on March 8.
   ``No culprits,'' the Massachusetts governor said with a smile
after delivering his speech to an overflow crowd at the Lyndon
Johnson School of Public Affairs without uttering Gephardt's name.
``Just good, strong, positive efforts to get this country moving
again.''
   Dukakis devoted much of his speech to his campaign message of
``good jobs and real opportunity'' for all, with special emphasis
on the need for education and research. ``It's going to take hard
workers, not high rollers, to get America moving again,'' he said.
   He spoke as he moved through a three-day Southern swing in
advance of the March 8 primaries, most of which will be in Southern
or border states. Aides said he has begun airing television
commercials in targeted areas of Florida and Texas, as well as in
the Baltimore area.
   If Gephardt's name was not mentioned, Dukakis' meaning was clear
when he said in his speech that ``building walls around America''
was a mistake. ``We tried that 60 years ago and it gave us the
worst depression in our history,'' he said.
   Gephardt favors trade legislation that would give the president
authority to retaliate against trading partners that failed to open
up their markets.
   The Missouri congressman also voted for the 1981 Reaganomics tax
cut, which passed with substantial help from Southern Democrats in
the House.
   ``In seven years that one mistake transformed our nation from
the world's largest creditor into the world's largest debtor,''
Dukakis said.
   ``Reaganomics isn't an economic theory; it's theft from our
children,'' he said. ``It's a felony against the future and it has
played the hard-working, tax-paying families of middle America for
fools.''
   The governor's speech reflected at least a temporary decision to
remain above the fray in an increasingly fierce rhetorical battle.
Gephardt sharply attacked Dukakis earlier this week and the
governor said on Thursday his rival ``better watch out'' if he
persisted.
   In his speech, Dukakis said he has no ``Southern strategy'' for
the primaries on March 8. ``The people of Texas and Florida and
Virginia aren't voting for a Zip code. They're voting for a
president of the United States,'' he said.
   But at the same time the Massachusetts governor sought to
re-establish a political bond created 28 years ago when John
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were on the winning ticket in the
national election.
   ``Together, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson inspired a whole
generation,'' he said. ``Ten months ago, in the spirit of JFK and
LBJ, we launched a campaign for the future of America.''

   U.S. companies surveyed by the government
reported a loss of $23.8 billion in 1986 because of foreign piracy
of U.S. patents, trademarks and copyrights, according to a U.S.
International Trade Commission study released Friday.
   The ITC said actual losses are much greater because not all
companies filled out questionaires on the subject.
   The commission said it received responses from 431 companies.
The questionaire was sent to 736 U.S. companies, including all
those on the Fortune 500 list.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said that the annual
drain on U.S. companies because of ``inadequate protection of
intellectual property'' actually may run as high as $43 billion to
$61 billion.
   ``The failure of our trading partners to provide effective
protection for intellectual property is a severe and growing
problem that distorts trade,'' Yeutter told a news conference
called to release the study.
   The report came in advance of discussions next week in Geneva on
developing a new international code to protect patents, trademarks
and copyrights. The talks are being held under the auspices of the
95-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which is
at work on a new set of global trade rules.
   The United States is seeking much tighter protection for
intellectual property rights and unified standards.
   Industries hardest hit by intellecutal-property piracy include
sceintific, medical and photographic equipment, computers and
software, electronics, entertainment, motor vehicles and
pharmaceuticals, Yeutter said.
   Nations cited most frequently as having inadequate protection of
intellecutal property included Mexico, Brazil, Taiwan, Korean and
Japan.
   However, Yeutter declined to single out any particular country
as the worst offender, telling reporters ``it's not just developing
countries. There is ample opportunity to improve among most of the
nations of the world.''
   Piracy of U.S. movies and musical recordings is a major problem
area, the study said.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, told the news conference: ``Piracy is a toxic waste ... it
is life threatening. It is a global war and we are fighting it on
every front.''
   The commission, which undertook the study at Yeutter's request,
said its figures represent only a partial approximation of U.S.
losses from piracy.
   ``The data collected by the commission's questionaire cannot be
projected to U.S. industry as a whole with any statistical
validity,'' the report said. ``The universe of all U.S. businesses
is unknown (and) those companies responding do not represent a
random sample.''

<HEAD>14 Women Arrested For Protesting As Crackdown Continues</HEAD>

   Police on Friday arrested 14
white women protesting the crackdown on black opposition groups,
and authorities silenced the last high-ranking United Democratic
Front official who was operating freely.
   At the University of Cape Town, 2,000 students and staff
assembled to denounce the government's bans on political activity
by the UDF, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition, and 17
other groups.
   ``The battle has only just begun,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak,
one of the UDF's founders, at the campus rally. ``We have decided
we will resist. Our commitment starts right now.''
   The 14 members of Black Sash civil rights group were arrested as
they carried placards in Durban. They were taken to police
headquarters, told they were being charged with participating in
illegal gathering, then released.
   Azhar Cachalia, treasurer of the United Democratic Front, was
served with a restriction order prohibiting him from speaking to
the press, publishing any statement or participating in activities
of the UDF or other anti-apartheid organizations.
   Cachalia had been the only UDF executive committee member not in
hiding, in custody or restricted from UDF activities. The
5-year-old coalition has 600 affiliates with about 2 million
members.
   The government Wednesday banned the UDF and 17 other opposition
groups from political activity, and issued restrictive orders
against 18 senior black leaders, including UDF co-presidents Archie
Gumede and Albertina Sisulu.
   Also on Friday, the Pietermaritzburg Chamber of Commerce met
with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to discuss the feuding
between UDF supporters and members of the Zulu political
organization, Inkatha. More than 400 people have been killed in the
past year in fighting between the groups for control of black areas
in Natal province.
   With the UDF banned from all activity, and its leaders
restricted, observers predicted the violence would continue and
Inkatha would have an advantage.
   Chamber of Commerce manager Paul van Uytrecht was quoted Friday
as saying that peace talks sponsored by his group could not proceed.
   Inkatha, with an estimated 1.5 million members, was not affected
by the new bans.
   The KwaZulu homeland assembly, headed by Inkatha President
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, condemned the restrictions. But at the same
time, it asked the government to give the homeland's pro-Inkatha
police force jurisdiction over all Natal townships.
   The Weekly Mail, a newspaper the government has threatened with
closure, quoted an unidentified UDF representative Friday as saying
the crackdown ``simply gives Buthelezi a free hand to gain control
of the whole of Natal.''
   Musa Zondi, an Inkatha delegate at the Chamber of Commerce peace
talks, said the restrictions ``dash all hopes for the talks. The
UDF is a crucial element in the search for peace.''
   Police said three blacks were killed in violence in Natal late
Thursday, but gave no details.
   At the KTC squatter camp near Cape Town, rival black factions
shot at each other and burned shacks early Friday, resulting in at
least one death and five injuries, police and witnesses said.
   The fighting was between militant youths and the squatter camp
management committee, both considered anti-apartheid groups. About
20 shacks were burned during the battle.
   The fighting in the camp began last month, and hundreds of
shacks have been burned. In 1986, 70,000 people in the area lost
their homes and scores of people died in battles between
conservative ``vigilantes'' and the squatter-camp groups.
   This year the fighting is between two groups who fought together
against the ``vigilantes'' in 1986, and appears to involve an
attempt by the militant youths to gain more power in the
administration of the squatter camp.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir urged Secretary
of State George Shultz to move slowly on Palestinian self-rule, and
15 prominent Arabs didn't show up for a meeting Friday night to
which Shultz had invited them.
   Shultz went to a hotel in Arab east Jerusalem, stood in the
floodlit courtyard and read a statement suggesting the Palestinians
were fearful of working with the United States.
   ``Peacemaking is difficult,'' he read. ``Peace has its enemies,
but peace is a necessary ingredient to a decent life. Even small
steps toward peace can be significant in moving beyond distrust and
hatred.''
   Shultz is here pursuing new American proposals for Middle East
peace.
   The no-show was not new for him. A group of Palestinians also
refused to meet him in Jerusalem during a visit last October.
   In the statement he read Friday night against a backdrop of
Moslem evening prayers in the distance, Shultz still pursued the
goal of bringing Palestinians into Middle East peace talks.
   ``Opportunity knocks loudly on your door,'' he read out in the
hotel courtyard. ``Now is the time to get to work. We have a
workable plan, and we are ready to commit our efforts to it. The
time is right, together, to make decisions of historic
proportions.''
   Earlier Friday, several Palestinians issued statements saying
they would not attend the meeting. The Palestine Liberation
Organization had told Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where riots began more than 11 weeks ago, not to meet with
Shultz in Jerusalem.
   ``Mr. Shultz seems to be trying to make a political statement by
insisting on a meeting here: that the Palestinian problem is in the
context of civil, religious and perhaps economic rights,'' said
Sari Nusseibeh, a professor at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank.
   ``By saying I will not attend, I'm saying this is wrong. The
problem is one of the national rights of the Palestinians.''
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the newspaper Al Fajr, said he told
Shultz ``I regret I cannot accept because the Palestinian people
have decided that we have to have a delegation reflecting the true
composition of the Palestinian people.'' Siniora conferred with the
secretary earlier this month in Washington.
   Shultz met on Friday with the three principal members of
Israel's coalition government _ Shamir, Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   He put ``no pressure whatsoever on Shamir,'' an Israeli official
said, on condition of anonymity. The official said Shamir urged
Shultz to move slowly on self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   During a two-hour meeting, Shamir told Shultz there should be
``a time of testing'' of up to three years before negotiations on a
final settlement in the occupied territories, the official said.
The American plan calls for negotiaitons on an overall settlement
by December.
   The attempt by Shamir to keep alive the 1978 Camp David formula
for interim Palestinian self-rule puts Shultz in the middle,
between Israel and the Arabs. Egypt and Jordan have declared the
process out of date.
   Shamir also insisted that Palestinian ``autonomy,'' which would
involve some self-rule but not statehood, not be ``accelerated''
because of the current violence, the Israeli official said.
   Peres, Shamir's partner and rival in the ``national unity''
coalition, said he found Shultz ``open-minded and very attentive,
looking for fresh ideas and information.''
   ``He brought workable proposals,'' the foreign minister
said.``We have some workable proposals, and for that reason we have
started to work.''
   Rabin, the defense minister, said Arab demonstrators should have
``no illusion that by force they can change the position of
Israel.''
   A solution is possible only through negotiations involving
Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza, along with Jordan
and Israel, he said.
   He told reporters: ``They are going to suffer more than anybody
else by the violence. ... By military means we can achieve
tranquility, but not a solution.''
   Peres and Rabin represent the center-left Labor Party, which for
20 years has proposed that Israel yield some of the occupied
territory as part of an overall peace settlement. Shamir and his
conservative Likud bloc oppose trading land for peace, which Shultz
has suggested.
   Shultz flies to Amman on Saturday to meet with Prime Minister
Zaid Rifai of Jordan, then to Damascus to see the Syrian president,
Hafez Assad.
   He also will travel to Cairo during his five-day shuttle, for
which Jerusalem is the base.

Assault</HEAD>

   A young white man sentenced earlier this week to
work for the NAACP by a judge who hoped to end a ``cycle of hate''
faced new charges of ethnic intimidation Friday for allegedly
punching and shouting slurs at a pregnant woman.
   ``It's very disappointing,'' Cook County Circuit Judge Stuart
Nudelman said of the new charges against James Kalafut Jr., 21.
``I've done these type of community-service sentences before and
they've been successful.
   ``Unfortunately, perhaps this one may not be. That remains to be
seen.''
   Kalafut was back in Nudelman's court Friday to face charges of
ethnic intimidation, battery and violation of his court-supervised
sentence, accused of punching a pregnant woman in the stomach and
shouting ethnic slurs at her.
   The woman has an Hispanic surname.
   Kalafut had pleaded guilty Tuesday to ethnic intimidation and
aggravated assault for an Aug. 16, 1987, incident in which a group
of whites brandishing baseball bats, hurling bottles and shouting
racial slurs chased two blacks from their neighborhood.
   Nudelman said Kalafut had been ``taught to hate blacks'' and
sentenced him to perform 200 hours of community service for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He also
sentenced the young man to one year of court supervision.
   The judge said he imposed the sentence in an effort ``to stop
the cycle of hate.'' However, the sentencing plan was put on hold
and will be set aside if Kalafut is convicted on the new charges,
the judge said.
   Nudelman said Friday that if the younger Kalafut is found guilty
of the new charges, ``the young man unfortunately will be in a
position where he may need an alternative form of punishment, such
as some time in the county jail.''
   Defense attorney Barry Silver said Kalafut had met with NAACP
officials and worked out a plan to collect and distribute clothing
to poor families and victims of house fires.
   The judge transferred the two new charges to Judge Leo Holt,
saying, ``It wouldn't be fair for me to hear them.'' A trial before
Holt was tentatively scheduled for March 28.
   Silver said the new charges were trumped up and said he believes
Kalafut was framed because of his guilty plea and sentence in the
earlier incident.
   ``I interviewed two witnesses who tell me he never touched the
girl,'' who lived nearby, Silver said. ``I'm told there has been
bad feelings between the families for quite some time.''
   The charges stem from an argument late Wednesday in front of the
Kalafut home between Virginia Flores, 27, who is 4{ months
pregnant, and Kenneth Kolokowski, 25.
   The couple said Kalafut came out of his house, yelled at them
and then got into a struggle with Kolokowski, said police Officer
Al Murphy.
   Kalafut then allegedly punched Ms. Flores in the stomach and
shouted an ethnic slur, Murphy quoted the couple as saying.
   The defendant apparently considers Ms. Flores to be of Hispanic
origin, although Ms. Flores told police she is primarily of Irish
heritage with some Indian background, Murphy said.
   She suffered minor injuries but her fetus was not harmed, said a
spokesman for Holy Cross Hospital, where she was treated and
released.
   The couple also told police the defendant's father, James
Kalafut Sr., 45, came out of the house during the confrontation
wearing pajama bottoms and exposed himself, Murphy said.
   Silver said Friday the allegation was false.
   The elder Kalafut, charged with ethnic intimidation and battery,
faces an April 14 court hearing.
   Kalafut's teen-age brother, Larry, was sentenced last March to
six years in prison for firebombing the home of a black family who
moved into Gage Park, a predominantly white neighborhood.

   Nicaragua came out in support of Panamanian strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega on Friday in the showdown over the
leadership of the Central American nation.
   Venezuela backed Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was removed from
office early Friday by legislators a few hours after he ordered
Noriega to step down.
   In Cartagena, Colombia, the foreign ministers of eight other
Latin American nations attending a regional meeting stayed
non-committal, saying they were studying the situation.
   In Bogota, ex-presidents Alfonso Lopez Michelsen of Colombia,
Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela
said they had agreed earlier with Noriega on a plan for the
``democratization'' of Panama under which they said Noriega would
promise to retire as armed forces commander to allow free elections
next year.
   But the three former leaders said the events in Panama had
aggravated the situation in the country.
   In Managua, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega offered his
support to Noriega and accused the U.S. government of trying to
destroy the nation's sovereignty, the government-owned Sandinista
newspaper reported Friday.
   ``The president of Nicaragua assured Gen. Noriega that the
Panamanian people, facing threats, blackmail and the danger of
American troop intervention, could count on the militant and
combative solidarity of the people of Sandino,'' a government
communique printed in the newspaper said.
   The Sandinista communique said Ortega spoke with Noriega on the
telephone Thursday night and offered ``unconditional solidarity in
these moments when the American government is trying to kill the
spirit of Torrijos to save the sovereignty of Panama.''
   Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos, the nationalist leader who staged a
1968 coup, became a national hero by working out the transfer to
Panama in 1999 of the American-built Panama Canal. He died in a
plane crash in 1981.
   The Sandinista links with Torrijos and the Panamanian government
go back to before the 1978-79 revolutionary war in Nicaragua.
Torrijos' government sent combatants and arms to the leftist
Sandinistas, who overthrew Anastasio Somoza.
   Weeks after Noriega's problems broke out last June, Ortega flew
to Panama as a show of support. Ortega said the United States was
engaged in a conspiracy to break the 1977 canal treaties.
   The eight Latin American foreign ministers attending the meeting
in Colombia discussed the events in Panama at the request of
Panamaian Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia.
   ``We are being informed about developments in Panama,'' said
Colombian Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes, but he declined
to make any further comment.
   Abadia had asked Thursday that his fellow ministers of
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela
should offer their solidarity to Panama against ``a worldwide
disinformation campaign.''
   Abadia told them that drug-dealing charges against Noriega ``do
not correspond with the facts in Panama'' and he denounced
``maneuvers'' by the United States to keep its troops in control of
the Panama Canal beyond the year 1999, when a treaty stipulates
that Panama will take over control of the waterway.
   Abadia returned hurriedly to Panama on Friday.
   Venezuelan Foreign Minister German Nava Carrillo said in
Cartagena that his government supports ``the democracy, sovereignty
and independence of Panama'' but warned that ``the military forces
should be subject and obedient to civilian power.''
   In Caracas, the Venezuelan government expressed support for
Delvalle's decision to oust Noriega and called on the Central
American nation's armed forces to respect such a decision.
   ``The Venezuelan government reaffirms its unequivocal position
on the respect that the military forces in Panama owe to the
civilian power, as dictated by the Panama's Constitution,'' said a
communique issued Thursday night by the Miraflores Government
Palace.
   ``The Venezuelan government expresses categorically its support
to all the efforts aimed at strenthening the Panamanian democratic
process,'' the brief communique said.

   A rookie policeman was killed in his patrol car
Friday by three point-blank shots to the head in what the police
commissioner said was an assassination meant to intimidate a crime
witness.
   Officer Edward Byrne, 22, was shot as he sat in a marked patrol
car in Queens, guarding the home of a threatened witness in a drug
case. The house had been firebombed twice, allegedly by dealers.
   Two men drove up to the patrol car at 3:30 a.m. One man got out
and fired up to five shots into the patrol car, said Police
Commissioner Benjamin Ward.
   The gunman had approached the car ``in a way not likely to alarm
the police officer that anything was amiss, and then when he was so
close that he could not miss, and moving so rapidly that the police
officer would not be able to respond defensively, fired into the
car,'' the commissioner said.
   Byrne was the first officer killed in the line of duty this
year, said police spokesman Sgt. Peter Sweeney. Three city police
officers and one transit police officer were killed in 1987.
   Ward acknowledged that the shooting could have been an act of
random violence, but said ``it smacks more of a deliberate
assassination attempt.''
   He described the shooting as ``an attempt to intimidate not just
that witness but all of you, and all of the people of this city and
this country to say that if you cooperate with criminal justice
something is going to happen to you.''
   The resident of the house is a witness in impending cases
against area drug dealers.
   The house was firebombed twice in November by drug dealers who
believed the man had complained to police about drug dealing on his
street, police said.
   Southeast Queens has become a hub of crack trafficking and
drug-related violence in the last two years. Many shootings in the
area are the result of constant turf wars between drug cartels,
Ward said.
   Authorities assigned a 24-hour police guard to the house after
the firebombings. Ward said the witness has also received other
threats against his life for cooperating with authorities.
   He said assigning a single officer was standard practice. The
patrol car was provided for the officer's convenience because of
the weather.
   Ward said having two officers in the patrol car would not make a
difference in officers' safety ``if an assassin decides to arrive.''
   Byrne was single and was a second generation police officer; his
father, Matthew Byrne, headed the department's Legal Bureau from
1972 to 1976.

<TEXT>
   A state judge Friday formally dismissed
22-year-old triple murder charges against Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter a week after prosecutors said they would not seek a third
trial of the former boxer.
   ``I'm joyous with the result and deeply satisfied that justice
finally has been done and the charges dismissed,'' said Carter's
attorney, Myron Beldock, after Superior Court Judge Ralph V. Martin
signed the order dismissing the indictment against Carter and John
Artis.
   Carter had served 19 years in prison before a federal judge in
1985 voided his second conviction and ordered his release on
grounds that the conviction was tainted by racial bias and the
witholding of information from the defense.
   Carter, who has been living in seclusion, could not be reached
for comment. Beldock would not release his telephone number or
whereabouts, but said his client would meet with reporters Monday.
   Prosecutors had said dismissal of the charges was justified
because of the passage of time since the 1966 killings, problems
finding witnesses, court decisions descrediting previous testimony
and the burden posed by a third prosecution.
   They also cited the time served in prison by the defendants.
Artis, who was paroled in 1981, is serving a six-year term on an
unrelated drug conviction.
   Carter and Artis were convicted in 1967, but given a new trial
in 1976 after two witnesses recanted. They were convicted again,
and the verdicts were upheld by the state Supreme Court.
   The federal judge's decision releasing Carter from prison was
upheld by an appellate court, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to
accept an appeal by prosecutors.
   Carter, 50, and Artis, 41, had been accused of killing a
bartender and two patrons of a Paterson bar. The victims were
white; and the gunmen, like Carter and Artis, were black.
   Hours earlier, a black Paterson bartender had been shot to death
by a white man. Prosecutors theorized that the later killings were
in retaliation.
   Celebrities such as Muhammed Ali and actress Ellen Burstyn took
up Carter's cause, viewing him as a symbol of racial injustice. Bob
Dylan wrote and sang ``Hurricane,'' a ballad about the boxer's case.

   Americans' incomes rose 0.3 percent in
January, a moderate increase that matched the gain in consumer
spending during the month, the government reported Friday.
   The Commerce Department said that incomes and spending both rose
0.3 percent, following identical 0.7 percent advances in both
categories during December.
   The gains were taken as positive signs that consumer spending,
while not growing as briskly as it did during the early years of
the economic recovery, will at least expand enough this year to
keep the economy out of a recession.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, is being closely monitored following the October
stock market collapse.
   ``These figures support our impression that the economy will
slow down this year but continue to move ahead,'' said Roger
Brinner, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   Consumer spending, after adjusting for inflation, fell at an
annual rate of 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the biggest
decline in more than seven years. Brinner predicted that much of
this decline would be reversed in the current January-March
quarter, in part, because auto sales have rebounded.
   Wages and salaries, the key component of the income category,
increased $12.4 billion in January, more than double the $5.6
billion December increase. This gain included a $2 billion increase
in payrolls at manufacturing companies, which followed a $1.1
billion December increase.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said the rise
in incomes, while below previous months, was still strong enough to
support further increases in spending. He noted that incomes in
manufucturing have risen 4.7 percent in the past 12 months,
compared to growth of just 1.8 percent in the previous 12 months.
   ``We have a picture of a consumer with adequate income growth
who has become a bit more cautious and is more likely to save, but
is not going to stop spending and drive the economy into a
recession,'' Sinai said.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, rose to 4.7 percent in January, 0.3 percentage point higher
than the December level.
   The 0.3 percent increase in spending reflected an annual rate of
increase of $10 billion with almost all of the strength coming in
the services category.
   Purchases of durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, edged up $200 million compared to a $12.3 billion December
advance. Purchases of non-durable goods fell $700 million in
contrast to an increase of $5.3 billion in December.
   The services category, which includes housing expenses, shot up
at an annual rate of $10.6 billion in January, much faster than the
$4.2 billion December rise. Some analysts said this reflected in
large part a big jump in inflation in the services sector during
the month.
   In a separate report Friday, the Labor Department said that
medical care services rose 0.8 percent, the steepest increase in
two years, while rental costs and other service charges also posted
big gains.
   In January and December, personal income was affected by a
variety of special factors, including pay raises for federal
employees, cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security
recipients and swings in farm subsidy payments.
   Farm incomes fell $10.5 billion in January, erasing a $10.4
billion December increase. Excluding the big swings in government
subsidies, farm incomes would have increased $500 million in
Janaury following a $1.5 billion December decline.
   After-tax incomes rose 0.6 percent in January following a 0.7
percent December increase.

   Panama's ambassador to Washington said he
refused an order Friday by military strong man Miguel Antonio
Noriega to resign and would continue to serve as envoy under
U.S.-recognized President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Ambassador Juan Sosa also said a U.S. trade embargo might be
necessary to depose Noriega and acknowledged that Delvalle has no
support in the military.
   Sosa declared his support for Delvalle hours before the State
Department said it would continue to recognize him even though he
was ousted by Panama's national assembly after he tried to fire
Noriega as military chief.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the U.S. government
still considered Sosa Panama's legal ambassador.
   Sosa said at a news conference that he expects Noriega to
appoint a rival ambassador, but he said later that he would retain
his office with the full backing of his embassy staff in Washington.
   Sosa said he had not contacted other Panamanian envoys around
the world and did not know whether others would support Delvalle.
   He said, however, he expects official recognition of Delvalle's
government from several other countries.
   The envoy said he told Noriega in a telephone call Friday that
as a member of Delvalle's Republican Party, he still considered him
president of the country. Noriega asked for his resignation and he
refused, Sosa said.
   He noted that as ambassador for four months he had opposed
economic sanctions against Panama, ``but there are some times in
the history of nations when economic sanctions (are needed) to get
the country back on track.''
   ``We certainly hope that not only the U. S. but the whole
hemisphere will support Panama and if necessary apply economic
sanctions to help Panama get back onto the road of democracy,''
Sosa said.
   He said, however, Delvalle would not support U.S. military
intervention.
   Sosa said he did not expect reprisals against the 50,000 U.S.
citizens in Panama and predicted the crisis could be resolved by
peaceful means.
   He denied that U.S. pressure had led to Delvalle's attempt to
depose Noriega, saying it is a ``step that has been taken
consciously and courageously'' without anyone else's help.
   Asked if there were any signs of support for Delvalle in the
military, Sosa said, ``The national defense forces are very united.
There might be dissent, but I don't know of it.''
   ``We do not have any military support. We only have the weapon
of being right,'' he said.

<HEAD>Engineer Warns of Problems With New Design</HEAD>

   A former Morton Thiokol engineer who tried
to stop the fatal launch of the space shuttle Challenger says
another shuttle disaster is possible because what he feels is a
poor redesign job.
   ``The shuttle's return flight is not going to be a safe one,''
Roger Boisjoly told student engineers Thursday during a speech on
professional ethics in Oklahoma City.
   Morton Thiokol managers, not engineers, directed the effort to
redesign new booster joint seals, and the result is ``an incredibly
lousy design,'' he said. The new seals are no better than the old
ones, he added.
   Company spokesman Rocky Raab was out of his office in Brigham
City, Utah, on Friday and could not be reached for comment.
   Boisjoly was considered Morton Thiokol's expert on the booster
rocket joint seals. He warned NASA officials not to launch the
Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, when below-freezing temperatures beset
the Kennedy Space Center.
   The shuttle exploded when O-ring seals on its solid fuel booster
joints failed and allowed gases to escape the booster and ignite
the massive fuel tank. The seven astronauts were killed.
   The next space launch is tentatively set for August. Boisjoly
said he wouldn't fly on it, and wouldn't advise anyone else to.
   Boisjoly has filed two federal lawsuits against Morton Thiokol
Inc. He took a long-term disability leave from the Chicago-based
company, saying he suffered depression and post-traumatic stress
following the explosion.
   He contends the company hurt his reputation by portraying him as
a disgruntled employee after he testified before the Rogers
commission, which investigated the Challenger explosion.
   Boisjoly contends in another suit that Morton Thiokol and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration conspired to ensure
that the company would be the sole supplier of solid-rocket motors.
   The lawsuits also charge that Morton Thiokol falsely certified
the safety of its O-rings.
   The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation of fraud
allegations made by Morton Thiokol employees. But the Justice
Department has declined to enter the case.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Speech Calls For Calm in Armenian Unrest</HEAD>

   A top Soviet official went on Armenian radio and
television Friday and read a plea by Mikhail S. Gorbachev for an
end to unrest by protesters demanding land from a neighboring
republic.
   Armenian activists speaking by telephone from Yerevan described
an increased presence by the Red Army, including paratroopers armed
with clubs.
   The 15-minute unprecented speech, broadcast at 11 a.m., blasted
from speakers throughout Yerevan, the capital of Armenia.
Demonstrators crowding the streets heard it read over TV monitors
placed outside by government officials.
   Reports from Yerevan late Friday indicated that the thousands of
demonstrators began dispersing several hours after the broadcast. A
witness said the protesters only began heading home after the
Armenian Communist Party Central Committee agreed to ask the Soviet
Central Committee to reconsider the request for land.
   Another witness said 1,500 Soviet paratroopers had been flown
into Yerevan around midnight Thursday and were ferried in a
40-vehicle motorcade to the Dynamo sports hall and other locations
around the republic's capital.
   ``They came with full equipment, including clubs,'' said Paruyr
Ayrikyan, an Armenian activist.
   For the past week, unsanctioned mass demonstrations have rocked
Yerevan. Protesters are demanding that Nagorno-Karabakh, an
autonomous region of the neighboring republic of Azerbaidzhan, be
made part of Armenia.
   Protests also were reported earlier in the week in
Nagorno-Karabakh where more than 80 percent of the 157,000
residents are Armenians.
   The Armenian National Committee, an anti-communist group based
in Athens, Greece, claimed that Azerbaidjanis killed more than 70
Armenians in the disputed region.
   A 17-year-old resident of Nagorno-Karabakh said Thursday that
virtually the entire Armenian population of the region demonstrated
daily in the main city, Stepanakert, since Feb. 13.
   Tass reported that Soviet officials said there were some
``victims'' in those protests but said there were no deaths.
   In his speech, Gorbachev appealed to the people of Armenia and
Azerbaidzhan to show ``civic maturity and restraint,'' the official
Tass news agency reported.
   He said the Central Committee will meet to examine relations
among the country's more than 100 ethnic groups, Tass said.
   In a late night dispatch, Tass reported that Gorbachev
acknowledged ``there are unresolved problems in the life of Soviet
society, but the fomenting of strife and mistrust among peoples
only hinders their resolution.''
   One witness said the demonstrators did not begin dispersing
immediately after hearing the address, read by Politburo member
Vladimir I. Dolgikh.
   They began leaving a few hours later, after learning that the
Armenian Central Committee had requested the national Central
Committee to reconsider the annexation proposal, said the witness,
a 40-year-old Armenian woman reached in Yerevan by phone Friday
night.
   A hotel worker said the demonstrators planned no more protests
until after March 23 when a decision on the dispute is expected
from the Armenian Central Committee.
   ``There is no disorder. Everyone is working again,'' said the
employee of the Yerevan Hotel who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Asked how the demonstrators reacted to Gorbachev's speech,
Valery Aidinyan, chief of the propaganda department at the Yerevan
Communist Party newspaper Kommunist, said: ``They took it with good
feelings. It had a calm tone, and was warm, without the usual
rhetoric.''
   Earlier Friday, Sergei Grigoryants, a dissident of Armenian
origin, estimated that more than 1 million people were in Yerevan's
streets Friday morning.
   ``Columns are marching along the major streets, and there is a
sea of banners,'' he said.
   Gevorg Mirozyan, an editor at the Armenian state broadcasting
authority Gostelradio, put the number of demonstrators at more than
a million.
   Aidinyan said his crowd size estimate was in the range of tens
of thousands or hundreds of thousands.
   There has been no official estimate of the number of
demonstrators, and the government has barred foreign reporters from
traveling to Armenia.
   Aidinyan said factories and public transportation, reported
earlier to have been closed by a strike in support of the
protesters, had returned to normal.
   Late Friday, Tass issued the first official confirmation of
labor disruption.
   ``A number of industrial enterprises in Yerevan have been in a
fever of late as people were leaving their workplaces to take part
in demonstrations and meetings in connection with the events in
Nagorny-Karabakh,'' the news agency reported, quoting an Armenian
Central Committee member identified only as S. Petrosyan.
   Armenia is the smallest of the 15 Soviet republics in area, and
has 3.4 million inhabitants. By annexing Nagorno-Karabakh, which at
1,760 square miles is smaller than Delaware, Armenia's area would
increase by 14 percent, and its population by 4 percent.
   The protests test Gorbachev's campaign for greater
democratization and openness, and his personal appeal showed how
seriously the Kremlin leadership regards the situation. Gorbachev
has said relations among the Soviet Union's nationalities are the
country's greatest problem.
   Grigoryants said protesters carried signs linking their actions
with Gorbachev's policies of ``glasnost,'' or openness, and
``perestroika,'' his broad plan for rebuilding Soviet society.
   The speech marked the first time Gorbachev has personally
intervened in a nationalities dispute.
   Even in December 1986, when rioting broke out in the Central
Asian republic of Kazakhstan, killing three and injuring hundreds,
Gorbachev did not surface.

   Soon it will be all right for American hunters
to bring foreign-bagged wild pheasant and grouse home for cooking,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   That is, so long as the birds have been eviscerated and their
heads and feet removed, said James W. Glosser, acting administrator
of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The
new rule takes effect March 28.
   Previously, such game birds had to be cooked before being
brought into the United States to prevent the introduction of
poultry diseases. Glosser said the agency has determined that wild
pheasant and grouse carcasses are not threats if they are first
trimmed of innards, heads and feet.
   About 300 to 400 American hunters annually have been returning
with cooked fowl shot in foreign countries, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Service Secretary Otis R.
Bowen on Friday announced the formation of a federal task force to
focus on AIDS among children.
   ``The purpose of the initiative is to cut across agency lines,
ensuring that we provide not only the best medical response but
also the best use of our social programs on behalf of these
children and their families,'' Bowen said at the latest in a series
of department briefings on AIDS.
   Dr. Antonia C. Novello of the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development heads the newly designated Pediatric HIV
Infection Working Group, which includes representatives from five
agencies within the sprawling HHS department.
   Bowen cited emerging evidence that the deadly disease affects
children somewhat differently than adults as justification for
designating the special task force.
   He said the working group ``will help carry out the agenda set
last year at the Surgeon General's Workshop on Children With HIV
Infection and Their Families.''
   Bowen noted that many agencies within HHS have already been
working on special problems associated with AIDS among children. He
cited as an example a plan by the Health Resources and Services
Administration to spend $4.4 million this year on demonstration
programs for innovative ways of caring for children with AIDS.
   He also said the Office for Human Development Services ``will be
funding projects to improve recruitment of foster parents and to
provide supportive services for natural and foster families'' of
children with AIDS.
   There are just over 1,000 officially reported AIDS cases among
people under 18 years old, but Bowen said that is projected to
increase to 3,000 in three years.
   Moreover, he added, ``We believe that for every one child who
meets the definition for AIDS itself, at least another two are HIV
infected and the number of probably higher. By 1991, we expect that
there will be some 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infected children in the
United States.''
   Existing evidence suggests that most children infected with the
virus eventually develop the disease itself.

   Two independent music promoters, a former
radio executive and a promoter's wife were indicted on bribery, tax
evasion or other charges stemming from a two-year-old payola
investigation, federal officials said Friday.
   One promoter used cocaine as well as cash to bribe radio station
employees to play his records, according to the indictment.
   ``The independent promoters were acting on behalf of virtually
all record companies in this country,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner
said at a news conference after the indictments were unsealed.
   However, Bonner said there was no evidence the record companies
were aware of any bribery, or payola as it's called in the industry.
   The investigation was continuing with help from authorities in
half a dozen cities, Bonner said, but he declined to say whether
additional indictments were expected.
   Federal agents arrested promoter Ralph Tashjian, 39, of San
Mateo and his wife, Valerie, at their home Thursday, even though
their attorneys had offered to surrender them to authorities, said
Anthony Brooklier, the promoter's lawyer.
   Tashjian is accused of three counts of payola, one count of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine, one count of obstruction of
justice and three counts of corporate income-tax fraud, Brooklier
said.
   Tashjian allegedly paid nearly $42,000 in cash and gave
undisclosed quantities of cocaine to three radio station workers
from 1980 to 1985 in exchange for air time for his records.
   The charges against him, handed up by a Los Angeles federal
grand jury Thursday, were denied by the Tashjians' attorneys.
   Mrs. Tashjian was arrested for alleged corporate tax evasion.
   A second indictment announced Friday by Bonner charged
independent promoter William Craig, 42, of Scottsdale, Ariz., also
known as William Craighead, with willfully aiding in the
preparation of false federal tax returns and attempting to evade
individual income tax.
   It also charges Craighead with making illegal payments to three
radio stations to ensure that certain records were played on the
air.
   The third indictment charged George Wilson Crowell, also known
as George Wilson, 59, former vice president and general manager of
radio station KIQQ in Los Angeles, with willful failure to file
federal income tax returns for 1984, 1985 and 1986.
   Craig faces 18 years in prison and fines of $1.64 million if
convicted. The charges against Tashjian carry penalties of up to 23
years and $1.53 million in fines; Mrs. Tashjian, 15 years and $1.5
million; and Crowell, three years and $75,000, Bonner said.
   The payola investigation began in 1986. Alleged organized crime
figure Salvatore James Pisello, 64, of West Hollywood, was charged
last July with three counts of tax evasion. His case is pending in
Los Angeles federal court.

<HEAD>Delvalle Has Secret Plan for Noriega's Ouster, Dissident Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panama's President Eric Arturo Delvalle knew
in advance that his attempted firing of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
would fail but is confident that planned steps would lead to
Noriega's downfall within three weeks, a Panamaniam dissident said
Friday.
   Jose I. Blandon, a onetime Noreiga associate, said in an
interview that Delvalle has devised an 18-point plan for the ouster
of the military strong man, and his unsuccessful bid to replace him
was but one element.
   ``It is exactly what we thought was going to happen,'' Blandon
said, referring to Delvalle's bid to install the second-ranking
officer in Panama's Defense Forces as commander on Thursday and
Noriega's decision to ignore the order.
   Hours later, the Panamanian National Assembly, dominated by
Noriega allies, voted to oust Delvalle and replace him with the
education minister. But Delvalle said he still regards himself as
president.
   Blandon said other elements in the effort to topple Noriega
include a general strike, the rallying of international support for
Delvalle and the consent of the Dominican Republic to give Noriega
a safe haven if and when he flees Panama.
   Delvalle received a boost Friday when the State Department
announced that it continues to recognize him as president. Blandon
said he expects similar support from many Latin American
democracies.
   The Reagan administration has been increasingly hostile to
Noriega, especially since his indictment on drug-smuggling charges
by federal grand juries in Florida three weeks ago.
   Other aspects of the anti-Noriega plot, Blandon said, include a
purging of Panama's Defense Forces, leading to the ouster of six
majors he said are involved in drug trafficking and eight colonels
who are serving in violation of rules requiring retirement after 25
years' service.
   If Noriega leaves, Col. Elias Castillo, the third-ranking member
of the Defense Forces, would take command. Blandon said Castillo is
a military professional, is untainted by corruption and leads a
modest middle-class existence that contrasts sharply with the
opulent life styles of some of Noriega's close military associates.
   Castillo is ``not involved in drugs and he's clean,'' Blandon
said. ``He's a good soldier. He does not have political ambitions.''
   With U.S. marshals deployed nearby, Blandon sat in a local hotel
suite and outlined how he, Delvalle and a group of other opposition
leaders have been planning to restore civilian rule in Panama.
   Noriega once looked on Blandon as a close confidante, but the
two had a falling out last fall after Blandon told the military
chieftain that Panama's crisis can only be solved if he steps down.
   Blandon is under U.S. government protection because of testimony
he gave outlining Noriega's alleged drug-smuggling activities and
his ties with the CIA, among other issues.
   During his 90-minute conversation with a reporter, Blandon
perused a document he said was an 18-point plan for restoring
civilian supremacy in Panama. It was dated Feb. 22, but Blandon
said the essentials of the plan had been worked out by himself,
Delvalle and opposition leaders weeks earlier.
   Blandon said that during a meeting in Miami last week, Delvalle
asked Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams if it would be
possible to drop the indictments against Noriega.
   Abrams replied that it would be legally possible but that any
such decision would have to be made by either the Justice
Department or President Reagan, Blandon said.
   Withdrawal of the indictments presumably would leave Noriega
free to seek a safe haven outside Panama without fear of U.S.
extradition. But Blandon said the administration has given no
indication it would agree to lift the indictments.
   He said authorities in the Dominican Republic, where Noriega has
a son-in-law, have agreed to allow him and five to seven associates
into the country should he be forced out. Noriega has been informed
of this development, he said.
   But if the indictments remain in place, Noriega would be subject
to U.S. extradition under a treaty with the Dominican Republic.
   Still, Blandon said he was confident that Noriega's days as
defense chief are numbered, particularly if there is widespread
adherence to a scheduled call for a general strike and if the
United States imposes an economic embargo against Panama.
   He said Alaskan oil is shipped through a Panamanian pipeline for
eventual delivery to U.S. East Coast ports. An embargo would
prevent continued use of the pipeline by American companies,
depriving Panama of millions of dollars of badly needed revenue and
aggravating what he described as the country's acute financial
crisis.

<HEAD>Mills Using Most Cotton Since Early 1970s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton use by U.S. textile mills is at the
highest level since the early 1970s, the Agriculture Department
said Friday.
   In the 1987 marketing year that ended last July 31, nearly 7.5
million bales of cotton were used by mills, up from 6.4 million in
1986. As it looks now, 1988 mill use is headed for another gain to
around 7.8 million bales.
   But imports of cotton textiles also are up, totaling an
equivalent of 4.9 million bales in 1987, a 22 percent increase from
1986, the department's Economic Research Service said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. exports of raw cotton are expected to be around
7 million bales in the 1988 marketing year, an increase of 300,000
bales from 1987, the agency said in its new outlook report.
   Based on Jan. 1 indications, the 1987 cotton harvest _ which
goes into the overall supply for the 1988 marketing year _ is
expected to yield 14.7 million bales, up from 9.7 million bales in
1986.
   Cotton prices moved up last year because of the tighter supply
and rising demand. The U.S. spot price, for example, rose above 77
cents per pound, the report said. But since last August prices have
dropped by 17 to 20 cents.
   ``The larger-than-expected 1987 U.S. crop, the potential for
increased acreage and production in 1988, and concern about the
economy's performance have pressured prices lower this season,''
the report said.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential condidate Jesse Jackson
campaigned in Georgia on Friday, visiting the Legislature, cajoling
Atlanta attorneys to help the poor and picking up an endorsement
from Amy Carter.
   Jackson, as he has done at other stops across the South,
reminded members of the Georgia General Assembly of his Southern
roots.
   ``I am one of you,'' he said in remarks to the state Senate. ``I
worked hard to make the new South new _ now, lets make the new
South better.
   ``I am my party's conscience. By July, with your help, I want to
be its candidate.''
   Appearing with Jackson in the Capitol rotunda was Miss Carter,
the daughter of former President Jimmy Carter, who said she was
endorsing the civil rights leader and 1984 Democratic candidate
because of his ``pro-people'' stands.
   ``I have discussed this with my father, but you'll have to ask
him how he feels about it, not me,'' Miss Carter told the Marietta
Daily Journal.
   The former president, a ``superdelegate'' to the Democrats'
national convention in Atlanta this summer, remains uncommitted,
according to aides at the Carter Presidential Center.
   Jackson will be back in Georgia on Saturday for a debate with
the other Democratic hopefuls at the Georgia World Congress Center,
sponsored by The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.
   In a speech Friday to members of the Atlanta Bar Association,
Jackson asked the lawyers for help in assuring all Americans equal
access to the judicial system.
   ``We have a whole body of people denied equal protection under
the law'' because President Reagan has cut funding for legal help
for the poor and the nation's lawyers have failed to fill in the
gap, Jackson said.
   In response to a question about his religion and the presidency,
the Baptist minister vowed to keep church and state separate if he
is elected.
   But, he said, ``We should not keep morality and state separate.
... We must bring our values to high office. ... I'm not ashamed of
the gospel. That which makes us feed the hungry and clothe the
naked ... we must never apologize for that.''

<TEXT>
   The Air Force said Friday it had launched an
environmental impact study of bases that could be used as garrisons
for rail-mounted MX nuclear missiles.
   In conducting the study, the service said it would review a
number of deployment alternatives, including the fielding of 100 MX
missiles on rail cars instead of just 50 missiles.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci disclosed recently the
administration would like to move the 50 MX missiles that Congress
already has approved for silo basing to rail cars along with a new
batch of 50 missiles.
   Congress has yet to approve any type of mobile deployment for
the 10-warhead MX, but it has provided research-and-development
funding since President Reagan unveiled the idea in December 1986.
   The Air Force announced a year ago it had selected F.E. Warren
Air Force Base in Wyoming to become the main operating base for any
rail-mounted MX missiles and 10 other bases for consideration as
additional ``rail garrisons.''
   The service said Friday that list had not changed, and that
special ``meetings to identify environmental issues'' would be
scheduled soon for residents living near each of those 11 bases.
   Besides F.E. Warren, the list includes Blytheville Air Force
Base, Ark.; Little Rock Air Force Base, Ark.; Whiteman Air Force
Base, Mo.; Barksdale Air Force Base, La.; Dyess Air Force Base,
Texas; Fairchild Air Force Base, Wash.; Grand Forks Air Force Base,
N.D.; Minot Air Force Base, N.D.; Malstrom Air Force Base, Mont.,
and Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Mich.
   The Air Force said it hoped to complete the impact study by late
this year and make the final selection of home bases.
   The Air Force envisions either 25 or 50 six-car trains, with
each train carrying two MX missiles. Each garrison could house
four, five or six trains.
   The missiles would be carried in specially modified cargo cars,
made to look like a regular boxcar. To launch the missile, the top
of the box car would open outward, allowing the missile to be
erected into a vertical position and fired.
   The trains would remain inside the heavily guarded garrisons
during peacetime, but could disperse onto the regular commercial
rail system in the event of an emergency. The Pentagon's goal would
be to have a mobile target that the Soviet Union could not destroy.
   The Air Force says it has made no decision on how many rail
garrison bases it needs out of the list of 10 besides F.E. Warren.
   The Air Force, which calls the MX the Peacekeeper missile, said,
``The proposed action is to deploy a total of 50 Peacekeeper
missiles on 25 Air Force trains with two missiles per train. But an
alternative action is to deploy 100 Peacekeeper missiles on 50
trains.''

<HEAD>Companies Accused In Kosher Fraud Agree To Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three companies accused of selling thousands of
pounds of non-kosher poultry as kosher to customers in up to 22
states have agreed in a legal settlement to get out of the kosher
business, officials said Friday.
   ``We wanted to make sure something like this never happened
again,'' said Rabbi Victor Segal, president of Goldman-Segal Kosher
Caterers of Chicago, which had accused the three companies of fraud
in a federal lawsuit. ``It was a nightmare.''
   Segal said it was the largest case of fraud involving
mislabeling of kosher foods, and potentially affected Jewish
families in 22 states where the companies' kosher poultry products
were sold.
   Jewish religious law restricts the type of meats that can be
eaten and mandates a ritual for butchering the meats and removing
as much blood as possible to make them kosher. ``The process is
lengthy and more expensive,'' Segal said.
   In mid-December, Segal's catering company sued the Chicago-based
companies _ United Poultry Inc., Aspen Foods Inc. and Shelat Kosher
Foods Inc. _ and two of their officers in federal court, accusing
them of false advertising, fraud and deceptive trade practices. The
catering company had bought kosher poultry products from United
Poultry, Segal said.
   A month earlier, the Illinois attorney general had filed a state
lawsuit against the companies, as well as Sheldon Terman, president
of the three firms, and Michael Terman, the companies' secretary,
for allegedly mislabeling their products as kosher.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Anthony Scotillo ordered a nationwide
recall on Nov. 5 of up to 376,000 pounds of poultry processed by
Shelat Kosher Foods and sold under the Shelat label.
   The judge also issued a temporary injunction shutting down
Shelat, a meat-processing firm that made specialty kosher poultry
products such as chicken kiev.
   On Nov. 24, Shelat admitted selling non-kosher poultry as kosher
in a court-issued consent decree and was permanently closed, said
William Sullivan, chief of the attorney general's consumer
protection division.
   The attorney general's office estimated that Shelat made about
$250,000 profit from selling cheaper non-kosher poultry at the
higher kosher prices.
   But Segal said his catering company was more concerned about the
possible violations of Jewish religious law. ``The mental anguish
that we had from the possibility of having defiled dishes and ovens
and flatware was awful,'' he said.
   The company also was ordered to pay $250,000 in restitution and
fines, and its president, Sheldon Terman, was ordered to sell his
stock in United Poultry, a company that distributed Shelat's
products and other kosher foods.
   Under Friday's settlement, United Poultry, which still was
distributing other kosher poultry products, must stop selling all
kosher foods by no later than Sept. 1, and the other two companies
are also ordered out of the kosher business, Segal said.
   It also specifies a monetary settlement which may not be
disclosed under terms of the settlement, Segal said.
   ``We have no complaints about the settlement,'' said Harvey
Silets, an attorney representing the companies and the Termans.
``We've agreed to it. This is merely a continuation of the matter
that was initiated by the attorney general.''
   Silets said the company officers accused in the suit would not
be available for comment.
   Shelat bought poultry from kosher butchering houses and then
processed it to make specialty items, such as boneless chicken
breasts stuffed with rice, Segal said.
   But a new employee at Shelat noticed that the company was
sending out more kosher-labeled products than the amount of
kosher-slaughtered chicken it received, Segal said.
   A surprise inspection by the Union of Orthodox Jewish
Congregations found that Shelat employees were placing the union's
kosher labels on poultry that was not kosher, Segal said.

   Milk production last year declined 1 percent
to less than 142.5 billion pounds from a revised 1986 record of
143.8 billion pounds, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Previously, USDA had estimated 1987 milk output at about 142.9
billion pounds and the 1986 record at 144.1 billion.
   The new estimates were in a monthly report on milk production,
which showed January output running about 3 percent above a year
ago in the major dairy states.
   Department economists say 1988 milk production is expected to
rise by 1 percent to 3 percent, which could push output for the
year to another record level.

<HEAD>20 British Defendants in Soccer Trial Set Free on Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court on Friday freed on
bail 20 British soccer fans charged with manslaughter in riots that
killed 39 people at a 1985 championship match.
   The court ruled that despite the charges, the setting of bail
was sufficient to assure their appearance at a trial, a court
official said. He spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
   No date for the trial has been set.
   The 20 were among 25 fans of the British soccer team FC
Liverpool who had been extradited to Belgium last September to be
tried in connection with the riots at Heysel.
   Earlier this month, a lower court had set bails ranging from
$1,430 to $5,715. Five of the defendants had been released earlier
to await trial.
   The 25 fans were arrested in Britain after video tapes and
photographs indicated they had been involved in the riots, which
occurred before the European Champions' Cup final between Liverpool
and Juiventus Turin of Italy on May 29, 1985.
   British supporters charged rival fans in an adjacent stand,
causing panic. Thirty-nine people, most of them Italians, were
trampled to death during the retreat from the violence.

<HEAD>Balkan Ministers Pledge to Resolve Ethnic Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IVAN STEFANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of six Balkan
nations pledged Friday to resolve ethnic disputes in their region
following a meeting that included the rare participation of Albania.
   The ministers ended their first post-war meeting by adopting a
communique in which they also pledged to boost economic
cooperation. Participating in the conference were Yugoslavia,
Albania, Greece, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.
   Relations among nearly all the Balkan nations are marked by
ethnic tensions. Albanian and Yugoslav relations have been strained
over the ethnic Albanian minority in the southern Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.
   The three-day conference was the highest-level meeting of Balkan
states since World War II, and the first international conference
outside the United Nations to be attended by an Albanian foreign
minister.
   It was also the first visit to Yugoslavia by an Albanian foreign
minister since Belgrade broke with the Soviet bloc in 1948. Albania
broke with the bloc in 1960.
   Albania has been moving toward contact with other nations since
the death in 1985 of its longtime leader Enver Hoxha, who kept
Albania virtually isolated from the rest of the world.
   The adoption of the final document was delayed 9O-minutes after
Albania raised objections to some aspects of the text. As the host
country, Yugoslavia drafted the final document.
   Albanian Foreign Minister Reis Malile and his Yugoslav
counterpart Budimir Loncar left the conference hall to discuss the
disputed paragraphs.
   Loncar, asked what Albania had objected to, said that it
involved ``only a sequence of words and paragraphs.'' He refused to
be more specific.
   The communique adopted by the conference encouraged more
frequent meetings among the Balkan leaders. The foreign ministers
agreed to meet ``periodically,'' but did not set a date for their
next conference.
   Addressing the minority issue, the communique stated that ethnic
minorities ``should be a factor of cohesion, stability, friendly
relations and cooperation.''
   The communique also emphasized the ``humanitarian aspect of
cooperation,'' an apparent reference to concerns of some states
over human rights abuses regarding their ethnic minorities in
neighboring countries.
   Bulgaria began a campaign in 1984 to change the names of its
estimated 1 million-strong ethnic Turkish minority. The campaign
was first reported by Turkish newspapers and later confirmed by
Western diplomats in Sofia and Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights organization.
   Albania has also accused Yugoslavia of discriminating against
its ethnic Albanian minority, and Greece has in the past expressed
concern about the Greek minority in Albania.

<HEAD>U.N. Prepares For Emergency Session On U.S. Move To Close PLO
Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations prepared Friday for an
emergency session of the General Assembly next week to consider
U.S. plans to close the U.N. observer mission of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The session by the 159-nation group begins Monday and is
expected to last at least three days.
   The dispute began after the U.S. Congress voted and President
Reagan approved an order last December to shut the PLO mission in
New York effective March 22.
   Following the congressional action the General Assembly voted
overwhelmingly to urge the United States to abide by its treaty
obligations and leave the mission alone.
   The United Nations resolution said the U.S. law violated the
1947 Headquarters Agreement, which obliges the United States to
allow U.N. missions to operate.
   Both the PLO and Arab League previously said they might seek to
move the General Assembly from New York to Geneva if the PLO office
is closed. They also have said they could seek a ruling by the
World Court in the Hague.
   The United Nations was awaiting word from U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III on whether he would implement the law and close the
mission. In the past, he has said he intends to enforce the law.
   In Washington, U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, America's
permanent U.N. representative, told congressmen Thursday he was
``not optimistic about the outcome'' of the session.
   He made the comment after testifying that if the United States
continues to default on its U.N. budget dues, now $252.8 million in
arrears, it will lose influence and prestige in the international
body.
   A draft resolution approved Friday by the Arab League states
that the United States is legally obliged to let the PLO operate
its observer mission and calls the U.S. legislation ``a blatant
violation'' of the Headquarters Agreement.
   Last year, the State Department closed the PLO information
center in Washington, the only other PLO office in the United
States.
   The Headquarters Agreement provides for binding arbitration of
disputes between the United States and the United Nations. U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has invoked the
arbitration clause of the treaty, but said the United States had
not agreed to arbitration.

   An Internal Revenue Service agent and a
former agent have been charged in a sting operation in which $300
million of purported drug money was to be laundered and brought
into the United States, federal prosecutors said Friday.
   William Parramore, 52, of Union City, an IRS employee for 20
years, and Harold Brown, 33, of Albany, Ga., who resigned from an
IRS office in San Mateo last year, were among four men charged
after an internal investigation that began in Seattle, said U.S.
Attorney Joseph Russoniello.
   The investigation last month when Ray Wilford, 26, of Des
Moines, Wash., told a government informant posing as a cocaine
dealer that he had an uncle who worked for the IRS and could help
launder money, said IRS internal security investigator Michael
Charland in a statement filed in federal court.
   Wilford later identified the uncle as Parramore, a revenue
officer group manager in the Hayward IRS office, Charland said.
   The informant told Parramore at an electronically recorded
meeting Jan. 14 that he had $300 million in Panama and Hong Kong
banks and wanted to bring it into the United States without
trouble, Charland said.
   He said Parramore agreed to help in exchange for 10 percent of
the money, and proposed setting up a corporation to launder the
funds, which were to be moved in amounts of $500,000. Wilford and
his cousin, Terrance Wilford, 25, of Seattle, were to receive
$50,000, Charland said.
   Parramore and Ray Wilford referred the informant to Brown, who
in a recorded Feb. 5 meeting proposed a plan to move money into the
United States by setting up three businesses in the San Francisco
Bay area that would be financed through loans from foreign banks,
Charland said.
   He said the informant and an undercover IRS agent rejected the
proposal, and that Brown promised to work on a new plan.
   All four men are charged with conspiracy to commit tax fraud,
punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Parramore was arrested at his home Friday, and the Wilfords were
arrested in Seattle, Russoniello said. Brown is being sought.

   The Romanian government, apparently weary of
White House and congressional demands for a better human rights
performance, has renounced American trade benefits given to
communist countries with good emigration policies, U.S. officials
said Friday.
   As a result, Romania could lose up to $250 million in commerce
with the United States, according to Romanian figures.
   State Department spokesman Phyllis Oakley said Romania informed
the United States through diplomatic channels that it had decided
to ``renounce'' the trade concessions, therefore subjecting
Romanian goods to higher tariffs as of July 2.
   Romania also will lose eligibility for U.S. government-supported
export credits through the Commodity Credit Corp. or the
Export-Import Bank, Mrs. Oakley said.
   The announcement reflected a growing deterioration of relations
between the United States and Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu,
who has been wooed by U.S. administrations in the past because of
his relatively independent line from Moscow.
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, who met Ceausescu
in Bucharest three weeks ago, informed the Romanian leader of U.S.
dissatisfaction with human rights policies. Whitehead later told
reporters that Ceausescu's replied, in essence: stop meddling in
Romania's internal affairs.
   Starting in 1975, presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan scrutinized
Romania's emigration policies and repeatedly asked Congress to
waive a rule preventing state-economy countries from receiving
``most-favored-nation status'' _ the right to lower tariffs.
Congress has gone along.
   Under the Jackson-Vanik amendment, designed to spur the Soviet
Union and its allies to permit high levels of emigration by Jews
and other ethnic groups, countries that satisfy that human right
are eligible for the trade benefit on an annually renewable basis.
   Among Soviet bloc countries, only Romania, Poland and Hungary
have been recipients.
   Despite Friday's announcement, Mrs. Oakley said Romania ``stated
to us that it will continue to allow emigration for family
reunification purposes, without relation to economic ties with the
United States. We welcome this.''
   She said Romania had also expressed a desire to continue to work
for better relations.
   According to her figures, U.S. exports to Romania are worth $200
million annually, of which half are agriculture products. ``The
competitiveness of these exports will suffer,'' she acknowledged.
``We think trade will likely shrink.''
   Romania exported goods worth $775 million to the United States
last year, the spokeswoman said. She said Romania estimates that
its loss of most-favored nation status will cost up to $250 million
in lost exports.
   In recent years, U.S. diplomats have conferred with the
Ceausescu government on steps Romania would be expected to take to
win President Reagan's approval of a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik
rules.
   Romania traditionally had satisfied those expectations enough to
win a presidential waiver and approval by Congress, but in recent
years, members of Congress increasingly have questioned whether
Romanian compliance met the requirements.
   Many members, notably Sen. Paul Trible, R-Va., asserted that
Romania's continued discrimination against religious minorities and
its overall supression of free speech, political opposition and
other freedoms warranted cancellation of the trade benefits.
   They also rejected arguments by Reagan and other presidents that
the benefits encouraged Romania to continue such non-Moscow
policies as recognition of Israel and non-participation in Warsaw
Pact military maneuvers.
   Whitehead said after returning from Bucharest that the
administration had not decided whether to ask Congress to give
Romania the trade benefits this year. Even if it made such a
request, there were no assurances Congress would grant it, he said.
   Stripping Romania of its most favored nation status has been
under consideration by House-Senate negotiators working on new
trade legislation.
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a sponsor of the trade-benefit
cutoff, said of Ceausescu's action, ``I think he has done this to
pre-empt the annual scrutiny of Romania's human rights record,
which is deplorable.''
   Smith said that during a recent visit to Bucharest he detected
``a hardened attitude.''
   ``He's cutting off his nose to spite his face,'' Smith said of
Ceausescu. ```We don't want to end the relationship. We just want
them to stop the trashing of human rights.''

   Congressional foes of Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega urged the Reagan administration on Friday to
impose an immediate and total trade embargo to force him from power.
   Some said the administration should not rule out _ at least as
an option _ the use of military force to oust Noriega, the general
who heads Panama's defense forces.
   Noriega was indicted in the United States recently on charges of
taking millions of dolllars to turn Panama into a haven for drugs
and the profits they generate.
   Others said the United States should press the issue at the
Organization for American States and seek the widest possible
consensus in the Western Hemisphere for Noriega's removal and for
the restoration of democracy in Panama.
   But Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said
the United States needs to ``keep cool''as it reviews its options
in dealing with Noreiga, especially in light of the continuing U.S.
need to protect free passage through the Panama Canal.
   There was almost universal rejection on Capitol Hill of
Noriega's claim that the United States is attempting to use
corruption charges against him to renege on the U.S. committment to
turn the canal over to Panama by the year 2000.
   ``That statement by Gen. Noriega is piffle, pap, and political
flim flam intended to preserve his own interests,'' Byrd told
reporters.
   ``That is an absolute and total and complete fabrication,'' said
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla. ``... It's the old trick of when you get
caught with your hand in the till, of trying to raise some red
herring to draw attention from yourself ...''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said he spoke to Panamanian
President Eric Arturo Delvalle by telephone at midday on Friday.
   ``He said to me he would be fully supportive of a trade
embargo,'' D'Amato told reporters. ``That would be the kind of
decisive action the United States should follow through on.''
   D'Amato said that while he does not believe the United States
should now intervene militarily, ``we should not preclude military
action if that is necessary to protect the vital interests of the
United States.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the United States should
press the Organization of American States (OAS) to accept the
credentials of a new ambassador sent by Devalle and cancel the
credentials of Noriega's ambassador.
   He said that would make clear where the democracies of the
hemisphere stand on the matter.
   ``The action that the OAS takes will speak volumes about whether
that is a meaningful organization or whether it should not be taken
seriously,'' Kennedy said.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who heads a Senate Foreign Relations
Committee investigation into Noriega's alleged links to narcotics
racketeering and money laundering, said the United States should
consider suspending landing rights for Panamanaian aircraft and
stop the export of U.S. technology to that country.
   But he said that because Panama uses U.S. currency as legal
tender, the most telling step would be to suspend the transfer of
U.S. dollars to and from Panama.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the Senate's deputy GOP leader,
called for a bipartisan movement to deal ``with a squirrel like
Noriega who's got his mailed fist on the levers of the locks of the
canal.''
   ``I think you will find Noriega will leave once the United
States makes a flat-footed stand,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
a leading critic both of Noriega and of the treaties which call for
the canal to be turned over to Panama in the year 2000.
   ``Just embargo Panama,'' Helms said.

<HEAD>U.S. Plans Appeal of Ruling Throwing Out Hijack Suspect's
Confession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors said Friday they intended
to appeal a judge's ruling that the FBI illegally obtained a
confession from a Lebanese hijacking suspect who is scheduled to go
to trial next month.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson said prosecutors had
asked Solicitor General Charles Fried to approve an appeal of U.S.
District Judge Barrington Parker's order suppressing the confession
of Fawaz Younis.
   Parker ruled earlier this week that the FBI illegally
interrogated Younis over a four-day period on a Navy vessel after
the suspect was lured onto an FBI-chartered yacht off Cyprus and
arrested last Sept. 13.
   Younis is scheduled to go on trial March 22 on charges he led
the June 11, 1985, hijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner carrying
three Americans.
   The plane was blown up at Beirut International Airport the next
day after the passengers and crew were taken off the aircraft.
   Parker ruled that the FBI should have provided Younis with an
attorney for the interrogation, which occurred on board a Navy
munitions boat that slowly steamed from Cyprus to a rendezvous with
an aircraft carrier, from which Younis was flown to Washington.
   The judge found that Younis, whose wrists were fractured when he
was grabbed by FBI agents and slammed to the deck of the yacht, was
in no physical condition to freely waive his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination before he was interrogated.
   The judge was sharply critical of the FBI's arrest and
interrogation, saying the only reason the FBI kept Younis aboard
the ship for four days was to extract a confession.
   An appeal of Parker's order could delay the proceeding if the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agrees to take the case and does not
make a ruling before the trial date.

   The Senate refused on Friday for the eighth
time in a year to allow a floor vote on a Democratic proposal to
limit campaign spending, but supporters and Republican foes agreed
that the battle wasn't over.
   A move by Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to halt
debate failed again on a 53-41 roll call after 53 hours of
round-the-clock filibustering led by Republicans. The bill was
promptly shelved, probably for the rest of the year.
   The Democrats thus fell seven votes short of the necessary
60-vote majority required to invoke cloture, or to gag debate, even
though Democrats got the votes of Republicans John Chafee of Rhode
Island, Robert Stafford of Vermont and Nancy Landon Kassebaum of
Kansas.
   Democratic leaders of the fight to curb the escalating costs of
Senate campaigning _ which averaged $3 million per candidate in
1986 _ said they were ``disappointed but not downhearted'' by their
latest setback.
   They claimed enough votes to pass the bill by a simple majority
if the cloture petition had succeeded. But Byrd declared that the
campaign finance issue ``will not be swept under the rug.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said, ``this is not the end of the
fight for campaign reform; this is but the beginning.'' And
Assistant GOP Leader Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming agreed.
   ``We've sliced the snake into seven sections and today we'll lop
off the head, for the eighth time, but it will rise again from the
sand,'' Simpson said.
   By all accounts, the bill was killed by unwavering Republican
opposition to a provision that would have given Senate candidates
incentives to limit voluntarily their spending in general election
campaigns starting in 1990. The ceilings would have ranged from
$950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on the size of a state's
population.
   Under the bill, special-interest political action committees
could have supplied no more than 20 percent of a participating
candidate's funds. In 1986, these PACs accounted for more than half
the campaign money spent by more than 200 House and Senate
candidates, most of them incumbents.
   Republicans complained, as Sen. Mitch McConnell of entucky put
it, that ``the bill was crafted to aid the Democrats at the expense
of Republicans,'' especially by limiting funds available to GOP
candidates challenging Democratic incumbents in larger states.
   Boren and other Democrats denied such an aim, but GOP senators
remained convinced that the bill would serve to perpetuate
Democratic control of the Senate, which they seized in 1986.
   McConnell said Republicans would never accept campaign spending
limits. ``We didn't do it today,'' he said. ``We won't do it ever.''
   But the issue, which Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., called ``a ticking
time bomb out there,'' was clearly far from dead. ``We will revisit
the issue in one form or another,'' Byrd said. ``It's not going to
go away.''
   The majority leader suggested that one option might be a
proposed constitutional amendment, which reportedly has some
bipartisan support, that would seek to override a Supreme Court
ruling against mandatory limits on congressional campaign spending.
   But Simpson warned that Republicans would be waiting. ``I know
there will be some more proposals like this, and when they come up,
they'll be dealt with like this,'' he said.
   The latest Senate battle over campaign spending followed a
record seven cloture attempts by the Democratic leadership last
year, all of them in vain. wound up with a fusillade of floor
rhetoric.
   In a futile appeal for votes to halt the debate, Byrd asked his
colleagues whether the Senate ``is going to become the fortress of
special interests and the citadel of men of wealth.''
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the Republicans ``have made
a miscalculation of historic proportions'' because incumbents tend
to spend more on Senate campaigns than their challengers.
   Unless GOP senators agree to spending limits, Mitchell said,
``It is possible there will be a Republican minority in the Senate
for the rest of this century.''
   Republicans began filibustering Tuesday afternoon in an effort
to block a vote on the bill, which the Democrats were virtually
certain to win. Byrd responded by ordering non-stop debate in an
effort to wear the Republicans down and focus attention on their
stalling tactics.
   Things turned nasty early Wednesday when senators _ nearly all
of them Democrats _ approved a Byrd motion to have absentee
Republicans arrested and returned to the chamber.
   Plainclothes Capitol police seized Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore.,
in his office and carried him feet-first into the Senate chamber,
giving Byrd the quorum of 51 senators that he needed to keep the
filibuster alive.

   These were the top developments involving Panama on Friday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega accused the
United States of instigating the effort to end his military rule.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle, ousted by the legislature after
trying to fire Noriega Thursday, insisted he was still the
president of Panama and called for a worldwide trade embargo
against his country.
   The Defense Forces, meanwhile, closed the headquarters of two
opposition groups.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ President Reagan said he has no plan to intervene
militarily in Panama, and the State Department said the United
States will continue to recognize Delvalle as president.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
wanted to see Noriega stand trial on the drug charges for which he
was indicted in Florida, and wants Panama to have a civilian
government, but ``we want to be careful not to unduly intrude upon
the affairs of Panama.''
   Vice President George Bush said the United States will do
``whatever is necessary'' to protect its vital interests, but
Reagan said he detected no ``appetite on the part of anyone there,
including Mr. Noriega, to take on our troops.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., advocated a trade
embargo to press Noriega to step down while Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., called Noriega ``a bum'' who ``ought to be thrown out.''
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the United
States ``ought to keep cool'' and give the Panamanian people ample
time to decide Noriega's fate.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Jose I. Blandon, a onetime associate of Noriega,
said Delvalle anticipated that his attempted firing of Noriega
would fail but is confident that planned steps will lead to
Noriega's downfall within three weeks.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Panama's ambassador to Washington, Juan Sosa, said
he refused an order Friday by Noriega to resign and would continue
to serve as envoy under Delvalle. Sosa said a U.S. trade embargo
might be necessary to depose Noriega and acknowledged that Delvalle
has no support in the military.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo on Friday criticized
lawyers for a black teen-ager who says she was assaulted by six
white men, accusing the lawyers of ``making up conditions'' that
have blocked her testimony.
   A lawyer for Tawana Brawley said Cuomo's remarks were ``down in
the gutter.''
   Meanwhile, an aunt of Miss Brawley's aunt was quoted in a
newspaper interview as saying the girl hadn't even talked about the
case with the lawyers who have refused to allow her to cooperate
with investigators.
   Miss Brawley, 16, was reported missing for four days in
November. She was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and
covered with feces, with racial epithets scrawled on her body. She
has said one of the men who assaulted her flashed a police badge
and had a holster.
   She and her family, of Wappinger's Falls north of New York City,
have refused to be questioned on the advice of attorneys C. Vernon
Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. of New York City, who have pressed for a
special prosecutor acceptable to them.
   ``They said they had reasons they could not cooperate. ... It's
clear now they don't really,'' Cuomo said, referring to the
lawyers. ``These conditions obviously don't mean anything. They
keep making up new conditions. What has become more and more
apparent is they simply don't want to cooperate for reasons that I
don't understand.''
   Cuomo said he was willing to do anything to help move the case
along, including meeting with Miss Brawley if her lawyers and the
special state prosecutor he appointed thought that might help. Her
lawyers have rejected that idea.
   At a news conference in Newburgh on Friday, Mason blasted
Cuomo's remarks and compared New York to ``Mississippi circa 1954.''
   ``I shudder to think how he would deal with Gorbachev. I shudder
to think how he would deal with the world's problems. I shudder to
think of how he would deal with leading the nation,'' Mason said,
referring to speculation about Cuomo as a potential presidential
candidate.
   He renewed his demand for a new and permanent special state
prosecutor for racial crimes to replace Cuomo's selection for the
Brawley case, state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   Mason said that if Cuomo didn't replace Abrams, he would turn to
federal authorities for help.
   Mason and the Rev. Al Sharpton said a mass rally against racism
is planned for Saturday in Newburgh and neighboring Poughkeepsie.
   Cuomo stood behind Abrams, and rejected Mason's claim that the
attorney general was unable to handle the investigation.
   Abrams told an Albany news conference that he was pressing ahead
with the investigation. Miss Brawley's cooperation is ``critically
important'' to the investigation, he said, but he refused to say
the case couldn't be solved without her help.
   The Middletown Times Herald Record quoted Juanita Brawley, who
helped raise Tawana for eight years and who has spent time with the
girl since her attack, as saying she is the only one who knows
enough about the incident to keep the lawyers and the girl's mother
informed.
   ``I know a few things that no one else knows,'' the girl's aunt
said during an interview at her home. She said of Maddox, ``He has
not talked to Tawana. He does not need to talk to Tawana.'' She did
not elaborate.
   ``I'm not going to address it or dignify it,'' Mason said when
asked about the report.
   Miss Brawley has refused to talk to investigators since shortly
after she was found. The Dutchess County district attorney and a
special local prosecutor both withdrew from the case for
unspecified conflicts of interest.
   Miss Brawley's supporters, without providing specific evidence,
have charged that local law enforcement officials were somehow
involved in the attack.

<HEAD>Fourth CIA Official With Iran-Contra Links Leaves Agency</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: CORRECTS time element, 2nd graf pvs, bgng: Alan Fiers</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA official who established a secret
supply network for Nicaragua's Contra rebels has resigned to go
into private business, becoming at least the fourth agency official
involved in the Iran-Contra affair to leave his job.
   Alan Fiers, a veteran agent who was chief of the agency's
Central American Task Force, has resigned effective March 4, Bill
Baker, the agency's spokesman, said Friday.
   Fiers was one of several CIA officials involved in the
Iran-Contra affair who was reprimanded last year by CIA Director
William Webster because of his role and his failure to inform
Congress about the activity.
   Despite that disciplinary action, Fiers had continued to handle
Central American matters and had briefed members of Congress as
part of the Reagan administration's efforts to win renewed military
aid for the Contras.
   ``It was his personal decision to leave,'' said Baker, who
called Fiers ``a solid guy'' and confirmed that he had turned down
a job as a CIA station chief in an unspecified foreign country.
``He said he has other options and is going to take them. Alan had
a full career here, and he knew it.''
   Baker also said the agency is annoyed at Elliott Abrams, the
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, who also
was involved in the administration's clandestine plan to aid the
Contras at a time when Congress had prohibited such aid.
   Abrams, quoted in Friday's New York Times, said Fiers' treatment
by the CIA ``would send exactly the wrong signal to young officers
at the agency.''
   Abrams was quoted as saying the handling of Fiers case ``says,
`Don't get involved in controversial programs because you will end
up being punished for it.''' He added: ``He has made a great
contribution to our interests in Central America and it is an
injustice that he is not being rewarded for it.''
   Baker said the agency will complain directly to Abrams about
what he called the impropriety of the remarks.
   ``We're very angry at Elliott Abrams,'' he said. ``It's none of
his business to making comments about case officers and their
futures.''
   Fiers, a former Ohio State football player, spent nearly 21
years in the CIA after joining in June 1967. At age 48, Fiers was
two years short of reaching the CIA's early retirement age and
collecting a substantial pension, said one associate, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Webster reprimanded Fiers late last year after an internal probe
of the agency's involvement in the secret sale of U.S. weapons to
Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
The reprimand meant Fiers could not be promoted for at least two
years, and he apparently saw his career at the agency stalled, the
source said.
   After that same investigation, Webster reportedly fired two
officials _ the former station chief in Costa Rica, Joe Fernandez,
and the chief of a large agency base at Aguacate, Honduras. And
Clair George, chief of the agency's clandestine service who was
criticized for his role in the affair, retired at the end of last
year.
   During closed-door testimony before the congressional
Iran-Contra committees, Fiers acknowledged that he had withheld
information from Congress about the resupply effort, saying: ``So
long as others who knew the details, as much as I, were keeping
their silence on that, I was going to keep my silence.''
   Fiers remains under investigation as part of the investigation
by the government's independent counsel, Lawrence E. Walsh, into
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The CIA has never disclosed Fiers' name or position, but some
details of his background and career are known. He served as an
intelligence officer in Pakistan and later as station chief in
Saudi Arabia, which was enlisted by the Reagan administration to
provide $32 million in covert funding for the Contras.
   Fiers played right end and tackle under the legendary Ohio State
football coach Woody Hayes from 1958 to 1960. He was a biological
sciences major.
   At the CIA, Fiers was credited for skillful work in setting up a
system to make airdrops of supplies to the rebels fighting the
leftist Sandinista government.

<HEAD>Cruise Ship Vacation Becomes Mutinous Mess, Passengers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pleasure voyage around Central America
turned into a seagoing nightmare when passengers encountered poor
food, a mutinous crew and fistfights, authorities say.
   The cruise brochure had promised passengers a ``friendly,
attentive crew'' and a chance to meet new friends around the pool,
or in the lounge or casino.
   On Friday, the last 90 passengers aboard the cruise ship Galaxy
got off the boat in Panama City, Panama, without completing the
last leg of the trip between Acapulco and Cancun, Mexico, said Ron
Dusek, spokesman for the Texas Attorney General's office.
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox had filed suit Wednesday
against Golden Cruisetours Inc. of San Antonio, which booked the
cruise, and two of its subsidiaries and the companies' owners.
   Mattox alleged that cruise customers were bilked of hundreds of
thousands of dollars when their trips were canceled and their money
not refunded. The pleasure cruises were advertised in an Austin
newspaper and 51 other newspapers across the country, Mattox said.
   The Galaxy is owned by Global Cruises, a Panamanian company
owned by the same people at Golden Gruisetours, said Dusek.
   Telephone calls placed Friday to Golden Cruisetours' office in
San Antonio went unanswered.
   The Galaxy cruise began Feb. 11 in Acapulco. Eighty-seven of the
250 passengers refused to go on the cruise because the food was
cold and the air conditioning broken, officials said.
   The next day, the crew mutinied, according to the U.S. State
Department. More passengers left the ship Feb. 18, before the ship
left from Punta Renas, Costa Rica.
   During a docking in Costa Rica, about 50 mutineers were removed
from the ship. That led to a dock rally sponsored by a local
workers' union which refused to supply replacement labor.
   When the ship docked in Panama City, the last 90 passengers on
the cruise disembarked, according to Dusek, who said he did not
know where the ship was.
   Passenger Sarita Anderson described an unsettling scene aboard
ship during a docking in Guatemala.
   ``As we started into the lounge, there was a fight going on,''
she told the Houston Chronicle. ``It was something to do with work
schedules.''
   The English-speaking Honduran crew supervisor was arguing with
the ship's staff chief, yelling that the Mexican crew members,
kitchen help and cabin boys, who had been hired only days earlier
in Acapulco, were being worked too hard, Ms. Anderson said.
   The two men then began a bloody fight, she said.

<TEXT>
   The prostitute who claims to have posed nude
for evangelist Jimmy Swaggart failed a lie detector test, a
national tabloid reported Friday.
   The National Enquirer said Debra Murphree voluntarily took the
polygraph test it arranged, adding that it was administered by a
expert with 15 years' experience with the New York City Police
Department.
   The tabloid said in a news release that its expert concluded
Murphree failed to tell the truth on all key questions relating to
her statements.
   However, the statement did not say what the questions were and
gave no other details.
   Murphree saus she performed pornographic acts for Swaggart for
about a year but never had sex with him.
   After allegations of misconduct arose, Swaggart made a tearful
public confession of sin and faces a three-month suspension from
preaching recommended by the Louisiana Assemblies of God hierarchy.
   John Martinez, a companion of Murphree, told The Palm Beach Post
that Murphree visited Swaggart weekly for a year in New
Orleans-area hotel rooms at $50 per meeting.
   Martinez is now peddling Ms. Murphree's story. ``This is a shot
for me and a shot for her,'' he said Wednesday. ``It's the American
way _ see an opportunity and jump on it.''
   Martinez says he talked with the National Enquirer about a
$100,000 contract for Murphree's story and also contacted other
media.
   ``I don't want to see her end up with nothing and on the
streets,'' Martinez, 28, said in a telphone interview Thursday.
``She's not after the money, but I'm looking out after her future.''
   Enquirer president and editor Iain Calder said the tabloid was
talking with Martinez, but would say nothing more.

<TEXT>
   Teachers in the state's largest school district
walked picket lines for a second day Friday as negotiators
continued to search for ways end their strike and resume classes
for 73,000 students.
   Adminstrators planned to teach classes for 3,600 seniors
starting Monday if the walkout continued.
   The Cleveland Teachers Union went on strike Thursday after
rejecting the school board's latest contract proposal. Negotiations
resumed Friday afternoon under the guidance of a federal mediator.
   ``I'm hopeful, and the parties seem resolved to try to make a
deal this weekend,'' said Craig M. Brown, the school district's
chief negotiator.
   Said Richard Farmer, the union's strike coordinator:``We would
hope they sit at the table until it's resolved. We don't want a
long strike.''
   The district canceled classes Friday because of the strike by
the 5,093-member union. Schools were closed Thursday because of bad
weather, although other area school systems remained open.
   The closure was viewed as an effort by school administrators to
give negotiators in marathon talks more time to reach a settlement.
   Schools spokesman John M. Hairston said the school board planned
to seek a court order to limit the number of pickets at the
district's buildings because of problems Friday. At Lincoln-West
High School, pickets prevented adminstrators from entering the
building to prepare for classes for seniors at that school Monday,
he said.
   The school board had offered a three-year package with a 3
percent pay raise retroactive to Sept. 1, and 5 percent increases
the next two years contingent on passage of a tax levy and a
voluntary ``career ladder'' in the third year, which would link pay
raises to performance evaluations.
   The school board also offered a one-year contract with a 3
percent raise.
   Cleveland teacher salaries range from $17,600 to $37,450,
depending on education and experience. The average teacher makes
$29,000 annually.

   A wild Miss USA pageant took a turn for
the wilder Friday when an animal-rights activist disrupted a news
conference by co-host Alan Thicke.
   Thicke, star of ABC's ``Growing Pains'' and host of the Saturday
morning children's show ``Animal Crack-Ups,'' replaced Bob Barker
as the pageant's host after Barker resigned last month to protest
the giving away of fur coats as prizes.
   It was just one in a series of bumps on the way to Tuesday's
nationally televised beauty contest.
   Miss Minnesota-USA and her runner-up dropped out after it was
disclosed they had been arrested on shoplifting charges. Another
contestant is awaiting trial on drunken-driving charges.
   And Thursday night, Thicke's co-host, actress Tracy Scoggins,
was attacked in a hotel elevator. She suffered bruises but no other
injuries and a suspect was charged with attempted sexual assault.
   Miss USA will be awarded cash and prizes including a full-length
mink coat and a mink jacket. The furs are worth $15,000.
   The Las Cruces, N.M., and El Paso chapters of Sangre de Cristo
Animal Rights plan to picket the El Paso Convention Center during
the pageant to protest the fur prizes. The activists say fur
farming and trapping are cruel activities that should be stopped.
   Bob Young, the picket organizer and president of the group's Las
Cruces chapter, has criticized Thicke for what he calls his
hypocrisy in hosting the pageant. Thicke ends each ``Animal
Crack-Ups'' show with the admonishment: ``Here's hoping you will be
kind to animals.''
   Thicke seemed eager to address the charges at Friday's news
conference. He said he prefers to work within the system instead of
causing ``more abrasion in what is potentially a conflictive
issue.''
   Referring to the pickets, Thicke said: ``I invite those people
to join any one of the eight groups that I am involved with and do
some of the things that we do, such as meet with lobbyists and
legislators.''
   At that point, Young stepped in front of Thicke and held up a
poster of a raccoon caught in a leg trap.
   ``Do your eight groups go along with this?'' Young said, holding
up the poster.
   ``I'm addressing all of that, sir,'' Thicke said.
   ``Your eight groups _ I'd like to know what those groups are,
and if they go along with this,'' Young said.
   ``I'm sure they would be happy to give you an opportunity to
speak when I'm done,'' Thicke said. ``As Mr. Reagan once said, I
paid for this microphone.''
   He did not name the eight groups.
   Thicke said he investigated the suppliers of the pageant's furs
before deciding to do the show to make sure they conformed with
U.S. animal-treatment standards.
   Pageant officials clearly were angry about the interruption, but
declined comment.

<TEXT>
   Although President Eric Arturo
Delvalle could not dismiss the general who really runs the country,
his attempt will make it harder for other Latin American nations to
support Panama's government.
   Since that has long been a goal of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
opponents, leading Panamanian dissidents and the U.S. State
Department were quick to cheer Delvalle's seemingly quixotic move.
   Its practical result was that Noriega stayed in his post as
military commander and the national legislature dismissed Delvalle,
althoguh he refused to relinquish the office and the United States
supported him.
   Delvalle's order to Noriega had the futility of tilting at
windmills because he had no way to back it up. Noriega, not the
civilian president, controls Panama's army, police, legislature,
and even the game wardens.
   It came as no surprise, therefore, that the commander of the
national police and the army's chief of staff quickly sided with
the general against the president.
   So, too, did the National Assembly, which is dominated by a
coalition of Noriega followers. In a 10-minute meeting early
Friday, it fired Delvalle and Vice President Roderick Esquivel.
   Delvalle said the assembly's action was unconstiutional, but his
only weapon against it is public opinion.
   Panama's Latin American neighbors have been slow to condemn
Noriega despite widespread allegations of involvement in drug
trafficking and other forms of corruption, even murder. The general
has denied all the charges.
   Noriega has drawn the United States as a straw man, accusing it
of trying to oust him and renege on a 1976 treaty turning the
Panama Canal to Panama at the turn of the century. Delvalle took
that stance himself before the change of heart.
   Latin American governments are reluctant to side with the United
States in any dispute involving a neighbor, if only to pacify their
own large numbers of left-leaning voters.
   But the spectacle of a legally sitting president firing his top
general, but being fired himself by the general's henchmen, is not
likely to sit well.
   ``This will isolate the government, no doubt,'' said Mario Luis
del Valle, vice president of the Panama Banking Association and a
member of the National Civic Crusade, which began clamoring for
Noriega's ouster last June.
   The Civic Crusade, a loose coalition of business, professional,
labor and political groups, has been trying for months to convince
other Latin American nations that Panama's government is not
legitimate.
   Aurelio Barria, president of the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry and an opposition leader, has carried that message
personally to the presidents of at least half a dozen Latin
American nations.
   Barria has obtained little support until now but the president,
or ex-president, predicted that soon would change.
   ``I think it will be another blow against Noriega and also
against Panama, which has had a terrible track record in recent
years,'' Delvalle said of his unsuccessful dismissal of the
general. ``I expect that the majority of the nations of this
hemisphere will be very reluctant to have relations with Panama.''

<HEAD>GOP Debate Rescheduled By League Of Women Voters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The League of Women Voters has rescheduled the
March 5 debate among Republican presidential candidates in
Nashville, Tenn., to March 6 to avoid a conflict with the March 5
South Carolina primary, a league spokeswoman said Friday.
   The new schedule means the GOP debate will be on the same day as
a previously scheduled Democratic debate sponsored by the league.
   ``We thought it would be better for the candidates if we
scheduled the debate on Sunday rather than on the day of the
primary,'' said league spokeswoman Janice Kaplan.
   Carole Bucy, president of the League of Women Voters in
Nashville, said Vice President George Bush and Sen Bob Dole of
Kansas had sent word they could not participate March 5 because of
the conflict with the South Carolina primary.
   Ms. Kaplan said Rep. Jack Kemp of New York is the only candidate
so far to accept the league's invitation for the GOP debate March
6. She said all six major contenders have agreed to participate in
the Democratic debate.
   However, spokesmen for the campaigns of Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said they have not
yet given a final commitment to join the league debate.
   The Republican debate will begin at 2 p.m. EST, while the
Democrats' debate will start at 5 p.m. Both of the debates will
last an hour and will be at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.

<HEAD>Cuomo Wants No Part of Brokered Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Friday he
wants no part of any brokered Democratic National Convention,
either as the presidential candidate or a kingmaker in selection of
the party's nominee.
   He said he still didn't believe there will be a deadlocked
convention when the Democrats gather in Atlanta in July.
   Cuomo, who announced a year ago that he wouldn't seek the
Democratic nomination, has since refused to rule out accepting a
convention draft.
   His comments came as he prepared for trips during the next few
days to North Carolina and Texas, two of the March 8 Super Tuesday
primary states.
   ``I would have no role,'' said Cuomo of any brokered convention.
``They (the announced candidates) would confine themselves to
people who were candidates and talk to one another.''
   Cuomo did say the possibility of a brokered convention came up
in telephone conversations he had this week with, among others,
former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.
Babbitt has quit the race for the presidential nomination while
Simon has cut back on his campaigning to concentrate on his home
state's March 15 primary.
   ``I just asked them how they thought it would come out,'' said
Cuomo. ``They said it looks now like it's open.''
   Cuomo said that in discussing the situation, neither Simon nor
Babbitt had asked if Cuomo might become a candidate at a brokered
convention. ``They know I'm not interested. They know I'm out of
this thing,'' said Cuomo.
   Cuomo repeated his view that a deadlocked convention ``is the
worst thing that could happen to the Democrats'' because it would
hurt them in the November election.
   Was it coincidence that Cuomo was heading south just before the
Super Tuesday voting? ``Oh, no, that's a plan,'' he joked. ``You
see, I'm going to be March 1 in Texas and if it really goes well,
then March 2 I'm going to announce I'm running.''

<TEXT>
   Young Arabs went from
weekly Moslem prayers to street war with Israeli soldiers Friday,
and four Palestinians were killed in melees that swept the occupied
territories.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz met with Israeli
leaders to explore new peace proposals in the second day of his
mission to the Middle East.
   Friday's dead included a 12-year-old boy accidentally hit by a
piece of concrete thrown by protesters outside a Gaza Strip Mosque,
the army said. Hospital officials said Israeli gunfire wounded 11
Arabs.
   The army reported the arrests of four soldiers on charges of
beating and kicking two young Palestinians who had been detained,
as shown in footage taken Thursday in Nablus by a CBS News crew.
   ``We were shocked and couldn't say a word after we saw this
film,'' said Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the army's West Bank commander.
   Mitzna said he suspended the unit's deputy commander, a captain,
and ordered the two Arabs released.
   Before the violence Friday, U.N. figures listed 65 Arabs killed
by gunfire and beatings since riots began Dec. 8 in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Hundreds have been wounded.
   Shultz is on a five-day mission to Israel and Arab countries
with new U.S. proposals for stopping the violence and reviving
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   He met separately Friday with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, partners and rivals in the tenuous
``national unity'' coalition.
   The U.S. plan calls for immediate talks on Palestinian self-rule
and negotiations by December on the final status of the West Bank
and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Israeli sources said privately that Shamir asked Shultz to move
slowly, recommending a three-year ``time of testing'' before
negotiations on a final settlement.
   Fifteen prominent Palestinians refused to meet with Shultz in
Jerusalem.
   Leaflets signed by the ``United Nationalist Leadership for the
Uprising'' exhorted Arabs to street protests this weekend as an
accompaniment to the Shultz visit.
   Haaretz said Syrian-backed Al Quds radio announced plans for six
weeks of violent protest and strikes. The newspaper said Arabs were
using firebombs more frequently and suspected collaborators were
being targeted for attack.
   A West Bank Palestinian accused of collaborating with the
Israelis was hanged by his fellow villagers Wednesday.
   Israel stationed 1,500 extra police in Jerusalem, doubling the
force, brought in soldiers to help with security during the Shultz
visit and put army units on alert throughout the occupied
territories.
   It did not stop violence on the Moslem Sabbath, sometimes
instigated by prayer leaders.
   ``Thank God we are still alive to fight our enemy Israel,'' a
masked prayer leader told worshipers at Nasr Mosque in the West
Bank city of Nablus.
   ``This is the time that we have to use to launch a holy war. We
have already paid a very high price, and we have to be willing to
pay more.''
   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, the body of Iyad al Ashqar, 12,
was brought to a U.N. clinic after a clash at Al Qassam mosque.
   According to the army, a military doctor said the boy died from
a gash on the head inflicted by a chunk of concrete. Initial army
reports gave the cause of death as gunfire.
   Hospital officials in Jabaliya said a woman was wounded by
gunfire and 20 Arabs were treated for injuries caused by beatings
or tear gas.
   Ahmed Attallah, a witness, said soldiers broke into the mosque
and took 30 people away after Palestinians inside began shouting
``Allahu Akhbar!'' (God is great).
   At Hebron, south of Jerusalem, hundreds of worshipers streamed
from a mosque chanting and throwing stones, and soldiers opened
fire when tear gas and rubber bullets did not disperse the crowd,
an army spokesman said..
   Arab reports said Fuad Shaarawi, 47, was killed but conflicted
on the cause of death. The army said it was not clear whether he
was shot or died of tear-gas inhalation.
   Razk Daraghmen, 55, bled to death after being shot in the right
thigh during a protest in Toubas, a the West Bank village, hospital
officials said.
   A Palestinian was killed as a result of disturbances in Al Arub,
south of Bethlehem, the army reported. Hospital officials and the
Arab-run Palestine Press Service said Israeli soldiers shot Hassan
Abu Kheiran, 22, in the chest.
   Three Arabs were wounded in Jenin, also in the West Bank, after
3,000 Arabs staged a march that led to a clash with soldiers. Arabs
threw stones and glass bottles and troops fired tear gas, rubber
bullets and live amunition, witnesses reported.

   Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
said Friday he's still a friend of the United States and U.S.
interests in his country ``shall remain intact, undisturbed and
unharmed'' despite a leadership struggle there.
   Noreiga's statement was issued by his Miami attorneys after
Panama's legislative assembly removed the president and vice
president early Friday. The president had tried to remove Noriega.
   ``These events are strictly internal to Panama,'' Noriega said.
   His attorneys declined to speculate as to whether Noriega would
step down.
   ``Our roles here are as lawyers, not as foreign policy or
domestic policy advisors,'' said Neal Sonnett, who read Noriega's
statement at a news conference.
   ``Conditions in Panama, as we understand it, are calm,'' Sonnett
said. ``That's a domestic political situation that's going on down
there.''
   Noriega was indicted three weeks ago by federal grand juries in
Miami and Tampa on charges of allowing drug traffickers to use his
country as a base for smuggling into the United States.
   Sonnett said he last spoke with Noriega about 10 days ago.
Friday's statement was issued after consultation between Noriega's
advisers and his defense team in Miami, Sonnett said.
   ``All American interests in the republic are and shall remain
intact, undisturbed and unharmed,'' the statement said. ``The
general reiterates that he is now, and has always been, a friend of
the United States of America. Those American politicians who have
suggested otherwise, and who advocate hysteria, act with a reckless
disregard for the truth.''
   Panama's legislative assembly removed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle and the vice president from office during an emergency
session. Its action followed Delvalle's order that Noriega step
down.
   Hours after Delvalle's announcement Thursday, Roberto Eisenmann,
exiled publisher of Panama's leading independent newspaper, La
Prensa, received word that soldiers had again closed the newspaper.
It was closed down last year for six months, reopening in January.
   Richard Gregorie, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Florida's
southern district, has said that if Noriega were to leave Panama,
``we would attempt to extradite him like any other dope dealer.''
   If Noriega were tried and convicted of all charges, he could
face up to 145 years in prison and fines of more than $1.1 million.

<HEAD>Only Scattered Precipitation As Most Of Nation Gets Fair Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The sky was clear over much of the nation Friday as two large
areas of high pressure over the Rockies and the Southeast swept
most clouds away.
   There were only a few areas of spotty precipitation.
   Light snow or flurries extended across eastern Upper Michigan,
northern New England, and western and upstate New York.
   Isolated showers dampened Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas and
northwestern Washington state.
   Southwesterly wind of 15 to 25 mph with gusts around 35 mph blew
up the middle Mississippi Valley as far as southern Michigan,
carrying warm air into the region and pushing temperatures into the
40s or 50s.
   The temperature hit 71 as far north as Emporia, Kan.
   Temperatures were mostly in the 20s across western and northern
Pennsylvania, New York state and northern New England, and a freeze
warning was issued overnight over parts of northeastern and
north-central Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at Gunnison, Colo., to 83 at Palm Springs, Calif., and Gila
Bend, Ariz. The low for the day was 17 below zero at Gunnison.
   For Saturday, snow was forecast from the upper Ohio Valley
through New Jersey and New England. Scattered showers were forecast
over California, and from southern Texas across the central Gulf
Coast region.
   Highs in the 20s, 30s and 40s were predicted from North Dakota
across the northeastern quarter of the country; in the 40s in the
mountains of Colorado and western Wyoming; in the 70s across the
southern Plains, Louisiana and southern Florida; in the 70s and low
80s over much of California and the desert Southwest, and in the
50s or 60s over much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, called a puppet
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega a few days ago, may have lost the
presidency but he has gained respect.
   After 2{ years in the obscurity of Panama's presidency, he went
on television Thursday and ordered Noriega, the man who is really
in charge of the country, to leave his post as military commander.
   On one side of the contest was a man with high political office
but no power, on the other a man with no political office but
control of the army, navy, air force, police and national
legislature.
   A colonel Delvalle appointed to succed Noriega declined the job.
Other officers rallied around their boss. The National Assembly
convened for 10 minutes, long enough to declare Delvalle an
ex-president.
   The legislature's action was unconstitutional, Delvalle said,
and the United States continued to recognize him as president, but
it was clear that he had lost.
   Delvalle, 51, was the fifth president in six years of a nation
whose presidents serve at the pleasure of the military. He said he
would take his case to the Supreme Court, but acknowledged that his
chances there were ``very slim because it also is controlled by
General Noriega.''
   Even so, he refused to relinquish the office. ``I am the
president of Panama this morning,'' he said Friday.
   By Friday afternoon, the two remaining numbers to the five-line
telephone system to Delvalle's residence were answered by a
recording: ``Because of damage to the system, the number you have
dialed is being repaired.'' The other three lines were cut Thursday
night.
   Delvalle was vice president in the fall of 1985. Noriega moved
him up after dismissing President Nicolas Ardito Barletta for
recommending an independent investigation into the death of one of
the general's leading opponents, Hugo Spadafora.
   The dead man's relatives claim Noriega was behind the killing.
Spadafora's headless body was found stuffed in a canvas U.S. Mail
bag in Costa Rica.
   He had been threatening to offer proof of Noriega's involvement
in drug trafficking, the same charge on which two federal grand
juries in Florida indicted the general earlier this month.
   Before becoming vice president in the 1984 election that
opponents claim was rigged, Delvalle had not held public office. He
had spent most of most of his time since graduating from Lousiana
State University running a family sugar mill.
   When asked Friday whether he regretted getting into politics, he
said:
   ``No, not at all. I think when you have an opportunity to serve
your country and you believe you can, you have to take the risks
involved.
   ``I discussed it fully with my family before running for vice
president and we knew it would be a difficult task. But I thought
that I could help and maybe I could make the difference.''
   He shrugged and added: ``I couldn't.''
   Just last month, retired Gen. Ruben D. Paredes had urged
Delvalle to act. The former Panamanian military commander said the
president should ``look at the tomb of his father, be a man and do
his part to tell Noriega'' it was time to go.

   The leader of a Puerto Rican independence group
and three sympathizers who plotted to spring him from prison with
rockets, grenade and a helicopter were sentenced to prison terms of
up to 15 years Friday.
   ``Those who take up the sword, die by the sword,'' U.S. District
Judge William Hart said in sentencing FALN leader Oscar Lopez and
the others.
   Lopez, 45, drew 15 years in prison for masterminding the scheme
to free himself and another inmate from the federal prison at
Leavenworth, Kan., in 1986. The FBI infiltrated the plot almost
from the beginning and broke it up.
   Lopez's co-defendants received prison terms ranging from three
to five years.
   ``The conduct which has brought the defendants to this court is
not their political beliefs,'' the judge said.
   ``In this country political beliefs are protected by the
Constitution, but by planning a prison escape with explosives, such
conduct goes beyond that protection.''
   Lopez was convicted of conspiracy in December along with
Grailing Brown, a fellow inmate and murderer; Dora Garcia, Lopez's
former sister-in-law, and Jaime Delgado, a counselor at
Northeastern Illinois University.
   Prosecutors said the group conspired to use rockets, hand
grenades and a helicopter to free Lopez, who was serving a 55-year
sentence for a 1981 seditious-conspiracy conviction. He was
transferred to another prison.
   Brown was sentenced to five years in prison; Delgado, 34,
received four years, and Garcia, 37, three years. Lopez had faced a
maximum of 25 years in prison, Ms. Garcia and Delgado faced 15
years each and Brown five.
   Defense attorneys had denied their clients engaged in violent
acts.
   ``Lopez views himself as a freedom fighter above the law,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly told the judge. ``He
provided the leadership and the direction of the conspiracy.''
   Lopez ``believes human life is expendable,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Deborah Devaney.
   Lopez said Friday that authorities and inmates at Leavenworth
had made threats against his life.
   ``I do not deny that I love my people,'' he told the judge. ``I
love my country Puerto Rico. I will do anything necessary _ when an
injustice is committed _ to fight it.''
   Hart had planned to sentence the defendants at a closed hearing
in the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center because of
outbursts by Puerto Rican activists at the defendants' trial, but
later decided to do it in open court.
   Ms. Garcia made a plea for leniency Friday, but Ms. Devaney
dismissed her contention that she is ``generous and loving.''
   ``What compassion did she show for the guards at Leavenworth who
were going to be riddled with bullets?'' the prosecutor asked.
   FALN is a Spanish acronym for Armed Forces for National
Liberation. The group seeks independence for Puerto Rico. It has
been linked to more than 100 bombings or planned bombings since
1974 in Chicago, New York and elsewhere.
   Authorities say at least six people have died and 100 have been
injured in FALN violence in the United States.

<HEAD>Questions and Answers On Panama's Importance to the United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALINA GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are questions and answers
about Panama's importance to the United States and the dispute over
the leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega:
   Q. Why is Panama important to the United States?
   A. Panama is vital to the United States, both because of the
Panama Canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and its
strategic location.
   Access to the S-shaped country is critical to control of the sea
lanes in the Caribbean as well as of links to South America and the
Far East. From Panama, forces can be quickly deployed to Central
and South American points.
   Q. Is it that vital?
   A. Yes. The United States helped create Panama by recognizing
its independence when it seceded from Colombia on Nov. 3, 1903, and
deployed the U.S. Navy to deter Colombia from reconquering it. The
United States financed and built the canal, owned it and ran it as
a wholly-owned U.S. government company until President Jimmy Carter
and Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos signed treaties in 1977 that
would hand ownership to Panama.
   Q. What is the canal's status now?
   A. Panama owns the canal, which is administered by a joint
U.S.-Panamanian commission. Complete administration, control and
defense of the waterway will be handed over to the Panamanians by
the year 2000.
   The Carter-Torrijos treaties also abolished the Panama Canal
Zone, a 10-mile strip of land flanking the waterway that had been
U.S. territory. U.S. military forces in the Southern Command are
allowed to remain in forts and bases to defend the zone.
   Q. What does the Southern Command do?
   A. The U.S. Southern Command has about 10,000 officers and
servicemen and coordinates all U.S. military activity from south of
the U.S.-Mexico border to Tierra del Fuego, in Argentina, and
Antarctica. Among other tasks, it does contingency planning for the
defense of Latin America, including training of Latin American
troops in anti-guerrilla warfare. Part of that is carried out under
provisions of the 1947 Inter-American Defense Treaty.
   Q. Will the United States turn the canal over to Panama?
   A. It has to, if the treaties are to be respected, although at
the time Carter signed the accords now President Ronald Reagan and
other conservatives in the Republican Party opposed the move.
   Q. Could current troubles affect operation of the canal?
   A. Since the unrest started last June, there has been no
disruption in operation of the canal. Officials say there is no
cause for concern.
   Q. Why is the United States opposed to Noriega's continued
leadership?
   A. He had been considered useful at times in some intelligence
operations, but the mounting controversy over his purported
involvement in illicit activities from drug trafficking to the
assassination of political opponents has lost him credibility in
Washington.
   His presence also runs counter to the trend toward civilian
governments in Latin America.
   The United States wants a functioning democracy in place when
the canal is turned over to Panama to help ensure its security.
Noriega maintains democracy already exists.
   Q. How was President Eric Arturo Delvalle ousted?
   A. Delvalle fired Noriega Thursday evening. Hours later the
legislature, dominated by Noriega supporters, deposed Delvalle in a
10-minute session. It claimed he acted unconstitutionally in firing
Noriega. The officer corps stood by Noriega.
   Q. Have relations between Panama and the United State been
strained before?
   A. Yes, several times. The last big confrontation was Jan. 9,
1964, when students rioted in a dispute over flying the Panamanian
flag alongside the Stars and Stripes in the Canal Zone. This led to
disputes over the then- existing treaties governing the zone, and
eventually to the Carter-Torrijos negotiations.
   Q. When did present tensions start?
   A. Last June, after Noriega's recently retired second in
command, Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, went public with charges of
illicit activities. The allegations had circulated for a long time,
but were never on record before from one of Noriega's associates.
   Noriega denies the allegations and blames U.S. rightists who
oppose turning the canal over to Panama for provoking the problems.

   State Republican Party officials
revised their Feb. 18 presidential straw poll numbers Thursday
after turning up 1,276 uncounted ballots, including some taken home
by a precinct meeting captain the night of the poll.
   After the revision, Vice President George Bush remained the
winner with 27 percent. But the undecided vote _ listed as 23
percent previously _ was revised downward to 22 percent. Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole, whose original tally was 22 percent, had 23 percent
after the revision.
   Rep. Jack Kemp moved ahead of former television evangelist Pat
Robertson, who dropped two points to 13 percent as Kemp rose one
point to 14 percent.
   The remaining 1 percent went to former Delaware Gov. Pete du
Pont and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, both of whom
have dropped out of the race.
   The final numbers are: Bush, 1,672; Dole, 1,480; undecided,
1,391; Kemp, 875; Robertson, 846; du Pont, 42; Haig, 8.
   While the numbers and percentages changed slightly and
Robertson's official tally slipped below that of Kemp, Robertson
supporters were still claiming victory by combining undecided
ballots and votes for their candidate.
   Steve Wark, Robertson coordinator in Nevada, has said most of
the undecided votes were cast by Robertson supporters as part of a
strategy to control later voting for delegates to upcoming county
conventions.
   Asked what happened on the night of the straw poll, state GOP
Chairwoman Sally Vitkus-McKinney said, ``I really don't know.''
   Hal Steiner, state party vice-chairman who was in charge of the
ballot counting, said part of the problem was the number of
precinct captains involved in the counting process. He said there
were 50 captains in Clark County alone under pressure to get the
numbers in quickly.
   Asked about the fact that only 82 percent of the vote was in
while party leaders were claiming 100 percent, Steiner added, ``In
the scurry of things, it's hard to tell an exact percentage.''

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Urges U.S. To Pay Its U.N. Budget Arrears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said Thursday
the United States must pay the huge arrears in its share of the
U.N. budget or lose prestige and influence in the world body.
   If the United States intends to use the United Nations as an
important tool of foreign policy in Afghanistan, the Middle East
and the Iran-Iraq war, then ``we must treat it as a serious
institution,'' he said.
   Walters, permanent U.S. representative at the United Nations,
addressed the joint Human Rights and International Organizations
subcommittees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington
on Thursday. His testimony was made available by the U.S. Mission.
   America, the largest U.N. contributor, now owes $252 million in
regular budget assessments for several years. The annual U.N.
budget is about $800 million, of which the United States is
expected to pay about 25 percent.
   Western sources said Thursday that if Congress continues to
withhold U.N. dues, the embarrassed administration may seek a
reduction of its budget contribution to the 159-member
organization. No decision has been made.
   The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The United States has been withholding some of its dues since
1985 in an effort to push for reforms in the United Nations, which
U.S. officials viewed as inefficient and biased against the United
States.
   U.S. delinquency in its payments and its efforts to close the
U.N. mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization have
tarnished America's image in the organization. The General Assembly
reconvenes Monday in an emergency session on the PLO dispute.
   ``We cannot continue to neglect our financial commitments to the
United Nations and then expect that our opinions, policies and
positions will carry their former weight in the world body,''
Walters said.
   ``The U.N. is not a perfect organization, politically or
administratively, from the U.S. perspective, nor will it ever be.
After all, the world is hardly a perfect place ... We must work to
improve the way the U.N. serves our needs.''
   He and the Reagan administration have been urging Congress to
restore full U.S. funding for the United Nations, about $212
million annually.
   The United States said that, as the largest donor, it should
have a greater voice in how its money was spent. Under the
one-nation-one-vote rule, developing countries were dictating how
U.S. funds were spent and voting expenditures the United States
opposed.
   A policy of consensus was instituted, in effect giving the
United States veto power, but it broke down in the General Assembly
session.
   ``U.N. member countries understood that this budget reform would
be followed by a return by the U.S. to full payment of our
assessment,'' Walters testified.
   He said implementation of the reforms was mixed and a key U.N.
committee last year was unable to agree on a budget ceiling and
contingency fund, as sought by the United States.
   But he said U.S. failure to pay even half of its U.N. dues last
year ``made other countries unwilling to move the new (budget
reform) process forward.''
   The initial shock of U.S. withholding created the impetus for
reform, Walters said, ``but reforms are unlikely to take full
effect in an organization paralyzed by financial instability.''

<TEXT>
   Ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle
called Friday night for a national strike to show that Panamanians
repudiate the leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The general accused the United States of instigating Delvalle's
failed effort on Thursday to end his military rule and said
Washington waged a campaign of ``psychological warfare'' against
him.
   Noriega addressed a rally of his supporters Friday night and
said Panamanians who consider ``betrayal, because they are born
traitors, meet a bad end here.''
   Up to 10,000 people attended the rally at the central garrison
of the Defense Forces.
   The Noriega-dominated National Assembly turned Delvalle out of
office in a 10-minute session early Friday after the president
tried to fire the armed forces chief following Noriega's indictment
in the United States as a drug trafficker.
   Noriega has denied all accusations against him.
   The legislature named Manuel Solis Palma, the education
minister, as new president, but Delvalle insisted to reporters he
was still president.
   In Washington, the State Department said it still recognized
Delvalle as Panama's president.
   Delvalle told reporters Friday night, ``I don't have a seat of
government, nor military support, but I do have two million
Panamanians who are tired ... of living under a regime that one man
has governed capriciously, and because of that I call for national
resistance to paralyze the entire country starting Monday.''
   The opposition National Civic Crusade on Friday evening called
for a ``progressive, nationwide strike'' starting immediately.
   Aurelio Barrilla, president of the Panamanian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, one of the groups in the coalition, said the
Crusade was seeking ``total paralysis'' of the country by early
next week.
   However, only one of several strikes called last summer by the
coalition of about 200 organizations was notably successful, and
the government has shut down opposition newspapers, radio and
television stations, limiting the Crusade's ability to spread its
message.
   In his address at the central garrison rally, Noriega said,
``The Defense Forces offer subordination, total support and our
cooperation to the new president, our best efforts to be able to
reach presidential elections in May 1989.''
   ``Panama is not a tribe,'' he said. ``The Americans who live in
Panama should sleep easy, because this people is not a tribe, it is
a healthy people.''
   Panama, a nation of 2.2 million people, is headquarters for U.S.
military programs in Latin America with the U.S. Southern Command
that has 10,000 military personnel and their 20,000 dependents in
Panama.
   After the rally, Noriega walked with his supporters to the
presidential offices about a mile away.
   Throughout the day there were fewer vehicles and people on the
streets, but Panama City was calm and businesses operated normally.
   Delvalle said the protest strike would be peaceful, saying, ``I
don't pretend to be the leader of the resistance. I pretend to be
the president who returns to the presidency.'' He also urged a
worldwide trade embargo against Panama.
   He called Solis Palma ``an opportunistic politician.''
   Delvalle's bid to remove Noriega as head of Panama's
15,000-member Defense Forces was thwarted Thursday night when the
military closed ranks around the general and said no officer would
replace him.
   President Reagan said the United States was not behind
Delvalle's attempt to get rid of Noriega but was ``very much aware
of it.'' He said there were no plans for military intervention.
   The White House called on Noriega to resign after he was
indicted Feb. 5 in Florida on drug trafficking charges. Noriega was
accused of using his authority to let Colombian drug traffickers
utilize Panama as a base for smuggling cocaine and marijuana into
the United States. The charges said Noriega received kickbacks from
drug profits.
   Soldiers on Friday surrounded and closed the Chamber of Commerce
building, headquarters for the National Civic Crusade.
   Opponents of Noriega met elsewhere to discuss actions to protest
his rule.
   Police closed the offices of the Christian Democratic Party,
whose president, Ricardo Arias Calderon, has been a leader of the
Crusade movement.
   Arias Calderon and a Miami Herald reporter, Andres Oppenheimer,
were detained for two hours Thursday night when they arrived on a
commercial flight from Miami. Oppenheimer was released but Arias
Calderon was put on a flight to Costa Rica.
   Panamanian authorities refused entry to three American
journalists when they tried to land early Friday in a charter plane
from Costa Rica.
   Miami Herald Central America correspondent Sam Dillon,
Washington Post correspondent Julia Preston and John Siceloff, a
Nicaragua-based producer for NBC-TV returned to Costa Rica.
   The rally was Noriega's first appearance in public since
Delvalle acted. In an interview broadcast by the government's Radio
Nacional earlier Friday, he said of the United States: ``They have
been using a web that includes psychological warfare ... slander,
lies, injury, conjecture, and ... misinformation.''
   Asked if there was U.S. involvement in Delvalle's attempt to
oust him, Noriega said: ``Totally, they have maintained a web.''
   He said Delvalle ``is in his home, with his family, without any
problem.''
   Relations between the Reagan administration and Noriega have
deteriorated since June, when opposition leaders launched a
campaign of strikes and protests in Panama to force the general out.
   Protests began after Noriega's former second in command, retired
Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, accused Noriega of drug trafficking,
fraud and assassinating political opponents.
   Noriega issued a statement through his attorneys in Miami in
which he denounced U.S. politicians he said advocate ``hysteria
(and) act with a reckless disregard for the truth.''
   The statement also said, ``All American interests in the
republic are and shall remain undisturbed and unharmed.'' It added
``these events are strictly internal to Panama.
   The Panama Canal operated normally Friday.
   American military personnel were on alert and civilians were
told to keep a low profile.
   The White House immediately offered its support after Delvalle
announced his intention to oust Noriega, but Noriega and his
supporters moved quickly against Delvalle.
   Solis Palma, 71, will fill out the current presidential term,
which ends in October 1989.
   The National Assembly removed both Delvalle and Vice President
Roderick Esquivel from office, saying Delvalle violated the law in
trying to fire Noriega.

   The Soviet Union will have its first international
art auction in July when Sotheby's holds a sale of contemporary
Soviet works, the American-owned auction house and Soviet officials
announced Friday.
   About 100 paintings by more than 20 contemporary Soviet
painters, including some previously ``unofficial'' artists, will go
on the block July 7 at the International Trade Center in Moscow,
said Lord Gowrie. He is a former British arts minister and now
chairman of the world's largest auctioneering company.
   ``I hope this will be the first of a series of auctions. ... We
chose Sotheby's because they have an international name,'' Sergei
Popov, a senior official in the Soviet Ministry of Culture, told
reporters at the news conference at Sotheby's headquarters.
   It will be the Soviets' first international auction since the
1917 revolution that brought the Communists to power.
   Asked if the auctioned works would be by unofficial artists as
well as those whose work is approved by the Soviet Union of
Artists, Popov replied: ``There are no longer any unofficial
artists. For the past three years there have been no restrictions
on any style or tendency in art.''
   Popov said that when the works in the sale are given preview
exhibitions in New York, Zurich, London and Paris ``you will see
that all tendencies that flourish in the West are present in our
art, and some are perhaps better developed with us.''
   Gowrie said the Soviets placed no restrictions on what could be
sold.
   ``We have chosen what to sell and in the main they will be
artists whose works are already well known in the West and of
interest to collectors,'' he said.
   Simon de Pury, Sotheby's managing director in Europe, said, ``A
large number of the artists represented in the sale were until
recently regarded as unofficial artists.''
   Among the contemporary artists with works in the sale are Iliya
Kabakov, Ivan Tschuikov and Vadim Zakharov. There will also be some
Russian avant garde paintings of the 1910-1932 period.
   Gowrie said prices should range from about $3,500 to $35,000 and
will have to be paid for in British pounds.
   He said Sotheby's expects the sale total to be ``well over half
a million pounds ($880,000) and the bulk of the money, after the
normal commissions, will go to the artists.'' He would not disclose
Sotheby's commissions.
   Popov said the Soviet government agreed to the auction because
previous art sales to the West, which started in 1967, were done
through an export trade body.
   ``That's not a very good way of entering the art market and this
auction will help to establish prices on the international art
market and allow Soviet artists to receive the bulk of the
proceeds,'' Popov said.
   Asked if the auction didn't run contrary to Marxist principles,
Gowrie said: ``We had a good response from the artists themselves
and I don't think 19th century philosophers were consulted.''
   Popov said, ``What's un-Marxist about selling Soviet art works
so they become better known all over the world?''

<TEXT>
   A defense contractor executive who lost
his job after criticizing the Pentagon's budget priorities filed
suit Thursday against the former secretary of the Navy and three
others, accusing them of having him fired.
   The suit by Dr. Lawrence J. Korb, filed in U.S. District Court
here, requests a jury trial and asks for a minimum of $500,000 in
compensatory damages as well as punitive damages for violating his
First Amendment right of free speech.
   The suit names as plaintiffs former Navy Secretary John F.
Lehman Jr.; a former top aide, Melvyn R. Paisley; Assistant Navy
Secretary Everett Pyatt, and Carl M. Smith, a staffer with the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The lawsuit alleges the four men, by complaining directly or
indirectly to Korb's bosses at the Raytheon Co., ``intended to and
did penalize Dr. Korb for exercising the right of free speech
guaranteed to him by the First Amendment of the Constitution ....''
   ``As a direct and proximate result of the defendants' acts, Dr.
Korb has sustained and will continue to sustain substantial
monetary losses and has suffered and will continue to suffer mental
and emotional pain, anguish and humiliation,'' the suit says.
   The suit was filed on Korb's behalf by the American Civil
Liberties Union, which in 1986 had asked then-Defense Secretary
Caspar W. Weinberger to fire Lehman and his aides for their conduct.
   Weinberger instead admonished the three.
   Efforts to contact Lehman and the other defendants Thursday were
unsuccessful.
   Korb, who worked for Weinberger for four years as the Pentagon's
assistant defense secretary for manpower, joined Raytheon _ a major
Navy contractor _ as a Washington vice president in 1985. With the
company's permission, he also joined the Committee for National
Security, a bipartisan group that seeks to encourage informed
debate on national security issues.
   In February 1986, Korb appeared with other group members at a
press conference and suggested the Pentagon could maintain its
strength with a smaller budget than that requested by President
Reagan.
   Following the news conference, Raytheon received phone calls and
letters from Paisley and Pyatt.
   The two Lehman deputies have acknowledged calling Raytheon and
suggesting Korb be told to stop speaking out against the
president's budget. The Pentagon's inspector general, in an earlier
investigation, concluded Lehman had not directed Pyatt and Paisley
to call Raytheon but clearly supported his deputies' actions.
   Korb's suit says Raytheon also was contacted about the same time
by Smith, a Senate committee staffer who oversaw missile budgets
affecting Raytheon.
   ``On information and belief, defendant Smith told them that
unless Raytheon silenced or removed Dr. Korb, he (Smith) would no
longer meet with anyone from Raytheon's Washington office,'' the
suit says.
   ``In direct and immediate reaction to the angry complaints and
explicit and implicit threats made by defendants Lehman, Pyatt,
Paisley and Smith, Raytheon terminated Dr. Korb as vice president
in charge of its Washington operations.''
   Korb is now the dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate
School of Public and International Affairs.
   The suit filed Thursday is similar to one filed in December by
Korb against Raytheon. Ratheon has responded that it didn't fire
Korb, but offered him a transfer to another job that he declined to
accept. Korb has said he considered the offered job would have been
a demotion.

<TEXT>
   A 52-year-old surveyor has inherited
30 farms and the entire village of Southwick, including two pubs,
two churches, a post office and 67 houses from a distant relative
he hardly knew, it was reported Friday.
   Robin Thistlethwayte said he was astonished when he was told
that Eva Borthwick-Norton, who died last week at the age of 96,
left him her 7,500-acre estate in Hampshire, about 60 miles
southwest of London near England's south coast.
   ``Although I had only met her a handful of times I think she
must have felt I was the best person to leave it to,''
Thistlethwayte was quoted as saying in today's Times of London.
   ``I have a lot of experience in running agricultural estates
with traditional standards of farming and I intend to continue with
the traditions as far as is possible in the 20th century,'' he said.
   The 300 residents of the pastoral village, nestling under the
slope of nearby Portsdown Hill, appeared delighted with her
decision.
   ``It seems she made sure the village will be preserved as it is,
which is wonderful news,'' Valerie Church, who runs the Red Lion
pub was quoted as telling the Today newspaper.
   The estate had been in the Thistlethwayte family for 250 years
until Lt. Col. Evelyn Thistlethwayte left it to his nephew, Hugh
Borthwick, in 1943. Following his death in 1950, his widow took
over its management.
   Mrs. Borthwick-Norton, a socialite who was friends with Wallis
Simpson, the American divorcee who forced the abdication of King
Edward VIII, had no children, and apparently decided to return the
estate to the Thistlethwayte family.
   The new owner, who lives in Banbury near Oxford, said he plans
to move to the village with his wife and three children.

   President Reagan said Friday he has no plan to
intervene militarily in Panama, as U.S. officials scrambled to
assess ``a precarious position'' brought on in part by federal
drug-smuggling indictments of strong man Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   But the State Department said the United States will continue to
recognize Eric Arturo Delvalle as president of Panama, despite a
parliamentary vote to oust him and replace him with Manuel Solis
Palma, who has been education minister.
   The National Assembly moved against Delvalle after he tried to
dismiss Noriega, who was indicted by federal grand juries in Miami
and Tampa, Fla., earlier this month.
   Amid the continuing political instability, Vice President George
Bush said the United States should do ``whatever is necessary'' to
protect American interests in the Central American country, which
include the militarily and economically vital Panama Canal.
   ``Noriega's gone bad, and he's proven he's trafficked in
narcotics,'' Bush said. ``... Noriega should go and in my view he
will go.''
   Reagan said he didn't think there was ``any appetite on the part
of anyone there, including Mr. Noriega, to take on our troops.''
   Responding to questions during a picture-taking session with
southern Republican Party leaders, the president said the United
States did not instigate Delvalle's move Thursday. But he also said
U.S. officials had been ``very much aware of it.''
   Asked whether the United States was contemplating military
intervention there, the president replied, ``No, I don't think
that's an answer.'' He declined to discuss other alternatives,
saying: ``We're not prepared to come up with any answers as yet.''
   Reagan said he thought ``there are some limits on what we can
do,'' but that ``we're looking at that situation, and our people
are meeting on it to see if there's anything we can do.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier there was no
administration interest in a proposal by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., to impose trade sanctions against Panama.
   Late Friday, following a series of meetings involving national
security officials, Fitzwater issued a statement saying that ``we
condemn all efforts to perpetuate military rule in Panama,
including efforts to remove President Delvalle from office.''
   The statement said ``we have also initiated a series of
consultations to learn the views of other countries in in the
hemisphere with regard to this situation.''
   Bush, campaigning to succeed Reagan, seemed to take a harder
line during a talk to a Greenville, S.C., audience.
   He told the South Carolina Press Association: ``We will do
whatever is necessary to protect American interests in Panama.
We've got treaty interests on the (Panama) Canal. I don't want to
rattle any sabers ....''
   ``But we would obviously as the United States, and I would,
reserve the right to do whatever is necessary, including military
force, to protect America's sacred interest in that region of the
world,'' Bush said.
   He stopped short of calling for military intervention, however,
saying the United States' past history of intervention in Latin
American affairs is ``what's hurting us in some areas now.'' Some
10,000 American troops are stationed in Panama.
   One of Bush's rivals for the Republican nomination, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, said during a campaign stop in
St. Louis that, ``The United States has had enough of Noriega and
will have nothing to do with any phony civilian, Noriega-puppet
government.''
   Dole warned the Panamian strong man: ``If you think you can put
the heat on us by meddling around with the canal _ we will do
whatever is necessary, including the use of military force, to
protect our security interests and the lives of American citizens.''
   From Capitol Hill, the administration got conflicting advice on
how to handle the situation.
   Senate Democrats urged caution, while D'Amato advocated the
trade embargo and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., called Noriega ``a
bum'' and said ``he ought to be thrown out.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the United
States ``ought to keep cool'' and ``make haste slowly'' to give the
Panamanian people ample time to decide Noriega's fate.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said Washington should proceed with ``great caution,''
in consultation with neighboring nations, to protect U.S. national
interests in Panama.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said the United States should strongly support Delvalle
and that other nations in the region should do the same.
   Fascell, D-Fla., said the United States should increase
diplomatic pressure immediately, and added: ``At this point, we
certainly should be reviewing our options in the economic area.''
   Fitzwater confirmed that Delvalle had held talks at the U.S.
Embassy in Panama City before moving to oust Noriega on Thursday,
but he denied that the administration had lent any encouragement to
the Panamanian president.
   ``There's not a lot that we can say about impressions,'' the
spokesman said. ``The United States has a large interest there,
obviously. But we have tried to walk the line between what's
appropriate and what's not appropriate.''
   ``We have a precarious position,'' Fitzwater added. ``Yes, we
want him (Noriega) to stand trial (on the Miami indictment). Yes,
we want civilian government in Panama. But we want to be careful
not to unduly intrude upon the affairs of Panama.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley reiterated
what she termed ``our support for the supremacy of civilian
constitutional rule'' and said ``we continue to recognize President
Delvalle as the president of Panama.''
   Asked to describe the legal grounds for such recognition, she
said, ``I don't think it's for us to interpret their constitutional
law. We had regarded him as the president, we still regard him as
the president.''
   Mrs. Oakley also said the United States continues to recognize
Juan B. Sosa as Panama's ambassador in Washington. Sosa has
supported Delvalle, and he said he planned to remain in his post,
although Noriega told him by telephone Friday morning that he would
be replaced.
   Mrs. Oakley said Elliott Abrams, the assistant secretary of
state for Inter-American affairs met with Sosa on Friday, but she
wouldn't reveal details of the discussion.
   Asked if the United States had been in contact with Noriega, she
said, ``Not that I'm aware of.''
   ``Many people knew that we had been aware of the actions that
President Delvalle was contemplating doing,'' the spokeswoman said.
``We had been informed that the decision was President Delvalle's
own to make.''
   Reagan canceled a scheduled weekend visit to his Camp David,
Md., mountaintop retreat, but Fitzwater said it was because of a
scheduled social event at the White House on Sunday afternoon and
not because of the Panamanian crisis.
   Fitzwater said that while Delvalle had been in contact with
State Department officials before Thursday's ill-fated attempt to
oust Noriega, ``we did not urge him to take this action. He did it
on his own.''
   The spokesman also said he saw no immediate need for any
dramatic moves by the United States to protect citizens and
military forces in Panama.
   ``Panamanian authorities advise us there is no threat to
Americans in that country,'' he said.

   A woman out looking for a policeman to
shoot stopped in an intersection and waited Friday for one to find
her, then smiled as she fired point-blank into the officer's chest,
police said.
   Officer Buddy Evans, who had approached the car at 5 a.m.
because it appeared stranded, was saved by his bullet-proof vest,
said police spokesman Dee Anderson.
   Evans and another officer managed to subdue the woman, who was
sitting on the passenger side of an idling station wagon, he said.
   ``She has given us information that this was premeditated. She
was driving around looking for a police officer to shoot for some
time, then she decided to stop and let the officer come to her,''
he said.
   ``She turned around and smiled and then shot him,'' he said.
   The woman, Pamela Diane Takhar, 33, was arrested for
investigation of attempted capital murder and was held in Arlington
City Jail on $250,000 bail, Anderson said.
   Officers said the woman was ``not real lucid or coherent,'' said
Anderson.
   ``She thought by shooting a policeman and being put in jail, she
would be an example to other people not to do it,'' Anderson said.
   Officers said Evans was taken to Arlington Memorial Hospital for
an examination and was released.

   Arizona's Supreme Court on Friday refused
to delay the start of Gov. Evan Mecham's immpeachment trial on
Monday but did not rule out blocking the proceedings later.
   The ruling came in an emergency session during which the
governor's lawyers cited danger to his constitutional rights and
the justices expressed concern about breaching the separation of
judicial and legislative powers.
   The high court said it would decide on Tuesday _ one day after
the Senate trial is to begin _ whether to issue an injunction
against it.
   In another development, Mecham's chief attorney has withdrawn
from Mecham's case.
   Thomas Crowe, another attorney for the first-term Republican,
had told the high court that Mecham's rights would be violated if
an impeachment trial were held before related criminal charges were
heard in court.
   But John Lundin, representing the Senate, told the justices they
were ``being asked to enter an arena that has never been entered
into by any court in this nation'' and suggested they refrain from
breaking such new ground.
   The justices indicated by questions that they were reluctant to
interfere with legislative matters in light of the state
constitution's separation of powers.
   ``I don't think one can say that fundamental rights of fair play
don't apply to impeachment proceedings. But who decides what is
fair play? Isn't it the Senate that decides what the rules are?''
said Vice Chief Justice Stanley Feldman.
   Feldman said he believed that the framers of the constitution
``wanted to keep us out of'' matters involving legislative bodies.
   Feldman presided in place of Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon, who
has removed himself from such matters because he will preside over
the impeachment trial.
   Meanwhile, the Arizona Civil Liberties Union filed a
friend-of-the-court brief arguing that Mecham's right to a fair
trial on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan
would be violated if the Senate proceeding were held first.
   ``We are taking no position on the impeachment,'' said ACLU
lawyer Alice Bendheim. ``But we are asking that the state Supreme
Court ensure that Governor Mecham gets due process.''
   Senators, who previously delayed the trial's start a week,
refused earlier this week to give Crowe and Washington attorney
Jerris Leonard more time to prepare the governor's defense.
   Mecham was impeached Feb. 5 on a 46-14 House vote. Several days
later the House approved 23 impeachment articles, the equivalent of
an indictment in a criminal case. They outlined details of three
broad charges against the first-term Republican: that he concealed
a $350,000 loan to his 1986 campaign, misused $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership, and
tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a
state official.
   Murray Miller, who has represented Mecham since October,
withdrew from the case abruptly, saying Friday that he decided late
Thursday night to drop out.
   He said Leonard was now in charge of the defense. But he
expressed uncertainty at whether Leonard, who was hired by the
governor Tuesday, could be prepared to proceed on Monday.
   However, Leonard said, ``I think Evan Mecham is entitled to the
best representation he can get. I don't say this braggadociously at
all, but if he feels he wants me, he should be entitled to have the
lawyer of his choice.''
   Miller declined to elaborate on his reasons for bowing out but
he said he hoped senators would not suspect he had deceived them
about his role in the case. As late as Wednesday night, he said,``I
was fully in charge of the case and defending the governor.''
   Senate Majority leader Robert Usdane, a Republican, said he
suspected the change of lawyers was planned and was a delaying
tactic by Mecham.
   ``Anything to try and tie this thing up until May 17th,'' he
said, referring to the date when the Republican governor faces a
recall election. ``We are not going to do that.''
   Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat, said, ``I see
no reason to delay.''
   ``I think it is absolutely disgusting and an outrage...,'' said
Assistant Minority Leader Lela Alston. ``I think it's part of the
governor's strategy to continue delays.''
   Miller, denying any devious actions, said, ``My main concern is
that the governor gets a fair legal shake.''
   Mecham did not immediately return a telephone call Friday from
The Associated Press, but The Arizona Daily Star of Tucson on
Friday quoted him as saying: ``Murray withdrew from the case. We
parted friendly, but that's really all. You'll have to ask him
why.''
   Impeachment prosecutor William French said Miller will be
required to submit a motion on Monday seeking Senate permission to
withdraw from the case. French said he may oppose the motion if he
believes Miller's withdrawal might be used for a later claim that
the new attorneys did not have time to prepare for the trial.
   Leonard was in his office but sent word through a secretary that
he was too busy to talk to a reporter who visited his office Friday.
   Leonard has resigned from the Washington law firm of Manatt,
Phelps, Rothenberg, Tunney and Evans because of his decision to
represent Mecham, said Charles T. Manatt, a senior partner in the
firm.
   ``Jerris Leonard informed the firm last week that he had been
contacted by Governor Mecham concerning representation,'' said
Manatt. ``We made it clear that the firm was not interested in
representing Governor Mecham, and Mr. Leonard informed us that he
has resigned from the firm.''
   Manatt, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
was asked why his firm wasn't interested in being associated with
the Mecham case. ``Lots of reasons, you can well imagine,'' he
replied.
   The beleaguered Mecham also faces a a March 22 criminal trial on
charges of concealing the $350,000 campaign loan. Miller has
dropped out of that case too.
   Miller had repeatedly pleaded to have the criminal trial heard
first, contending that widely publicized Senate proceedings would
prejudice potential jurors.
   Senators have voiced suspicions that Mecham wanted to fight for
his job in the recall election before the Senate trial because the
Senate has the power to bar him from ever holding public office
again if he is convicted.

   Government officials said 2,134
prisoners were released Saturday and 5,100 others had their prison
terms reduced or civic rights restored under a ``grand amnesty.''
   The officials said 125 political dissidents were among those
freed and 1,606 dissidents were among those granted other forms of
leniency. The rest were common criminals.
   It was the first public gesture of conciliation by the
government of President Roh-Tae-woo, who was installed Thursday in
the first peaceful transfer of power since South Korea's
independence in 1948.
   Culture and Information Minister Chung Han-mo announced the
amnesty Friday. He said it was meant to promote ``national harmony
and restore public confidence'' in the Roh government.
   The political opposition and dissidents, however, said the
amnesty was not enough and expressed regret that many leading
dissidents were not included.
   The divided opposition agreed Friday to join ranks after months
of bitter squabbling. The two parties decided to unite to oppose
the Roh government in upcoming National Assembly elections.
   The rival opposition leaders issued a joint announcement saying,
``We have agreed to form a new integrated party by the end of next
week.''
   The agreement calls for Kim Young-sam's Reunification Democratic
Party and the Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy to merge
into a new opposition party, to be named later.
   In a news conference Saturday, Kim Dae-jung called for ``total''
amnesty. He complained that the number of political prisoners
released constituted a small portion of the total of 1,300
political detainees. He called on the government to free all but
those who profess themselves to be Communists.
   Lee Ton-myung, a leading dissident and human rights lawyer, said
the amnesty was ``a sham'' and showed Roh was ``the extension of
his authoritarian predecessor Chun Doo-hwan.''
   Prosecution authorities claimed that 276 political detainees
remain _ 216 awaiting trial and 60 serving sentences but considered
unrepentant, involved in serious crimes such as murder or arson.
The prosecution hinted that some of those awaiting trial might be
freed later when judicial processes are completed.
   Among released political prisoners were seven student leaders
involved in seizing the U.S. cultural center in Seoul in May 1985.
   Some prominent dissidents, including the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan and
poet Ko Eun, who were already out of jail, had their civic rights
restored.
   Meanwhile, several major questions remained unanswered about the
opposition merger, including power distribution, The two parties
have been bitter rivals and their past unification attempts have
failed.
   The division was formed after both Kim Young-sam and Kim
Dae-jung insisted on running in the Dec. 16 presidential election.
The two Kims, who split the oppostion vote, lost to Roh, the ruling
party candidate.
   Roh was elected with 36.6 percent of the vote.

   The hierarchy of Jimmy Swaggart's church
said Friday it will ask church officials in Louisiana to reconsider
their proposed three-month suspension of the TV evangelist accused
of sexual misconduct.
   G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendent of the
Springfield-based Assemblies of God, refused to say what penalty
the church recommended instead.
   However, the church's Executive Presbytery had met here to
consider a tougher penalty after many members called the church
headquarters to complain that the suspension of the
fire-and-brimstone evangelist too lenient.
   CBS reported Friday that the Assemblies of God told Louisiana
leaders to order Swaggart, who tearfully confessed to unspecified
sins from his pulpit Sunday, to step down a year. The network cited
no sources for the report.
   Assemblies of God spokeswoman Juleen Turnage late Friday said
she did not know what the church had recommended and could not
confirm the report. Louisiana District Superintendent Cecil Janway
was not home Friday night, said his wife.
   Carlson announced the decision after 11 hours of discussion over
two days with other members of the Executive Presbytery. Other
board members refused comment Friday.
   The home district of the Baton Rouge, La., evangelist
recommended earlier this week that Swaggart be barred from
preaching for three months and undergo two years of rehabiliation
and counseling.
   Once the Louisiana district has reviewed the Swaggart case, the
Executive Presbytery will take it up again, Carlson said. ``A final
decision on these matters could be several days or weeks away,''
Carlson said.
   Although Swaggart and church officials never specified the
evangelist's sin, an admitted prostitute said in interviews this
week that she had performed lewd acts for Swaggart for about a year.
   Church officials say no other minister accused of moral
misconduct has been allowed to return to preaching in so short a
time as three months and questions were raised about the financial
support the Louisiana district receives from Jimmy Swaggart World
Ministries.
   Two officials of the state district _ general superintendent
Cecil Janway, also a member of Swaggart's evangelical enterprise,
and Forrest Hall, the treasurer _ met with the Executive Presbytery
on Thursday. Louisiana District officials had no comment Friday.
   Turnage said earlier that if the Executive Presbytery disagreed
with the Louisiana district's recommendations, it would pass on its
concerns to the lower body and ask officials in Louisiana to
reconsider.
   Mrs. Turnage said the church's constitution made the
disciplinary process a lengthy one. She said this has been
frustrating for church members, who have flooded headquarters with
calls expressing their concern.
   ``It just continues to hang there in the forefront of everyone's
mind,'' she said.
   Mrs. Turnage added that officials want to conclude the matter as
soon as possible, ``and get out of the public spotlight.''
   It is the second time in a year that the Assemblies of God, the
nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, considered disciplinary
measures against a prominent minister caught in a scandal. Last
year, PTL founder Jim Bakker lost his Assemblies credentials after
it was disclosed that he had had sex with a woman other than his
wife and then tried to pay her to keep silent. Bakker rejected a
rehabilitation proposal.
   Swaggart, who reaches around the world with broadcast sermons
and contributes $12 million a year to the foreign missions programs
of the Assemblies of God, stepped down from his pulpit Sunday after
confessing to an undisclosed sin.
   He has not appeared in public since then and was not at the
closed meetings here.
   Mrs. Turnage said the Swaggart case is the most complex ever for
the Executive Presbytery because of the many facets of Swaggart's
ministry.
   Swaggart records gospel albums, Bible study tapes and television
tapes and takes his ministry abroad.
   The problem, according to Mrs. Turnage, is deciding ``what is
preaching.''
   `In the past, preaching meant going into the pulpit,'' she said.
But with Swaggart, ``Is his singing going to be considered
preaching? I don't know.''

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission voted
Thursday to explore the possibility of creating a national radio
channel with a single entity guiding the operations of the channel
on a nationwide basis.
   Such a channel could be carved from a new set of AM broadcasting
services in the 1605 to 1705 kilohertz range at the upper edge of
the AM band. These frequencies could accommodate about 10 channels
in a band for which receivers are not yet available.
   The FCC voted to open its fourth inquiry on the expanded band to
get comment on this proposal and others on use of the new channels,
in preparation for an International Telecommunications Union
conference in June where the issue will be discussed. The ITU, a
unit of the United Nations, coordinates use of the electromagnetic
spectrum.
   The FCC said that while it is keeping open the option of
licensing the additional channels in its traditional way, it also
said it will explore ``national licensing'' of frequencies in the
expanded band.
   ``Under this approach, a single entity would be able to guide
the development of a channel on a nationwide basis. Such a national
licensee could operate the stations itself or could lease the
frequency to others,'' the FCC said.
   The commission said such a concept could have several
advantages, including economies of scale.
   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said that while the idea was
``creative,'' it would face a number of regulatory hurdles,
including the commission's multiple ownership rules.

   Afghanistan's Communist government
said Thursday a guerrilla proposal for an interim government while
Soviet troops withdraw was a ``hysterical'' dream, but a U.S. envoy
called it a good idea.
   Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost, visiting Pakistan,
said the plan announced this week by the seven-party guerrilla
alliance was a ``very welcome step toward the resolution of the
Afghan problem.''
   The alliance, led by Yunis Khalis and based in Pakistan,
proposes an executive council of all seven guerrilla leaders to
preside over a 28-member Cabinet of rebels, Afghan refugees and
``Moslems presently living in Kabul.''
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
an estimated 115,000 now are in the country helping fight the
guerrillas.
   About 3.5 million Afghans have fled to neighboring Pakistan.
Most live in border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply
points for the guerrillas.
   Thursday's editions of the Afghan Communist Party newspaper Anis
said the plan ``resembles more a hysterical and disturbed dream,''
Kabul radio reported.
   ``It is clear that this void and unfounded plan has no
legitimacy and therefore is unacceptable,'' the paper said, adding
that the insurgent proposal was like the ``story of sharing the
wolf's prey.''
   The radio also broadcast a Foreign Ministry statement that
``there is only one legal government in Afghanistan, which has been
recognized by 80 countries in the world.''
   Armacost arrived Wednesday to discuss progress toward Soviet
withdrawal. He met with President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, and a U.S.
Embassy official said he also had ``frank and open'' discussions
with leaders of the Moslem guerrillas.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Feb. 8 that Soviet troops will start
pulling out May 15 if U.N.-sponsored talks in Geneva between
Afghanistan and Pakistan bring a settlement by March 15, and
complete the withdrawal in 10 months. The talks are to resume
Wednesday.
   Pakistan demands a military settlement be accompanied by a
political one to ensure transitional stability. Washington, which
supports the guerrillas, has devoted most of its effort to
obtaining a withdrawal.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas called an
end to their transportation ban Thursday. At least three civilians
were killed and eight wounded during the three days it lasted,
police said.
   The guerrillas announced Monday on their clandestine Radio
Venceremos that all vehicles defying the ban risked attack.
   Police said guerrillas damaged four vehicles and a gasoline
station during the ban.
   The five leftist guerrilla groups which form the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front denied responsibility for civilian
casualties in a statement broadcast over Radio Venceremos.
   They blamed the U.S.-supported government of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, saying the dead and injured were part of ``an
orchestrated campaign ... with the brutal intention of
incriminating'' the guerrillas for civilian casualties.
   The broadcast claimed the guerrillas sabotaged 30 electrical
distribution structures and killed or wounded 45 soldiers during
the transport ban.
   A land mine exploded Thursday as an army patrol sought to
dismantle a barricade on the Pan American Highway, wounding five
farmers and one soldier, according to judicial sources in Ilobasco,
about 35 miles northeast of the capital.
   City and rural traffic returned to normal Thursday. Dozens of
trucks, waiting at the Guatemalan and Honduran borders until the
ban ended, entered El Salvador, customs and migration officials
said.
   Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
earlier this week that three workers were killed and five wounded
when guerrillas attacked a bus on a highway 10 miles northeast of
San Salvador.
   Police reported that in another incident, on the south side of
the capital, three civilians were injured when suspected guerrillas
ordered passengers off a minibus defying the ban and then tossed a
grenade into it.
   The rebels have called transportation bans regularly as part of
their economic sabotage campaign during the 8-year-old civil war.

   A gunman wounded four people on a crowded
city bus and fled Thursday in an outbreak of the gang violence
gripping South Central Los Angeles, police said.
   Gang challenges were shouted back and forth on the bus before
the assailant shot one gang member in the chest with a .45-caliber
automatic handgun, said Lt. Bruce Hagerty. ``Then he shot
indiscriminately,'' Hagerty added.
   Three of the victims were teen-agers and one was an adult,
police said. Two of the wounded were believed to be gang members,
said police Lt. Fred Nixon.
   Two 15-year-old boys were taken to Martin Luther King Jr.
Medical Center, one in guarded condition with a chest wound, the
other in serious condition with a wound in the lower abdomen, said
spokeswoman Paula Wauls.
   A 15-year-old boy was in stable condition at California Medical
Center with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh, said hospital
spokeswoman Jane Twomey.
   The condition of the wounded adult was not immediately known.
   The shooting occurred in an area of the city plagued by gang
violence. More than 300 gang-related killings occurred in Los
Angeles County last year, many of them in the neighborhoods of
South Central.
   About 200 people gathered near the shooting scene. ``This is
every day,'' said Mary James, a bystander. ``I wouldn't mind seeing
the National Guard around here.''
   Earlier this week county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn suggested
National Guardsmen be used to quell the gang violence. Sheriff
Sherman Block said people wouldn't like the idea of troops in the
street.

   A major obstacle to oil and gas drilling
below the scenic bluffs at Pacific Palisades on the Los Angeles
coast was removed Thursday when the state Supreme Court rejected an
appeal by environmentalists.
   The unanimous vote of the six justices participating clears the
way for Occidental Petroleum Corp., which first applied for a
permit in 1970, to begin exploratory drilling within a few months
unless another court intervenes.
   ``Occidental is obviously very pleased,'' said Arthur Groman,
senior member of the company's board. ``This field, which we think
may be as much as 60 million barrels of oil, is a vital resource of
the United States.''
   Attorney Roger Diamond, who represented two residents
challenging the drilling and is a board member the environmental
group No Oil Inc., said opponents will ask a Los Angeles judge next
week to block the drilling while a challenge to the project's
Coastal Commission permit is pending.
   ``The (Supreme) Court now is less environmentally concerned than
it used to be,'' said Diamond, noting that the court had blocked a
version of the Palisades project in 1974.
   The court refused to hear an appeal of a lower-court ruling
upholding the city's 1985 approval of the drilling project. Justice
Stanley Mosk, whose son, Richard, is one of Occidental's lawyers,
did not participate in the ruling.
   Occidental plans to seek quick city approval of a water drainage
system to stabilize the cliffs, site of a destructive 1957
landslide. Drilling could then begin.
   Opponents suffered a setback Monday when a Los Angeles City
Council panel voted 3-2 against withdrawing city approval of the
project.
   Occidental has estimated that 25 million to 60 million barrels
of oil and 50 billion to 120 billion cubic feet of natural gas can
be found 10,000 feet below ground at the site. Opponents have
called the estimates inflated and speculative.

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Senate on Thursday rejected a
proposal to let voters decide whether to create a holiday honoring
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   The 15-12 vote against a referendum clears the way for the
Legislature to decide the matter for itself.
   The Republican-controlled Legislature has killed such holiday
proposals for many years, citing the cost of another paid holiday
for state workers.
   But Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt ended his term in 1986 by
creating a paid holiday by executive proclamation in honor of the
slain civil rights leader.
   Babbitt's successor, Republican Evan Mecham, rescinded the order
in 1987, triggering international boycotts of the state by
musicians and convention groups.
   Mecham has since been impeached on charges that he tried to
conceal a campaign loan, and also awaits criminal trial on similar
allegations.

   The Reagan administration is welcoming reports
from Moscow that a strategic arms agreement could be ready for
signing at a May summit, but says it is doubtful such a timetable
could be met.
   ``We welcome it, if it means the Soviets are going to work at
the negotiations just as hard as we will,'' an administration
official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   And Reagan, in an interview Thursday with The Washington Post,

``the time is too limited'' to complete work on the treaty by the

emphasis and elaboration but no retractions.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was hit with a barrage of

   Fitzwater avoided saying that Reagan had misspoken on any

said an apparent contradiction with Secretary of State George

   A widely used pair of antibiotics prevented a

than half of the patients in a similar untreated group came down
with it, researchers reported today.
   This dramatic success in preventing one of the leading causes of
death among AIDS patients is not a cure for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, but could prolong the lives of AIDS sufferers,
said the study's principal author, Dr. Margaret Fischl of the

presidency but he has gained respect.
   After 2{ years in the obscurity of Panama's presidency, he went
on television Thursday and ordered Noriega, the man who is really

assess ``a precarious position'' brought on in part by federal
drug-smuggling indictments of strong man Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   But the State Department said the United States will continue to

parliamentary vote to oust him and replace him with Manuel Solis
Palma, who has been education minister.
   The National Assembly moved against Delvalle after he tried to
dismiss Noriega, who was indicted by federal grand juries in Miami

   The West Virginia Supreme Court last week
declared the state's budget unconstitutional on grounds it is based
on excessive revenue estimates and therefore threatens the
chronically poor, mostly rural state's financial stability. The

situation. This, the second story in a four-part series on the
impact of rural poverty, looks at how West Virginians are dealing
with the crisis.

   If West Virginia were a private
corporation, says George Farley, the rural Appalachian state would
be in bankruptcy proceedings at this moment.
   ``Things are that bad in West Virginia,'' Farley, chairman of
the state House Finance Committee, said recently. ``And not only
that, but it appears this current legislative session is our last
chance to keep things from totally going bust.''
   Farley, a Democrat who has helped put together the state's
budget for the past 10 years, said he's never seen conditions so
bleak. Long-term unemployment, a decimated industrial tax base and
the loss of millions of dollars in federal revenue sharing funds
have West Virginia reeling on the edge of bankruptcy.
   While leaders cast about for solutions _ including special loan
promotions for industry, tax hikes, spending slashes and a hotly
debated plan to make southern West Virginia a dumping ground for
nuclear waste _ the 1.9 million residents watch helplessly as their
highways crumble from neglect, their social services dwindle and
thousands of their friends and relatives flee to greener pastures.
   ``I'd estimate more than 100,000 of our young people have left
the state since 1980,'' said William Miernyk, a retired economist
at West Virginia University.
   This accounts for about 15 percent of the state's labor force,
he said. It also tends to distort the unemployment picture in West
Virginia, a chronically poor state where three of every five
residents live in rural areas.
   Rural places throughout the South and Appalachia have found
themselves left out of the economic boom in many of the metro areas.
   The federal government currently lists West Virginia's jobless
rate at 7.4 percent, with many rural counties reporting
double-digit unemployment.
   ``I'd say the true unemployment rate around here, counting
people who have used up their benefits, would be way over 20
percent,'' said John ``Duck'' Dudash, a retired miner at
Farmington, a little coal town in northern West Virginia.
   ``Things are so bad that people would line up for miles, double
file, if a mine around here would start hiring. Why, it reminds me
of the Depression,'' said the 74-year-old Dudash. ``Farmington is
almost a ghost town these days.''
   Miernyk went further: ``In some ways it's worse than it was in
the 1930s.
   ``Coal has always been a cyclic industry here but in recent
years we've lost many thousands of coal mining jobs that, because
of the decline of our chemical and primary metals industries, we'll
never get back.''
   The loss of these industrial payrolls, plus the erosion of
nearly 25 percent of West Virginia's manufacturing jobs, has had a
ripple effect on the state economy. Even traditional revenue
sources, such as the state-operated liquor stores, are reporting
serious revenue losses these days.
   In December, Standard & Poor's, a national bond-rating service,
imposed an emergency ``financial watch'' on the state.
   Last month, the Kanawha County school system, West Virginia's
largest, threatened to close down, then filed suit in an attempt to
force the state to pay millions of dollars in overdue school-aid
payments.
   ``The state needs an immediate $150 million fix, just to stay
even,'' Farley said. ``On top of that, we'll probably need another
$50 million by the end of the fiscal year, given that tax revenues
currently are $37 million below budget estimates.''
   Farley doubts Gov. Arch Moore Jr.'s recent assertion that the
state merely has a cash flow problem, which will clear up when
log-jammed tax revenues come rolling in.
   Moore, a Republican, imposed a 20 percent, across-the-board
spending freeze during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that
ended last June 30. Despite the freeze, he still had to withhold
$58 million in state income tax refunds until after June 30.
   ``This meant we began the current fiscal year $58 million in the
hole,'' Farley said.
   As of mid-February, West Virginia was $100 million behind in
school-aid payments. It owed $50 million in state medical insurance
payments to hospitals, physicians and pharmacists. And it needed to
come up with about $30 million as its share of $120 million in
overdue federal-state Medicaid payments.
   Meanwhile, the state's teachers are up in arms because their
paychecks are threatened and their retirement fund is more than $1
billion in the red, due to past borrowing from it by the state.
   Some state officials acknowledge privately that many smaller
companies no longer will do business with the government, except on
a cash basis.
   Moore, who is seeking re-election, acknowledged in November the
state was facing a financial crisis. A month later, in his
state-of-the-state address, he said West Virginia had just
experienced a great year of economic development.
   State Senate President Dan Tonkovich, a Democrat who also is
running for governor, accused Moore of fomenting ``chaos.''
   Standard & Poor's, in its financial warning about $900 million
worth of state bonds, noted, ``Neither the executive nor
legislative branches has formulated a comprehensive program to
address the state's deteriorating financial picture.''
   West Virginians, whose motto is ``Mountaineers Are Always
Free,'' say they are depressed and frightened.
   ``I feel the thing that has really pushed us over the edge is
the loss of federal revenue sharing funds,'' said Kate Long, a
citizen activist who is knowledgeable about the state's tax
structure. ``We've always had inept politicians and cycles of boom
and bust, but a poor state like West Virginia simply can't overcome
the loss of $200 million a year, given everything else that has
happened to us.''
   A study by the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees shows West Virginia over the past four years
has lost more federal dollars, per capita, than any other state
except New York. The money lost when federal revenue sharing was
curtailed took 23 percent of West Virginia communities' annual
budgets and caused widespread service cutbacks.

<HEAD>CHARLESTON, W.Va.: service cutbacks.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In rural Preston County, county hospital administrator Hilda
Heady, said she has had to impose a 20 percent layoff and other
cutbacks, such as reduced operating room hours, in order to keep
the doors open.
   Jerry Ash, a spokesman for the West Virginia Hospital
Association, said continuing revenue losses, and especially late
payments by the state, have created a medical care crisis.
   ``Two small hospitals went bankrupt last year and we did a
recent survey that showed six more of the state's 35 small, rural
hospitals are on the verge of bankruptcy. Another six are just a
step behind them,'' he said.
   Farley, who advocates a combination of budget cuts and tax
increases to try and stave off financial disaster, said a national
energy policy is needed to help states such as West Virginia,
Louisiana and Texas, whose economies have been crippled by erosion
of natural resource-based industries.
   Asked what West Virginia would do if it did go belly up, Farley
just shook his head.
   The governor, when asked recently what would happen should West
Virginia be unable to pay its bills in April, replied by quipping,
``Who says there will even be a state government by then?''
   But the question is no joke to many West Virginians, and
especially thys out for the
poor in Pahokee, long bypassed by the opportunity burgeoning in
other parts of Florida.
   Pahokee High School _ with 150 male students now enrolled _ has
26 graduates attending college on football scholarships. Many hope
to follow the lead of Jackson, who returns here in the offseason,
and Pahokee alumnus Andre Waters, now a safety for the National
Football League's Philadelphia Eagles.
   Football coach Don Thompson said 34 players from the high school
have earned scholarships in the past 4{ years.
   ``That's a million dollars worth of education,'' said the coach.
   Few could afford the schooling otherwise in a town where no
college means joining the armed forces or a life of seasonal
agricultural work.
   Economic statistics are imprecise, but average family income in
Pahokee ranges between $12,500 and $15,000, compared to $38,000
statewide. Florida's unemployment rate is only 4.9 percent. There
are no reliable unemployment figures for Pahokee because most work
is seasonal.
   ``In Pahokee, a few families are filthy rich, and some people
are dirt poor,'' said Warren Nevad, city finance director.
   While Florida's population has grown to 12 million from 5
million in 1960, Pahokee's has fallen below 7,000 people for the
first time since the Depression, when it hit 15,000.
   Nearly 45 percent of the residents are black, many of them
young. The median age is 26.2 years.
   Rural towns in many parts of the nation, but especially in the
South, have seen their fortunes and numbers decline in recent
years, as farming and small manufacturing employment have dropped
and people have migrated to cities for opportunity.
   Pahokee's history tells a peculiar tale of decline _ but
recently, too, of hope for a new start.
   Country singer Mel Tillis, who left his hometown in 1951,
recalls a ``Huckleberry Finn-Tom Sawyer'' existence in his boyhood.
Pahokee's living history book, 92-year-old Carmen Salvatore,
remembers that when he arrived in 1919 he found the land ``like God
made it.''
   That was before this part of the Everglades was drained. The
only way to get to Pahokee was by boat.
   ``The wildlife was in abundance,'' Salvatore said. ``The lake
was filled with fish; there were birds of every kind. We had plenty
of beans and fresh vegetables.''
   But powerful financial, political and natural forces threatened
that bucolic lifestyle.
   Sugar corporations moved in after Fidel Castro's communist
revolution in Cuba three decades ago and the subsequent end in U.S.
purchases of Cuban sugar.
   The dark, rich Everglades muck around giant Lake Okeechobee was
bought up from small farmers and converted from winter vegetable
fields by U.S. Sugar Corp. and smaller companies to grow cane. Some
450,000 acres around the lake produce $1 billion in sugar each year.
   It's at harvest time, when the fields are torched to burn off
leaves and drive out snakes and other animals, that the rabbit runs
bring a burst of activity in the quiet town, which has no night
spots or community center for teen-agers.
   ``We don't have jobs. That's the way we have to get some
money,'' said Willie Littlejohn, an all-state sophomore defensive
tackle at the high school. The rabbits bring $1.25 to $2 apiece.
The likes of Littlejohn can bring home 10 to 20 a day.
   Salvatore recalls a thriving Pahokee. During Prohibition,
bootleggers flocked to the isolated town on boats full of homemade
South Florida booze destined for Chicago speakeasies.
   In the late 1920s, hurricanes and floods washed away precious
topsoil _ and then the Great Depression hit.
   Even then, Pahokee's low cost of living _ Salvatore, a father of
five, recalls getting by on $9 a month _ and plentiful work in the
vegetable fields, increased the population to 15,000.
   Pahokee became one of South Florida's up-and-coming towns. A
native was elected speaker of the Statehouse. The town's political
clout led to roads, schools, and everything else Pahokee seemed to
need.
   ``We had high hopes,'' Salvatore said, sitting on his porch as a
morning breeze delivered a sugary scent from nearby fields.
   ``Like so many pioneers, we had all the trials and tribulations,
then someone else came in and reaped the benefits,'' he said,
referring to recent shifts in the labor force.
   The sugar industry requires less labor than previous
agriculture, and most harvesting is done now by West Indians
imported under a special immigration agreement.
   Desegregation in the 1960s meant more change. Many white
families sent their children away to private school or moved out.
   Salvatore, whose grandson Carmen III is police chief, details
the dozens of stores, restaurants, motels and even barbershops that
have closed.
   He predicts Pahokee will shrivel, but he seems to be in the
minority.
   ``People are saying, `I like this town and I'm going to take a
stand,''' said James Bennett, a funeral home operator who just
completed four years as president of the Chamber of Commerce.
   It's not the style of people here to talk publicly about one
major reason for change: the death 1{ years ago at age 80 of Mayor
Duncan ``Uncle Dunc'' Padgett, who ran the city for 25 years.
   ``Uncle Dunc'' dominated Pahokee and was determined to protect
it from the onslaught of Florida growth.
   Those who run the city now say Pahokee had become a textbook for
how not to run a city. Water meters weren't read for years, and the
city was paying $69,000 a year to insure a fleet of vehicles, many
no longer in service.
   The city council of ``Uncle Dunc'' rebelled in the 1970s against
federal regulations that found water, sewerage and housing were not
up to minimum standards.
   At one point, Pahokee City Council voted to secede from the
Union.
   Today's council is more pragmatic.
   Mayor Clark Wilkinson was elected last year on a reform platform
and she helped gain 3-1 passage of a Feb. 9 referendum changing the
city government from the strong mayor system to a city manager
running a professional city government.
   ``This has turned the city around 100 percent,'' said Councilman
Ramon Horta, the first Hispanic ever on the five-member council.
Roy Singletary last year became the first black on council.
   The mayor followed the city charter referendum with a series of
meetings among more than 50 residents and researchers from state
universities to look at Pahokee's needs.
   They are working out plans to develop fishing-based tourism,
improve housing and lure new businesses.
   Said City Council President John Norman, ``We love Pahokee and
we're going to keep it alive.''

   The urgent need to boost employment in the
depressed rural South is a point on which Democratic and Republican
presidential candidates agree. But to create jobs in the hard-hit
region, they take different routes. This, the last story in a
four-part series looking at rural poverty, details the candidates'
proposals, from training and basic education to rural enterprise
zones and increased wages and farm prices.

   Most of the presidential candidates agree that
new jobs are the key to combating poverty, especially in the rural
South, but their proposals for creating them differ widely, from
minimum wage revisions to education, enterprise zones and saving
the family farm.
   Responding to a survey by The Associated Press on how to deal
with rural poverty, Democrats Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart both
pushed an increase in the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage, while
Republican Pat Robertson said there should be a subminimum ``youth
opportunity wage'' to help teen-agers break into the job market.
   The Republicans, in general, stressed economic development. Vice
President George Bush said rural America ``has been strongly tested
in recent years,'' but is ``headed back up.''
   Bush's chief rival, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas,
said that as a disabled war veteran, ``I am sensitive to the needs
of people who, due to factors beyond their control, may need a
boost in climbing the ladder of opportunity.''
   Dole said he would change the formula for funding poverty
programs that he said ``discriminate against rural America.''
   Both Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York suggest rural
enterprise zones. Robertson said education is ``the turnkey'' to
resolve poverty in the South.
   Among the Democrats, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who is
hoping to score heavily in his home region during the Super Tuesday
primaries March 8, said, ``Our greatest defense against poverty is
education.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri said his ``trade, agricultural
and competitiveness initiatives ... will restore economic health to
rural America.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said every distressed area in
America, urban or rural, could benefit from the same development
and welfare reform policies that have worked in his state,
including job training for welfare recipients and public-private
development partnerships.
   Jackson said, ``The cornerstone of anti-poverty policy is full
employment at adequate wages.'' He called for a national floor on
welfare payments, universal national health care and a commitment
to save the family farm.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said day care was vital for the rural
poor. He said his public works program would give people a better
opportunity than welfare or unemployment benefits, and he pledged
to ``bring farm prices back up.''
   The Associated Press asked all the presidential candidates on
Feb. 11 to respond to the following question:
   ``The Census Bureau reports that in 1986, when the national
poverty rate was 13.6 percent, the poverty rate in the South was
16.1 percent. More than 13 million or 40 percent, of the nation's
32 million poor people live in the South. As President, how would
you deal with poverty in general and rural poverty in particular?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Here is how the Democrats replied:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``In Massachusetts, we have made `Opportunity for All' a
fundamental economic goal. We have reduced unemployment from nearly
12 percent in 1975 to three percent today. ... Our ET (Education
and Training) Choices program has helped more than 40,000
Massachusetts residents lift themselves from public assistance to
real jobs. And the Massachusetts Housing Partnership has helped
provide decent and affordable housing for 30,000 families of low
and moderate income, with thousands more in the pipeline.
   ``America can and must do the same. Through a strong national
urban policy and a parallel commitment to regional development, we
can bring to every distressed area and to every region, rural or
urban, the opportunity to combine public investment with private
resources and create new jobs.
   ``Through national welfare reform, we can make the success of ET
a nationwide success. And with a National Partnership for
Affordable Housing _ one that combines a renewed federal commitment
with the sensitivity of local initiative _ we can end the national
disgrace of homelessness and provide affordable housing for working
people, the poor and the elderly.''

<HEAD>RICHARD GEPHARDT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Missouri congressman said welfare benefits should be high
enough to bring poor families up to the poverty line. Welfare
programs must be reformed to give people ``the skills and
experience they need to leave welfare and poverty behind,'' and
provide preschool education for their children at age 3.
   Gephardt supports ``higher Medicare prepayment rates for rural
hospitals'' and federal efforts to strengthen ``both our
infrastructure and our transportation system in rural areas.''
   To spur rural development, Gephardt ``will utilize the expertise
of local governments, rural electric and telephone cooperatives,
Cooperative Extension (through land grant universities), and the
private sector to help communities build their own economic
development strategies. ... The FmHA Business and Industrial
Development Loan Guarantee Program, which has languished in recent
years, will be aggressively reorganized and expanded.''

<HEAD>ALBERT GORE JR.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The key to winning the war against poverty is giving all
Americans the first-rate education that will guarantee them a job.
... Job training and retraining programs, like formal education,
are also vital to preventing poverty. ...
   ``I believe there is a great deal we can do to revitalize the
rural economy so that fewer families are forced to live in poverty.
First, we must improve and maintain our ability to compete for jobs
and markets. We need to improve rural infrastructures to attract
new jobs. We must make it easier for new enterprises to get started
and for small businesses to stay in business. We need strong
presidential leadership to open markets abroad and help workers and
farm families earn a decent income at home. Above all, we need an
agricultural policy that works.''

<HEAD>GARY HART</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jay Angoff, a Hart campaign aide in Washington, said the former
Colorado senator favors a comprehensive strategy ``of promoting
better health care in rural areas, higher quality education, more
and better paying jobs, a better infrastructure and a greater
availability of transportation and other services.''
   Among the anti-poverty strategies Hart has proposed: raising the
minimum wage to $5 an hour; voluntary national service, including a
literacy corps; universal access to pre-school education, and
incentives for student teachers to teach in rural areas.

in other countries.

   Polygamy was banned in this West
African country more than 20 years ago, but it persists for much of
the population because it makes life easier _ at least for the men.
   ``One woman is not enough for an African man,'' said Soumahoro
Mekinhui, a 64-year-old retired civil servant who has four wives
but is not sure how many children he has. ``Every woman has her
role. They clean house, wash clothes, prepare food, and care for
the children.''
   While the government doesn't try to enforce its ban on polygamy,
debate erupts every year over the practice and it always ends up
inconclusive.
   But there's no debate in Mekinhui's home. He is a Moslem and his
religion permits him to have four wives. The only question is the
number of children.
   ``I don't know how many there are exactly, perhaps 24,'' he said
one recent evening, relaxing in a stuffed vinyl chair at home.
``They are too numerous.''
   Large families are traditional in many parts of Africa because
children, preferably males, can help support the family and
perpetuate the husband's name.
   As Mekinhui spoke to a reporter, a 2-year-old boy wandered into
the room in his underwear and climbed onto his father's lap. His
wife Bakayoko, 38, the fourth and youngest of the four, sat in a
chair across from him, breast-feeding a year-old son, Chialo, in
one arm and holding a sleeping 2-year-old in the other.
   She was the only one of the wives at home. The others were
visiting their families, and Bakayoko was left to do the work of
all of them.
   Her day began at 4:30 a.m., which she said is her usual waking
hour even when the other wives are home to help with the work.
   She had prepared the family's food and washed the clothing. She
spent part of the day selling fruit at the market, but at noon and
in the evening she was home to prepare meals and look after her
children.
   ``This is a woman's life,'' she said. ``There's never a dispute
between me and the other wives. I do what work I have to do. It's
not too much for me.''
   ``My women are good,'' Mekinhui said. ``There are those in other
households who are impatient and always fight. But not in my
house.''
   Marie Antoinette Aoulou, producer on an Ivorian television show
on women, said that because women outnumber men by a large margin
in the country, many women could not marry unless they agree to a
polygamous marriage.
   As such marriages remain outside the law, the wives' only
recourse in marital disputes is to leave, said Yves Roux, chief
lawyer at the Ministry of Justice.
   ``We Africans like to live in community,'' Roux added.
``Children are a gift of God, a source of wealth. They play an
important economic role for the family.''
   He said the government banned polygamy mainly because costs of
living rose as the country developed.
   ``The government wanted families to adapt to the new economic
situation, to restrain spending.''
   Polygamy also runs counter to efforts at population control and
has the potential to cause friction between religious groups.
   In nearby Nigeria, black Africa's most populous nation, Roman
Catholics criticized a recent population-control policy limiting
women to four children each. Church leaders said this would permit
the polygamous Moslem population to expand at the expense of
monogamous Christians.
   About one-third of Ivory Coast's 10 million people are
Christians. The rest are Moslems or animists, both of whom practice
polygamy.
   Roux estimates that more than half the nation practices
polygamy, but exact numbers of polygamists are not known. Roux
added that some men call their additional wives mistresses,
clouding even more any attempt to determine the fullest extent that
polygamy is practiced.
   He said the Ivory Coast government has been concerned about
disturbances caused by disputes in polygamous families.
   In interviews here, children of polygamous marriages complained
of families divided by jealous wives, and of nasty disputes among
children.
   ``There are always personality problems between the women, and
often the disputes are uncontrollable,'' said Ramatou Traure, an
unmarried seamstress in Abidjan, whose father had three wives.
``The worst is when the women use black magic against each other.''
   Nonetheless, some Ivorians believe the ban on polygamy should be
lifted or at least modified to give people a choice.
   Once a year, at least, the polygamy ban comes up for debate with
people discussing it in the streets, in offices, on the radio and
the television, and in the newspapers.
   ``Polygamy is still common in the cities and villages,'' wrote
Narcisse Haquat, a professor at the national university, in the
official newspaper, Fraternite Matin. ``To legalize polygamy would
be to take into account the sociological reality.''
   Reality includes the rising costs of maintaining multiple wives.
   ``It ruins the household ecomony,'' said Ibrahim Diallo, a
Moslem cafe owner in Abidjan. ``The man is always paying for food
and supplies for his women and children.''
   Mekinhui, who said he lives on a monthly pension the equivalent
of $175, acknowledged that it is difficult to make ends meet. But
he added that the burden is an honor, a man's responsibility.
Besides, he observed, his older sons help support him.

<HEAD>Sikh Radicals Again Control Golden Temple</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No sand-bag bunkers bar the way, and Sikh
radicals aren't waving rifles and submachine guns menacingly. But
inside the Golden Temple, bearded young men look as determined as
nearly four years ago when Indian troops stormed Sikhism's holiest
shrine to dislodge militants.
   Today, Sikh radicals are again in control of the 17th-century
sanctuary, the seat of Sikh temporal power which has served as the
base for their six-year campaign for a separate nation in the
Indian state of Punjab.
   Police in Amritsar estimate that 100 to 200 Sikh radicals, most
of them armed, are inside the shrine at any given time, slipping in
and out almost at will.
   ``They are a determined lot, ruthless killers. We are up against
very nasty people,'' said Mohammad Izhar Alam, the Amritsar
district police chief.
   Again, the radicals are vowing to resist intrusion. But now they
say they will carry the battle well beyond the walled temple
complex.
   ``We have arms and very, very committed men,'' said Nirvar
Singh, one of the top Sikh militant leaders in Punjab. ``This time
if we are attacked, the army will have to fight us all over
northern India.
   ``It will be real bloodbath in true Sikh tradition.''
   As he spoke during an interview with The Associated Press in a
windowless room of the temple, about 20 young Sikhs looked on.
   ``Warriors of the faith,'' Singh called them.
   ``Each of these men can die for the faith and we have thousands
of them all over northern India.''
   The evidence is that, despite 35,000 police and 50,000
paramilitary troops in Punjab, the militants operate freely in the
northern state bordering Pakistan.
   They have been blamed for about 300 deaths in the state since
January. In the same period last year, 135 slayings were reported.
   At least 17 visitors to the Golden Temple, including a woman,
have disappeared this year. All are believed to have been killed by
the militants on suspicion of being police spies.
   A classified police document shown to The Associated Press says
the militants in Punjab have at least 200 AK-47 assault rifles,
1,000 Thompson submachine guns, 1,200 sten guns, 50 self-loading
rifles, 10 light machine guns, 250 Enfield rifles, 800 revolvers,
and a large number of hand grenades.
   In almost every Sikh home, too, is a 3-foot sword, kept shining
and sharp under a religious obligation of the martial faith founded
about 500 years ago as an alternative to the era's warring Hindus
and Moslems.
   Alam, the police chief, said authorities could clear the shrine
of militants if necessary, but he questioned the costs.
   ``We can storm the shrine, but it has to be a political decision
because the consequences will be far-reaching,'' he told a reporter.
   Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of India's 780 million people, have
traditionally been the sword-arm of the Indian army. Many consider
it a sacrilege for security forces to enter their shrines.
   The 1984 assault on the Golden Temple left 1,200 people dead,
most of them Sikhs. It so angered two Sikh bodyguards of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi that they assassinated her five months later
in New Delhi.
   S.S. Virk, the senior paramilitary officer in Amritsar, also
expressed fear that driving Sikh radicals from the temple could
backfire and build support for them.
   ``Clearing the Golden Temple of the terrorists is not a very
difficult task, but after that what?'' said Virk, who is the deputy
director general of the Central Reserve Police Force.
   Forty miles to the north, in the village of Haruwal, a young
Sikh ventured an answer: ``If police enter the Golden Temple we
will declare a war.''
   He refused to give his name, but declared: ``Seven of us from
this village have been to Pakistan and we have enough arms to
strike at will.''
   The village is a half mile from Pakistan, which denies India's
repeated charges that it is supporting the Sikh rebels.
   To the south at Fattu Bheela village, where the radicals
recently killed three members of one family, Sikh farmer Gurven
Singh said he knew the militants were killing innocent people.
   ``But I cannot support police entering our shrines to get them.''
   In Amritsar, a spokesman for the Panthic Committee, an umbrella
group of radicals, vowed to kill ``any enemy'' entering the Golden
Temple.
   ``We have a hit list. If and when anyone from that list comes
here, we kill them,'' said Giani Jagir Singh. ``We will kill them
with our bare hands, so much is our anger.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oh, yes, NBC wants you to spend a half hour in a
roomful of tots, not once but three times this week as part of the
unusual premiere schedule for ``Day by Day,'' a new comedy from the
creator of ``Family Ties.''
   Preview episodes air tonight and Thursday. The series premieres
in its regular time period on Sunday, in place of ``My Two Dads,''
which will move around the schedule during the ``Day by Day''
spring tryout.
   Thanks to witty writing and a pleasant disposition, ``Day by
Day'' proves a lot easier to take than the 30 minutes of darling
dialogue and squeaky tricycles the premise would seem to suggest.
   Linda Kelsey and Doug Sheehan star as Kate and Brian Harper, a
successful couple who have dropped out of the rat race to spend
more time with their infant daughter by running a day-care center
for toddlers in their home.
   The series premise is based on ``Family Ties'' creator Gary
David Goldberg's similar real-life experience.
   ``Day by Day'' has the same gentle humor as ``Family Ties'' and
is in many ways also reminiscent of ``Growing Pains.'' There's even
a kind of Michael J. Fox-Kirk Cameron stand-in _ C.B. Barnes as
15-year-old Ross, the Harpers' older son.
   In the first episode, Ross, who apparently heretofore had little
use for little ones, gets uncharacteristically interested in the
kiddie-minding business to impress Kristin, the Harpers' beautiful
assistant.
   Kristin: ``There's something so attractive about a man holding a
small child.''
   Ross (suddenly bolting after a romping child): ``C'mere!''
   There's ample opportunity for cheap sentimentality when Ross
promises little Justin that the boy's father will be at his
birthday party, not knowing Justin's parents are divorced.
   But as in ``Family Ties,'' the writing only flirts with
corniness: Ross launches into a speech about resenting his own
father's absence when he was a child. Brian counters that he's
given everything up now to be with his children. ``But I'm 15
now,'' Ross says. ``I resent you being around.''
   Added to the mix of not-too-cute tykes is Brian's self-involved
former co-worker, Eileen, still enthusiastically working her way up
the corporate ladder. She drops by to say she saw some children
playing and was moved by the sight.
   Eileen: ``I said, `Eileen, you've got a biological clock, but
your finger's on the snooze alarm.' Shouldn't there be some little
Eileens?''
   Kate: ``Eileen! I never knew you felt that way!''
   Eileen: ``I do, and coming over here always seems to cure me of
it.''
   ``Day by Day'' is the first of a number of new series premiering
in March. By the middle of the month, the networks' schedules will
little resemble the lineups they started with last fall.
   This week NBC adds ``The Highwayman,'' an action-adventure
series starring Sam Jones as a ``Road Warrior'' kind of character,
and featuring Jacko, the Australian ex-football player so popular
in the battery commercials; it will be the new lead-in for ``Miami
Vice.'' The ratings for that 4-year-old series have been so-so this
season. NBC will announce in March after watching its performance
following ``The Highwayman'' whether it will be back for a fifth
year. ``Sonny Spoon'' was recently added to the schedule following
``Vice.''
   ABC is adding ``Probe'' for a trial run. Parker Stevenson and
Ashley Crow star in the series based on an idea by Isaac Asimov
about crime-fighting scientists. The network is also launching
``Supercarrier,'' apparently hoping to reap the benefits of the
popular movie ``Top Gun.''
   The ABC comedy ``The Wonder Years'' also premieres this month in
its regular time period on Tuesday.
   CBS is adding a bunch of sitcoms to its drama-heavy schedule. On
Monday is ``Eisenhower & Lutz,'' about a one-man Palm Springs law
firm. The network will put three new comedies on Tuesday: ``Trial
and Error,'' about mismatched roommates; ``The Dictator,'' with
Christopher Lloyd as a deposed despot living in Queens, N.Y.; and
``Coming of Age,'' with Paul Dooley as a retired airline pilot
living in an Arizona retirement community.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Commissioner Kevin Tucker drops
management buzzwords like efficiency and cost-effectiveness, but
what he's really talking about is battling a legacy of corruption
in Philadelphia's police force.
   A 47-year-old former Secret Service officer who once protected
Jackie Kennedy, Tucker is revamping a department that less than a
year ago was labeled ``unfocused, unmanaged, undertrained,
underequipped and unaccountable.''
   As head of the nation's fourth largest force, Tucker is credited
with restoring morale and public confidence in a department
crippled by a federal corruption probe and a deadly confrontation
with the radical group MOVE.
   A 1986 survey revealed that 65 percent of Philadelphians thought
police officers used excessive force, 49 percent thought they took
bribes and 46 percent believed they slept on the job.
   ``I don't represent corrupt or brutal police officers,'' Tucker
said in an interview. ``It's my responsibility to find them and to
deal with them as effectively as possible and to get rid of them.''
   Since 1983, a federal investigation of police corruption has
resulted in the conviction of 34 police officers, including a
deputy commissioner, for extorting money from vice figures.
   The department came under searing criticism for its handling of
the May 1985 confrontation with the radical group MOVE in which 11
people died and 61 rowhouses were destroyed in a fire ignited by a
police bomb.
   In January 1986, Tucker replaced Gregore Sambor, who quit after
the MOVE debacle. One of Tucker's first actions was to appoint a
civilian task force to examine the department top to bottom.
   The group issued a 195-page report last May attacking the
force's management, training, infrastructure and relationship with
the city's 1.6 million residents.
   ``To us, the Philadelphia Police Department's development as an
effective, modern department seems arrested,'' the 13-member panel
wrote. ``The dead hand of past traditions guides the department,
rather than the challenge of the future.''
   So far, over half the task force's 112 recommendations have been
implemented, and Tucker gets credit.
   ``He has communicated a clear, positive, modern image of what a
metropolitan police department ought to be,'' said William B.
Eagleson Jr., chairman of the civilian Police Commissioners
Council. ``He's a very strong leader.''
   Among the few major gripes, black officers charge Tucker with
failing to recruit and promote enough minorities, who comprise just
18 percent of the force in a city that is 42 percent black and
Hispanic.
   Philadelphia has the lowest crime rate among the nation's top 10
cities and is tied with Detroit for the highest number of officers
per capita.
   Still, in 1974, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission said of the
Philadelphia police: ``corruption and political influence have
plagued the force since its inception.''
   The force's reputation for violence grew under Frank Rizzo, who
was commissioner from 1967 to '71 and mayor from 1972 to '80. One
study found that from 1975 to '78, 41 percent of people shot by
police were unarmed.
   The last decade has included unconstitutional police ``sweeps,''
dozens of false arrest charges and accusations of abuses by the
police K-9 unit. According to city records, more than 300 citizens
were attacked by police dogs in the early 1980s.
   Tucker quickly reorganized the department's ethics and
accountability division, which helped arrest nine officers on
corruption charges in 1986. And for the first time ever, the
department now has a statement of ethical principles.
   ``There's no question that he was very serious about making
changes in the way the police department handled matters involving
the integrity of officers,'' said U.S. Attorney Edward S.G. Dennis
Jr.
   Tucker was a police officer for two years in Rahway, N.J.,
before joining the Secret Service in 1965. He spent four years
traveling around the world providing security for John F. Kennedy's
widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, and the couple's two children.
   From 1969 to '78, Tucker was an agent in Newark, N.J.,
Philadelphia and Washington before taking over the Philadelphia
office. He retired from the Secret Service in May 1985.
   After six months in the private sector, he accepted the
commissioner's job at a salary of $55,000 a year _ a $20,000 pay
cut. In January, Tucker received a pay raise to $85,000.
   The first outsider named police commissioner since 1924, Tucker
was greeted coolly by some members of the force _ including the
influential head of the police union _ but reform has wooed the
critics.
   ``I think there isn't any doubt that this police force is
responding to what is happening at the top,'' said Michael
Churchill, chief counsel for the Public Interest Law Center. ``Many
people in the force were disgusted by the crooks and the more
brutal members and are pleased it's not being condoned.''
   Tucker sees policing as a partnership between officers and the
public; so, he's opened a minipolice station in one of the city's
worst drug neighborhoods and added victim assistance and crime
prevention officers.
   Foot patrols have been increased, officers are learning Spanish,
computers are on order and Nautilus exercising machines have been
installed in police divisions.
   ``I was convinced from my time here as head of the Secret
Service that there were a lot of dedicated and competent people,''
said Tucker, a burly 6-footer with a Brooklyn accent. ``It was a
question of giving them the opportunity to be innovative and
creative.''
   Tucker's tenure as head of the 6,700-member force hasn't been
entirely smooth.
   A federal lawsuit by the Fraternal Order of Police has stymied
his attempt to require polygraph tests for officers seeking to join
an elite investigation team.
   Last year, the commissioner was criticized for allowing officers
to ``infiltrate'' political groups police believed would disrupt
events celebrating the bicentennial of the Constitution.
   The Guardian Civic League, which represents black officers, has
called for timetables for increasing the number of black
supervisors.
   ``I still see more effort in the hardware rather than in dealing
with some core problems,'' said Detective Ron Oliver, the league's
president.
   Tucker said he still has much to accomplish, from modernizing
facilities to upgrading officer performance standards.
   ``I'm satisfied we've come a long way,'' he said. ``But a lot
remains to be done, and a lot of them are big-ticket items.''

<HEAD>Dividends Are Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market crash might have dropped the
price-earnings ratios of some better-known stocks, but it didn't
knock the dividends out of them.
   True, the boards of some companies might have rethought earlier
notions of raising the payout, but many others went right ahead and
raised theirs.
   For the first nine months of last year there was a 19 percent
increase over the similar period of 1986 in the net number of
increased corporate dividends. In two of the following four months
the trend was lower.
   Nevertheless, a compilation by Wright Investors' Service shows
dividends for the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's index were
7.3 percent higher in the final three months of 1987, matched
against the similar 1986 period.
   In fact, the percentage of dividend increases in the fourth
quarter of the year was higher than in the first three months.
   Wright's figures show that so far this year companies continue
to express a good deal of faith in the future, because that is what
it takes to commit a major company to a higher dividend level.
   Of almost 600 companies _ all listed on the New York Stock
Exchange _ that have declared dividends so far this year, 360, or
60 percent, have raised their figures over the same period of 1987.
   While some observers are inclined to declare these increases as
additional evidence that October's big collapse had only small
repercussions on the economy, there is probably a better
explanation.
   Among other things, the Oct. 19 debacle produced a very strange
twist in the economic trend: It reduced the prospects for a sharp
increase in inflation and the subsequent threat of a serious
recession.
   Recession still appears in the forecasts of most corporate
economists, but it is pushed deeper into the future. If the
executive suite listens to its economists, it believes any
recession is not likely before late this year.
   Adding to the sense of confidence about raising dividends is the
historical record, which shows that dividend yields are still low.
   Wright observes that the average dividend yield of the 500
companies in the Standard & Poor's index is only 3.6 percent,
``clearly out of line with history.''
   Only during the period 1958 to 1972, Wright's researchers found,
have such low yields prevailed. Even Uncle Sam is paying more;
there is close to a 5 percentage-point yield advantage in Treasury
bonds compared with the S&P 500 average.
   Wright cautions that further increases are not in the bag, by
any means, and even suggests there has been some additional loss of
business confidence in the first two months of 1988.
   But, judging by forecasts of corporate economists, that lower
confidence is not a consequence of recession fears. What appears to
be a consensus forecast calls for relatively weak growth, but
growth nevertheless.
   That is, they may be laying back because of a sense of caution
more than a loss of confidence. And if that cautiousness lessens,
it conceivably could lift the lid on more dividend increases.

<DATELINE>HAKODATE, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in their history, the
Japanese will be able to travel across the nation's four main
islands without taking a boat or a plane.
   Scheduled for opening soon is a transportation project that has
been likened to the opening of the transcontinental railroad in the
United States on May 10, 1869.
   The Japanese project includes the world's longest underwater
tunnel and a mammoth bridge system.
   But it has its critics and doubters who contend the project is
unnecessary and is going to cost more than Japan will be able to
afford in the years ahead.
   In March, the 33.4-mile Seikan Undersea Tunnel will replace an
80-year-old ferry service when it goes into operation as a railroad
line running under the Tsugaru Strait between Aomori on the main
island of Honshu and Hakodate in southern Hokkaido.
   In April, the Seto Ohashi, or Great Bridge, comprised of six
suspension bridges reaching five small islands in the Seto Inland
Sea, will open to both rail and vehicle traffic between Honshu's
Okayama region and Shikoku Island in southern Japan.
   For the first time, Japanese will be able use ground transport
to go from the northern island of Hokkaido to the main island of
Honshu, and on to Kyushu or Shikoku.
   The two projects represent the largest engineering schemes ever
attempted by Japan and each is a major technological feat in itself.
   Yet critics question the investment of more than $17 billion in
public money on what they contend is an outdated mode of
transportation _ the railroad _ at a time when Japan's rapid rate
of growth is slowing.
   Kyohei Kakumoto, a director of the Japan Transport Economics
Research Center and commentator on transportation issues, said the
projects were given the go-ahead by politicians in the 1960s, at
times of rapid economic growth and when forecasters predicted major
increases in rail use.
   ``The key point here is that even though planners were aware
they erred in their original forecasts, construction was still
allowed to proceed,'' Kakumoto said. ``And now that these projects
are complete the people are finding themselves concerned about the
lack of advantages.''
   The expressway portion of the bridge system is expected to
recover costs, which ran up to $8.7 billion over the 10-year
construction period, if tourism reaches projected levels. But
transportation officials acknowledge that the rail lines will
operate in the red in the tradition of the formerly state-operated
Japan National Railways (JNR), where the blueprints for the two
major projects originated.
   The Seikan Tunnel, tailored for 2.3 million rail passengers and
some 5 million tons of cargo each year, carries a price tag of $8.5
billion in overall construction outlays, $16.2 million in annual
maintenance costs and a yearly operating deficit of at least $23.1
million.
   A Seikan tunnel official, Mitsuaki Tanaka, argued that the
tunnel is justified because cargo and passengers will be
transported safely, regardless of weather conditions.
   It now takes travelers four hours to cross the strait by ferry
boat on waters that claimed the lives of more than 1,100 passengers
in a 1954 accident. When rail service starts up March 13, the
journey time will be cut by half.
   Kakumoto, a former Japan National Railways official who has
observed work on the both the tunnel and bridge since the start,
claimed the system will never be cost effective.
   ``The longer that tunnel is used, the larger the deficit will
become,'' he said. ``If the ferries had been allowed to continue
service we could have gotten by with keeping the deficit at its
present level and still have met the needs of the locals.''
   But Taizo Omiya, an engineer from Aomori who spent 10 years
working on the main Seikan tunnel, said the project should be
backed as a national undertaking.
   ``Compared to the defense budget the cost of the tunnel is
minimal. ... If it brings prosperity to the region many people here
feel it should backed by the government.''
   Thirty-four laborers lost their lives in the 16 years it took to
build the tunnel.
   Shikoku Island residents, responding to recent survey, were
divided in their opinions on the Seto Bridge, the first of three
scheduled causeways to connect Shikoku with Honshu. While 45
percent were listed as saying the new bridge to would improve local
lifestyles and spur development, 44 percent replied they were
unsure or that they expected the effects to be detrimental.
   Residents said they feared an influx of tourists would cause
problems for their underdeveloped rail and road system.
   In Aomori, businessman-historian Masao Mizuta echoed the local
view that only politicians wanted Japan's famed ``shinkansen''
(bullet-train) line to extend up from Morioka in neighboring Iwate
Prefecture.
   ``Actually the people here are more concerned about how the
disappearance of the ferries, which have been the center of life in
Aomori, will effect the region,'' Takada said. ``Even if the
shinkansen comes through the only direct benefits will be some ski
slopes and golf courses.''
   Both the tunnel and the bridge were built to accommodate the
bullet train, and local officials insist that the new line will
spur economic development in the backward regions of Aomori,
Hokkaido and Shikoku.

<HEAD>Moscow Theater Makes a Splash in Munich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of Kremlin-imposed
restrictions on artists, Soviet drama director Genrietta Yanovskaya
finally knows she has the talent to please audiences abroad as well
as at home.
   ``The audiences here have been tremendous,'' Yanovskaya said
after her Moscow Youth Theater performed a long-banned work,
``Heart of a Dog,'' to sell-out Munich crowds.
   The audience was still shouting ``bravo'' and clapping
enthusiastically as Yanovskaya's cast made its seventh curtain call.
   Her troupe was one of six from the Soviet capital that performed
in the ``Moscow in Munich'' theater festival, whose West German
backers say reflects the sweeping Soviet reforms under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``At last we (Soviet artists) have an opportunity to do the
things we want to do, to do the things we dream about,'' Yanovskaya
said in a backstage interview.
   Her long-time artistic collaborator, scriptwriter Alexander
Chervinsky, agreed. ``Before Gorbachev, we (artists) were punished
very badly'' by severe creative restrictions, he said.
   Gorbachev's reforms have made it possible not only for Soviet
theaters to stage controversial works but for the six Moscow
theaters to bring their shows to Munich.
   The Jan. 14-Feb. 6 festival showcased works that two years ago
would have never made it past Soviet officials because they focus
on such topics as the repression of past Kremlin regimes.
   Yanovskaya's troupe of young thespians staged a play based on
Mikhail Bulgakov's 1925 novel, ``Heart of a Dog,'' with a script by
Chervinsky.
   At the start of the play, shabbily dressed actors and actresses
stand at the edge of the stage screaming in dramatized terror
because of political repression in the 1920s and showing mock pain
because of Moscovites' hunger at the time.
   The satirical novel, in which a dog is surgically transformed
into a brutish low-level Soviet official who turns on his creator,
was banned by Soviet authorities until 1987. The novel has been
widely read in the West.
   That same year, the 47-year-old Yanovskaya received permission
to stage Chervinsky's version of Bulgakov's novel. Muscovites
packed her theater in the Soviet capital to see the performances.
   ``When we first got approval to do this play in Moscow,
everybody had forgotten about our theater because nothing that was
permitted was what people wanted to see,'' said Yanovskaya, who has
been in professional theater since the 1960s. ``Not even the taxi
drivers knew their way to the theater. Now everyone in Moscow
knows.''
   But Yanovskaya says that because people in her country were for
years harshly restricted in what they could perform, write or
otherwise create, the Soviet reforms are putting artists to an
unexpected test.
   ``Glasnost gave us more freedom in choosing what to do. But that
does not mean we always know how to make the right artistic
decisions. This is a real challenge,'' she said in Russian, with
Chervinsky translating her remarks into English.
   West German theater producer Jochen Hahn thought up the idea for
the ``Moscow in Munich'' theater festival and flew to Moscow to try
to put it together.
   The Union of Theater Producers of the Soviet Union, an
unofficial organization founded in 1986, put up half the $1.4
million cost for the Munich festival, Hahn said. The remainder came
from West German federal and local government grants, as well as
private and corporate sources, he said.
   ``We were interested in how theater people are working with
glasnost and perestroika,'' Hahn said, referring to the Russian
words for, respectively, openness and restructuring.
   ``We watched about 30 plays (in Moscow), and were surprised
about the openness'' displayed by theaters in dealing with
controversial topics, he said.
   Hahn says he had no problem getting official approval for his
proposal, ``despite the nightmare rumors I had heard about the
Soviet Union. It was just the right moment (because of Gorbachev's
reforms) for this happen.''
   However, that's not to say that theaters have been given carte
blanche in what they can stage and in how they do it. Theaters are
still required to get permission from the authorities before going
on with a show.
   Theater professionals in the Soviet Union also would like the
opportunity to do more performances in the West.
   ``I would love to play in New York some day. I would like to see
how I would be received by audiences in still other parts of the
world,'' said one young Soviet actress who performed in Munich,
speaking on condition that her name not be mentioned.
   Yanovskaya says Bulgakov's ability to find comedy in the
bleakest of circumstances is a trait she and her colleagues also
relied on heavily in the pre-glasnost days.
   ``You should not be too serious about yourself in this world. To
make it, you have to understand comedy. Comedy is the only thing
that helped us (artists) to survive,'' she said.

<HEAD>`Last Tape' Is Not Last Call, German Actor Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The career of German stage great
Bernhard Minetti spans from the tumultuous days of the Weimar
Republic to a current round of accolades for his contribution to
the theater.
   He recently was made an honorary member of Frankfurt's
prestigous theater ensemble after receiving lengthy standing
ovations for his final performance in Samuel Beckett's classic
``Krapp's Last Tape,'' at the city playhouse.
   But the feisty, 83-year-old actor heatedly says he's not heading
towards his last curtain call.
   ``Why should I quit? I'm not sick,'' said Minetti, who is known
for his brusque manner and general dislike of talking to the news
media.
   Over the years, he has played some of the greatest roles theater
has to offer, always in his native German.
   His Shakespearean heroes have included Hamlet, Othello and Lear.
The actor's roles by German playwrights have included both
Mephistopheles and Faust in Goethe's ``Faust,'' Robespierre in
Buechner's ``Danton's Death'' and Wallenstein in Schiller's
``Wallenstein.''
   One of his favorite roles, the craggy-faced actor said in an
interview is King Lear. ``I would play Lear again any time,'' he
said, speaking in German.
   Another role he said he would play again is Krapp in ``Krapp's
Last Tape,'' which he has been performing in Frankfurt since last
October to enthusiastic reviews.
   Projects for 1988, he said, include starring in a play by German
playwright Gerhart Hauptmann in Berlin.
   ``If you want any other information, just read my book,'' he
said, his voice rising.
   Minetti wrote the 1985 book, ``Memoirs of an Actor,'' with the
help of Frankfurt city theater director Guenther Ruehle.
   ``Minetti is certainly one of our country's greatest actors,''
Ruehle said. ``He has a strong personality and presence, and brings
a wonderful intellectual energy into his work.''
   Minetti, who now lives in West Berlin, was a member of the
Frankfurt city theater ensemble from 1951 to 1956.
   Critics praise Minetti especially for leading roles he played as
an older man.
   ``The older he gets, the better he is,'' drama critic Georg
Hensel of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said.
``Minetti has impressed me most with his performances as King Lear,
Prospero and his work with the playwright Thomas Bernhard.''
   The actor is well known for his performances in works by
Austrian playwright Bernhard, who in 1976 wrote a play entitled
``Minetti _ A Portrait of the Artist as an Old Man'' in the actor's
honor. Minetti starred in the poignant story of a lonely old actor
and a little girl who visits him.
   ``I'm constantly being asked whether I'm the Minetti that Thomas
Bernhard created,'' Minetti writes in his 1985 memoirs. ``Large
portions of my life are not represented in Bernhard's plays. On the
other hand, Bernhard gets to the essence of my being as an actor.''
   Frankfurt's Neue Presse newspaper has called him West Germany's
``grand old actor.''
   Minetti's professional career began in 1927, when the
beleaguered Weimar Republic was trying to cope with mass
unemployment and severe inflation. But in 1933, Adolf Hitler took
power, destroying hopes of a democratic solution.
   Although Minetti has worked in many West German cities, he is
best known as a Berlin actor. He was a member of Berlin's Prussian
State Theater from 1930 to 1944, when World War II forced the
theater to close.
   Minetti recalls in his memoirs the day in 1934 when ensemble
members gathered to hear Gestapo head Hermann Goering appoint
renowned actor Gustav Gruendgens director of the Prussian State
Theater.
   ``Herr Gruendgens, you have been appointed to make this theater
the best one in Germany, and, with that, the world,'' Minetti
quoted Goering as saying.
   Minetti devotes several sections of his memoirs to Gruendgens,
whose experiences working for the Nazis were the basis of Klaus
Mann's novel, ``Mephisto.'' That novel formed the basis for the
1981 Academy Award-winning film starring Klaus Maria Brandauer.
   ``He (Gruendgens) certainly suffered from many things that he
couldn't change, politically, mentally and also ethically,''
Minetti wrote. ``I often said to myself, `he has a cross to bear.'''
   Minetti was not a Nazi sympathizer, he said. In a chapter called
``Questions of Conscience'' he writes of the problems artists had
trying to get through the period.
   Minetti starred in more than a dozen films during the Third
Reich, but is not primarily thought of as a film actor.
   Today, he occasionally participates in West Germany's peace
movement.
   ``The arms build-up goes against the duty to be humane,'' he
said. ``My desire to live and to act is still strong.''

<HEAD>Strange Twists and Turns In Springsteen's Tunnel Of Love Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge American flag has been replaced
with tapestries of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. And Bruce
Springsteen has shed his bandana and work boots for the less
proletarian look of a boardwalk carny in his first return to the
road since 1985.
   But appearance is the least of the unexpected twists and turns
provided by the rock star on his `Tunnel of Love Express Tour,''
the 22-city show that opened Feb. 25 at the Centrum in Worcester.
   ``It's good to see you again. I missed you,'' Springsteen told
the opening night crowd of 12,500 midway through a surprising first
set that opened with the band as patrons at a boardwalk Tunnel of
Love and Springsteen as their host.
   The opener bore little resemblance to the ``Born in the USA''
world tour shows, sharing only length (more than three hours) and
intensity with the performances which made Springsteen a mega-star.
   The 38-year-old New Jersey rocker, aided by a five-piece horn
section and the usual assortment of E Streeters, rearranged and
restructured virtually every song in the show _ from such
Springsteen classics as ``Born to Run'' to such new cuts as ``Spare
Parts.''
   After opening with the title cut from his ``Tunnel of Love'' LP,
Springsteen _ wearing black jeans, a loose-sleeved white dress
shirt and white vest _ befuddled the crowd with an assortment of
seldom-heard songs.
   Virtually ignoring his albums ``Nebraska,'' ``The River'' and
``Darkness on the Edge of Town,'' the Boss and his 12-piece band
played an assortment of B-sides, unreleased songs, cover tunes and
new material that eventually put the crowd in a frenzy.
   ``Be True,'' a B-side dating back to 1981, was the second song
of the show; another B-side, ``Roulette,'' was performed before the
hit ``Brilliant Disguise.''
   Eight songs from ``Tunnel of Love'' were featured; in
comparison, only two from ``Born to Run'' surfaced during the show.
   A pair of new songs were introduced: the rhythm and blues-styled
``I'm a Coward When It Comes to Love'' and a reggae-flavored ``Part
Man, Part Monkey.'' Both were key elements in the second set, which
closed with Springsteen and company's version of ``Light of Day'' _
the song he wrote that was performed by Joan Jett in the Paul
Schraeder film of the same title.
   A highlight of the second set was a rockabilly tune, ``You Can
Look (But You Better Not Touch),'' with Springsteen leading a
conga-line of bandmates across the stage while pianist Roy Bittan
pounded out a Jerry Lee Lewis riff.
   The first encore featured an acoustic reworking of ``Born to
Run'' with Springsteen solo on guitar and harmonica, followed by
revamped versions of ``Hungry Hearts'' and ``Glory Days''
emphasizing the horn section of Jersey bar band favorites LaBamba
and the Hubcaps.
   After breaking new ground throughout the first 2{ hours of the
show, Springsteen returned to old territory for the knockout punch
_ killer versions of ``Rosalita'' and the Mitch Ryder ``Detroit
Medley.''
   Both these former show closers had been discarded during the
last tour, which ran from 1984-5; Springsteen revived them and
added covers of the 1960s classics ``Sweet Soul Music'' and
``Shake'' for good measure.
   ``I forgot how much work this is,'' a smiling Springsteen told
the crowd during the final encore. Looking out at 25,000 raised
hands, he quickly added, ``It's fun, too.''

   The U.S. economy expanded at a 4.5 percent
annual rate from October through December, the fastest pace in
almost two years, the government said.
   The growth in the gross national product was revised Thursday up
from an original estimate of 4.2 percent made a month ago.
   Three-fourths of the growth last quarter came from a buildup of
business inventories which was occurring at the same time that
consumer spending was plunging 3.1 percent.

   Crude oil prices have dipped below $16 for the
first time since December, reflecting worries about overproduction
and higher inventories.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, contracts for
April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, closed at $15.92 per 42-gallon barrel, down 54 cents from
Wednesday.
   It was the first time the near-month crude contract closed below
$16 since Dec. 21, when it settled at $15.16.
   Among March contracts for refined products, wholesale heating
oil closed at 45.22 cents a gallon, down 1.18 cents from Wednesday,
while unleaded gasoline settled at 45.37 cents per gallon, 0.98
cent lower.
   Analysts said technical factors and a report showing
larger-than-expected U.S. inventories helped to send prices lower
Thursday.
   The catalyst of the decline was a federal Energy Information
Administration report, issued Wednesday night, that showed U.S.
crude inventories up by 8.5 million barrels last week, said William
Byers, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co.
   That figure, much greater than the 1.88 million-barrel increase
reported Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, a
Washington-based trade organization, shook the market, which was
already edgy over continuing reports of growing production and
inventories.
   The market's confidence was shaken further when the near-month
crude contract broke below $16.37 in early trading. That had been
viewed as an important support level on the, they said.
   Declining prices on the London oil market overnight also
contributed to the tone of Thursday's market in New York, said
Donald Morton, vice president for energy futures at the Boston
office of Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.
   ``Psychology in the market was already very weak, very
negative,'' he said. ``So it gave ground and just broke. It seemed
like everyone lined up on the sell side all day long.''
   But behind the recent trend lay one underlying cause, he said:
``There weren't any new rumors. There weren't any new reasons.
There weren't any new excuses. It was the same old reason:
oversupply.''

   Three years ago today, American tourists were
flaunting dollars in Paris and Tokyo while bargain-priced West
German cars rolled off arriving cargo ships.
   Feb. 26, 1985, marked the dollar's highest point of the 1980s _
a level that economists say will probably never be seen again.
   The strong dollar made Americans rich in the eyes of the world,
but contributed to a huge trade deficit and damage to American
industries unable to compete with a flood of inexpensive imports.
   Since then the dollar has lost roughly half its value against
the currencies of Japan, West Germany and some other trading
partners.
   Against the Japanese yen, for example, the dollar has fallen
from a little more than 260 yen to a little less than 130.
   The dollar has fallen less against the currencies of Canada,
South Korea and Taiwan, though, and is actually stronger now
against the currencies of Mexico and Brazil.
   The cheaper dollar has brought about an export boom and the
trade deficit has begun to shrink, although more slowly than almost
anyone had predicted.
   Meanwhile, the dollar has flattened out in recent months,
pinched between speculators who expect it to rebound and others who
say it has further to drop.
   The dollar's stability makes for boredom at the banks and
securities firms that specialize in trading currencies, where
volatility is crucial to lock in profits.
   ``This week has been about the deadest it's been,'' James
Hohorst, managing director for foreign exchange at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co., said Thursday.
   Currency traders are confident that the action will pick up,
though, because governments can't agree on the coordination of
economic policies that would allow for stable exchange rates.
   Hohorst, 33, recalls once worrying about whether to commit his
life to trading currencies because of the danger that governments
would agree on fixed exchange rates.
   ``But then I realized fixed exchange rates would depend on
responsible governments,'' he said. ``So I stopped worrying about
it.''

   Car bombs, corporate spies,
hijackings everywhere: The headlines are enough to make a
millionaire shake in his Guccis.
   They're also causing CEOs, sheiks and stars from Kenny Rogers to
Michael Jackson to seek out a host of high-tech security devices
that would turn 007's head.
   ``Are You Bugged?'' asks the poster at the front desk of CCS
Communication Control Inc., where specialties include briefcases
stuffed with telephone scramblers, wiretap detectors and ``bug
alerts'' disguised as watches.
   The shah of Iran once hired the company to build a limousine
with an ``Armageddon device'' to explode unless disarmed, a pop-out
motorcycle in the trunk and other James Bond-like features.
   The makers of ``Miami Vice'' have rented night-vision scopes,
debuggers and long-distance microphones and occasionally call up to
consult for the sake of realism, said Tom Salway, head of the CCS
Beverly Hills office.
   Salway is reluctant to discuss celebrity purchases in detail,
but he outlines a few: Singer Kenny Rogers stopped by for a
bulletproof briefcase, actor Roddy McDowall bought a disguised
tape-recording system and representatives of superstar eccentric
Michael Jackson often drop in.
   ``They're always checking up on what's available,'' he said.
   When the company began nearly two decades ago, it sold only a
few wiretap and hidden microphone detectors. Now about 300 products
are offered, Salway said.
   Among the items available for heads of state and corporations,
security forces, private eyes, gadget-lovers and the merely
paranoid:
   _``Supercars'' that spew tear gas and oil slicks. Occupants
breathe bottled oxygen, fire weapons through portholes in armor,
and navigate through smoke and the dark with an infrared system.
   _Letter bomb detectors, in case enemies use the mail.
   _More than a dozen bullet-resistant vests, shirts, coats and
jackets. Sales soared after recent reports of random freeway
shootings, Salway said.
   _Video cameras disguised in books, bamboo stalks and clocks.
   _A voice ``microtremor'' detector advertised as a portable lie
detector that ``can help determine ... if your friends are really
your friends.''
   Salway said insurance companies use it to help determine if
claimed losses are real.
   Producers for entertainer Joan Rivers' talk show approached CCS
about using the tremor detector to catch guests in lies, but she
was replaced as permanent host of the Fox Broadcasting Co. show
last May before she could.
   ``It would have been so much fun,'' Miss Rivers said recently.
``It would have been the kind of thing I do.''
   But most seek out high-tech security for deadly serious reasons.
   ``Probably there's been more corporate interest in
anti-terrorism in the last year or two than there has been in the
25 years I have been in the business,'' said Philip W. Little,
president of West Coast Detectives.
   Little, a former sheriff's deputy who opened his own private-eye
business in 1971 and bought West Coast Detectives in 1977, says
West Coast doubled in size in 1986 and grew substantially in 1987.
``And it's all related to anti-terrorism.''
   He tells stars and chief executive officers that terrorist
groups have moved from the Mideast and Europe to Latin America, and
the United States is the next stop.
   Little said clients include ``television and movie studios, oil,
finance, electronics, aerospace, every manufacturing concern you
can imagine.''
   West Coast Detective's anti-terrorist division tries to do for
private companies and people what the Secret Service does for the
president, Little said. Many clients are Americans traveling abroad.
   In Southern California, protecting the homes of high-profile
business people and entertainers, especially those with children,
is a major part of the business.
   ``They have such a high profile that they feel they must take
action _ they know you or anyone can find out where they are if you
want to,'' Little said.
   Infrared cameras that see in the dark, alarms throughout the
house, and ``panic buttons'' in the bedroom are part of a typical
setup. Perimeters of celebrity properties typically have visible
but well-dressed guards.
   ``Very professional, an executive look,'' Little said. ``So you
don't create fear in the minds of children or a wife _ you don't
want to so overdo the threat that you create paranoia.''
   Little and Salway said many corporate chiefs are worried more by
devious employees or snoopers from the competition or the
government than by terrorism.
   Bug-detector business boomed after the arrest of stock
speculator Ivan Boesky in the Wall Street insider trading scandal
and reports that Boesky, cooperating with investigators, had
allowed his business conversations to be recorded, Salway said.

<HEAD>Bank of New York Closing In On Irving, But Battle Not Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New York Co. has tightened the noose
around Irving Bank Corp., winning government approval to proceed
with its $1.08 billion hostile bid and moving to oust the rival's
directors if they don't capitulate.
   The Federal Reserve Board and New York State Banking Board
concluded Thursday that a shotgun marriage of the two large New
York banks wouldn't hurt competition in the nation's biggest
financial center.
   The approvals were significant because they could signal more
hostile takeover attempts of banks, which have been rare.
   Irving officials could not be reached Thursday night, but
earlier they vowed to fight the takeover regardless of the
government's decision. Though Irving's defenses have shrunk, the
battle is expected to intensify.
   After a meeting that lasted well into Thursday night, the Fed's
governors unanimously sanctioned the Bank of New York's takeover
attempt in a 58-page order.
   While noting the difference between friendly and hostile
takeovers, the central bank said federal law ``does not draw any
distinction between acquisitions that are agreed to between the
parties and those where, as here, there is no agreement.''
   As a condition, however, the Fed requested the Bank of New York
to finance the $264 million cash portion of the proposed takeover
by selling additional stock, partly because of concerns that such a
depletion of capital would weaken it financially.
   Bank of New York executives, who have been maneuvering to
acquire Irving for months, expressed delight with the Fed's
approval and said they were confident the condition could be met.
   ``We intend to proceed with our offer as expeditiously as
possible,'' said Owen Brady, a Bank of New York spokesman. ``We
again invite the board of directors of Irving to reconsider their
position, sit down and talk to us, and discuss ways in which the
transaction can be concluded on a negotiated basis.''
   The Bank of New York also said that as an Irving shareholder
with an approximate 4.83 percent stake, it would nominate 16 people
for election to Irving's board at the annual shareholders meeting
April 21. The move was seen as another strategy to pressure Irving
into agreeing to a takeover.
   Earlier Thursday, the Bank of New York won approval from the
state banking board, which regulates many of the nation's biggest
banks.
   Jill M. Considine, board superintendent, said a combination of
the two banks met all state requirements, wouldn't hurt competition
and would benefit the public with a wider range of services.
   Such a merger would create the nation's 12th largest bank
holding company, with assets totaling around $41.7 billion.
   Despite Bank of New York's successes Thursday, analysts said it
still faced a battle for control of Irving.
   ``There's no reason to think they could strike a deal with Bank
of New York. Chances are slim,'' said Rosemarie Conforte, a banking
analyst with Moody's Investors Service. ``Their goal is to remain
independent or maybe combine with somebody else they feel makes
more sense, although I don't know who that is.''
   Shareholders of both banks would have to approve the merger, and
Bank of New York shareholders might react unhappily at the prospect
of an additional stock issue that could dilute the value of their
holdings.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Irving
stock jumped $3 a share to $53.50. Bank of New York fell 12{ cents
to $29.50.
   In an effort to bolster its takeover defenses and place stock in
friendly hands, Irving announced Tuesday that 15 investors were
issued $100.1 million worth of cumulative convertible preferred
stock, which have expanded voting rights and other entitlements
that could foil a hostile bid.
   Earlier this month, Irving's board rejected as inadequate Bank
of New York's revised offer to pay $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of
its own stock for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 million common
shares outstanding. That amounts to about $60 per share, or $1.08
billion.
   Bank of New York initially offered to pay $80 in cash and
securities for Irving last September. It reduced the offer twice
after the October stock market crash.

<TEXT>
   Gasoline retailer Getty Petroleum Corp., cousin
of a Texaco Inc. takeover four years ago that later would bring
Texaco to its knees, has now joined the contest for buying chunks
of the troubled oil giant.
   Getty announced Thursday that it has bought $14 million worth of
Texaco shares and is seeking government permission to acquire more.
   The Jericho, N.Y.-based company, born of Texaco's 1984 takeover
of Getty Oil Co., said it would ask the Federal Trade Commission to
let it buy more than $15 million of Texaco's stock, in accordance
with government regulations.
   Getty is the third party holding _ or in the process of lining
up _ a large block of Texaco stock. But analysts said Getty was not
large enough to harbor any notions of swallowing Texaco.
   Rosario Ilacqua, an industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc., said ``$15 million is peanuts'' when it takes
$42 million to buy roughtly 1 million of Texaco's 243 million
shares.
   He suggested Getty might be hoping to make money on its stock,
or perhaps negotiate its holding into some Texaco assets in the
future _ either with the company or some other party or parties.
   George Friesen, who watches oil companies for the Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. securities firm, also held that view.
   ``I suspect we'll have a number of smaller predators circling
the prey and relying on the bigger predators to do the job for
them,'' he said. ``I can't imagine Getty becoming a big player.''
   Last Friday, T. Boone Pickens, a takeover strategist who
controls Mesa Limited Partnership, an oil and gas concern, also
expressed interest in buying Texaco shares. He joined fellow raider
Carl C. Icahn, Texaco's biggest shareholder.
   Getty spokesman Stephen Salzman said that his company had not
been in contact with either Icahn or Pickens and was unwilling to
say if it would join Icahn's effort to gain a greater voice in
running Texaco.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, Texaco
stock stood at at $42.87{ per share, up 62{ cents.
   ``We believe that Texaco is an excellent company which is
substantially undervalued,'' Leo Leibowitz, Getty's president, said
in a statement. ``We are purchasing shares of Texaco for investment
purchases at this time.''
   Getty is one of the nation's largest independent marketers of
gasoline and refined products, doing business in 11 states in the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Getty was known as Power Test
Corp. until January 1985, when it acquired Getty Oil's retail
operation and the Getty name.
   Getty's interest in Texaco coincides with Texaco's effort to
exit the refuge of federal bankruptcy court, sought nearly a year
ago because of a $10.53 billion judgment held against it by
Pennzoil Co.
   The judgment stemmed from a Houston jury's ruling that Texaco
had illegally interfered with move by Pennzoil to acquire Getty Oil
and bought Getty itself.
   In December, Texaco agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion in cash to
settle the dispute as part of an overall plan to reorganize and
emerge from bankruptcy.
   Shareholders are voting whether to approve that plan, with the
results due to be announced at a March 22 hearing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., Texaco's corporate home.

   The judge who heard the
Pennzoil-Texaco case is listed in an attorney's directory as having
a law degree, but the judge only has an undergraduate degree.
   Solomon Casseb Jr., 72, a prominent San Antonio attorney,
garnered national renown after presiding over the controversial
$10.53 billion judgment that a Houston jury ordered Texaco to pay
Pennzoil in 1985, the biggest civil damage award in history.
   Casseb does not have a law degree, although the authoritative
102-year-old Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory lists Casseb as
having a law degree from the University of Texas.
   It is legal to practice law or sit on the bench in Texas without
having a law degree because during an earlier era it was possible
to pass the Texas bar exam and become a licensed atorney without
having graduated law school.
   Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the State Bar of Texas, said
that Casseb was a member in good standing.
   ``We have absolutely no reason at all to say anything is wrong
at this point,'' Fitzgerald said. ``As far as State Bar of Texas is
concerned, the man is a licensed attorney, passed the law exam and
never had a grievance against him.''
   Richard Pizzi, a spokesman for Martindale-Hubbell, said Thursday
that the company has two Casseb application forms on microfiche,
one from 1938 and the other from 1974. The original application
forms for inclusion in the directory were destroyed years ago,
Pizzi said.
   Pizzi said the 1974 application form is illegible, but the 1938
form listed Casseb as receiving a bachelor of arts degree from St.
Mary's in 1936 and a ``bachelor of law'' degree from UT in 1938.
   The application has Casseb's name typed in the signature line,
but it is not signed, Pizzi said.
   ``We don't require a signature and we don't require a
certification. We rely on the representation of the attorney,''
Pizzi said. ``About the law degree, I don't know if he said it, but
whoever filled in the form said it.''
   Records show that Casseb attended St. Mary's University in San
Antonio as an undergraduate pre-law student from 1932 to 1935, said
registrar spokeswoman Helen Garza.
   Casseb then went to the University of Texas at Austin Law School
for three years, but did not receive a degree, Dean Susana Aleman
said.
   Instead, Casseb applied his law school credit to his bachelor of
arts degree, which he received from St. Mary's in 1938.
   Casseb was hearing a civil case in Laredo on Thursday and did
not return telephone calls to The Associated Press. Attorneys for
Texaco and Pennzoil also did not return calls.

<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union is
stepping up pressure aimed at discouraging Chrysler Corp. from
selling its $1 billion Acustar Inc. parts-making arm.
   More than 1,000 angry workers gathered outside Chrysler
headquarters in below-freezing temperatures Thursday chanting
``Strike! Strike!'' to protest the proposed sale of the
28,000-worker subsidiary, which represents nearly a fifth of
Chrysler's worldwide operations.
   ``You do whatever you need to do _ and you know what to do,''
UAW Vice President Marc Stepp told the demonstrators, which
followed a special meeting of the 140-delegate Chrysler bargaining
council representing the company's 49 UAW locals.
   Although the union can't legally call a national strike against
Chrysler over Acustar, Stepp said he will give local UAW unions
permission to strike on a plant-by-plant basis over unresolved
issues such as health-and-safety grievances.
   A series of local strikes at key Chrysler plants could shut down
the company nationwide just as easily.
   At least seven Chrysler locals have voted to seek strike
authorization and one, a key 4,000-worker stamping plant in
Sterling Heights, should receive authorization as early as next
week, Stepp predicted.
   Acustar, which has plants in Mexico and Canada as well as the
United States, represents nearly a fifth of Chrysler's worldwide
operations, already the leanest among the Big Three U.S. automakers.
   Chrysler has said it may sell Acustar because it doesn't want to
invest in the research needed to upgrade some operations. Chrysler
already buys 70 percent of its parts elsewhere.
   ``The potential sale of Acustar would generate funds for future
investments but the primary reason we would sell Acustar is
because, long-term, we want to concentrate our resources on new
product and powertrains rather than components,'' the company said
in a statement.
   ``Acustar's best chance to progress may be to operate as an
independent company free to pursue business opportunities beyond
Chrysler,'' the statement said.
   Workers say they are angry at the possible sale because they
made concessions and helped Chairman Lee Iacocca win loan
guarantees from the federal government to rescue the company from
the verge of bankruptcy at the beginning of the decade.

<HEAD>U.S. Bank Investigators Cut Short Swiss Trip As Row Flares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four U.S. Congressional bank
investigators cut short a trip to Switzerland after being warned
that some of their alleged activity could constitute economic
espionage, Swiss authorities said Friday.
   Switzerland had allowed the staffers from the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce to hold talks earlier this month with
authorities and banks about Swiss rules on judicial assistance and
insider trading probes, foreign ministry official Alexei Lautenberg
said.
   The visit followed signing of a Swiss-U.S. agreement designed to
speed up cooperation in such cases last November. The committee
oversees the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Several days into the visit, a Geneva bank alerted Swiss
authorities that the U.S. investigators allegedly overstepped their
mandate, demanding details on a possible Swiss link to a major
insider trading case involving Wall Street dealer Dennis Levine,
Lautenberg said.
   He said authorities warned the Congress staffers about Swiss
laws on economic espionage and banking secrecy and told them a
Swiss official would accompany them for their remaining interviews.
Thereupon the U.S. investigators left abruptly.
   Switzerland's ambassador in Washington, Klaus Jacobi, meanwhile
has tried to smooth the affair in talks with Rep. John Dingell, a
Michigan Democrat who heads the committee.
   Bern and Washington had lengthy diplomatic rows over exchange of
information in the Dennis Levine case and another U.S. probe in the
early 1980s involving Marc Rich, a commodities trader now based in
Switzerland.

<HEAD>EEC Consumer Prices Up 0.2 Percent in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices in the 12 nations of
the European Economic Community edged up on average 0.2 percent in
January from December and 3 percent from the year-earlier month,
the EEC statistical office Eurostat reported Friday.
   The EEC's year-to-year inflation rate of 3 percent in January
compares with 3.2 percent in December.
   Eurostat said the steepest price increases were recorded in
Italy (0.5 percent), Denmark (0.5 percent), Spain (0.6 percent) and
Portugal (1 percent).
   West Germany, France and Luxembourg reported moderate increases
of 0.2 percent or less, while prices in Britain remained unchanged.
   According to Eurostat, January prices declined in three
countries, including the Netherlands (0.8 percent), Belgium (0.1
percent) and Greece (0.2 percent).
   The EEC price index weighs the proportion of each country in the
total consumption, and does not necessarily coincide with inflation
figures from individual member states.

   Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in January as
the year began with a moderate dose of inflation, the government
reported today. Higher grocery prices partially offset declines in
energy costs.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was
equivalant to an annual rate of inflation of 4.2 percent, compared
to the 4.4 percent rise for all of 1987.
   Last month's increase was larger than the 0.2 percent rise in
December and matched November's 0.3 percent rise. December's
increase was revised from the previously reported 0.1 percent.
   Pacing the January increase were widespread gains across a range
of goods and services. Energy prices, however, supplied a major
dampening on the overall rate by plunging 0.7 percent after a 0.8
percent drop in the preceding month.
   Gasoline prices fell 1.6 percent; heating oil costs were down
0.8 percent. The price of natural gas and electricity, combined,
fell 0.3 percent.
   Food prices rose 0.3 percent, down from December's 0.6 percent
gain. Pacing last month's rise were jumps in prices for poultry,
eggs and bakery products. Meat, fruit and vegetable prices declined.
   Subtracting the usually volative food and energy categories,
consumer prices for all other goods and services rose a sharp 0.5
percent in January after a 0.2 percent increase in December.
   January's report underscored forecasts by many analysts that any
significant change in the inflation rate was unlikely this year.
   ``The underlying rate of inflation looks to be 3 percent to 4
percent,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Company
Economic Advisers. ``The question mark is on the energy price
side.''
   The Reagan administration has predicted an inflation rate of 4.3
percent this year.
   Energy prices, which tumbled in 1986, partially rebounded
through 1987. But more recently oil prices again have been falling,
recently dipping below $17-a-barrel on the spot market from the
$18-a-barrel prices that prevailed in December and from prices of
around $19 a barrel in November.
   While petroleum prices have fallen recently, anlaysts also said
they expected to see a rise in natural gas costs.
   ``Energy prices may continue to soften through late spring,
providing continuing offsets to food prices, which are expected to
remain on an upward path,'' said Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State
University economist who specializes in prices.
   Supply shortages and weather and crop infestation problems,
particularly in California and Arizona, have pushed up food prices
in recent months. After climbing through the fall, fruit and
vegetable prices fell 0.4 percent last month.
   Beef prices were down 1.4 percent while pork priced declined 0.5
percent. Poultry prices, however, climbed 1.0 percent, their first
increase since August. Cereal and bakery product prices rose 1.1
percent.
   Overall, grocery prices were up 0.2 percent while restaurant
meal costs climbed 0.3 percent.
   The Labor Department gave these other specifics of January price
behavior.
   _New automobile prices were down 0.2 percent; used automobile
prices fell 0.1 percent.
   _Housing expenses were up 0.4 percent.
   _Apparel costs gained 0.1 percent.
   _Medical care expenses rose 0.8 percent, its largest increase in
two years.
   _Entertainment costs gained 0.9 percent.
   January's increase left the CPI at 115.7, meaning that a
selection of goods and services that cost $100 during a 1982-84
base period cost would have $115.70 last month.
   The department recently abandoned a 1967 base period in favor of
the 1982 standard. Under that base period, a selection of goods and
services costing $100 in that year would have cost $346.70 last
month.
   Using either base number, the gain from January 1986 would have
been $1.56.
   The overall index is not adjusted for seasonal variations; other
figures in the report are.
   The major source of inflation in the months ahead likely is to
come from higher import prices resulting from declines in the
foreign exchange value of the dollar.
   The dollar is now worth only half of its 1985-value against
Japanese and key European currencies. These exchange rate changes
have begun to show up in the form of higher import prices for a
wide variety of goods. At the same time, U.S. items are becoming
less expensive abroad.
   The weaker dollar is expected to help trim the nation's huge
trade deficit, although higher priced foreign goods might be the
price Americans will have to pay for more trade balance.
   Still, ``there is too much slack in the U.S. economy and too
much slack in the world economy'' to worry about steep inflation as
a result of higher import prices, said Jay Goldinger, chief
economist for Capital Insight, a Los Angeles bond brokerage.
   Many economists say this slackness is illustrated by a recent
slowdown in consumer spending _ a slowdown that will keep
inflationary pressures at a minimum. Consumer spending dropped 3.1
percent in the fourth quarter of 1987, the steepest plunge in more
than seven years, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday.
   While most private economists deem a major bout of new inflation
unlikely, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested
earlier this week that chances of a resurging inflation and of a
recession are now roughly equal.
   The companion producer price index, which only includes
domestically produced items and does not cover imports or services,
showed a 0.4 percent rise in wholesale prices in January.

<HEAD>Volcker Says Tax Increase May Be `Best Medicine' For Economic Woes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``broad-scale consumption tax of
some sort'' may be the best medicine for the nation's economic
woes, former Federal Reserve Board head Paul Volcker says.
   ``I don't think we are approaching Doomsday,'' he said, speaking
Thursday before a seminar held by the National Association of
Industrial and Office Parks. ``I do not think we face inevitable
recession or inevitable inflation or a combination of the two.''
   ``I think we are in control of our destiny, but I don't think we
can take the future for granted,'' he said.
   New York stock traders blamed Volcker's remarks for helping kill
a morning stock rally Thursday, although he has publicly advocated
tax increases before.
   To alleviate the nation's trade deficit, foreign debts and
declining dollar, Volcker said, ``We need to start with the federal
budget deficit.''
   ``I think there's some amount of wishful thinking about the
budget deficit,'' he said. ``I'd like to think we can solve it all
by a little spending restraint, but I don't think that's possible.
   ``Certain elements of spending are going to increase, and you
know it,'' he said.
   A combination of spending cuts and tax increases are needed to
cure the deficit, he said.
   The newly reformed income tax structure should be left alone and
``given a chance to work,'' Volcker said. Instead, he recommended a
``consumption tax'' to raise revenue.
   As an example, Volcker cited ``a very sizeable increase in the
gasoline tax, which by world standards is relatively low. Is it
really so impossible to add 10 or 15 cents to the gasoline tax?''
   ``I do not think this problem is insoluble,'' Volcker said of
the budget deficit. ``I think it's quite readily soluble.''
   At a press conference after his speech, Volcker said the
``political pressure'' of this year's presidential campaign is
discouraging a meaningful discussion on the nation's large budget
and trade deficits.
   ``The tendency in democracies is to wait for a crisis,'' Volcker
said in his speech. ``It is terribly important that we put a sense
of reality in this situation and ... get this issue before the
American public in a way that the political campaign does not
undermine.''
   Both the federal government and American businesses must wean
themselves away from their dependence on foreign capital, Volcker
said.
   ``People are not going to lend us money indefinitely to finance
the deficit,'' he said.

<HEAD>EEC Authorizes Spain to Curtail Japanese Car, Truck Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community said
Friday it has authorized Spain to cut the imports of Japanese cars
and trucks to 2,000 units through much of this year.
   The EEC executive Commission, which granted the authorization,
said the move was needed to protect Spain's fledgling car industry
from non-Community imports coming largely from Japan.
   Citing Spanish figures, the Commission said car and truck
imports to Spain rose to nearly 400,000 units in 1987 from 70,190
in 1985, an increase of over 435 percent. Of the 1987 total, 11,582
cars and trucks were imported from non-Community countries.
   In Spain, the share of domestically produced cars fell to 64.8
percent from 89.4 percent over the same three-year perid, the
Commission said.
   Separately, Willy De Clercq, the top EEC trade official, said
the Commission wants to conclude an agreement with Japan to hold
imports, mainly cars, to around 10 percent of the Community market.
   He said in a speech to French businessmen in Lille Thursday that
Japan sold 1.18 million cars in the EEC last year. This represents
about 11 percent of the European car market.
   De Clercq said the arrangements would be ``transitional'' to
give the Community's car industry time to restructure.
   The Commission has been under pressure from automakers to impose
EEC-wide limits on Japanese car sales following a surge in the
imports in the first five months of 1987.
   The EEC car industry has also expressed fear that the
Community's plan to abolish all internal borders and create one
integrated market by 1992 will lead to a flood of Japanese imports.
   Japanese car imports are currently subject to a variety of
national rules ranging from no restrictions in West Germany to
strict numerical limitations in Italy and Spain.
   Any national curbs, however, must be approved by the EEC
Commission.
   In his speech, De Clercq urged Japan to open its market to
European car exports in order to boost Europeans' market share to 5
percent from its current level of 2.7 percent.
   He said EEC car makers sold 87,000 vehicles in Japan last year.
   A Commission official, who declined to be identified, said there
are no negotiations under way at present on limiting car imports.
``There are continuing contacts, however,'' the official said.

<TEXT>
   Now that more and more people are investing on
an international scale, many Wall Streeters these days are teaching
themselves to think in foreign currencies.
   The exercise is relatively simple, nothing like having to learn
a whole new language. And it seems a logical way to try to
understand what has motivated foreign investors operating in this
country in the recent past, and what they might do in the future.
   The dollar, of course, has taken a drastic drop since the
mid-1980s against important foreign currencies.
   In early 1985, a dollar could be exchanged for more than 250
Japanese yen. Recently, it was worth about 129 yen. Similarly, the
exchange rate has fallen from more than 3 West German marks per
dollar to about 1.7.
   To understand the kind of impact such wide swings can have on
financial decisions and distort the way they are perceived, Burton
Siegel, chief investment officer at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
speaks of the ``Dave Righetti effect.''
   As followers of the sports pages know, Righetti is a standout
pitcher for the New York Yankees who was offered, and decided not
to accept, a deal to play in Japan under a two-year contract that
would pay him something on the order of $10 million.
   Even in these days of boxcar-number sports salaries, the figure
was regarded as mindboggling.
   But as Siegel points out: ``In currency-adjusted terms, the
offer was handsome, but not quite as expensive to the Japanese as
it first appears. Indeed, when adjusted for the yen-dollar
relationship, the proposal was in line with salaries being paid to
top players in the United States.
   ``The same analyses can be applied to recent auctions of fine
art in which Japanese and Euopean collectors-investors bid up
dollar prices.''
   What does all this mean for other businesses and the stock and
bond markets?
   If the dollar is going to keep dropping in foreign exchange, it
would be a negative for foreign investors, reducing or eliminating
the return they realize from investments denominated in dollars.
   But if the dollar is perceived as fundamentally cheap, the story
could well be very different.
   Says Siegel: ``Foreign corporations may be especially attracted
to the opportunity to acquire existing U.S.-based operating assets.
This avoids the delay of starting from scratch and can sometimes be
done at lower cost.
   ``This may be especially appealing to foreign companies
interested in handling U.S.-produced goods through their own
international distribution systems.
   ``Foreign companies anxious to increase or maintain their market
share in the U.S. may also be attracted to the ability to produce
in the now cost-competitive U.S.''
   Thinking in yen or marks yields another interesting point: When
stated in those currencies, Standard & Poor's 500-stock composite
index is now substantially below where it stood at the beginning of
1985.
   Thus, from a foreign investors' viewpoint, Wall Street has been
experiencing a bear market for more than three years.
   There is a danger in carrying this kind of analysis too far. To
illustrate that, Greg Smith, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, recently suggested a remedy if a friend or relative
remarks that you seem to have put on weight lately: ``Tell them
that in yen, you have actually lost five pounds.''

   The stock market edged upward today, steadying
after Thursday's late selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.65 to 2,021.22 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 602 up, 459 down and
432 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.32 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said many traders were disappointed at the market's
inability to surpass its early-January highs, as measured by the
Dow Jones industrial average.
   The average seemed to be headed for into new-high territory for
the year Thursday morning, but the advance gave way to selling.
   While evidence continues to accumulate that the economy hasn't
yet suffered any severe effects from last fall's market crash,
brokers say confidence remains fragile.
   The Labor Department's report this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.3 percent in January was in line with advance
estimates, and had little evidence impact on the market.
   Federated Department Stores rose 1} to 64~ on news that the
company, which has been fighting a takeover bid by Campeau Corp. of
Toronto, was negotiating with Campeau on a proposed purchase at $68
a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .30 to 147.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .05 at 283.34.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average, up about 27 points
at its midsession high, closed with a 22.38 loss at 2,017.57.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 689 up, 802 down and 473 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 213.49 million shares, against 212.73 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Life Insurance Sales Increase 11 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New sales of life insurance increased
11 percent in 1987 to $11 billion, representing an improvement over
1986 but short of the other gains in the early 1980s, an industry
group said.
   The Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association, based
here, said Thursday that $9.8 billion in new life insurance
policies were purchased in 1986.
   By contrast, new sales of life insurance grew 25 percent in 1983
and 15 percent in 1985, according to the trade assication, with 596
member companies around the world.
   ``1987 was a challenging year for sure, but the industry as a
whole maintained a strong, steady growth pattern despite tremendous
economic uncertainty,'' said Ronald A. Bishop, the association's
chairman and vice chairman of National Life Insurance Co. in
Montpelier, Vt.
   The premium figures include only 10 percent of the money paid
for single-premium life insurance, which is bought with a large
lump sum, often $20,000 of more.
   The association says that to include the total amounts paid for
those products, which are relatively new, would skew the statistics.

<HEAD>Stronger Economic Expansion Doesn't Impress Wall Street</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with 10 new grafs with January consumer prices, spending
and personal income. Picks up 3rd graf pvs bgng, The Dow Jones ...</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in January, matching 0.3
percent increases in American's personal incomes and consumer
spending for the same month, the government reported today.
   The rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was
larger than the 0.2 percent rise in December and matched November's
0.3 percent rise. The gain in December was revised from the
previously reported 0.1 percent.
   Pacing the January increase in consumer prices were widespread
gains across a range of goods and services, including a 0.3 percent
gain in food prices.
   Energy prices, however, fell 0.7 percent after a 0.8 percent
drop in the preceding month, the report said.
   The overall increase in January prices was equivalent to an
annual rate of inflation of 4.2 percent, compared with the 4.4
percent rise for all of 1987.
   The January gains reported by the Commerce Department in
personal income and consumer spending were less than half the gains
posted in December.
   The department said the 0.3 percent seasonally adjusted increase
in incomes followed a 0.7 percent rise in December and was the
slowest income gain since a 0.4 percent decline in November.
   The 0.3 percent rise in spending represented a slowdown from a
0.7 percent December advance. Spending had risen 0.5 percent in
November after falling 0.7 percent in October, reflecting a decline
in auto purchases that month.
   The reports came a day after the government reported that
economic expansion at the end of 1987 reached the fastest level in
almost two years.
   The Commerce Department's announcement Thursday that the economy
grew at a 4.5 percent annual rate in the last three months of last
year initially rallied Wall Street but stocks later fell sharply.
Bond prices and the dollar also fell.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 27 points at
its midsession high, closed with a 22.38-point loss at 2,017.57,
most of it in the last hour of trading.
   ``There is a considerable amount of confusion in the financial
markets'' about the strength of the economy, said Jack Barbanel,
senior vice president at Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   The growth in the gross national product, the broadest measure
of the economy, was revised up from an original estimate of 4.2
percent made a month ago.
   The Reagan administration said the growth rate showed the
economic recovery, now in its sixth year, a record for peacetime,
was suffering no ill effects from the October stock market
collapse. However, private economists said they were still
concerned about the one-sided nature of the growth.
   The rapid expansion in the fourth quarter occured without a
pickup in inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an
annual rate of 3.7 percent from October through December, little
changed from a 3.4 percent increase in the third quarter.
   Three-fourths of the growth last quarter came from a buildup of
business inventories, occurring at the same time that consumer
spending was plunging 3.1 percent, the biggest spending drop in
more than seven years.
   The last such sharp drop in consumer spending occurred in 1980
during the recession that year which helped doom President Jimmy
Carter's re-election bid.
   Some analysts said the revisions made in the new GNP report made
them more confident that a recession can be avoided. Others said
they were encouraged because the report showed that consumer
spending, while falling sharply, was not as weak as previously
believed. The report also increased the estimate of business
investment spending, another area of expected strength.
   The fourth-quarter gain boosted growth for the year to 3.9
percent, when measured from the end of 1986, up slightly from the
3.8 percent estimate made a month ago. Growth when all four
quarters of the year are averaged together showed a 2.9 percent
increase in 1987, the same as 1986.

<HEAD>Union: Strike By Flight Attendants Imminent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines and its flight
attendants are on a ``collision course'' and a strike by the
attendants appears to be imminent, according to a Teamsters union
official.
   Several dozen flight attendants demonstrated Thursday night
outside the Eagan, Minn., home of Northwest Chief Executive Officer
Steven Rothmeier. The home was watched by private guards and Eagan
police.
   ``Mr. Rothmeier has been traveling around the circuit all of
this week, visiting all of our flight attendant bases; we thought
it was only polite to return the favor,'' flight attendant Dottie
Malinski told WCCO-TV.
   It was not known if Rothmeier was home at the time.
   Talks continued Thursday as flight attendants prepared to walk
off their jobs at 11:01 CST tonight.
   ``There's a 100 percent chance of a strike,'' William Genoese,
director of the Teamsters' airline division, said at a morning news
conference Thursday. ``As far as I'm concerned we're on a collision
course with Northwest Airlines to strike.''
   But Redmond Tyler, a spokesman for the airline, said progress
was being made on some of the major contract issues. The two sides
have been meeting steadily since Tuesday at Northwest's
headquarters in Eagan with the assistance of a federal mediator,
Tyler said Thursday.
   Seniority wage scales, pensions and work rules are among the
major issues in the dispute. Former Republic Airlines flight
attendants have been working under their old contract since
Northwest acquired Republic in 1986. The company is trying to bring
the workers under one contract.
   ``We believe we're making substantial progress at the bargaining
table,'' Tyler said. ``We're not Jimmy the Greek, but we continue
to believe that we will get this resolved without a strike.''
   Flight attendants have voted overwhelmingly to strike if a
contract agreement isn't reached by the 11 p.m. CST deadline. The
national president of the International Association of Machinists
has vowed his union's support, but the telegram that contains the
message stops short of saying machinists would honor picket lines.
   Officials at national and local IAM offices did not return a
reporter's phone calls Thursday.
   Tyler said the machinists are under a contract that forbids them
to strike in sympathy with another union. ``We expect our
machinists to honor their contract,'' he said.
   Pilots are barred from sympathy strikes under provisions of the
Railway Labor Act, Tyler said.
   Asked if those workers would be locked out if they walk off
their jobs in sympathy with the flight attendants, Tyler said, ``We
won't address that because we don't want to play that `what if?'
game.''
   Genoese said flight attendants would have the full backing of
the international Teamsters, which could result in delays of supply
shipments from truckers.
   ``We're putting all our power together in the next 24 hours,''
Genoese said. ``We would like to put them (Northwest) at 10 to 20
percent'' of operations if there is a strike.
   Genoese said he is hopeful that pilots would honor picket lines,
but Jim Halverson of the Air Line Pilots Association said pilots
would not decide until today.
   Tyler said the airline is armed with about 2,000 management
workers who are certified as flight attendants to step in if the
6,700 union flight attendants strike.
   The machinists union represents about 20,000 airline mechanics,
baggage handlers, aircraft cleaners, ticket and reservation agents
and clerical workers at Northwest.
   Genoese said Thursday the Teamsters are researching the
possibilities of an employee-led leveraged buyout of Northwest and
other airlines to protect the long-term interests of workers.
   He said his union has talked with Salomon Brothers Inc. and
other Wall Street investment firms to consider financing
arrangements. However, Robert Salomon, managing director and chief
spokesman of the firm, said he is unaware of any contact between
the Teamsters and his company on the issue.
   Genoese said discussions of a possible leveraged buyout of
Northwest could help the bargaining position of flight attendants,
but he said the talk was not a ploy.

   Soybean futures prices retreated and grain

Chicago Board of Trade.
   Follow-through selling from Thursday pressured the markets,
while a flurry of buying by big professional traders helped offset
losses, analysts said.
   Continued heavy rains in Brazil, which have eased dry,
crop-threatening conditions, and other outside factors added a

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. hopes to add passenger cars to the
line of Jeeps it already produces in China, a top official of the
automaker said Friday.
   Gerald Greenwald, head of the Chrysler Motors division of
Chrysler Corp., said in an interview that his company was
negotiating with First Automotive Works of Changchun, in northeast
China, to produce upscale autos for use as official cars and taxis.
   First Automotive hopes to begin construction by the end of the
year on a plant that initially would produce 30,000 cars a year,
with potential capacity of 150,000, Greenwald said.
   If successful, Chrysler would be the first American automaker to
set up passsenger car production in China, and the third foreign
company. Peugeot has a small joint venture in Canton, and
Volkswagen produces about 10,000 vehicles a year at its Shanghai
plant.
   China produced about 400,000 motor vehicles last year, almost
all trucks and buses. Only about 20,000 passenger cars were built.
   Chrysler inherited a stake in China last year when it took over
American Motors Corp., which produces Cherokee Jeeps as part of a
joint venture known as Beijing Jeep Co.
   Beijing Jeep has had a rocky road since it began as a
much-heralded Sino-American joint venture in 1984. Two years ago,
the plant shut down for two months because it ran out of foreign
currency to import the parts it needed to stay in operation. The
Chinese government finally agreed to provide financial support
after exacting promises that the plant would use more domestically
produced components.
   Greenwald said that currently about 18 percent of parts are made
locally. He said the process to increase the local percentage will
take years, but that eventually, as production climbs from the
current 4,000 vehicles a year to 30,000-40,000 vehicles,
localization of parts could top 50 percent.
   ``We have an excellent start with the two projects'' with Beijin
Jeep and First Automotive, Greenwald said. ``We want to move ahead
at a faster pace.''
   Greenwald said he did not know what other companies were bidding
for the passenger-car contract, but Chrysler is thought to have an
edge because it signed a deal with First Automotive last July to
supply technology for four-cylinder engines to the company. The
Chinese company is to produce 150,000 engines under the initial
stage of the agreement with Chrysler.
   At the end of last year, the Chinese government sent a
high-level delegation to the United States to seek a partner in a
major auto production joint venture. Chrysler is believed to have
an advantage because of its previous activities in China, although
General Motors Corp. sold an engine assembly line to China last
month in what it said was a first step toward eventual
co-production.
   Greenwald said the 2.2-liter engine to be produced in Changchun
could be used in First Automotive's envisioned car, giving the
company a needed boost in its drive to cut back on foreign currency
spending by relying on domestically produced parts.

<HEAD>When it Rains Bad News, It Pours For Kodak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bad news has been pouring in from all
sides recently for Eastman Kodak Co. as rivals, partners, judges
and financial analysts take turns bashing the company.
   A questioned merger ... BAM! Battery troubles ... POW! The
potential for a whopping damage award to Polaroid Corp. ... SOCK! A
downgraded bond rating ... BOOM!
   ``It seems like Kodak can't do anything right,'' said Robert
Maney, a local stock analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc.
``Every time they get one thing cleared up, another thing comes
along and hits them on the head like a hammer.''
   Things had been looking up for the photographic and chemical
giant, which announced record sales and tripled profits for 1987,
after two years of cost cutting and restructuring.
   But just two months into 1988, triumph has turned to trouble.
   ``We don't see it that way,'' countered Kodak spokesman Henry
Kaska. ``It's just coincidence that all these things have come
together at the same time.''
   Kodak's woes began Jan. 22, a Friday, with the company's
surprise announcment of a $5.1 billion effort to acquire Sterling
Drug Inc., maker of such products as Bayer aspirin and Lysol
disinfectant and prescription drugs.
   Stock analysts criticized the deal as being too expensive and
several stopped recommending Kodak's stock.
   Four weeks later, on Feb. 19, another Friday, Kodak found out
that Polaroid Corp. wanted a federal judge to award $5.7 billion in
damages for Kodak's violation of instant photography patents,
several times earlier estimates.
   Kodak officials called Polaroid's estimate ``ridiculously
inflated.''
   The same day, Kodak announced that it had determined its
innovative 9-volt lithium battery, which was supposed to have a
shelf life of 10 years, doesn't last that long.
   That revelation prompted Black & Decker Corp., which sold two
lines of mini-flashlights with the lithium cells included, to pull
the products from the shelves immediately.
   ``We can't very well continue to be associated with something
like this,'' said Barbara Lucas, a spokeswoman for the
Baltimore-based company.
   Last Monday, a federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, put Kodak's
planned joint venture with Fuqua Industries Inc. on hold, ruling
that a tiny photofinishing competitor, Phototron Corp. of San
Bernardino, Calif., had grounds for an antitrust lawsuit.
   The venture with Colorcraft Corp., a Fuqua subsidiary, would
create the nation's largest wholesale photofinishing operation with
potential control of up to 80 percent of the market, according to
claims by Phototron that are disputed by Kodak.
   Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating of Kodak and
Sterling senior debt three levels, from Aa2 to A2, the lowest
rating Kodak has ever had, according to John Dean, a Moody's
analyst.
   The service's highest rating is Aaa, followed by Aa1, and Aa2.
   Standard & Poor's Corp. disappointed Kodak by lowering its
ratings even further.
   On Thursday, Kodak officials held a special meeting with stock
analysts in New York in an effort to stop the flow of bad news
about the company and put an end to the storm cloud that seems to
be hovering over its Sterling deal.
   Kay Whitmore, Kodak's president, told analysts that they had
lowered their profit expectations too much because of the Sterling
deal and that Kodak earnings will meet or exceed profit estimates
made at the start of the year, which ranged from $4 to $4.40 a
share.
   Several analysts had dropped their estimates down to $3.75
before the Kodak meeting. In 1987, Kodak had profits of $3.52 a
share.
   ``Things went about as positive as could have been expected,''
Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said about
Thursday's meeting. ``Considering that virtually everyone went in
with a negative attitude, I think it's still negative, but not as
negative.''
   Peter Enderlin, a stock analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham,
said Kodak offered a convincing case for the various cost savings
and reductions inherent in the Sterling deal.
   The meeting did not, however, prompt either analyst to start
recommending the purchase of Kodak stock again. Kodak's stock edged
up just 62{ cents a share to $42 a share, compared to $49.12{ just
before the Sterling announcement.
   Kaska, who is Kodak's chief spokesman, said that while the
recent rash of troubles had kept him busy, they were really nothing
more than ``temporary setbacks.''

   He said the Sterling acquisition will prove over time to be good
deal, the lithium battery shortcoming will be corrected in a few
weeks, the Polaroid damage estimate is absurd, the Phototron
lawsuit will be thrown out on appeal and the bond rating is not so
bad.
   ``The company has a bright future. Period,'' Kaska said.
   Maney said he has been getting many calls from Kodak investors
in Rochester who are disturbed by the flurry of bad news, but his
advice to them is to buy more Kodak stock.
   ``This has not changed my opinion that Kodak is still a great
buy. You just have to have patience,'' he said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan criticized a top
Treasury official's attempt to influence Fed policy. He also said
in congressional testimony that the risk of a recession is as great
as the risk of renewed inflation, but neither is imminent.
   _The U.S. economy expanded at a 4.5 percent annual rate from
October through December, the fastest pace in almost two years, the
government said. The growth in the gross national product was
revised from an original estimate of 4.2 percent made a month ago.
   _The government said consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in
January, matching 0.3 percent increases in American's personal
incomes and consumer spending for the same month.
   _Orders to U.S. factories for ``big-ticket'' durable goods fell
2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a year, the
government said.
   _The nation's trade deficit shrank in the final quarter of 1987
as exports climbed, the Commerce Department said. The deficit's
decline to $40.2 billion on a balance-of-payments basis marked the
first quarterly improvement since the spring of 1986.
   _The federal government reported a rare $16.09 billion surplus
for January, primarily because Social Security checks for January

consecutive monthly decline, the National Association of Realtors
said.
   _New American car and truck sales rose 14.5 percent in
mid-February from the comparable period a year ago. General Motors
Corp. said it planned to rehire 8,600 workers at four U.S. and
Canadian assembly plants because of rising demand and shrinking
inventories.
   _The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union rejected a merger
with the United Mine Workers union after private talks in Denver.

October's stock market crash, said it will merge with a subsidiary
of Franklin Savings Corp., a financial services company based in
Ottawa, Kan.
   _Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. rejected an offer from
dissident investor Henley Group Inc. to buy $780 million of new
Santa Fe stock. Santa Fe said it would pursue a financial
restructuring.
   _New England Electric System, a Massachusetts electric holding
company, began talks aimed at taking over ailing Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, except for its 36 percent share of the
stalled Seabrook nuclear plant.
   _Black & Decker Corp. sweetened a hostile bid for American

agreed to be taken private by its chairman in a $940.5 million plan.
   _Bank of New York Co. tightened the noose around Irving Bank
Corp., winning government approval to proceed with its $1.08
billion hostile bid and seeking to oust the rival's directors if
they don't capitulate.
   _Texaco Inc. agreed to pay $1.25 billion to the government to

the estimated $250 million cost of cleaning up the Love Canal
landfill that became synonymous with environmental disaster.

   The stock market showed a very slight gain today
in a subdued atmosphere after Thursday's late selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 22.38 points
Thursday, recovered .50 to 2,018.07 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New

   Analysts said many traders were disappointed at the market's
inability to surpass its early-January highs, as measured by the

   The average seemed to be headed into new-high territory for the
year Thursday morning, but the advance gave way to selling.
   While evidence continues to accumulate that the economy hasn't
yet suffered any severe effects from last fall's market crash,
brokers say confidence remains fragile.
   The Labor Department's report this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.3 percent in January was in line with advance
estimates, and had little apparent impact on the market.
   Federated Department Stores rose 1] to 64{ on news that the
company, which has been fighting a takeover bid by Campeau Corp. of
Toronto, was negotiating with Campeau on a proposed purchase at $68
a share.
   Eastman Kodak gained { to 42{ in active trading. On Thursday the
company said it expected its earnings for 1988 to be better than
estimates published lately by some analysts.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.22 to 147.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .53 at 283.82.

   Share prices dropped on the London Stock Exchange
Friday as investor sentiment turned sour and trading volume thinned.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 15.9
points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,766.5 at the close. The index's low
for the trading session was 17.8 points down.
   Volume fell to a light 350.2 million shares from 510.1 million
on Thursday.
   A strong rally earlier this week seemed to run out of steam as
the index approached strong technical resistance at the 1,800-point
level, dealers said.
   In addition, losses on Wall Street Thursday and sharp declines
on the London stock futures market took their toll on British
stocks, they said.
   ``It's amazing how quickly confidence can change, showing we're
still very nervous'' in the wake of October's stock crash, one
dealer said.
   However, the market still views the British economy as sound,
and a string of company earnings results this week indicated that
corporate profits are being maintained despite the crash, dealers
said.

<HEAD>Mexico to Give Responses to Bond Bids by March 4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will announce by March 4 its
response to foreign banks' secret bids for bonds offered by Mexico
in an innovative plan to reduce its $105 billion in foreign debt,
the Treasury Department said.
   Mexico's approximately 560 creditor banks had until 4 p.m. EST
Friday to submit their sealed bids under the plan, devised by the
Mexican and U.S. governments.
   New York-based J.P. Morgan & Co., exchange agent for the deal,
refused to disclose details of the bids.
   Over the next week, Mexican officials will consider how much
debt would be cleared and service cost reductions in determining
whether to accept each bid, the Treasury Department said in a
statement.
   The plan involves exchanging some of the debt Mexico owes
foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds to be issued by
the government.
   The bonds, backed by $10 billion worth of special U.S. Treasury
securities, will carry a higher interest rate than Mexico is paying
on the old debt.
   Mexico's potential savings ``will be in proportion to the offers
that are accepted,'' the department said in a statement carried by
the government newspaper El Nacional.
   In addition to the bond scheme, the government ``will present
other options and programs'' to its creditors to reduce the
country's debt burden, the Treasury statement added.
   It refused to predict how much principal and interest the
government might save under the bond program, saying each bank bid
must be analyzed first. But Mexican officials previously have
warned that if the offers are not attractive enough, they may
reject all of them.
   Participating banks sought to get as much money as they could
for their old loans, while Mexico wants to buy the debt cheaply.
   Most analysts expected bidders to offer discounts of between 30
cents and 40 cents to the dollar. Mexican debt paper sold for 48
cents to the dollar in early February.
   Observers doubted the government could market the entire $10
billion package. Mexican officials, they said, would consider at
least $3 billion in securities sales to be acceptable.
   The Treasury Department said that at the least, the Mexican bond
scheme had achieved a ``formal recognition'' by Mexican creditors
of the difference between the debt's book value and that commanded
on secondary markets.

   Soybean futures prices advanced and grain futures
were mixed in trading Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A wave of buying by big professional traders sparked a rally in
soybeans and also helped support corn futures, analysts said.
   Jitters early in the trading session over crop-bolstering rains
in Brazil's soybean region subsided later in the day, and traders
discounted that as a negative factor, said Victor Lespinasse, an
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``Big professional buying late in the day helped the beans to

   Technical rather than outside factors had the biggest influence

<HEAD>Shares of Societe Generale Frozen as Takeover Battle Rages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brussels Stock Exchange officials
suspended trading in Societe Generale de Belgique SA for a second
straight day Friday, as soaring demand for the stock highlighted
the intense battle for control over Belgium's biggest holding
company.
   Societe Generale shares opened with offers hitting a record
8,060 francs, or $230.30 per share, up 15 percent over Thursday.
   On Thursday, Italian investor Carlo De Benedetti had doubled his
original offer to 8,000 francs, or $228.60.
   De Benedetti claims to control 45 percent of Societe Generale
stock. He wants 7 more percent to counter an alliance of French,
Belgian, Luxembourg and Swiss investors, which claims it controls
52 percent of Societe Generale shares.
   De Benedetti disputes that claim.
   Societe Generale management, which supports the alliance, denied
reports of a rift within the group on Friday.
   ``There are accords between different partners to be sure this
majority exists,'' said Etienne Davignon, a Societe Generale
director.
   The Italian financier has said he wanted to expand Societe
Generale's holdings throughout Europe by 1992, when the European
Economic Community expects to have removed all internal bariers to
trade among the 12 EEC nations.
   The alliance opposing De Benedetti wants the 166-year-old
company to remain anchored in Belgium.
   Trading in Societe Generale was first halted Thursday, after the
share price rose to a record 7,010 francs, or $200, shortly after
the stock exchange opened.
   The stock closed at 6,100 francs, or $174.29, Wednesday and at
5,350 francs, or $152.86, Tuesday. It stood at 2,155 francs, or
$61.58, last October, when hints of the looming takeover battle
began to appear.
   On Friday, a new freeze forced any trading in the share off the
exchange to the unofficial market.
   This market has accounted for millions of transactions on given
days over the course of the last few months, but has largely dried
up in recent days to the lack of available shares.
   ``We had offers as high as 10,000 francs (or $285) per share but
had no paper for them,'' said one dealer at a major brokerage firm.
   The alliance battling De Benedetti is formed around the French
firms Compagnie Financiere de Suez, an investment firm, Compagnie
Generale d'Electricite, an industrial company, and Societe
Financiere et Industrielle Gaz et Eaux.
   Together they control 36 percent while an international group
around Belgium's biggest insurance company, Groupe AG, controls
another 16 percent.
   The 166-year-old Societe Generale has interests in some 1,400
firms world-wide and in about half of Belgium's top 50 companies.

<DATELINE>SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Metromedia Co. has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire the Ponderosa Inc. restaurant chain for an
undisclosed amount, the company announced Friday.
   Metromedia, a privately-held telecommunications and technology
holding company, said it planned to keep Ponderosa management in
place and anticipated no changes in the company's operation.
   Ponderosa, which was taken private in a $331 million buyout led
by New York investor Asher B. Edelman in January 1987, is one of
the nation's largest steakhouse chains, with annual sales of $500
million.
   The Dayton, Ohio-based company owns and operates 400 restaurants
nationwide and franchises another 280 in the United States and
Canada, and has a meat processing and distribution operation
through its ESI Meats Inc. unit.
   After Edelman acquired the company he sold off a number of
assets, including most of its Casa Lupita restaurants and a
meat-processing company, to help pay off debt used to finance the
buyout.
   ``We believe that Ponderosa is an outstanding company: it is
strong and well-positioned with excellent management and great
potential for growth and expansion,'' said Stuart Subotnick,
Metromedia executive vice president and general partner.
   Metromedia formerly was the nation's biggest independent
television and radio broadcasting company. John Kluge, who owns 97
percent of the present company, liquidated most of its holdings
after taking Metromedia private in 1984.
   Kluge has said he planned to use Metromedia as the vehicle for a
broad-based investment program. In addition to long-distance
telephone operations, the company owns robotic painting and
computer software companies.

   Arthur Emil never envisioned traveling all the
way to Japan to sell some of the 54 luxury condominiums he
developed in lower Manhattan.
   And he was more than a little skeptical when Japan's Fujisankei
Communications Group approached him about featuring one of the
units on a home-shopping broadcast that would air in Tokyo, Osaka
and nine other cities in late January.
   A Fujisankei representative explained that the communications
giant's satellite shopping network ``markets high-ticket items,''
Emil said. ``They said they sold a chateau in France.''
   And what could be more high-class than his condos, which range
in price from $500,000 to $1.7 million and feature such amenities
as commercial-style refrigerators in the gourmet kitchens, 17-foot
ceilings and a 24-hour concierge in addition to the doorman.
   Emil had a hard time with the notion that someone would buy an
apartment without ``physically visiting the property,'' although he
said it does happen from time to time.
   But Fujisankei promised, after a single broadcast, to present
him with 20 to 25 qualified buyers. ``I'm assuming these are real
buyers,'' he said shortly before leaving for Japan in early
February.
   But 16,000 miles later and one week later, Emil was a believer.
``You can sell apartments in the United States by television in
Japan,'' he exclaimed.
   While Emil said Fujisankei introduced him to fewer qualified
buyers than promised, he was still pleased.
   None of the investors signed on the dotted line, but Emil said
several are coming to New York to see the landmark building in the
near future, and he's confident he'll close on more than one deal.
   Emil described the buyers as wealthy executives who do business
in and around New York and were attracted by the building's luxury
qualities.
   ``I expected a number of offshore buyers, but that I would
schlep myself over to Japan ...,'' he joked.
   Fujisankei's January broadcast proved to be successful not only
for Emil. A limousine used by Pope John XXIII also sold _ to an
unnamed bidder for $423,000.

   In a courtroom filled with 100 lawyers, a
bankruptcy judge on Friday began trying to sort out how to handle
the complex, historic Public Service Company of New Hampshire
reorganization.
   Judge James Yacos reached no immediate decision on a
``procedural mechanism'' for the case after a 2{-hour hearing. But
he approved several preliminary motions, including the utility's
request to retain a law firm to consider a U.S. Supreme Court
challenge of a state law that bars advance charges for power plants.
   Public Service, choked by debt from its $2.1 billion investment
in the stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant, sought refuge from
creditors in bankruptcy court on Jan. 28. Two days earlier, the
state Supreme Court upheld the state law that bars the utility from
charging ratepayers for Seabrook unless the reactor surmounts
evacuation-planning hurdles and wins a commercial license.
   New Hampshire's largest power company, with 360,000 customers,
became the first major investor-owned utility to seek protection
from its creditors since the Depression.
   Yacos noted that Congress did not contemplate the insolvency of
an electric utility, with captive customers, when it drafted the
bankruptcy law.
   ``This case wasn't supposed to happen,'' Yacos said, because
there had been a belief that utility regulators would save troubled
companies. But the state court ruling denied Public Service an
emergency rate increase.
   ``We are doing what Congress didn't do, and if we can do it in a
year, which I hope we can do, it would be a miracle,'' Yacos said.
   Public Service has 120 days from its bankruptcy filing to
present a reorganization plan. Other parties then could propose
rival plans. Though debtors often get lengthy extensions of the
``exclusivity period,'' Yacos said he is inclined not to grant one
to Public Service.

   Sales of existing homes suffered their third
consecutive monthly decline in January, a 3.6 percent drop which
pushed activity to its slowest level in 2{ years, a real estate
trade group said Friday.
   The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing
single-family homes dropped to a seasnally adjusted annual rate of
3.21 million units last month, following declines of 1.2 percent in
December and 2.9 percent in November. The association said that
consumer fears raised by the collapse of the stock market in
October were partly to blame for the slowdown.
   The sales decline was accompanied by an increase in home prices,
which rose $2,500 to a median price of $87,900 in January, up 6
percent from a year ago.
   The decline in sales pushed the annual sales rate, the number of
homes that would be sold if the monthly sales pace continued for a
year, to its lowest level since June 1985.
   John Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist, said he did not
believe the downturn in housing would be permanent or would lead to
a recession.
   ``Anecdotal evidence suggests that sales in February were more
brisk than in January,'' he said, crediting lower mortgage rates
and better economic news for the rebound.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported Friday that its
nationwide survey found 30-year mortgages had dipped to 9.87
percent this week, down from 9.92 percent the previous week. The
new rate is almost a full percentage point below where it was at
the beginning of the year.
   Sales were off in every region of the country in January except
the Midwest, which posted a 4.5 percent gain to an annual rate of
920,000 units.
   Sales dropped 12.2 percent in the West to a rate of 500,000
units and fell 9.6 percent in the South to a rate of 1.12 million
units. Sales fell 4.7 percent in the Northeast to 610,000 units, a
decline blamed in part on job layoffs in the New York financial
district following the market crash.
   But the Northeast continued to report the fastest jump in home
prices, a 14 percent gain over the past 12 months to a median price
of $135,000.
   The West was close behind with a 12.2 percent rise in home
prices over the past year, pushing the median sales price to
$116,000. The South, where sales have been depressed by weakness in
energy and farming, saw prices rise 3.7 percent to $82,000. In the
Midwest, home prices rose 3 percent to $67,400.

   The stock market closed out an on-again,
off-again week with a small gain in quiet trading Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.64 to 2,023.21,
finishing the week with a net gain of 8.62 points.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 5 to 4 in the daily
tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 798 up, 669 down and 492
unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 158.06 million shares, down from 213.89
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index added
.40 to 147.70.
   Analysts said many traders were disappointed at the market's
inability to surpass its early-January highs, as measured by the
Dow Jones industrial average.
   The average seemed to be headed into new-high territory for the
year Thursday morning, but the advance gave way to selling.
   While evidence continues to accumulate that the economy hasn't
yet suffered any severe effects from last fall's market crash,
brokers say confidence remains fragile.
   The Labor Department's report Friday morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.3 percent in January was in line with advance
estimates, and had little apparent impact on the market.
   Federated Department Stores rose 1] to 64{ on news that the
company, which has been fighting a takeover bid by Campeau Corp. of
Toronto, was negotiating with Campeau on a proposed purchase at $68
a share.
   Eastman Kodak gained { to 42{ in active trading. On Thursday the
company said it expected its earnings for 1988 to be better than
estimates published lately by some analysts.
   Other gainers among the blue chips and technology issues
included International Business Machines, up 1\ at 115};
Hewlett-Packard, up 1 at 61; Philip Morris, up 1 at 91~; General
Electric, up | at 43|, and General Motors, up { at 69[.
   On the downside, Merck dipped \ to 161\; American Telephone &
Telegraph \ to 29, and Coca-Cola | to 36~.
   Ausimont N.V. jumped 3 to 23. The company denied rumors that it
was being pursued as a takeover candidate by Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing.
   Wells Fargo Mortgage and Equity Trust fell 1[ to 15}. The real
estate investment trust said it had decided not to proceed with a
plan to liquidate after negotiations ended to sell its property
investments to Cal Fed.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $6.88 billion, or 0.27
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 181.90 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.02 to 302.63,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up .88 at 262.46.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped .22 to 363.40. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 284.32, up 1.03.

<HEAD>Another Specialist Withdraws Voluntarily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the fifth time since the October stock
market crash, a stock specialist firm has agreed to give up its
role as a market maker in a New York Stock Exchange issue, the
exchange said Friday.
   The NYSE said Wagner, Stott & Co. had voluntarily withdrawn as
the specialist in the stock of Carter-Wallace Inc., a drug and
consumer products company based in New York.
   The exchange said in a news release that the stock would be
reallocated to another specialist firm March 10.
   Catherine Maroney, a NYSE spokeswoman, said the exchange would
not disclose the reason for the reallocation. The press release
said the exchange had been reviewing the performance by Wagner
Stott on Oct. 20, the day after the historic market collapse.
   The NYSE is investigating several cases in which its 53
specialists failed to maintain orderly trading in stocks they
controlld. The specialist firms control the rights to market
certain issues and are required to keep order by setting opening
prices and covering trades when there are too few buyers or sellers.
   Previously, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg surrendered its franchise in
J.P. Morgan & Co. stock; M.J. Meehan & Co. withdrew its rights to
Gould Inc.; Lawrence, O'Donnell & Co. gave up Neiman-Marcus Group
Inc.; and LaBranche & Co. agreed to drop E.F. Hutton Group Inc. and
A.G. Edwards Inc.

<TEXT>
   The dollar slipped Friday against most major
currencies in quiet trading on the world's foreign-exchange markets.
   Gold prices resumed their recent decline in New York, falling to
their lowest level since April 1987 in moderate volume. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price for gold of
$429.50 a troy ounce, down from $433 late Thursday.
   The dollar slipped in Asia and Europe, reflecting lingering
disappointment over Thursday's report that the U.S. economy
expanded at a 4.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter when some
traders had expected a 5 percent rise.
   But dealers in Europe said expectations that central banks might
intervene to support the dollar prevented it from falling even
lower.
   John Hazelton, a vice president for institutional sales at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said the dollar traded in a very
narrow range in the United States with professional traders
accounting for the bulk of the activity.
   ``They are about the only ones involved in the market,'' he
said. ``There has been very little corporate or institutional
business. It's mostly traders in the various banks.''
   He said the market shrugged off the latest government reports on
the U.S. economy, which said Friday that personal income, consumer
prices and consumer spending each rose 0.3 percent in January. The
increases were within expectations.
   ``We are in a quiet period for the currencies,'' Hazelton said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 128.35 Japanese yen from 128.80 yen
on Thursday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 128.24 yen. In New
York, the dollar edged down to 128.37 yen from 128.425 yen late
Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7715 from $1.7665 late
Thursday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.7715 from $1.76725 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.68875 West German marks, down from 1.6930;
1.38625 Swiss francs, down from 1.39215; 5.71700 French francs,
down from 5.7285; 1,245 Italian lire, down from 1,247; and 1.2634
Canadian dollars, down from 1.26495.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.6895 West German marks, down from 1.6945;
1.3897 Swiss francs, down from 1.3935; 5.7175 French francs, down
from 5.7315; 1.8965 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9020; 1,245.45
Italian lire, down from 1,248.25; and 1.2838 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2650.
   Gold prices have slumped this week as worries about inflation
have receded and supplies of the metal have grown.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell
$3.60 a troy ounce to $429.60, its lowest level since April 8 when
it closed at $420.20.
   The exchange said contracts for about 3 million ounces of gold
were traded, which an exchange spokesman described as moderate
volume.
   Earlier, gold closed in both Zurich, Switzerland, and London at
$431.50 a troy ounce, up from $428 bid late Thursday in London but
down from $433 in Zurich.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose to $437.23 an ounce from $436.35 late
Thursday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to $6.20 a troy ounce, up from
$6.15 late Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery fell 9 cents an ounce to $6.155, its lowest level since
March 26 when it closed at $5.92.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Prices Drop On Reports of Surplus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices dropped sharply Friday amid fears that a
London trading house was preparing to release an estimate showing a
jump in surplus production.
   In other markets, energy futures prices were mostly lower,
precious metals retreated; soybean prices rallied while grains were
mixed. Cattle and pork prices also were mixed.
   A wave of selling in the cocoa pit at New York's Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa exchange was triggered by rumors that London-based Gill and
Duffus is preparing a report showing a production surplus of
130,000 to 140,000 tons for the 1987-88 crop year ending in August,
analysts said.
   ``That compares to the most recent estimate of world production
of 93,000 tons surplus'' from the International Cocoa Organization,
said Debra Tropp, an analyst with Philipp Brothers Inc. in New York.
   ``This is a substantial increase,'' she said. ``Even if you take
into account recent rumors that Ivory Coast production might be up
... this still exceeds most market expectations.''
   Cocoa prices settled $39 to $45 lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $1,609 a ton.
   Energy futures prices continued a downward swing in quiet
trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil futures prices settled unchanged to 14 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in February at $15.36 a barrel;
heating oil prices were .48 cent higher to .18 cent lower, with
February at 45.47 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline settled .11
cent to .45 cent lower, with March at 45.26 cents a gallon.
   The drop in energy futures prices helped drag down precious
metals prices, which began a retreat earlier this week in trading
at the New York Commodity Exchange, said Bette Raptopoulos, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   A sharp decline in the commodity index, a measure of inflation,
added pressure. But the negative market was tempered by political
turmoil that has resurfaced in South Africa and a softer U.S.
dollar, she said.
   Gold prices settled $3.60 to $4.60 lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $429.60 a troy ounce; and silver prices
settled 9 cents lower across the board, with the March contract at
615.5 cents a troy ounce.
   A wave of buying by big professional traders sparked a rally in
the soybean pit, and also helped support corn prices in trading on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Cattle and pork futures prices were mixed at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle prices settled .10 cent to .15 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in April at 72.55 cents a pound; feeder
cattle settled .2 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with March at
80.72 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .30 higher, with
April at 44.30 cents a pound; and pork bellies settled unchanged to
.47 cent lower, with March at 52.10 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices advanced while grains were mixed at the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Concerns over rains in Brazil's soybean region subsided as the
session got under way, and traders discounted that as a negative
factor, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean, Witter,
Reynolds, Inc.
   Technical rather than outside factors had the biggest influence
over the markets, he said.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2{ cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $3.15\ a bushel; corn settled { cent to 2\
cents higher, with March at $2.00} a bushel; oats settled } cent
lower to 1 cent higher, with March at $1.90\ a bushel; and soybeans
settled 3 cents to 5} cents higher, with March at $6.25{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Plans to Lay Off 20 Percent of Its Production Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Champion Spark Plug Co. announced Friday
that nearly 20 percent of its 1,700 production workers nationwide
will be laid off because of overcapacity in the auto parts industry.
   The bulk of the cuts, which will begin March 22 and will be
phased in over the next four months, are being made at the plant
here.
   The layoffs come just one month after workers at four U.S.
Champion plants approved a new four-year contract that includes a
provision that the company try to increase production at two of its
domestic plants.
   ``We explored every alternative to reducing the labor force.
Even though the numbers are regrettable, it was the only way we
could keep a significant number of manufacturing presence in
Toledo,'' said William Walker, Champion's industrial relations
director.
   ``There is clearly too much capacity in the auto parts industry,
and we have elected to balance production rather than close and
consolidate plants,'' he said.
   A total of 243 Toledo workers _ 119 people from the aviation
products group and 124 from automotive operations _ will lose their
jobs, the company said. Champion currently employs about 800
production workers in Toledo.
   An additional 63 people will be laid off at the company's three
other U.S. manufacturing facilities, including 13 at the Detroit;
20 at Cambridge, Ohio; and 30 at Burlington, Iowa.
   Walker said UAW leaders were aware of the overcapacity situation
when they agreed to a new national contract last month, which
covers about 1,700 workers at the U.S. Champion plants.
   ``We informed them of the possible consequences to Champion;
specifically, that about 200 workers might be laid off in the
coming months. As a result, it was a recognized fact in the
negotiations and led to a major effort on the part of the company
and the UAW to assure those who were laid off that they would
receive benefits,'' Walker said.
   Rodney Smith, international representative for the UAW, said he
was disappointed with Champion's decision.
   ``It's bad news for us, that's for sure,'' he said.
   Walker said the effect of the Toledo layoffs could be lessened
by normal attrition through the retirement of 60 to 70 production
workers.
   He also said the company is reducing its Toledo aviation
division because it is trying to balance production between Toledo
and Liberty, S.C, a non-union plant.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise In Quiet Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL MENEZES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose in thin trading Friday,
supported partly by indications of continued moderate inflation.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose by nearly }
point, or $7.50 per $1,000 in face value, with its yield declining
to 8.36 percent from 8.42 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said that after a busy morning session market activity
quieted for the rest of the day, with price movements occurring in
very thin trading.
   Helping to tug prices higher was the Labor Department report
that its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in January, a pace
generally expected by the market, analysts said. The monthly rate
translated into a moderate 4.2 percent annual rate, compared with
4.4 percent in 1987.
   High inflation erodes returns on fixed-income securities such as
bonds and reduces their attractiveness as investments.
   In addition to the CPI report, the Commodity Research Bureau
futures index of 21 commodities fell a sharp 1.42 to 224.26. Many
market participants consider the index a reflection of inflationary
expectations, with a decline thought to signal lower near-term
inflation.
   Furthering such sentiments were additional declines in crude oil
prices. The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, fell 14 cents to $15.78 per 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its lowest since late December.
   Otherwise, analysts said, many market participants were limiting
their activity in the absence of major new economic news. Many are
waiting for next Friday's U.S. unemployment report for February
before taking major investment positions.
   ``The economy still seems to be moving at a decent clip and no
one has any strong convictions in either direction to buy or sell,
so the market waffles in a narrow trading range,'' said Elizabeth
Reiners, a vice president of money market research at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose [ point, intermediate maturities rose in the range
of 3-16 point to 15-32 point and 20-year issues rose { point,
according to the investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.32 to 113.71. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 3.46
to 1,189.35.

<HEAD>FCC Warns TV Stations to Improve Minority Hiring</HEAD>

   The Federal Communications Commission signaled
a tougher stance Thursday on minority hiring, putting conditions on
license renewals of 11 Southern television stations with
affirmative action efforts it found defective.
   The action, the first since the FCC revised its equal employment
opportunity guidelines last year, shows that ``we mean business,''
said Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis.
   The FCC renewed the stations' licenses but said they must report
periodically to the agency on efforts to recruit, hire and promote
qualified women and minorities.
   The commission will monitor the stations' efforts and if
unsatisfied, could conduct an investigation. If the FCC still is
unsatisfied with a station's equal employment opportunity efforts,
it could take steps to revoke the station's license.
   The National Black Media Coalition had asked the FCC to deny
license renewals to 19 TV stations because of what the group called
deficient affirmative action efforts.
   Pluria Marshall, coalition chairman, said that while he was
disappointed the commission did not take stronger action, it was
``a step in the right direction.''
   The FCC requires all TV and radio stations to have plans
describing their efforts to find, hire and promote qualified women,
blacks and other minorities. The plans are reviewed at the time of
license renewal, every five years for TV stations and every seven
for radio stations.
   In revising its equal employment opportunity guidelines last
year, the FCC required more detailed reporting by stations and put
stronger emphasis on evaluation of a station's overall employment
efforts, rather than focusing on the the number of minorities and
women employed.
   With the revision, the FCC also decided to scrutinize all plans.
Previously, the agency looked closely at plans of stations where
minority employment was less than 50 percent of the minority
population of the work force in the station's area.
   One of the stations cited, WTWC-TV in Tallahassee, Fla., had
more minority employees than required by the FCC parity guidelines,
but the commission said ``merely meeting or exceeding these
guidelines is not a `safe harbor.'''
   ``The number of minorities and women that a station employs is
important and continues to be a factor which we consider,'' said
FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick.
   ``We will not use numbers as a strict quota below which a
broadcaster will necessarily fail in their EEO program if they are
making aggressive and adequate efforts to correct the problem,'' he
said. ``But nor will numbers be used as a `safe harbor' above which
broadcasters will necessarily be found to be in compliance.
   ``The simple lesson is that all broadcasters must have in place
an affirmative action program which puts them in a position to
identify and recruit and retain qualified minorities and women,''
he said.
   Besides WTWC, the stations required to submit further reports to
the FCC are: WNCT-TV, Greenville, N.C.; WUNC-TV, Chapel Hill, N.C.;
WTKK-TV, Manassas, Va.; WTGL-TV, Cocoa, Fla.; WXEL-TV, West Palm
Beach, Fla.; WNFT-TV, Jacksonville, Fla.; KETS-TV, Little Rock,
Ark.; WLPB-TV, Baton Rouge, La.; WYES-TV, New Orleans, La.; and
WJTC-TV, Pensacola, Fla.
   All stations in a block of states come up for renewal in the
same year.

<TEXT>
   After a month of public discord, Campeau Corp.
and Federated Department Stores Inc. announced Friday they had
opened negotiations on a $6.1 billion merger agreement.
   Federated's board of directors, which met in regular session
Thursday, authorized the merger talks, in which Campeau proposes to
pay $68 in cash for each share of Federated.
   The proposal, which followed Campeau's pledge to sell off its
Brooks Brothers division to help finance the merger, is to be
presented to the Federated board Monday, the companies said in
their joint announcement.
   ``No assurance can be given that a definitive agreement will be
reached,'' the companies said.
   It was the first sign of a softening in Campeau's month-long,
increasingly hostile campaign to buy Federated. The
Cincinnati-based Federated had $11 billion in sales last year. The
Toronto-based Campeau, a development company, bought Allied Stores
Corp. in December 1986.
   ``Sixty-eight dollars per share is a good price. The
shareholders should be happy,'' said Monroe H. Greenstein, an
analyst with the Bear Stearns firm in New York City.
   Federated stock rose $1.50 to $64.50 a share in late New York
Stock Exchange trading Friday.
   The merger proposal is separate from Campeau's latest hostile
takeover offer, its $66-per-share tender bid made Thursday, Campeau
spokeswoman Joele Frank said Friday in New York City. That offer
was improved from a previous $61-per-share proposal.
   Federated has 90.4 million common shares and equivalents
outstanding. In addition to acquiring the company's 88.5 million
outstanding shares, Campeau would pay about $100 million to buy up
outstanding Federated stock options.
   ``What's new about this is that negotiations are under way and
that the price has been agreed on,'' Ms. Frank said.
   Greenstein predicted that Campeau Corp. would _ if it buys
Federated _ sell off some Federated holdings, including
non-department store assets and underperforming department store
groups.
   Greenstein said those groups might include I. Magnin in San
Francisco, Lazarus in Cincinnati and Abraham & Straus in New York.
``All these have been known to be under-performers in recent
years,'' he said.
   Thursday, the Canadian company increased its tender offer to
Federated from $61 to $66 per share and said it would consider
making a higher bid if necessary. Campeau has been bidding to buy
Federated since Jan. 25.
   Federated's board said Friday it has deferred until 11:59 p.m.
EST Monday implementation of a ``poison pill'' shareholder rights
measure designed to make a takeover of Federated more difficult.
The board said it could later decide to further delay the measure's
implementation.
   Federated has rejected previous Campeau takeover bids,
questioning whether Campeau had obtained the necessary financing.
Campeau chairman Robert Campeau says he has the financing and would
be willing to match offers by other bidders for Federated.
   Campeau said Thursday it would raise a substantial amount of
equity for its proposed buyout by selling the Brooks Brothers
division of its Allied Stores Corp. unit to Britain's Marks and
Spencer PLC for $770 million. The Brooks Brothers sale was
conditioned on Campeau acquiring Federated.
   The Brooks Brothers sale also could preempt antitrust concerns
raised by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, in connection with the
proposed Federated acquisition. Metzenbaum is concerned that a
Campeau purchase of Federated could hurt competition in some U.S.
markets, such as New York and Miami, where both Allied and
Federated operate stores.
   Federated's board has previously rejected offers of $66 and $47
per share. The company has been considering alternatives, such as
selling some of its non-department store assets or having
management buy the company and convert it to private ownership.
   Federated operates 650 stores nationwide. Its holdings include
the New York chains Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Straus, Filene's
of Boston, Burdines of Miami, Rich's in Atlanta, Bullock's and
Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles, I. Magnin in San Francisco and
Lazarus in Cincinnati.

<HEAD>Dart Calls for Stop & Shop Shareholder Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANDOVER, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dart Group Corp. announced Friday that it
passed another hurdle in its attempt to oust the board of directors
of Stop & Shop Cos. Inc. in its $1.03 billion hostile takeover bid
for the supermarket chain.
   Dart said its 95 percent-owned affiliate, Jefferson Partnership,
submitted to Stop & Shop applications from holders of more than 10
percent of Stop & Shop's outstanding shares calling for a special
shareholders meeting on March 30, according to Dart spokesman
Stanley Rubenstein.
   Dart says the meeting, which is being demanded under
Massachusetts' Business Corporation Law, is to consider replacing
Stop & Shop's board with Jefferson's nominees and adopting related
resolutions.
   Stop & Shop spokeswoman Aileen Gorman declined to comment on
Dart's latest announcement.
   Stop & Shop, based in Braintree, Mass., on Feb. 12 filed a
federal suit to block Dart's $37-a-share offer. Stop & Shop claimed
that Dart failed to register as an investment company with the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission and failed to disclose
details of its past takeover attempts.
   Dart responded with a countersuit, claiming that Stop & Shop
illegally withheld corporate information. U.S. District Judge Rya
Zobel ruled Dart must file its claim in Norfolk Superior Court in
Massachusetts.
   As of Wednesday, Jefferson Partnership had acquired more than
73,000 shares of Stop & Shop, about 2.7 percent of the company's
outstanding shares.
   Stop & Shop operates 113 Stop & Shop supermarkets and 169
Bradlees discount department stores from Maine to North Carolina.
   Speculation mounted Friday that Stop & Shop could soon be sold
to an outside bidder.
   One union representing Stop & Shop workers said Thursday it
wanted to be included in any sale negotiations, said Robert
Petronella, international vice president and New England regional
director for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which
represents about 20,000 Stop & Shop employees.
   Recently, UFCW union leaders agreed to take a strike vote if
there was not a new contract for Stop & Shop employees by March 6.
   Dart, based in Landover, owns Crown Books and Trak Auto Parts.
It has mounted other hostile takeover attempts targeting retail
chain Dayton Hudson Corp., Safeway Co. and Supermarkets General.

   Marks and Spencer PLC, where Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher shops, is poised to establish a major U.S.
beachhead with its planned purchase of the preppy clothier Brooks
Brothers.
   ``Marks and Sparks,'' as the 550-store chain is affectionately
known among rhyme-loving Londoners, has been seeking to expand in
the United States for more than a year as part of its strategy of
becoming a global retailer.
   Marks and Spencer announced Thursday it had agreed in principle
to buy Brooks Brothers for $770 million from Campeau Corp., the
Canadian retailing and real estate company, if Campeau acquired
Federated Department Stores Inc. of Cincinnati.
   Campeau and Federated disclosed Friday they were negotiating a
$6.1 billion merger but said there was no guarantee they would
reach a definitive merger agreement. Federated already has rejected
several lower offers from Campeau.
   Marks and Spencer has grown in 104 years from a market stall to
a favorite store of the average Briton. It's also where Mrs.
Thatcher buys her underwear because, she says, it is well made.
   The retailer hopes to get Brooks Brothers' flagship store on New
York City's Madison Avenue, its 46 other U.S. stores and 12
joint-venture outlets in Japan.
   British retailers have boomed in recent years on strong spending
by consumers and their increased use of credit. This has prompted
some retailers to ponder expansion outside Britain, which they now
see as too small a market.
   ``Marks and Spencer needs to become a global retailer and to a
certain extent hey do need to get into the U.S. market to fulfill
that ambition,'' said Charles Allen, an industry consultant with
the investment firm Wood Mackenzie and Co.
   Other British retailers that have expanded into the United
States by acquisition or opening of new stores include Storehouse
PLC, owner of the Conran's home furnishing stores, Dixons Group
PLC, owner of the Silo electric appliance chain, and the jeweler
Ratners PLC.
   But reaction to Marks and Spencer's plans were mixed in the
City, London's financial district.
   Marks and Spencer fell 4.5 pence, about 8 cents at current
exchange rtes, to 176 pence, or $3.12, a share late Friday on the
London Stock exchange after falling the same amount on Thursday.
   Analysts agreed the retailer should target the United States but
were divided about whether the acquisition of Brooks Brothers was
the right choice and whether Marks and Spencer agreed to pay too
high a price.
   Some also expressed concern that Marks and Spencer was
establishing its beachhead in a portion of the U.S. market that
might be softening.
   Wood Mackenzie's Allen said the company agreed too quickly to
something that wasn't a sure deal.
   Marks and Spencer's pre-tax profit growth will slow to 5 percent
from 10 percent in its new fiscal year beginning April 3 because of
the acquisition, Allen predicted.
   But Paul Backhouse, a retail analyst with the investment firm
Morgan Grenfell and Co., said: ``This is a long-term move for Marks
and Spencer.''
   Analysts also noted that although many foreigners view the U.S
market as uniform, it has regional differences that make marketing
products challenging.
   Marks and Spencer stated Thursday: ``The acquisition of Brooks
Brothers would represent a substantial opportunity for Marks and
Spencer to enter the U.S. retail clothing market through a major
long-established business with a high reputation for quality.''
   Marks and Spencer said it wants to use its retailing expertise
to boost Brooks Brothers' business.
   Brooks Brothers and Marks and Spencer are similar in that they
both sell durable, quality merchandise under their own brand name
and they stick with classic designs.
   But there are some big differences. Brooks Brothers caters to a
small clientele of the well-to-do; Marks and Spencer markets huge
volumes to the middle class.
   Marks and Spencer also sells more than clothes. It sells food
under its St. Michael brand name, and home furnishings.
   Marks and Spencer ventured into the U.S. market last year by
opening four women's clothing stores in upstate New York under the
name D'Allaird's.
   A Marks and Spencer spokeswoman, who did not want to be named,
declined to detail how the stores were faring but said the company
remained optimistic about their prospects.
   Marks and Spencer has had mixed results with its efforts to
expand into other foreign countries.
   Profits for its 11 stores in the rest of Europe jumped 25
percent in its most recent fiscal year. But in Canada, where it
operates 260 stores, its profit sank 61 percent.
   The company plans to open a store under its own name in Hong
Kong in May.
   Marks and Spencer's pre-tax profit jumped 18 percent to 432
million pounds, about $765 million, in the year ended March 1987 on
a 13.5 percent revenue gain to 4.2 billion pounds, $7.4 billion.

<HEAD>Montgomery Ward Furthering Its Goal Of Specializing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Montgomery Ward & Co., bolstering its move to
promote itself as a specialty retailer, announced on Friday a
realignment of field office management to create several new
specialist merchandising positions.
   The move will create a 20 percent increase in employees, while
some current employees will lose their jobs, said spokesman Charles
Thorne. He did not have exact numbers on how many employees will be
cut.
   Under the realignment, the Chicago-based retailer will close two
of its six territorial management offices, one in Los Angeles and
one in Kansas City, leaving offices representing the North, South,
East and West, Thorne said.
   The new merchandising experts will be spread out primarily at 23
offices throughout the country, with an aim to bring the managers
closer to the stores they serve, he said.
   Each of Montgomery Ward's four major specialty merchandising
categories _ Electric Avenue, Auto Express, Home Ideas, and Apparel
_ will have its own field organization under the realignment.
   Every full-line store features each of the four categories of
merchandise, Thorne said.
   ``As a result, Montgomery Ward will begin to compete as a
specialty retailer right down to the point of sale, as is done by
the best specialists in the industry,'' said Bernard F. Brennan,
president and chief executive officer.
   The new organization will create 10 merchandise director
positions, one additional apparel vice president and 115 district
merchandise manager positions, the company said in a statement.
   ``The district managers will be deployed in the field and are
responsible for implementing merchandising and sales training
programs at the store level,'' the statement said.
   The field officers currently in charge of the retailer's
territorial offices will concentrate on operations, customer
service and other similar responsibilities, Thorne said.
   ``Now, our territorial offices can concentrate their entire
effort on sevring customers, while a new group of managers has the
task of moving our specialty merchandising strategy ahead,''
Brennan said.
   The move will increase the retailer's field employees to more
than 180, he said.
   The company is in the process of identifying candidates for the
new positions, Brennan said, adding that they will come from within
as well as outside the organization.
   Montgomery Ward, a subsidiary of New York-based Mobil Corp.,
operates a chain of 316 stores in 39 states. For 1987, sales
increased 6 percent to $4.6 billion. Earnings rose 23 percent to
$130 million in 1987, the second consecutive year of record
earnings, the retailer said.

<HEAD>Manville To Provide More Than 16 Million Asbestos-Related
Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. said Friday it will make available
at a Denver storage facility more than 16 million asbestos-related
documents to those involved in resolving health claims against the
company.
   Billions of dollars worth of asbestos-related lawsuits drove
Manville into Chapter 11 reorganization. The Denver-based company's
reorganization plan has been confirmed, but it cannot emerge from
bankruptcy until all appeals have been exhausted, and one currently
is pending.
   Manville said in a prepared statement that the repository, which
is believed to be the most comprehensive of its kind, will be
established in cooperation with the Manville Personal Injury
Settlement Trust, the committees representing asbestos health
claimants and other interested parties.
   Manville officials said the repository should be operational in
six weeks, and access guidelines will be provided.
   The documents were produced from 1983 through 1986 in two widely
publicized Manville lawsuits against 29 insurance carriers and the
U.S. government. The company said some documents support claims
that Manville knew or should have known before 1964 that some
employees and customers were at risk because of exposure to high
levels of asbestos.
   Manville has agreed to pay $2.5 billion over a 28-year period,
including $615 million in insurance proceeds, into the Personal
Injury Settlement Trust when the Chapter 11 plan is completed. The
company also will give the trust 50 percent of its common stock and
convertible preferred stock for use if needed. The trust also will
share in Manville profits as long as necessary to pay off the
claims.

   Japanese share prices posted modest gains at the
start of half-day trading in Tokyo Saturday following an overnight
rise on Wall Street, and analysts predicted a 13th consecutive day
of gains in a market intent on recouping its losses after the
October crash.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei stock average of 225
selected issues, which gained 64.52 points Friday for the 12th
straight trading day, gained another 5.74 points, or 0.02 percent,
in the first 15 minutes of trading to rise to 25,170.92.
   ``It's the 13th day of straight gains and the market is
definitely headed for a rally ... it's 100 percent sure,'' said a
trader with Nikko Securities, one of Japan's four largest
brokerages.
   The index stood at 25,746.56 points just before the mid-October
crash when it lost nearly 4,000 points in one trading day. It was
the largest single day drop for the Nikkei.
   The trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tokyo
trading opened on a positive note, taking the lead from moderate
gains in New York Friday, and then shot up by some 40 points by
mid-morning.
   Trading companies and supermarket issues were winners, he said.
   Other notables included precision machine makers such as as
Olympus and Ricoh, as well as pulp and paper, transportation and
nonferrous metals.
   The Tokyo foreign-exchange market is closed on Saturdays.
