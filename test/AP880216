   An arsonist who burned the town's elementary
school and damaged a church that opened its doors to students may
have set a fire Monday that destroyed another church and its
classrooms, authorities said.
   Omak, a central Washington town of 4,000 that boasts Okanogan
County's only stoplight, has been terrorized by the arson spree.
   ``It's affected everyone in town. People are very, very grim,''
said Mary Koch, managing editor of the weekly Omak Chronicle.
``They were somber as they drove by it going to work this morning.
It was still burning.''
   The North Omak Elementary School was heavily damaged in a
January fire, its second in two months. In the past two weeks, two
churches and a church parsonage have been set afire.
   ``They're a kook ... someone who is unbalanced,'' said Vic
Power, superintendent of Omak's school district.
   School officials have checked through their records for any
former employee or student who has a grudge but have turned up
nothing, he said.
   ``One of the interesting things in Omak is we haven't had any
particular problems with people, haven't had anyone out there we
could identify who had been on our case for any particular
reason,'' Power said.
   Police Chief Peter Sirois said police are looking at two or
three ``persons of interest'' at this point. Police have
interviewed about a dozen people so far, he said. He declined to
say why the ``persons of interest'' might have wanted to harm the
schools or churches.
   Firefighters on Monday extinguished the latest fire, which
destroyed the $1.5 million Omak Presbyterian Church. The church and
the Free Methodist Church had served as temporary classrooms after
the fire at the elementary school, which served students in
kindergarten though second grade.
   Last week, the Methodist church sustained about $200,000 in
damage. A fire set there Saturday and at the parsonage next door on
Sunday caused an additional $30,000 in damage, said Mike Cramer,
assistant chief of the eight-person Omak police force.
   ``It's got everybody on the edge,'' said pastor Elbert G.
Harlow, who lives across the street from his Presbyterian Church.
``They're nervous ... waiting to see what's going to happen next.''
   Church officials met Sunday night and made sure all doors and
windows were locked, Harlow said. A security guard woke him Monday
with news of the fire.
   The blzae apparently was set by someone who broke into the
basement through a window hidden by two evergreen trees beside the
three-story, red-brick church, Omak Fire Chief Cal Bowling said.
   But Bowling said he'd rather not discuss the investigation with
reporters.
   ``Whoever set these fires is going to read your report, and I'd
just hate to let him know what this has done to the community,''
Bowling said.
   The latest fire was too hot Monday for the fire marshal to
determine what caused it, Cramer said.
   ``We have a strong feeling but we can't draw any conclusions
yet,'' he said. Authorities hope to determine the cause by Tuesday.
   But there was no doubt that an arsonist had set the earlier
fires, Cramer said.
   The fires are beginning to take a psychological toll on
residents and on the 1,800 students, including 450 from North Omak
Elementary, Cramer said.
   ``It's having a bad effect on everybody. When the first fire hit
the school it devastated the kids. It was tough for them to move.
Now they're going to have to again,'' he said.
   Electricians and plumbers helped set up temporary buildings as
classrooms, said Cramer, who added that nighttime patrols have been
expanded with the help of the Okanogan Sheriff's Department.
   ``It only seems to happen while Omak sleeps,'' Cramer said. ``In
a way that's good, because the buildings are empty and, so far, no
one has been hurt.''
   The Rev. Norman Lund, pastor of Foursquare Gospel Church, which
also housed North Elementary students, said he doesn't ``want to
guess what the arsonist is thinking.
   ``I think everyone's concerned about saying anything,'' he said.
``You don't want to motivate the person.''

   Gary Hart, who was catapulted to national
prominence in New Hampshire in 1984, finished way behind his five
Democratic rivals Tuesday but vowed to stay the course, saying:
``Today's defeat can become tomorrow's victory.''
   ``We're going to take this fight all the way across this nation
_ into the South, into the industrial Midwest and then we're going
to head West, where I live,'' Hart told a roomful of supporters.
   In nearly complete returns, the former Colorado senator had 4
percent in the New Hampshire primary. He put the best face on it.
His showing, he said, was ``500 percent better than Iowa,'' where
he won barely 1 percent of the vote in last week's caucuses.
   Four years ago, Hart stunned the political establishment by
upsetting front-runner Walter Mondale in the New Hampshire primary,
gaining status as a credible candidate. He said he never expected
to do that well again this year.
   ``We have just begun. We are committed,'' said Hart, who has
labeled himself a maverick, offering fresh thinking.
   Earlier, Hart said his faltering campaign had enough money to
last until delegate-rich Super Tuesday on March 8.
   ``I've always mentally prepared for a long-term gain, not a
break-through early on,'' Hart said.
   Campaign manager Sue Casey said the candidate had $400,000 in
his campaign treasury _ enough, she said for three weeks of
campaigning prior to the 20 Super Tuesday states.
   ``I don't have to do what other candidates have to do,'' Hart
said during a campaign stop earlier in the day in Portland, Maine.
``Other candidates have to make a certain showing to get money and
get support. We have support in 50 states,'' and money in the bank.
   Hart dropped out of the race last May after questions surfaced
about his relationship with model Donna Rice. He returned to New
Hampshire to re-enter the race in December, soared for a time in
the polls, then slumped to the back of the pack.

   Politicians, journalists and schoolchildren
commemorated on Tuesday journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann's 1,000th
day as a hostage in Lebanon. But both French and Iranian officials
suggested there was no end in sight to the drama.
   ``It is important that the captors know that all of France is
united,'' Kauffmann's wife Joelle said at a gathering of public
figures and sympathizers outside a barge on the Seine, where the
Association of Friends of Jean-Paul Kauffmann is headquartered.
   Twenty-seven runners, ending a 1,000-kilometer trek from
Brittany in northwest France, arrived Tuesday morning at the barge
carrying a large chain to symbolize Kauffmann's captivity.
   The Newspaper Guild of America, the Prague-based International
Organization of Journalists and the Journalists' Committee for the
Liberation of French Hostages in Lebanon all issued statements
appealing for the freedom of Kauffmann and other captives.
   ``We would like even more to be close to them, to tell them to
hold on, that nothing will be neglected and nothing is,'' President
Francois Mitterrand said on television.
   Kauffmann, 43, a reporter for the newsweekly Evenement du Jeudi,
and Michel Seurat, 39, were taken hostage as they drove from the
Beirut airport following Kauffmann's arrival. On March 5, 1986, the
Islamic Jihad group claimed Seurat had been killed.
   Two other French hostages, diplomats Marcel Carton, 64, and
Marcel Fontaine, 45, kidnapped March 22, 1985, have passed their
1,000th days as captives.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held of the 24 foreign hostages in
Lebanon. He was captured March 16, 1985.
   In a related development in Paris, UNESCO Director General
Federico Mayor on Tuesday told representatives of Western
journalists that he will take an active role on behalf of three
reporters held hostage in Lebanon, one of those present at the
meeting said.
   The press group representatives met with the U.N. official to
seek his intervention on behalf of Kauffmann, Anderson and British
television cameraman John McCarthy.
   Mia Doornaert, president of the Brussels-based International
Federation of Journalists, said Mayor promised to hold meetings
with the governments concerned _ those whose citizens are hostages
and those with influence in the area.
   The names of specific countries were not mentioned, according to
participants, but it was common knowledge that Iran exercises some
influence over the Shiite Moslem groups holding foreign hostages.
Iran is a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.

   Journalists have received widespread persecution
and harassment, executives of three leading international
organizations defending press freedom told the U.N. Human Rights
Commission on Tuesday.
   The reports marked the first concerted move to have examination
of such abuses placed before the 43-nation panel.
   Peter Galliner, director of the International Press Institute,
cited a survey listing 25 journalists killed in 1987, 10 kidnapped
or disappeared, and 675 arrested, expelled or otherwise harassed.
He said last year alone the institute sent 63 protests to 31
countries.
   The president of the Inter-American Press Association, Ignacio
E. Lozano, Jr. said freedom of the press was a basic human right
and that the commission's support in defending it is essential.
   ``It is our hope that you would keep defense of freedom of
expression on your permanent agenda,'' Lozano said.
   Galliner said the situation in countries such as Chile and
Paraguay in Latin America, and South Africa and some other African
countries continued to be of special concern.
   Also represented was the Paris-based International Federation of
Newspaper Publishers.

   A victorious George Bush, flushed with a
New Hampshire primary win, vowed Tuesday night to ``rise again''
when the presidential campaign moves South.
   Frequently interrupted by chants of ``We want George,'' and
``We're Number One,'' Bush spoke of polls that had him slightly
behind Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole in the Republican
presidential race.
   ``Tonight, I feel I have a lot in common with Mark Twain,'' he
said. ``Reports of my death were greatly exaggerated.''
   With 94 percent of the precincts reporting, Bush had 38 percent
to 29 percent for Dole. Others trailed far behind.
   ``And now I'm going home to change the laundry and on to the
South, where we're going to rise again,'' Bush told cheering
supporters.
   Bush thanked the voters of New Hampshire and in a personal note
said, ``I'll never forget you.''
   ``You haven't chosen a man,'' he said, his wife, Barbara, by his
side. ``You've chosen a course, to expand our prosperity, to see
that it touches every hamlet, every home.... You've chosen to back
a strong America, an America strong enough to bring peace to the
entire world.''
   Bush planned to spend Wednesday in Washington and then campaign
on Thursday in Missouri and Texas, two Super Tuesday states.
   Once the commanding front-runner in polls in the first primary
state, Bush saw himself fall into a virtual dead-heat with Dole
after Dole's victory in the Feb. 8 Iowa caucuses. Beaten 2-1 by
Dole in Iowa, Bush also trailed former television evangelist Pat
Robertson in the caucuses.
   The post-Iowa Bush sought more contact with voters, making
improptu stops at shopping malls, sitting at the wheel of a big
truck and a forklift, and declaring that he had strong feelings
even if he doesn't always show them.
   Bush's national campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said the New
Hampshire win would wipe out the Iowa loss.
   ``New Hampshire is the big enchilada in American politics,''
Atwater said. He attributed Bush's win to the vice president
``talking about issues'' while Dole ``was talking about all this
momentum jazz.''
   As he prepared to retire for the night, Bush told supporters,
``I leave you with four little words that will be on my mind when I
take the oath 11 months from now: Thank you, New Hampshire.''

   PARIS (AP) _ UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor on Tuesday
told representatives of Western journalists that he will take an
active role on behalf of three reporters held hostage in Lebanon, a
press representative said.
   The group met with Mayor to seek his intervention on behalf of
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated
Press, British television cameraman John McCarthy and French
magazine writer Jean-Paul Kauffmann, who marked his 1,000th day in
captivity Tuesday.
   Anderson, missing since March 16, 1985, is the longest held of
the 22 foreign hostages in Beirut, and McCarthy has been missing
since April 17, 1986.
   The group met with Mayor for a 40-minute closed-door session.
The journalists were led by Mia Doornaert, diplomatic correspondent
of the Dutch newspaper De Standaard and president of the
Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists.
   It included Harry Conroy, general secretary of Britain's
National Union of Journalists and Gerard Gatinot, a Frenchman
representing the the Prague-based International Organization of
Journalists.
   Ms. Doornaert said Mayor promised to hold meetings with the
governments concerned _ those whose citizens are hostages and those
with influence in the area.
   The names of specific countries were not mentioned, according to
participants, but it was common knowledge that Iran exercises some
influence over the Shiite Moslem groups holding foreign hostages.
   Iran is a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
   UNESCO has a special human rights group that takes up
imprisonment cases with member governments. It also has sponsored
meetings in the past involving the two journalists' federations on
professional issues.
   Two officials of the Newspaper Guild of America, Charles Dale,
the president, and Charles Perlik, immediate past president, were
unable to attend because of visa problems.
   In prepared remarks for the meeting, Dale said:
   ``The Newspaper Guild ... takes this occasion to reaffirm its
commitment to the freedom of Terry Anderson and the other
journalists held hostage in the Middle-East as well as the release
of Arab journalists currently imprisoned in Israeli occupied
territories.
   ``We are approaching the third anniversary of Anderson's
imprisonement. He and the other journalists who share his fate are
prisoners without guilt, sometimes to terms that now exceed those
meted out to many violent criminals.
   ``The conscience of the world cannot permit this to continue. It
cries out for the immediate freeing of Terry Anderson, John
McCarthy and Jean-Paul Kauffmann, not as part of any quid pro quo
arrangement between governments but out of elementary consideration
of human justice and decency. In the same spirit, we urge the
release of all Arab journalists held in Israeli prisons,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra, Bork Hearings Called Constitution in Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official celebration of the U.S.
Constitution's 200th birthday was largely ceremonial, but
historians say the true tribute actually came during the
congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra affair and the Supreme
Court nomination of Robert Bork.
   The Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, the
official sponsor of the tribute to the 200-year-old document, got
some credit from historians for reaching out to the people with
such things as its pocket-size copies of the Constitution. But
others faulted it for paying too little attention to serious
scholarship.
   Most of the historians interviewed in recent weeks about the
bicentennial celebration agreed that Americans learned more about
the Constitution and its workings through watching the Iran-Contra
hearings on television and reading about the debate on the Bork
nomination than through any planned activity.
   ``My sense is that the commission's work was not particularly
substantive,'' said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor
at Harvard University, who testified to the Senate Judiciary
Committee against the Bork nomination. ``Nonetheless, what the
country experienced proved to be extraordinarily profound because
of the Iran-Contra hearings and the Bork hearings.
   ``You can't help observing how much the public became involved
in discussions on the meaning of the Constitution, the role the
courts should play, the fundamental relationships between the
executive and legislative branches,'' Tribe said. ``Those topics
usually are discussed just by lawyers.''
   G. Edward White, professor of law and history at the University
of Virginia, agreed that the Bicentennial Commission's efforts
``were largely ceremonial.''
   ``The ones that have come to my attention basically are on a
kind of superficial, ceremonial level,'' he said.
   In comparison, he said, ``the Bork hearings were one of the
major contributors _ unconsciously so _ to the constitutional
debate.''
   J. Woodford Howard Jr., a political science professor at Johns
Hopkins University, recalled that when he went to parties last
summer and fall, all that people wanted to talk about were the Bork
or Iran-Contra hearings.
   ``This was the Constitution in action,'' Howard said. ``Both
hearings really drove home the fact that the Constitution is not
just a document, or a fossil, but something that is enduring.''
   Former Chief Justice Warren Burger, who gave up his place on the
court to devote full time to heading the Bicentennial Commission,
said he believes its work did have an impact on Americans'
understanding of the document that guarantees their freedoms.
   ``My guess will be there's a higher awareness, a higher
consciousness, not necessarily of the details,'' he said in a
recent interview in his office. ``If a free people don't look from
time to time at their liberties and how they got them, they take
the risk of losing them.
   ``Although we succeeded in creating greater awareness, that
doesn't mean detailed knowledge necessarily,'' Burger added.
   A coffee table in Burger's office in the Supreme Court building
was covered with recently published books and pamphlets on the
Constitution. On it, too, was a cereal box with a short historical
message, copies of placemats from fast-food restaurants with short
constitutional quizzes and a bicentennial calendar.
   Louis Harlan, a history professor at the University of Maryland
and president-elect of the American Historical Association, was one
of the historians critical of the commission's work.
   ``The parades and fireworks have faded into history,'' he said,
``but the commission has failed to give us something that will
endure and be of use to future generations.''
   Burger countered that the commission's work will lead to a wider
audience for scholarly works and noted that other government
agencies have financed studies on the Constitution.
   The commission stated at the start of its work that it wanted to
teach Americans more about the Constitution. It cited a survey that
found that about half of the public could not identify the purpose
of the Constitution or explain what the Bill of Rights is.
   Burger said no survey of Americans' knowledge of the document
has been taken in the wake of last year's tribute, which reached a
zenith last Sept. 16 with a party on the Capitol steps in
Washington and with a ceremony in Philadelphia the next day.
   Henry Steele Commager, a historian at Amherst College, said he
did not believe it was possible to measure the success of the
bicentennial activities.
   ``What is the criterion for success for a party?'' he asked.
``If you want to know if people learned anything, who knows?
Obviously, the lessons of Watergate didn't teach Mr. Reagan
anything about the Constitution.''
   Howard said the mood of the country for the Constitution's
bicentennial was one of introspection. ``We were worrying about
whether we have dropped the torch, and I think the Iran-Contra
hearings and Bork hearings really brought that feeling home.
   ``This time, we had the Constitution in action,'' Howard added.
``Those hearings brought the Constitution to life.''

   The House resumes its struggle toward a
national AIDS policy this week with two sharply contrasting
Californians at the extremes of disputes over issues ranging from
discrimination to testing.
   On one side is Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman, the liberal and
influential chairman of the House health subcommittee, whose Los
Angeles district is ethnically diverse and big-city tolerant.
   Across the ideological gulf but geographically next door is Rep.
William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., a conservative from straight-laced
and suburban Orange County.
   Their differences will be aired Friday at what Waxman is calling
a ``refresher hearing'' on his bill to provide money for voluntary
AIDS tests, guarantee confidentiality for those tested, and protect
AIDS victims and carriers from discrimination.
   The hearing follows a series of canceled work sessions last year
that Dannemeyer claims were scratched because Waxman didn't have
enough votes to win approval of his bill.
   ``If he can't achieve his objective ... of anti-discrimination
status for those with the virus, he will not move a bill in the
100th Congress,'' Dannemeyer said.
   ``We had other things pressing on us,'' Waxman responded when
asked why the sessions were canceled. He said he expects to finish
work on the AIDS bill within two months.
   Though he maintained he is ``always open to discussion,'' Waxman
indicated he would not compromise on the measure's confidentiality
or civil rights provisions and said he detected little support for
Dannemeyer's positions.
   ``The whole public health world has concluded we need to protect
against discrimination,'' Waxman said. ``The only people likely to
come in for tests if there is no protection are people at low
risk'' of having AIDS.
   Dannemeyer calls it ``inappropriate and absurd'' to legislate
anti-discrimination safeguards because of what he contends is the
``unstable status'' of information about AIDS transmission.
   While Waxman quotes the prevailing view of virtually all public
health authorities that AIDS cannot be transmitted by casual
contact, Dannemeyer asserts that those authorities are rethinking
``their dogmatic pronouncements that the AIDS virus is not a threat
in the workplace.''
   Dannemeyer says employers should be free to decide whether to
fire an AIDS victim or carrier.
   ``The civil rights of the uninfected are entitled to just as
much protection as the infected,'' Dannemeyer said. He also
asserted that protecting AIDS victims from discrimination conflicts
with ``the heterosexual ethic.''
   Going against the grain of prevailing psychiatric thought, he
contended that homosexuals voluntarily choose their sexual
preference and said schoolchildren should be taught that
``homosexuality is a perverse lifestyle, it's an unhealthy
lifestyle. That's a fact. We should tell that to kids.''
   Dannemeyer has introduced a bill requiring AIDS testing of
marriage license applicants, hospital patients, people being
treated for venereal disease and people convicted of drug or sex
crimes. He has also sponsored a bill that requires reporting by
name of every individual who has AIDS or tests positive for
antibodies to the AIDS virus.
   Waxman said Dannemeyer and others who promote such reporting
requirements ``seem to want these names for some other purpose''
and that suspicion would discourage high-risk individuals from
being tested.
   ``We have a clear danger of hysterical over-reaction where many
people might find themselves persecuted for being infected,''
Waxman said. ``We can't get sidetracked into an anti-gay crusade
when our real job is to stop the spread of this terrible disease.''
   Waxman said the biggest concern at this point is not the
transmission of AIDS among homosexuals but its spread among
intravenous drug users ``and their sexual contacts in the
underclass.''
   Dannemeyer contended that strong homosexual lobbies are hobbling
Congress and some state legislatures in their handling of the
disease. He said AIDS victims have received kid-glove treatment
that flies in the face of traditional ways to halt epidemics.
   ``If 73 percent of the (AIDS) cases were presented by people
with gray eyes, a highly disorganized group in America, three years
ago we would have witnessed large-scale quarantine of anyone who
had the virus,'' he said.
   Dannemeyer also condemned an educational film created by the Gay
Men's Health Crisis in New York City. He distributed videotaped
copies to reporters and said the film uses tax dollars to promote
homosexuality.
   The tape features blunt language, a demonstration of condom use
on a cucumber and a scene of two men kissing in a shower.
   Waxman said he had not seen the tape but added, ``I wouldn't
know how to design a message to the gay community. I don't think
Mr. Dannemeyer would know how to design it. ... But we'd better
start getting the message across and not pull our punches because
we're fearful of talking about sex.''

   The odds are increasing rapidly that Americans
traveling abroad can find a fast-food place that bears a familiar
name.
   ``McDonald's in Munich, Pizza Hut in Fiji and Taco Bell in
Sydney are just three examples of the trend toward expanding
foreign markets for U.S. restaurant fanchises,'' says an
Agriculture Department report.
   In 1985, there were 6,122 international franchise units, up 36
percent from 3,943 in 1980. Figures by the Commerce Department show
that Canada and Japan account for almost half, with Australia and
New Zealand ranking next.
   The report was written for the department's National Food Review
magazine by two economists, Charlene Price and Hal Linstrom of
USDA's Economic Research Service.
   ``As you might expect, the popularity of the different
restaurants varied around the world,'' the report said. ``For
example, Canada was the largest market for hamburger units, and
Japan accounted for the greatest share of the chicken market.
Austalians and New Zealanders enjoyed pizza.''
   McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King and Wendy's _ the
four largest U.S. restaurant chains _ accounted for 31 percent of
the world total, franchising 4,626 restaurants internationally by
1986, up from 272 in 1974, the report said.
   As the largest food service organization in the world with about
9,400 establishments, McDonald's led the international scene with
about 2,138 outlets, compared with 370 five years earlier, the
report said.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken, a division of PepsiCo Inc., operated
more than 6,500 units, including 1,854 in 54 foreign countries.
   Burger King, part of Pillsbury Foodservice, operated 4,744
outlets in 1986, including 403 in 24 foreign countries and Puerto
Rico.
   Wendy's, which grew to the world's fourth-largest restaurant
chain in 17 years, operated almost 4,000 outlets, including 231 in
17 foreign countries.
   Of the four largest franchisers, only Kentucky Fried Chicken
operated outlets in Africa in 1986, and also held sole position in
the Middle Eastern countries, the report said.
   ``Franchise growth overseas will continue in existing markets,''
the report said. ``At the same time, some chains are entering
previously untapped areas. Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut,
for instance, recently negotiated with the Chinese and Russian
governments to bring fast food to those countries.''
   Most franchise restaurant companies probably will keep expanding
their menus and services abroad as well as in the United States,
particularly to meet a growing interest in diet and ``light'' foods.
   ``Strong growth in Mexican and oriental foods may also mean
introduction of new menu items,'' the report said. ``Following the
U.S. trend, breakfast offerings are also likely to increase in
overseas restaurants.''

   A shot or two of carbon dioxide _ the stuff
used in some fire extinguishers _ may be just the thing to help
sensitive plants such as raspberries and blueberries survive the
stress of heat therapy, says an Agriculture Department plant
pathologist.
   The result one day could be a new assortment of plants for
nurseries and home gardeners.
   Heat is used in special chambers to rid fruit and vegetable
plants of viruses. At 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the heat forces the
plants to grow faster than the viruses lurking in them, said
Richard H. Converse, who works for the department's Agricultural
Research Service, Corvallis, Ore.
   But that's too hot for blueberries and many raspberries, he said
in a recent report by the agency. If carbon dioxide is raised to
1,100 parts per million in the chamber from the 350 parts normally
present in the air, the plants are able to withstand the heat.
   Converse said the process of raising carbon dioxide levels had
been used previously by Australian scientists to heat-treat grape
plants. He is hopeful that the procedure can be used to eliminate
viruses from apples, oranges, potatoes, onions and bulb crops such
as iris and lilies.

   Poultry processors soon will be allowed more
options in repackaging and relabeling federally inspected fowl and
poultry products for final distribution to consumer outlets, says
the Agriculture Department.
   As it is right now, poultry products can only be repacked and
relabeled at federally inspected plants.
   ``Warehouses and distribution centers are often more
conveniently located than federally inspected plants,'' said Lester
M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service. ``So, allowing certain facilities to repackage
and relabel poultry products with inspectors present means savings
in time and money and a safe product. We believe the savings in
transportation costs could ultimately mean lower prices for
consumers.''
   The optional operations will also have to be done under the
supervision of federal inspectors, he said. The new rule will take
effect on March 11.
   The processors will pay USDA for the inspection at the
repackaging operations. Crawford said the optional service has been
available to the meat industry but has not been allowed under
poultry inspection regulations.
   Repacking and relabeling allow bulk shipments of federally
inspected products to be divided into consumer packages and to have
brand names placed on the products.

<HEAD>Homosexual Congressman Raises Funds While GOP Looks For A
Challenger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank, who acknowledged last year
that he is a homosexual, is busy raising money for his re-election
campaign while the Republican Party is still looking for someone to
oppose him.
   At this point, the only Republican publicly talking of running
against the liberal Massachusetts Democrat is a conservative gadfly
who withdrew from the 1986 Massachusetts gubernatorial race after
admitting he had lied about his military record.
   ``I don't know what the Republicans plan to do about it, but the
reading we have (from polling) is that voters care about
performance in office'' and not personal issues like sexual
preference, Frank said. ``And that's certainly consistent with the
reading I've gotten from people.''
   Massachusetts Democrats say the homosexual disclosure will have
little impact on voters who have sent Frank to Congress with
increasingly convincing victory margins _ 52 percent, 60 percent,
74 percent and 89 percent.
   And they note that the disclosure was not news to many
constituents.
   Republicans, however, are talking about how Frank could be
defeated in the state's 4th District, which includes Democratic
strongholds on the outskirts of Boston, upper-class Republican
enclaves like Wellesley, and mill towns like Fall River near the
Rhode Island border.
   Joe Malone, executive director of the state GOP, said the
homosexual issue could be exploited by a Republican challenger, not
by attacking Frank's sexual preference but by telling voters he is
focusing too heavily on ``gay issues'' at the expense of other
congressional work.
   ``I've always thought it's a case of how the congressman votes,
and if his sexuality slants his voting in such a way that he no
longer represents his district,'' Malone said.
   ``In many cases he has chosen to pursue issues that have an
effect on the gay community to the detriment of issues that affect
the typical constituent in his district,'' he added.
   However, Malone could not immediately provide any examples. And
Frank's supporters point to his work on several major bills in 1987
to counter that argument.
   They credit him with playing major roles in passage of a measure
requiring that any low-income federal housing demolished under
urban renewal be replaced; a bill requiring a special prosecutor be
appointed to investigate alleged wrongdoing by administration
figures; and legislation prohibiting the government from denying
visas based on politics.
   While Republicans talk about Frank's vulnerability, there is no
declared candidate with the election nine months away. The only
politician publicly considering a challenge to Frank is Royall
Switzler, who would carry considerable political baggage into any
race.
   Switzler made a name for himself by taking on leaders of the
Democratic-controlled Massachusetts House _ often alone _ during
his years in the state Legislature.
   The Massachusetts GOP enlisted Switzler in 1986 to run against
popular Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis, but he was forced to bow
out after admitting he was a sergeant in peacetime Korea, not a
Green Beret captain in Vietnam.
   Frank, 47, is taking nothing for granted.
   Campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show
that his spending and fund-raising in 1987 were more than double
his campaign receipts and expenditures during 1985, the last
non-election year.
   The fourth-term congressman raised $144,300 during 1987,
compared to $71,400 in 1985. He spent $106,400 last year compared
to $49,800 in 1985.
   Frank also paid $7,000 for an October poll to measure voter
reaction to the disclosure of his homosexuality.
   ``The general finding is that overwhelmingly people in the
district will judge me on how I do my job as a member of Congress
and not anything else,'' Frank said.

<TEXT>
   Planners of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library, forced to abandon a site at Stanford
University after widespread protests, are running into skepticism
from some city officials about their proposal to build the library
near this Southern California city.
   The 100-acre site, donated by the real estate development firm
of Blakeley-Swartz, impinges on a greenbelt area that is protected
from large-scale development by a decade-old, non-binding agreement
among Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks.
   ``We do not want the library project used as means for further
land-use concessions on any property within the greenbelt,''
Moorpark officials wrote on Jan. 7 to the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors, which must approve the project. Moorpark Mayor John
Galloway said similar letters were sent by officials of Thousand
Oaks and Simi Valley.
   Donald E. Swartz, a partner in the developing firm, said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles, ``We have seen the letter and
I think we can live within the scope of that.''
   But Moorpark City Councilman Clint Harper, a mathematics teacher
at Moorpark College, said, ``We are concerned as a council that the
Reagan library may be used as a lever to get additional land
development.''
   However, he added that he thinks the $60 million library could
be ``consistent with the greenbelt if that is the only anticipated
use.''
   Galloway expressed surprise at a report in the Los Angeles Times
on Sunday that Blakeley-Swartz plans to build a 300-room hotel and
conference center on 540 acres adjacent to the library site. ``We
are going to have real concerns about that,'' the Moorpark mayor
said.
   Swartz said only about 40 acres of the Blakeley-Swartz property
lie within the greenbelt. Nevertheless, previous efforts to develop
the property have been rebuffed by local officials who argued such
development would affect the integrity of the greenbelt agreement.
   The strongest concerns have been expressed by Moorpark, which
officials say would be most affected by development of the property
because of its location.
   ``I think in general people are very supportive of the
library,''said Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton. ``One of the
reasons the Reagans liked the area was that it was so unspoiled, so
development would be contradictory to the president's wishes. To a
certain extent, that will help maintain it as a greenbelt.''
   The greenbelt, covering about 1,200 acres, embraces an area of
rolling hills covered with brush, beavertail cactus and
wildflowers. The heights command a sweeping view of surrounding
valleys, and on a clear day California's offshore Channel Islands
can be seen in the distance.
   Although surrounded by more development, the site is in itself
much like the country around the Reagans' ranch, about 80 miles
northwest of Simi Valley, where the president and first lady Nancy
Reagan are taking a brief vacation.
   Selection of the site climaxed a search which began after the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation abandoned the Stanford
location in the face of opposition from students, faculty and
homeowners. Reasons for the opposition ranged from politics to
traffic.
   Mrs. Reagan was driven to the new site during a California
vacation in August and approved it. The president gave his approval
after flying over, planners said.
   The foundation has not yet filed a plan with Ventura County
officials for development of the site, but has said it hopes to
start construction in July. Local officials say they will be
concerned if roads and other facilities for the library would
support additional development.
   ``This is the first time that we have had the prospect of quite
such a prestigious proposal,'' said Simi Valley City Council member
Ann Rock. ``This isn't something that comes along every day. So I'm
assuming that the Reagan foundation indeed is serious.
   ``Now what I don't know, if they have a fairly intense land-use
plan, is whether or not they are going to get the go-ahead from
Ventura County. That may be discouraging.''

   Pat Robertson had just finished a strident
anti-communist sermon to the Chamber of Commerce when Kent Evans
stood up and told the Republican candidate what was on his mind.
   ``I'm shaking,'' he said. ``I'm sitting here really afraid when
you start talk about going to war.''
   It was a dramatic moment on the eve of the crucial New Hampshire
primary, where Robertson hoped for another surprising finish in the
wake of his upstart second-place showing in Iowa.
   After several minutes of back-and-forth, Robertson told Evans:
``I don't know what else to say except that peace will come through
strength. ... Maybe would you prefer to live under communism? I
don't know. I'd rather be free.''
   The confrontation with the Portsmouth merchant highlighted the
strong reaction some have to Robertson's foreign policy positions.
   It also came as the GOP hopeful was embroiled in a controversy
about Soviet missiles and Cuba. Robertson said during a Sunday
night debate that Soviet medium-range missiles are still based on
the island, although he backed off the assertion Monday, saying he
had no such first-hand knowledge.
   Robertson drew criticism from his opponents for the comment, in
tones that echoed Evans' fears.
   ``This is a very serious allegation,'' Bush said in an interview
on a Manchester, N.H., radio station. ``You keep hearing these
outrageous charges ... which are designed to scare the American
people.''
   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York called it ``a rather rash and
unsupportable charge.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said SS-4 and SS-5
missile sites established in Cuba in 1962 ``were confirmed as
having been destroyed in that year.''
   At the Chamber of Commerce candidate forum, Robertson gave his
standard speech, with a strong defense of America and strong
denunciations of communism as the greatest evil the nation faces.
   After hearing what Robertson had to say, this was Evans'
reaction: ``He advocates using weapons and war as a solution to all
the problems in the world. ... That's isn't a solution _ that's
annihilation.''
   Robertson talked of the Berlin Wall, calling it an abomination
that the United State should have stopped.
   ``Had I been president when that was done, there would have been
U.S. tanks on the move to knock that thing down,'' Robertson said.
   And that was too much for Evans, who runs an office furniture
store.
   ``I'm sitting here really afraid when you start talk about going
to war the way you just talked about it, the result of taking tanks
to the Berlin Wall,'' said Evans. ``With all that talk of war, not
understanding the threat we face today from nuclear weapons... We
can no longer do it.''
   Part of the audience of 250 applauded Evans. Robertson asked who
he supports and Evans said Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole.
   Robertson nodded and went on to compare the current situation to
the challenge posed by Adolf Hitler's Germany in the 1930s.
   ``Had we been resolute in the face of dictatorship that would
never have happened. I am for peace with all of my heart,''
Robertson said.
   Evans broke in: ``There were not nuclear weapons when Hitler was
there. You need to address the root cause before it comes up to a
Hitler, not afterward with weapons.''
   The former television evangelist was clearly irritated by Evans'
questions but pressed on.
   ``You have somebody who is every bit as bad as Hitler in charge
of many nations of the world,'' Robertson said. ``Communism is just
as bad as the Nazis. ... If we want to have peace in our world, it
is absolutely essential that we stand up resolutely to communism.''
   Several times later during the appearance, Robertson returned to
Evans to address his concerns.
   At one point, he said: ``This gentleman had all the concerns.
Sir, I want to eliminate nuclear weapons from the face of the
earth.''

<HEAD>Robertson Backpedals On Cuban Missile Assertion, Saying No One
Really Knows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson says he has no first-hand
evidence that there are Soviet missiles in Cuba, as he had claimed
in a debate over the weekend with his Republican presidential
rivals.
   Robertson came under fire Monday for the assertion, made Sunday,
which fellow GOP candidates termed ``rash'' and ``outrageous.''
   The White House emphatically denied the claim and the man
identified by the Robertson campaign as the candidate's source said
the existence of such weapons in Cuba has not been confirmed.
   The former television evangelist initially said Monday that he
would not ``back off'' his claim. But later in the day, he began
revising it until he was saying that he had been asking a question,
not making an assertion, when he alleged that Cuba has nuclear
weapons pointed at the United States.
   ``I was asking in the debate is this true,'' he said. ``I have
no sources other than what I've said, so there was no categorial
statement per se.''
   In the debate, Robertson was attacking the intermediate-range
missile treaty signed last December by President Reagan and Soviet
Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he made the claim.
   ``Somehow in all this brilliant negotiations which these
gentlemen are so proud of they left that out of the treaty,'' he
said. ``And it seems to me nukes pointing at the United States are
more vital to our security than nukes pointing to Europe.''
   Pressed by reporters here, Robertson said he had no first-hand
evidence that there are such weapons in Cuba.
   ``My contention is there might be missiles in the caves; they
may have brought in missiles on some other transport vessel or
possibly a submarine. I don't know the exact sizing of it, but
nobody can say for certain that those missiles aren't there,'' he
said.
   Later, interviewed on Cable News Network's ``Larry King Live,''
Robertson said it is possible there are Soviet missiles in Cuba.
   ``I don't think, frankly, there's anybody in the United States
right now that I'm aware of who can say categorically that there
are or they're not there,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday, Robertson had told a GOP candidate's forum here
that ``the least we can do in this is get those nuclear weapons out
of Cuba,'' a reiteration of the statements he had made during
Sunday's debate in Goffstown, N.H.
   ``I'm not going to back off from that. I'd be happy to have
somebody prove me wrong,'' he told an interviewer.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said SS-4 and SS-5
missile sites established in Cuba in 1962 ``were confirmed as
having been destroyed in that year. We also are confident that the
missiles were removed from Cuba at that time.
   ``We have had extensive intelligence collection directed at Cuba
since 1962 and have no evidence that SS-4, SS-5 or other strategic
missiles have been deployed there,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked whether he was denying any offensive nuclear weapons are
deployed in Cuba, Fitzwater said, ``Exactly.''
   Vice President George Bush said in an interview Monday that
``I'm confident this (Robertson assertion) is not true,'' and
added: ``You keep hearing these outrageous charges ... which are
designed to scare the American people.''
   Another GOP presidential candidate, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
called it ``a rather rash and unsupportable charge.''
   Officials with Robertson's campaign said his contention was
based on information supplied by David S. Sullivan, a staff member
of the Republican minority on the Democratic-controlled Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   But Sullivan said Monday in an interview with The Associated
Press that ``we do not know whether nuclear weapons are in Cuba or
not.''

<HEAD>Dole Backers Denounce Puerto Rico GOP Straw Poll As Illegal; Bush
Wins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of George Bush are
claiming an overwhelming victory in a Republican straw poll, but
Bob Dole's backers boycotted the vote and say they'll win when it
counts _ on primary election day.
   Bush garnered 731 votes while Dole got 32 in the presidential
straw poll, which Bush supporters denounced as illegal.
   ``This proves that Puerto Rico is George Bush country,'' said
Josito Dapena, Bush's campaign director for Puerto Rico.
   Dole supporters minimized the importance of the poll _ which is
not binding _ saying the real test is March 20, when Puerto Rico
holds its primary.
   ``We don't participate in straw polls,'' said Donald Devine, a
pro-Dole observer at the assembly.
   There was a bitter dispute when GOP National Committeeman Edison
Misla Aldarondo, a Dole backer, tried to address the gathering to
question whether there was a quorum. He was told he had not
registered as a delegate and could not speak.
   Luis A. Ferre, the local GOP chairman, said the presence of 750
of the 1,500 delegates in the general assembly would constitute a
quorum. Dole supporters said there were only 682 delegates
registered but the Bush forces said more than 900 attended.
   The Dole campaign in Washington issued a statement saying Bush
backers had ``failed ... in an attempt to convene and illegally
poll Puerto Rico Republicans.''
   Monday's assembly was originally scheduled to chose the 14
delegates to the Republican convention instead of waiting for March
20. However, the local Democratic Party went to court to prevent
the primary from being advanced.
   Bush's national campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said the Puerto
Rico results would give the vice president a lift going into the
New Hampshire primary and also ``send a positive signal to other
Hispanic voters throughout the United States.''

   Last week the political spotlight was on a
farm state whose economy has fared poorly during the Reagan years.
Now it turns to a New England state that has been booming.
   Political analysts say economic circumstances may have a bigger
impact on the New Hampshire primary than any momentum from the Feb.
8 caucuses in Iowa, where Democrat Richard Gephardt and Republican
Bob Dole came in first, with Vice President George Bush falling
back to third place behind Pat Robertson on the GOP side.
   ``Iowa was a state that voted for change,'' says William
Schneider, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ``The
status quo candidates were Bush and Dukakis and they both did
fairly or very poorly.
   ``The Reagan legacy and the Massachusetts miracle didn't sell in
Iowa,'' Schneider said. But New Hampshire is ``at the other
extreme, with the lowest unemployment rate in the country and a
boom economy. The status quo is much more popular.''
   Schneider said exit polling in Iowa by the Los Angeles Times
showed, ``the more dissatisfied you were with the way things were
going, the more you voted for Dole or Robertson on the Republican
side _ if you were realy unhappy, you voted for Robertson _ and for
Gephardt on the Democratic side.''
   Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst, agreed that Iowa was ``a
considerable portrait of discontent.''
   ``Bush's screaming one-fifth of the vote was the only vote that
you could really read as support of the president. That's pretty
low for an incumbent vice president,'' said Phillips.
   ``On the Democratic side, it's pretty clear that Gephardt and
Simon and Jackson did better than early expectations. The guy who
ran a little bit behind early expectations was Mr. New England Good
News, the man with the purring economy whose message is for the
yuppies, Dukakis,'' said Phillips.
   In New Hampshire, ``what Dukakis has to worry about is falling
short of expectations,'' like Muskie in 1972, he added.
   Stu Eizenstat, a top policy adviser in the Carter
administration, predicted that the combined Iowa and New Hampshire
results may only show the strength of regional candidates _
Midwesterners Gephardt and Simon in the Midwest, New Englander
Dukakis in New England.
   If Al Gore and Jesse Jackson, the two Democrats with the
strongest Southern ties, emerge as the big winners on Super
Tuesday, then the Democrats may be ``left with no one candidate
showing a national base and strength.''
   ``We'll have sorted out regional candidates with no base
anywhere,'' Eizenstat said.

<HEAD>Reactor Building Roof Fractured by Malfunctioning Fan, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The roof of the Washington Public Power
Supply System No. 2 nuclear reactor building cracked because of a
malfunctioning fan, but the mishap posed no danger, officials said
Monday night.
   During a safety check of a circuit breaker Sunday night, an air
supply fan came on inadvertently and within a few minutes had built
enough pressure to pop about 200 bolts that fasten an interlocking
grid of steel panels in the roof of the building, said Lee Oxsen,
operations director. The bolts are about a quarter-inch in diameter
and an inch long, he said.
   No loud noise accompanied the fracture, and it was discovered
only as a reactor operator noticed the bolts on the floor while
making a routine hourly inspection less than an hour later, Oxsen
said.
   The pressure pushed the roof upward a few inches, and when it
fell back into place there were two seams in a rough T-shape, one
seam about 40 feet long and the other about 25 feet long, said
Barbara Mathews of WPPSS.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified immediately, but
there was no danger to workers or the public, Ms. Mathews said. The
plant was shut down at the time.
   Oxsen said repairs could cost more than $1 million, ``a couple
of hundred thousand dollars a day (for) up to a week.''
   ``These (roof) panels, I should add, are designed to do exactly
what they did,'' he said. ``These bolts are designed to pop'' when
internal pressure reaches a specified level.
   He explained that the pressure system and roof design are
intended to protect the reactor from inward collapse in the event
of a tornado or other severe storm.
   He said an initial inspection indicated the only repairs needed
would be to bolt the panels back into place and restore the foam,
tar and gravel on top of the roof, which is about 120 feet off the
ground.
   ``The whole building is pressurized,'' he said.
   Oxsen said similar accidents had occurred at other reactors,
including the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey about 19 or 20 years
ago. He said he did not know the cost of repairs in that or other
instances.
   The plant at the nearby Hanford nuclear reservation was shut
down Saturday to fix leaks in two condenser tubes in the cooling
system, so ``it was an opportune time to do some other
maintenance,'' Oxsen said.
   The NRC had directed WPPSS to check for potential problems in
some Westinghouse circuit breakers, including the one linked to the
errant supply fan, he said. Both exhaust fans and the other supply
fan were turned off at the time, he said.
   Oxsen said the control panel initially failed to show the supply
fan had come on, and an automatic cutoff system apparently failed
as well.

<HEAD>Palestinian Wounded In Jerusalem; Leaflets Call For `Day of Wrath'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police battled Arabs in violent clashes in
Jerusalem, and leaflets distributed in the occupied territories
called on residents to step up protests and attack Jewish
settlements in a ``day of wrath.''
   The leaflets, which appeared Monday, also asked Arabs to hold
commercial strikes and stay home from their jobs today, Israeli
media said.
   In another development, the army on Monday questioned an Arab
youth who said he and three other residents of the West Bank
village Kfar Salem were buried alive by Israeli soldiers using a
bulldozer after a riot Feb. 5.
   ``I am afraid. I thought I was going to die,'' said the youth,
Abdel Latif Mahmoud Ishtiah, 19. ``I dream about it all the time.''
   Relatives charge that 20 soldiers grabbed the four Palestinians
after the riot, beat them, forced them to lie on the ground and
then poured sand over them with a bulldozer. The four were
unconcious when relatives rescued them after several minutes,
according to villagers quoted in Israeli newspapers.
   Two soldiers have been detained in the case, and further
detentions were expected, the army said. The West Bank's army
commander, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, who ordered the investigation,
said that ``even in my worst dreams I would never imagine such a
thing.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday attacked left-wing
legislators who said soldiers had the right to refuse to obey
orders they considered illegal.
   ``There is nothing more dangerous to Israel than soldiers
deciding what is bad and what is good, which orders to accept and
which orders to reject,'' Israel radio quoted Rabin as saying.
   In interviews with Israeli media, a number of soldiers have said
they were troubled by orders to use beatings instead of bullets to
quell Arab protests.
   In a related development, the Hadashot newspaper on Monday said
three soldiers of the elite Golani brigade were sentenced to jail
terms of at least 21 days for using excessive force against
Palestinians.
   The army said it had no information on the case.
   In Jerusalem, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets in
several locations Monday to disperse stone-throwing Arabs.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said police did not use live
ammunition, but a border police officer told photographers that
forces fired gunshots to subdue protesters in the Anata
neighborhood.
   Officals at Mukassad Hospital said they treated a 23-year-old
resident of the city's Shufat refugee camp for gunshot wounds to
the abdomen.
   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service said the man was shot
during a clash at Shufat. It was the first report of bloodshed in
Jerusalem since anti-Israeli protests began Dec. 8.
   In Jerusalem's Sur Bahir neighborhood, border police fired tear
gas to disperse Palestinians who erected roadblocks of twisted
metal and burning tires. Residents said border police broke into
homes.
   They showed reporters smashed windows, an overturned television
set and the shattered glass panels of a china cabinet.
   Israel radio said 21 Arabs were arrested in Jerusalem on Monday,
bringing to 437 the number of demonstrators detained in the holy
city since Dec. 8. During that period, 54 Arabs have been killed by
Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N. figures.
   In Jerusalem, members of the Gush Emunim settlement movement
said they were printing flyers to be distributed in Arab areas. The
leaflets contain threats that if the protests continue, Arabs might
be ousted from the West Bank, Israel television said.
   In the political arena, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on Monday
called on his political rival, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, to
work out a joint Israeli reaction to the new U.S. Middle East peace
initiative.
   ``It doesn't look so good that when American envoys come here,
it appears there are two governments,'' Peres told Israel
television.
   ``With the arrival of (Secretary of State George P.) Shultz,
despite our differences of opinion, we need to sit together,''
Peres said.
   Shultz is expected to visit the Middle East later this month to
seek support for the U.S. plan.
   The proposal calls for an international opening in April to
launch direct talks on an interim solution for the occupied
territories. Negotiations of a final settlement would begin in
December, regardless of the outcome of the interim talks.
   Peres has accepted the U.S. plan while Shamir opposes key
elements as well as statements by Shultz that Israel must be ready
to trade land for peace.

   Midnight voters in the New Hampshire
mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch gave Republican George Bush and
Democrat Richard Gephardt the winning votes in the nation's 1988
leadoff presidential primary.
   More often than not, Dixville's votes have been a bellwether for
candidates seeking the presidential nomination.
   Bush received 11 votes, Gephardt 4. In the rest of the
Republican field, Bob Dole had 6, Jack Kemp 5, Pete du Pont 2,
Alexander Haig 2, Pat Robertson 1.
   Among Democrats, Paul Simon received 3. No other Democrats
received votes.
   ``In the primary, Dixville has a pretty good record in choosing
the eventual candidates for each party,'' Town Clerk Tom Tillotson
said of past elections. ``It's just when we came to November, we'd
frequently be in the wrong party.''
   Since 1960, Dixville Notch voters have sided with the loser in
all but three presidential elections. They picked the winners in
1972, when they favored Richard Nixon over George McGovern, and in
1980 and 1984, when they sided with Ronald Reagan.
   Few residents of the resort town in northern New Hampshire were
willing to discuss in advance how they might cast their ballots.
   ``Because so many people are asking, the voters tend to not be
committal, even amongst themselves,'' said Tillotson, a supporter
of Vice President George Bush.
   Tillotson's father, Neil, came up with the idea in 1960 of
making Dixville Notch the first town in the first primary state to
cast ballots.
   Now 89 and the town moderator, the elder Tillotson _ who owns
The Balsams resort hotel where the votes are cast and a surgical
glove factory that is the town's only industry _ incorporated
Dixville Notch that year to push the village into the national
spotlight.
   Every four years, most of the candidates or their surrogates
make their way five hours north of Boston to Dixville Notch,
population 47, to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south
of the Quebec border. They are followed by more reporters,
photographers and TV camera crews than there are residents in town.
   Residents take seriously their place in political history. They
make sure to be in their voting booths by 11:45 p.m. so they can
drop their ballots into the ballot box at the stroke of midnight.

   Robert Redford says Paul Newman is probably his
best friend, and he'd like to do another movie with the blue-eyed
actor.
   ``He's the greatest,'' Redford said in an interview with Esquire
magazine. ``Not much I wouldn't do for him.''
   The actor said he's awed by his co-star in ``Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid'' and ``The Sting.''
   After a recent evening with Newman, he said, he found himself
thinking, ``God, here's old Paul. ... He looks great, feels great,
has lots of money, gives to great causes, he's in love with his
wife, he races his cars when he wants to, makes a movie when he
wants to, he's incredibly happy and still has that face that looks
the way it did when he was 20.
   ``God, by the time we got home, I wanted to shoot myself.''
   ``I'd love to make one more movie with him,'' Redford added.
``Just one more. The two of us.''

   Country music singer Lee Greenwood
turned the state Senate chamber into a concert hall when he sang
the national anthem and his hit, ``God Bless the USA,'' in a
special ceremony.
   Greenwood's performance won a standing ovation from senators
during Monday's ceremony celebrating Presidents' Day.
   ``It gives me great honor to be here on the floor and to be able
to sing this humble song that I wrote in 1983, which was more or
less representative of my feelings about how I feel about all of us
who call ourselves Americans,'' Greenwood said.
   The Senate unanimously adopted a resolution to honor Greenwood
and his career in country music.
   ``You keep the spirit going,'' Lt. Gov. John Wilder said as he
presented Greenwood with a plaque.

   Roxanne Pulitzer's version of her
ill-fated entry into high society and her headline-making divorce
has hit The New York Times best-seller list, but her ex-husband
says he's too busy to read it.
   ``The Prize Pulitzer: The Scandal That Rocked Palm Beach _ The
Real Story'' reached No. 10 on the national non-fiction best-seller
list Sunday.
   The book, which calls Palm Beach a ``Buffet Society Babylon,''
is full of gossip about the rich and famous, from Alfred
Bloomingdale to Barbra Streisand.
   Asked Monday about his former wife's literary success, Herbert
``Peter'' Pulitzer said, ``I have no comment on that.
   ``I have two young boys to bring up. That's a full-time job,''
said Pulitzer, contacted by telephone at his estate in Okeechobee
in central Florida. Pulitzer, who has remarried, said he hasn't
read the book, then hung up.
   Roxanne Pulitzer noted with satisfaction that bookstores on
upscale Worth Avenue quickly sold out their first shipments of the
book.
   ``The book is selling tremendously well there,'' she said,
laughing. ``I don't know who's buying it because everyone there
says they're not going to read it.''

   Entertainer Dick Dale, dubbed the
``king of the surf guitar'' in his 1960s musical heydey, is riding
a new wave of popularity that includes a first-ever Grammy Award
nomination.
   Fifteen miles inland from the landmark Southern California
beachfront mansion he lost in bankruptcy proceedings, Dale, 50,
recently discussed his rediscovered optimism.
   ``All I want to do is sit on my porch and make enough money to
play with my toys,'' said Dale, whose 1960s hits included ``The
Wedge'' and ``Let's Go Trippin.'''
   ``I don't want the fame,'' he said. ``That's a killer. I don't
need that or want that anymore.''
   But Dale doesn't entirely dismiss his nomination for a Grammy
with Stevie Ray Vaughan for a duet of the surf classic ``Pipeline''
for the movie ``Back to the Beach.''
   ``I never dreamed of a Grammy and then somebody is calling me up
to congratulate me,'' said Dale, who plans to fly to New York for
the March 2 award ceremonies.
   Dale and Vaughn have formidable competition in the best rock
instrumental performance category: Bruce Springsteen, Frank Zappa
and Herbie Hancock.

   After being honored for 50 years of selling
Avon products door to door, 91-year-old Rosie Gries said she was
ready and willing to keep on pounding the pavement.
   ``I want to make it up to 100,'' Ms. Gries of Goodrich said
Monday, speaking in an easily detectable German accent. ``And if I
can still walk, I'd like to keep selling Avon.''
   Avon Products Inc. executives, fellow salespeople and family
members looked on as Ms. Gries received a gold watch and 50 roses.
   Before the presentation, Ms. Gries recounted her start with the
company, her appearance on ``The Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson
in 1986, and the new car she received from Avon after that national
TV debut.
   She said her first years with the company at the end of the
Great Depression were tough. Hand cream sold for 10 cents a tube
then, but many people didn't have money for luxuries like
cosmetics, Ms. Gries said.
   But she plugged away, and even though the population of Goodrich
and surrounding towns in her sales area is shrinking, she still was
among a handful of sales representatives honored at the meeting for
selling more than $8,500 worth of products in the last year.
   ``I learned never to give up the ship,'' she said. ``Push, push
forward.''

   Vice President George Bush forecast a win
but Sen. Bob Dole also expressed optimism Monday as the GOP
presidential field sprinted for the finish line in a tight New
Hampshire primary race. Democrat Michael Dukakis said his expected
win might be smaller than predicted.
   ``I sense a rising tide,'' said Bush. The vice president threw
all the resources he could muster into his bid to arrest Dole's
week-long surge, campaigning side by side and in a hurriedly taped
television commercial with Barry Goldwater, patron saint of
conservatives.
   ``It feels good, like it did in Iowa last Monday,'' countered
Dole, hoping to ride to victory on the strength of the momentum
spawned by last week's caucus win.
   One candidate after another posted hopeful predictions of a
surprise when New Hampshire voters render their verdict in the
nation's lead-off primary on Tuesday.
   ``I don't know where all those political pundits are today but
they ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run for
cover tomorrow,'' said former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, back in
the pack in the GOP race.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, his GOP candidacy on the line, held out the hope
of a second-place finish that would confound the pollsters. ``I'm
going to finish in a good competitive third or higher,'' he said.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, also facing tough times if he
falters, said he was sure he'd defeat Rep. Richard Gephardt for
second place. Referring to Dukakis' commanding lead in the polls,
he said, ``I think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming
tomorrow.''
   Fellow Democrat Bruce Babbitt, far off the pace in the polls,
said, ``I'm anticipating a strong showing and a surprise but I
can't put a number on it.''
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson bid to deal with a
tempest that arose over his claim that the Soviet Union has
offensive nulcear missiles in Cuba. The Reagan administration
denied the claim, but the GOP hopeful said, ``The least we can do
is remove those nuclear missiles.''
   Democrat Dukakis' lead seemed secure, to judge by the polls, but
he and his aides worried that they would be held to an impossible
standard when the New Hampshire results are analyzed. Thus, he
noted that his rivals have been attacking him regularly, adding,
``I assume that's going to take its toll.''
   No two polls were alike. But they all showed a Republican race
as close as the Democratic campaign was not.
   First results from New Hampshire, as usual, came from the
mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch, where midnight voters favored
Bush and Gephardt, who claimed 11 and 4 votes respectively.
   In the rest of the Republican field, Dole had 6, Kemp 5, du Pont
2, Alexander Haig 2, Robertson 1. The only Democrat besides
Gephardt to get any votes was Simon, who received 3.
   Dukakis, governor in next-door Massachusetts, held a commanding
lead among the Democrats with support of roughly 40 percent of the
voters. Gephardt and Simon, who finished a close one-two in Iowa's
caucuses last week, are in a duel for second place. Jesse Jackson,
Babbitt, Gary Hart and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. are far afield in the
polls.
   Among the Republicans, the surveys said that Dole has wiped out
all of Bush's once-commanding lead in the eight days since the
Kansas senator won the Iowa caucuses and the vice president slipped
to third place behind Pat Robertson. Robertson, Kemp and former du
Pont are in a close fight for third place in the same surveys.
   What the polls couldn't say was whether Dole's momentum would
carry him past a struggling Bush to first place.
   The vice president had his re-tooled, informal campaign style on
display. He went from one restaurant to another to greet voters at
breakfast time, ordering pancakes at one stop, sipping coffee at a
second and eating an Egg McMuffin during a visit to a McDonald's.
   Bush attacked Dole's call for a spending freeze as a ``copout''
that avoids making tough decisions, and forecast a victory for
himself in the lead-off primary.
   ``I'm going to win tomorrow. Believe me,'' he told a cheering
crowd at Daniel Webster Colleger in Nashua.
   In the five-minute television commercial, Goldwater called Bush
the ``best qualified candidate of my lifetime _ other than me,
George.'' Addressing the voters, Bush said, ``Who can you most
trust to continue the Reagan Revolution?''
   Dole and his senior aides sounded confident. ``I think it's that
close,'' said Dole, who said a victory in New Hampshire might carry
him all the way to the GOP nomination.
   ``I'm always skeptical until the polls close,'' he said, but
then added that he had followed his pollster's example and ``slept
well last night.''
   William Brock, Dole's campaign manager, said that no matter what
the outcome, Bush was a loser in New Hampshire. ``You can't have a
campaign that collapses this fast and have any credibility,'' he
said.
   While Bush bid to salvage New Hampshire, Brock already was
looking beyond.
   As for the Bush campaign's claim to have a ``firewall of
support'' in Southern states which hold primaries and caucuses next
month, Brock said, ``It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.''
   But Bush's campaign manager maintained that Dole's New Hampshire
surge had stalled. ``Bush was a little behind but he's moving up,''
said Lee Atwater.
   Among the Democrats, Simon urged New Hampshire's voters ``to
assert their independence'' from Dukakis. ``There is a difference
between me and Michael Dukakis, a difference in experience, a
difference in commitment,'' he said.
   Dukakis had a speech prepared taking aim at Gephardt and Simon,
but he chose not to deliver it when he faced a high school audience
in Claremont.
   ``This campaign is not about the past, it is about creating a
future in which all of you can work,'' he said.
   Gephardt made no attack on Dukakis or Simon in the final full
day of campaigning. ``Stand with me tomorrow and we will reform
America,'' he said.

   New Hampshire primary voters put their
often unpredictable mark on the 1988 presidential campaign today,
with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis hoping for a neighborly
boost from the Democrats. On the Republican side, Bob Dole hoped to
make it two victories in a row while George Bush banked on a
comeback.
   In keeping with longstanding tradition, the 34 voters of
Dixville Notch cast their ballots shortly after midnight at the
Balsams, a resort hotel, and gave the edge to Bush and Democrat
Richard Gephardt.
   Statewide, about 150,000 Republicans and 115,000 Democrats were
expected to vote, according to William Gardner, secretary of state.
   ``It feels good, like it did in Iowa last Monday,'' said Dole,
referring to the Iowa caucus victory that catapulted him to the
forefront of the race.
   But Bush, who suffered a jolting setback in Iowa, predicted he'd
bounce back in New Hampshire.
   ``I sense a rising tide,'' the vice president said.
   Bush took some comfort from New Hampshire's tradition of
rejecting Iowa winners _ including Bush in 1980, and Walter F.
Mondale in 1984.
   All the candidates _ seven Democrats and five Republicans _
sounded upbeat about their prospects. Optimism was bipartisan.
   ``I hope we are going to do a good deal better than people are
expecting,'' said Democratic Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who
was dead last in Iowa after pulling his campaign out of the state
last year.
   Pat Robertson, who finished ahead of Bush in Iowa, was in a
tight battle for third place in the GOP primary with Rep. Jack Kemp
and former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware.
   ``I don't know where all those political pundits are today but
they ran for cover four years ago and they're likely to run for
cover tomorrow,'' said du Pont.
   Kemp insisted he, too, would fool the pollsters. ``I'm going to
finish in a good competitive third or higher,'' he said.
   Robertson hinted he might equal his Iowa showing and come in
second. The former television evangelist's finish in Iowa was far
stronger than the polls had indicated, so no one was willing to
predict how large his New Hampshire following might be.
   Robertson was trying to distance himself from statements made in
a debate Sunday night, when he said there were Soviet nuclear
missiles in Cuba. That drew a quick denial from the White House and
criticism from the rest of the GOP field.
   He initially stuck by the statement on Monday, but under
questioning, acknowledged he had no first-hand evidence that there
were nuclear missiles on the island.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois said he was sure he'd
defeat Gephardt, the Missouri congressman, for second place. And
referring to Dukakis' commanding lead in the polls, he said, ``I
think there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow.''
   As it has since 1960, the mountain hamlet of Dixville Notch was
the first to report results. On the Republican side, Bush received
11 votes, Dole had six, Kemp five, du Pont two, Alexander Haig two,
and Pat Robertson one.
   The town's seven Democratic voters gave Gephardt four votes and
Simon three.
   ``I don't think it makes any difference if you're the first vote
or the last. It's the vote that counts _ the privilege,'' said Neil
Tillotson, 89, town moderator and the community's patriarch, who
traditionally casts the first ballot just after midnight.
   Gephardt was the Democratic winner in Iowa, and Simon finished
second and Dukakis third in the caucuses there. But statewide
results in New Hampshire were likely to be different.
   Dukakis was the overwhelming favorite with Simon and Gephardt
battling for second.
   Opinion polls consistently gave Dukakis the support of between
36 and 40 percent of Democrats.
   Polls of New Hampshire Republicans showed a dramatic impact of
the Iowa results. Bush, once the choice of 52 percent of the
state's Republicans, entered primary day in a virtual dead heat
with Dole.
   Six candidates appeared at the Mall of New Hampshire in
Manchester on Monday for a ``Rally Finale'' and a chance to pick up
support among the thousands of holiday shoppers.
   From a platform set up between a shoe store and a jewelery shop,
Republicans Kemp and du Pont and Democrats Gore, Simon, former Gov.
Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Jesse Jackson delivered abbreviated
versions of their stock stump speeches.
   Leadership was a campaign theme sounded in both Iowa and New
Hampshire, particularly in the struggle between Bush and Dole. But
the foreign policy debate on the Republican side featured more
hawkish rhetoric in New Hampshire than in dovish Iowa.
   Dole, who rarely mentioned Star Wars in Iowa, made a strong plea
in New Hampshire for development and deployment of the missile
defense system.
   Candidates in both parties also emphasized their fealty to low
taxes, an article of political faith in New Hampshire.
   Bush, who brought in a corps of congressmen to campaign for him
on the weekend, trumpeted the endorsement of former Sen. Barry
Goldwater of Arizona in a television commercial Monday.
   Goldwater, the 1964 GOP presidential nominee and a hero to
conservatives, called Bush the ``best qualified candidate of my
lifetime _ other than me ...''

<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders have assured the
AFL-CIO that its top legislative priority, a trade bill with
mandatory advance notices of plant closings or mass layoffs, soon
will be sent to President Reagan.
   But the House-Senate compromise that is to emerge probably will
not include the strict trade imbalance-reducing quotas written into
the House version by Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., says House
Speaker Jim Wright.
   Wright, D-Texas, told the AFL-CIO's executive council here
Monday he had won assurances from Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd of West Virginia and other key negotiators that the
House-Senate compromise version will be ``nailed down'' by March 23
and on the House floor for final action the following week.
   After slightly different versions won easy passage in the House
and Senate last year, the trade measure became a dead letter when
the stock market crashed Oct. 19 because of fears it would trigger
more panic selling by stock and bond traders.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said last month that
Reagan would veto either version as it now stands as being too
protectionist. The main targets of the administration's opposition
have been the Gephardt language in the House version and a milder
variation of it along with the mandatory 60-day advance layoff
notices in the Senate measure.
   ``No question in my mind, we'll pass a trade bill ... with
enough votes to override a veto, should that be necessary,'' Wright
said.
   He said he met last week with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III and Reagan's trade representative, Clayton Yeutter, expressing
a willingness to compromise and promising them a vote by the end of
the year on a separate U.S.-Canada free trade agreement wanted by
Reagan.
   Both House and Senate versions of the trade bill require
countries with free access to U.S. markets to provide the same
level of access to American exports. If a country does not remove
its tariffs or quotas on U.S. goods, the president would have to
impose the same measures on their exports to the United States or
justify why he would not do so.
   Wright said some version of the mandatory advance layoff notices
will be in the final package despite intense opposition from
business groups. But he indicated the bill likely will drop the
Gephardt language, complaining there is too much of a ``fixation''
on it.
   Gephardt's measure, a major theme of his presidential campaign,
would mandate retaliatory quotas or tariffs on some countries if
they do not reduce their trade imbalances with the United States by
10 percent a year over a five-year period.
   Gephardt's campaign message of threatening Koreans with stiff
U.S. tariffs was credited with reviving his campaign with a victory
in last week's Iowa caucuses.
   Labor leaders said the Iowa results confirmed their belief that
the nation's record trade deficits and their contribution to the
loss of more than 1.5 million manufacturing jobs this decade is a _
if not the _ dominant political issue.
   ``The public will begin to demand more strongly that something
effective be done about this decline of the American industrial
base,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Monday. ``Everything
is going down with it.''
   Wright agreed, saying wage scales in many countries with the
biggest U.S. trade imbalances ``are so far below those of the
United States that they are acutally depressing wage scales and the
standard of living in our country.''
   Nonetheless, he predicted the House-Senate conferees will agree
on ``something in between'' Gephardt's language and the Senate
version, which targets raising exports to countries with large
trade surpluses rather than mandating specific trade imbalance
reductions.

   Authorities cut telephone lines of
leading Lithuanian nationalists and warned citizens of the Soviet
republic that protests marking Lithuania's short-lived independence
would not be tolerated.
   On Monday, 2,000 people attended an officially-staged rally in
central Vilnius to protest alleged U.S. interference in Baltic
affairs.
   Most participants kept their hands in their pockets and chatted
with neighbors during the hourlong rally, then disappeared down the
narrow streets of the republic's capital.
   Uniformed and plainclothes police flooded a main street,
cemetery and square where dissidents planned demonstrations today,
the 70th anniversary of Lithuania's declaration of independence.
   Moscow dissidents said nationalists planned to lay wreaths today
at such sites in Vilnius and Kaunas, the republic's second largest
city and the spiritual center of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic
church.
   Lithuanian Foreign Minister Vladislavis Mikuciauskas was asked
by foreign journalists Monday if people could mark the independence
day.
   ``Personally, yes. But it is forbidden to organize anything,''
he said.
   The Moscow-based correspondents, barred from traveling to
Lithuania on their own, came to Vilnius on a tour organized by the
Foreign Ministry.
   In 1940, the Soviets took over the three Baltic states _
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia _ under a secret non-aggression pact
that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the previous year.
   The states had a stormy independence between the world wars,
variously occupied by the Germans, Poles and Russians.
   About 80 percent of Lithuania's 3.6 million people are of
Lithuanian descent, the highest percentage of native population of
any of the Baltic republics.
   Lithuanian nationalist Nijole Sadunaite said Communist
authorities had distributed a warning in offices and factories that
taking part in protests today would be considered an ``anti-Soviet
act.''
   The crackdown marked a hardening of the Kremlin's line on
protests by nationalist groups. Officials allowed peaceful
demonstrations in the Baltic states on Aug. 23, the anniversary of
the non-aggression pact.
   The United States never recognized the incorporation of the
Baltic states by the Soviet Union, and U.S. politicians still speak
out in support of Baltic nationalists.
   During Monday's official rally, one elderly man said Vilnius
factory and office workers had been forced to attend the rally. The
man refused to give his name, saying he feared arrest.
   ``They just drove them in,'' he said. ``It's that simple.''
   Another participant said each Vilnius workplace had been told to
provide 10 people for the rally held next to the city's former
Roman Catholic cathedral, which now houses an art gallery.
   Ms. Sadunaite, 49, who served three years in a labor camp and
three more in internal exile for her role in publishing underground
Catholic literature, said her apartment was under KGB guard and
that her phone was disconnected without explanation Sunday.
   ``They shut it off at 10 a.m. without giving me notice,'' she
said, speaking to The Associated Press from her office.
   Ms. Sadunaite said the home phones of other Lithuanian activists
including former political prisoner Povilas Peceliunas also were
disconnected.
   She said more than 100,000 Lithuanians attended services Sunday
at Vilnius' 17 functioning Catholic churches and left singing
traditional national songs.
   In Kaunas, she said hundreds of people visited the grave of a
national poet, and an undetermined number were beaten by police.
   When Latvians tried to celebrate their national day on Nov. 18,
police and vigilantes were deployed to keep demonstrators from
approaching national monuments.
   Estonian nationalists plan to mark the anniversary of their
declaration of independence on Feb. 24.

<HEAD>MIT Study Identifies Weaknesses In American Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poor management, an inability to cooperate, and a
preoccupation with short-term profits are among reasons American
business is losing ground to foreign competitors, says the first
report of the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity.
   The U.S. economy is still the most productive in the world, but
could be surpassed by other nations that are gaining on it, the
commission reported Monday at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
   ``We are talking about keeping the standard of living in the
United States and enhancing it,'' said Michael L. Dertouzos,
director of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and chairman of the
commission. ``In that sense, we think productivity is important.''
   The commission was appointed in December 1986 by MIT President
Paul E. Gray. Its 18 MIT scientists, engineers, political
scientists and economists _ including Robert Solow, last year's
winner of the Nobel Prize in economics _ were asked to determine
the causes of the weakness in U.S. productivity and to make
recommendations to industry, universities and government concerning
what might be done to correct it.
   In its interim report Monday, the commission listed what it
believes to be the five principal causes of the decline in American
productivity.
   They are:
   _ Excessive attention to activities and investments that are
profitable in the short run. America invented the transistor radio,
color television and the video cassette recorder, Dertouzos said.
American businesses quickly lost interest in producing them,
however, and lost those markets to Japan.
   _ Parochial attitudes that led American businesses to pay
insufficient attention to foreign competitors. In the machine-tool
industry, American firms tried to backlog orders rather than
aggressively deliver products on time. Japanese firms promised
quicker delivery and captured much of the market, Dertouzos said.
   _ A lack of cooperation within firms, among competing firms and
between firms and their suppliers. One reason that Japanese
automakers can bring new cars to market faster than those in the
United States is that Japanese designers and production engineers
work together more closely than their American counterparts,
Dertouzos said.
   ``That's endemic to our educational system,'' said Lester
Thurow, a commission member and the dean of the MIT Sloan School of
Management. ``We throw you out of school if you cooperate on an
exam _ it's called cheating.''
   _ Weaknesses in human resource management. ``The worker is
viewed as a cost factor to be minimized, rather than as an evolving
human resource that has to be educated, motivated,'' Dertouzos said.
   _ Failures in applying technology to make simple, reliable,
high-quality products. In the case of VCRs, the Americans who
invented them couldn't develop production lines that would meet the
close tolerances necessary and would do so at an acceptable cost,
Dertouzos said.
   Thurow said the United States clings to certain practices that
might have served us in the past, when our economy was far ahead of
everyone else's, but are not serving us well now.
   ``The United States is the easiest country in the world to hire
and fire people,'' he said. It is the only industrialized country
where people can be fired at will, he said. In France, to take one
other example, workers must be given one year's notice before they
are dropped, Thurow said.
   While the ability to fire workers might seem efficient in the
short-term, it provides powerful incentive for workers to sabotage
innovative technology that might cost them their jobs, Thurow said.
   Solow said that the comparatively high cost of borrowing money
in the United States, compared with Japan, makes it more difficult
for American firms to profit from long-term investments.

<HEAD>Residents of Tiny Hamlet First to Vote in New Hampshire Primary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Citizens of the tiny resort town of
Dixville Notch today gave Republican George Bush and Democrat
Richard Gephardt the first bragging rights in New Hampshire's 1988
leadoff presidential primary.
   In the town's traditional balloting at midnight, the vice
president received 11 votes, beating his closest GOP rival, Robert
Dole, who received six. Jack Kemp received five votes, Pete du Pont
and Alexander Haig two each, and Pat Robertson one.
   On the Democratic side, Gephardt received four votes and Paul
Simon three.
   Twenty-nine of the town's voters cast their ballots in
flag-draped, individual voting booths, while five votes were cast
by absentee ballot. Other New Hampshire residents had to wait until
their polls opened beginning at 6 a.m.
   ``I don't think it makes any difference if you're the first vote
or the last. It's the vote that counts _ the privilege,'' said Town
Moderator Neil Tillotson, 89, who cast the first vote in keeping
with tradition.
   And frequently, Dixville Notch voters have been on target.
   ``In the primary, Dixville has a pretty good record in choosing
the eventual candidates for each party,'' said Tillotson's son Tom,
the town clerk. ``It's just when we came to November, we'd
frequently be in the wrong party.''
   In the presidential primaries since 1964, Dixville's voters have
picked winners eight times, a loser once and had two ties.
   But in the November presidential elections during the same
period, Dixville Notch voters have sided with the loser on all but
three occasions. They picked the winners in 1972, when they favored
Richard Nixon over George McGovern, and in 1980 and 1984, when they
sided with Ronald Reagan.
   The elder Tillotson came up with the idea in 1960 of making
Dixville Notch the first town in the first primary state to cast
ballots.
   Tillotson, who owns The Balsams resort hotel where the votes are
cast and a surgical glove factory that is the town's only industry,
incorporated Dixville Notch that year to push the village into the
national spotlight.
   Every four years, most of the candidates or their surrogates
make their way five hours north of Boston to Dixville Notch,
population 47, to woo the handful of voters living 15 miles south
of the Quebec border. They are followed by more reporters,
photographers and TV camera crews than there are residents in town.
   Residents take seriously their place in political history. They
make sure to be in their voting booths by 11:45 p.m. so they can
drop their ballots into the ballot box precisely at midnight.
   ``I think it is an honor to be the first in the nation to vote.
And I think people in Dixville take it very seriously,'' said
14-year resident Gail Barba, a registered independent who favored
Republican Jack Kemp.
   ``We realize there is pressure on us ... and we don't just pick
somebody we don't know anything about. We study the candidates more
and we make a decision based on that.''

   As a political science major, Greg Lunn
knew the job description including the fine print. Still, he never
thought it would come to this.
   ``It is most definitely not the sort of task I had in mind when
I ran for office,'' he said the other day, reflecting on what has
become Topic A across Arizona among residents and visitors alike:
the impeachment of the governor.
   ``And I'm sure,'' he said, ``that I speak for my colleagues, of
both parties.''
   Lunn is one of the 30 Arizona state senators who soon, sitting
as a jury, will decide whether to restore Evan Mecham to office.
Mecham is now in political limbo, impeached by the House of
Representatives 46-14 and his gubernatorial duties assumed by the
secretary of state.
   The next step is a trial in the state Senate, where a conviction
would require a two-thirds vote. The trial is scheduled to start
Feb. 22.
   Judging the fitness of a governor to remain in office seems to
be like cleaning the gutters. No matter how ardent the outcry that
it be done, there is no joy in doing it.
   Stop any senator in the Capitol corridors these days and you
hear phrases like ``awesome responsibility'' and ``no-win
situation.''
   Mecham, a Republican, won the office with less than 40 percent
of a light turnout in a three-way election. ``It is safe to say,''
says Lunn, also a Republican, ``that to the vast majority of
Arizonans he is the worst governor this state has ever seen.
   ``He has polarized the state. Instead of practicing the art of
the possible, the art of compromise, of bringing people together,
he has brought a narrow, ideological and personal agenda and is
trying to shove it down people's throats. Anyone who opposes him on
any basis instantly becomes an enemy.
   ``Even so,'' says Lunn, ``to invalidate a constitutionally held
election is the most sobering act any of us could ever
contemplate.''
   Lunn, 35, has made politics a career. Unlike nearly all other
members of the Legislature he has no other job. He makes no bones
about planning to run for governor himself some day.
   He represents Tucson, one of the state's two urban centers,
where his constituents are about evenly divided between Democrats
and Republicans.
   ``However I vote in the impeachment trial, yea or nay _ and I
won't make up my mind until it's time _ I will not please many of
my constituents. This is true of all of us to a greater or lesser
degree depending on the makeup of the constituency.
   ``But that's good. It will make it easier for us to put aside
any public or political pressures and make our decision solely on
the facts as we see them.''
   Another senator, Carol Macdonald, feels equally free of
political pressure but for exactly opposite reasons.
   She represents one of the most remote areas in the state. Her
home is Safford, a town of 8,000, the largest in the three counties
she represents. She is part owner of the town drug store and served
as mayor without any party affiliation. When the Republican senator
who represented the district for 30 years retired last year her
neighbors voted for her to take his place. She did, as a Republican.
   She says her constituents are predominately Mormons. She is not.
Mormons, who number about 200,000 in Arizona, are divided on the
Mecham issue but nonetheless represent a great deal of his support.
   ``I came here to represent rural people who don't have a lot of
representation in an urban-dominated Legislature,'' she said, ``but
I have absolutely no political ambitions beyond doing that duty as
best I can.
   ``So I feel comfortable about casting a vote because I feel I
can make a fair decision. If it happens that my constituents don't
like it and don't choose to send me back, so be it.''
   Lunn, for his part, expects the vote to be close.
   Mecham, he points out, faces a criminal trial for not reporting
a campaign loan as well as a May 17 recall election resulting from
a public petition.
   ``Even if some senators feel he is guilty of an impeachable
offense they could vote against it as an attack on the fairness of
the process. Why not use one of these other avenues?''
   Well, why not?
   ``Because the people have a right to expect a standard of
behavior in their public officials that does not have as its bottom
line simply acting lawfully.
   ``That's why the constitution provides for impeachment. It is a
political process, not a judicial one. A court trial could be long
and drawn out; if there is a conviction there would be appeals.
   ``There is no short-term way that these matters can be resolved,
but they must be resolved so we can restore some stability to this
state.
   ``That's why I'm prepared to do a duty that is extremely onerous
to do.''

   The mother of a 3-week-old infant who received
a heart transplant says doctors have given her son a 10 percent
chance of survival.
   ``He's in very critical condition. The transplant didn't go as
well as we had anticipated,'' Tabatha Stowe, 20, said late Monday.
   ``They don't quite know yet what went wrong. They don't know if
it was a heart attack or stroke. It (the heart) just got tired
out,'' she said.
   Jonathan Stowe underwent more than 10 hours of surgery Monday at
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said hospital spokeswoman Sue
Cardillo. He is the youngest patient to undergo a heart transplant
at Children's, she said.
   Because the new heart is in a weakened state, doctors have
placed him on a special support system, Miss Cardillo said. The
device takes over the pumping function of the heart, allowing it to
rest.
   ``We hope (it) works,'' she said. ``If it doesn't, he could be
in all kinds of trouble.''
   Jonathan's father, David Stowe, 20, of Beaver Falls, said he
hopes the new heart is ``just tired and will get stronger on its
own.''
   Jonathan was born Jan. 25 at the Medical Center of Beaver
County, weighing 7.9 pounds. Doctors soon became worried over the
failure of his tissues to receive enough oxygen.
   He was transferred to Children's two days later, where doctors
found he had hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, a lethal
underdevelopment of the heart.
   Another infant who received a new heart because of the same
ailment improved to serious condition Monday, 24 hours after his
transplant surgery, officials of Loma Linda University Medical
Center in Loma Linda, Calif., said.
   The infant, called Baby Christoffer and identified only as the
son of an Air Force family, had been in critical condition after
the operation Sunday.

   Thousands of Mardi Gras revelers thronged the
French Quarter today for America's biggest block party, where
madness is a way of life and the only sin is to be a party pooper.
   Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, was the crescendo of two weeks of
nightly pre-Lenten Carnival parades in The City That Care Forgot.
   As early as noon Monday, the lines were a half block long
outside Pat O'Brien's bar, a popular watering hole in the Quarter,
and the non-stop party was just getting started. Narrow streets of
the city's old section were wall to wall with revelers.
   As the party grew, jazz and fireworks heralded the arrival of a
costumed stand-in for Rex, the King of Carnival, who disembarked
from a Coast Guard cutter at the Riverwalk shopping mall on the
Mississippi River just outside the Quarter.
   By midnight, George Moore and his friend Don Granda, both from
St. Louis, were getting into the swing of things at Molly's Pub, a
crowded bar on the Quarter's river edge. Moore said it was his 15th
Mardi Gras.
   ``This has always been my second home,'' he said. ``Last year
was great, and we're hoping good weather will make this one just as
good. If it is, I'll need five days to sleep when I get back to St.
Louis.''
   The first of 17 organizations scheduled to take to the streets
today was jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain and his Half Fast Marching
Club, preceding the real Rex along a route winding past the stately
homes of the Garden District to Canal Street in the central
business district on the edge of the Quarter.
   In the Quarter, women on wrought-iron balconies often bare their
breasts, and gay bars play host to male cross-dressers barely clad
in various combinations of women's underwear, hosiery, high heels,
feathered headresses and beaded gowns.
   Today's crowds could surpass the estimated 1 million people that
jammed metropolitan area streets last year, said police spokesman
John Marie.
   The day officially concludes at midnight tonight with the
meetings of the courts of Rex and Comus, signaling that Mardi Gras
has given way to Ash Wednesday and 40 days of Lenten sacrifice.
   Last year, police were criticized for clearing the streets after
Mardi Gras with a little too much vigor. Assistant Police Chief Ray
Holman said officers will be more gentle this year, but no less
insistent.
   In nine days preceding the 1988 celebration, police had made
1,434 arrests, 79 fewer than last year, a police spokesman said.
   In Mamou, 160 miles west in the heart of Cajun country, Mardi
Gras is celebrated, but in a different way.
   As many as 20,000 visitors were expected to turn out in the town
of 3,200 for Courir du Mardi Gras, or The Running of the Mardi
Gras, in which masked horsemen canter from house to house
soliciting the makings of a giant gumbo. At dinner time, those
still in the saddle gallop into town to toss their gleanings into
the pot.
   The Cajun country towns of Eunice, Lawtell and Ville Platte also
celebrate Courir du Mardi Gras, but Mamou's celebration is the
biggest.

<HEAD>Nicaraguans Complain That Reforms Are Aggravating Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union leader and people in Managua
complained that the government's new attempt to combat runaway
inflation through currency and economic reforms has sent consumer
prices soaring.
   On Monday, the government began trading one new cordoba for
1,000 old ones and raised salaries up to seven times their December
level.
   It also increased prices and ended government subsidies for a
host of staples _ ranging from rice to beans, milk, sugar and
cooking oil.
   Last year, inflation reached at least 1,500 percent.
   President Daniel Ortega announced the reforms in a broadcast
address Sunday, declaring that 10 new cordobas would buy one U.S.
dollar.
   ``The new measures enforced by the government has left us in an
even worse state than we were before,'' said Nilo Salazar, general
secretary of a 30,000- member federation of construction unions.
   Nicaraguans have until Wednesday to exchange up to 10 million
old cordobas at 2,000 booths the government has set up across the
nation. Bank deposits are being adjusted automatically.
   Under the reform package, the government-subsidized price of
gasoline jumped fivefold overnight to 15 new cordobas a gallon.
Gasoline is rationed at 17 gallons a month for private automobiles.
   Salazar said people in his federation say they are worse off
than before.
   As an example, he cited an assistant bricklayer whose monthly
salary has risen from 191,808 old cordobas to 792.50 new ones.
   ``A liter of milk which yesterday cost 2,500 old cordobas now
costs 6.60 new cordobas, or 6,600 old cordobas. That is to say
these prices have gone up more than 60 percent,'' Salazar said.
   The leftist Sandinista government has said the new measures will
benefit wage earners in the long run by reducing inflation.
   The revaluation is also an attempt to do away with the black
market, where a dollar had until Monday been worth up to 60,000
cordobas.
   On the official market used to import machinery, petroleum and
other essential goods, a dollar had cost 70 cordobas, while it was
worth 21,000 cordobas on the parallel market.
   A pound of beef, which used to cost 25,000 cordobas, now costs
35 cordobas. ``That means that an assistant bricklayer has to work
10.93 hours to buy one pound of meat,'' Salazar said.
   An urban bus ride _ which the government won't subsidize anymore
_ will now cost half a new cordoba, against 10 old cordobas.
   ``They (those in the government) think they can deceive
people?'' Felix Carnonel, a 26-year-old carpenter, asked as he
waited in line Monday outside a bank to change his old cordobas for
new ones.
   Angel Moreno, 40, a mechanic, complained that a ``housemaid will
not be able to buy anything with the 500-cordobas (a month) minimum
salary that she gets paid, when a pound of beef costs 35 cordobas,
a dozen eggs 25 cordobas,'' and bread from 7 to 10 cordobas a pound.
   Many of shopkeepers closed their doors Monday to adjust their
prices and to change old cordobas for new ones.
   But at Managua's huge Oriental Market _ a center of black market
dealing in foreign currency _ it was business as usual. Black
market dealers and stallkeepers accepted both old and new cordobas.
   Three days were allowed for the exchange, during which only
newspapers, fuel, medicine and medical services could be purchased
with the old bills. In addition, the government established a
temporary radio service to provide information on the currency
exchange.
   Ortega has blamed Nicaragua's economic problems on the
6-year-old war with U.S.-supported Contra rebels and an American
trade embargo. According to the government, the two factors have
cost Nicaragua $3.8 billion in lost income.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Lower Against Yen; Stocks Climb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed slightly lower against the
Japanese yen today, while stock prices continued to rise.
   The dollar closed at 130.50 yen, down 0.50 yen from Monday's
close of 131.00. It opened at 130.40 yen and ranged between 130.10
and 130.60 yen.
   ``Many traders decided to sell dollars when it hit the 130-yen
level,'' said an official at a Tokyo commercial bank. ``There was
also profit-taking, which resulted in the dollar's decline.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 225.53-point winner Monday, added another 138.19
points, or 0.57 percent, to close at 24,345.66.
   ``The market is recovering from the October crash. We expect the
stock average to hit the 25,000-point level during February and
March,'' said an official at a major securities firm who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Distribution issues such as supermarkets and department stores
were popular. Foods and textiles, along with drugs and chemicals,
were also higher. Among the losers were electricals and machineries.
   Volume was a heavy 680 million shares, up from 650 million
shares Monday.
   The securities firm official said improved U.S. seasonal trade
figures continued to help boost share prices, reflecting hopes for
a shrinking U.S. trade deficit.
   Both the dollar and Tokyo stock prices have surged following the
announcement in Washington of U.S. trade figures for December last
Friday, showing the deficit fell to $12.2 billion from $13.2
billion in November.
   The dollar rose 1.05 yen in Tokyo Monday.
   Some investors on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were focusing on
Japan's January trade performance, traders said. The Ministry of
Finance said Monday that the nation's unadjusted trade surplus for
January was $3.07 billion, down from $4.31 billion a year earlier.
   Other investors were concerned about the dollar's effect on
Japan's seasonally adjusted January trade surplus, which rose to
$7.76 billion from $6.36 billion in December.

<HEAD>Senator's Condition Continues to Improve Following Surgery to
Correct Aneurysm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware continued
to improve four days after surgery to correct an aneurysm in an
artery supplying blood to his brain, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The 45-year-old senator remained in intensive care at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center but was listed in satisfactory condition,
said Doris Nutt.
   ``Senator Biden continues to improve,'' said Ms. Nutt, who read
a prepared statement issued by the hospital. ``His condition is
listed as satisfactory and his physicians are pleased with the
progress he is making.''
   Doctors have limited Biden's visitors to family members only,
Ms. Nutt said. Biden and his wife, Jill, have three children.
   Biden, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, had been
complaining for several weeks about neck pain he thought to be a
pinched nerve.
   Biden was admitted to the hospital early Friday after being
transferred from St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, Del., where he
lives. He underwent eight hours of surgery, which did not involve
removal of any brain tissue.
   The 3-term senator withdrew from the Democratic presidential
race last September following disclosures that he had borrowed,
without attribution, portions of campaign speeches from a British
politician and that he had exaggerated his academic accomplishments.

<HEAD>Car Bursts Into Flames Near 10 Downing Street; Thatcher Unhurt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said no explosive device was found in a car
that burst into flames early today a few yards from Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's official London residence and office, killing
the driver.
   Police bomb squad officers raced to 10 Downing Street around 1
a.m. local time fearing a possible terrorist attack.
   However, Scotland Yard later said in a statement: ``There was no
trace of an explosive device.'' It added: ``At no time did the car
make any attempt to enter Downing Street and therefore the prime
minister was not in any danger.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's office issued a statement confirming that the
prime minister had been at 10 Downing Street at the time of the
incident.
   Scotland Yard said police did not yet know what caused the green
Vauxhall Viva automobile to burst into flames at the entrance to
Downing Street from Whitehall, the main thoroughfare in the area.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said gasoline
cans were believed to have been found inside the car and that one
theory was that the driver deliberately started the fire in order
to commit suicide. But Scotland Yard refused to comment on that
report.
   Scotland Yard said police had not yet established the dead man's
identity. It said an autopsy will be carried out on the badly
burned body.
   ``We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the
incident,'' it said, indicating that police do not believe the fire
was the result of crime.
   ``A car pulled up in Whitehall at the entrance to Downing Street
and burst into flames. The fire was put out by London Fire Brigade
and the body of a man was found inside the car,'' the Scotland Yard
statement said.
   The incident was witnessed by a police officer on duty at the
metal security barriers that separate Downing Street from Whitehall.
   The car had been traveling down Whitehall from the direction of
Parliament, Scotland Yard said. Whitehall was sealed off for about
three hours as police investigated the burned-out auto before
removing it.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Attack on Supertanker Off Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMIR F. GHATTAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq today claimed its warplanes hit a
supertanker in the Persian Gulf after raiding Iranian troops along
the war front.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Iraqi
warplanes attacked ``a very large maritime target,'' a common
reference to a supertanker, off the Iran coast overnight. It did
not give the exact time of the raid.
   The agency quoted an unidentified military spokesman as saying:
``The Iraqi air force will continue to destroy naval targets that
ferry Iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance
the aggression against Iraq.''
   The news agency quoted a military communique as saying that
Iraqi jets flew 60 combat missions earlier Monday along the war
front, ``inflicting substantial losses in men, weaponry and
equipment, then returned safely to base.''
   It said Iraqi helicopter gunships rocketed and strafed Iranian
military posts in 39 sorties, destroying ``many of the enemy's
troop buildups and positions.'' It gave no details.
   Iran did not comment on the Iraqi claims. However, Iran said its
outnumbered air force jets attacked a petrochemical complex and
military installations in southern Iraq on Monday.
   A communique issued in Tehran and carried by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iranian warplanes ``heavily
bombarded Iraqi positions and fortifications'' along the southern
front east of the Iraqi city of Basra, and in Faw Peninsula farther
south.
   Iranian warplanes also attacked a petrochemical complex in Basra
in one of five raids carried out by early Monday afternoon, IRNA
said in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia. ``All the attacking
fighters returned safely to bases after inflicting heavy casualties
and losses on the enemy,'' it said.
   Reports by Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since 1980,
cannot be independently verified because they rarely allow access
to combat zones.
   Iran's air force is outnumbered 8-to-1 by Iraq's fleet of
Soviet- and French-made aircraft.
   However, in recent weeks Iran has used its U.S.-made planes in
several raids, suggesting Tehran may have bought spare parts on the
black market. Iran has 60-70 operational warplanes, according to
Western military analysts.

   Less than a week after deciding to permit
closed meetings during the trial of impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, the
state Senate is considering whether to scrap the idea.
   Senators also decided Monday to reconsider whether to begin the
trial Feb. 22 as scheduled or agree to Mecham's request and delay
it until after his criminal trial.
   Majority Leader Robert Usdane urged his fellow senators Monday
to change rules adopted Thursday that would allow them to hold
closed discussions at the request of only one senator.
   ``Even though it was never the intent of the Senate to hide from
the public, or to railroad or exonerate the governor in private,
the press has intimated that this type of situation would not only
be possible but probable behind closed doors,'' Usdane said.
   In a formal motion filed later Monday, Mecham's attorneys also
asked for open discussions.
   ``Absent a compelling reason, the principals of fundamental
fairness dictates that every moment of these impeachment
proceedings, the importance and gravity of which cannot be
overstated, be witnessed by the citizens of this state and
nation,'' defense attorney Rick Miller wrote.
   ``Surreptitious meetings held in smoke-filled back rooms will
cast a dark cloud of suspicion over the hearings,'' he added,
calling it ``nothing but a farce, sham, and a mockery'' for the
Senate to meet secretly.
   A two-thirds vote is required to change the rules.
   The president of the Arizona Newspapers Association, Joe
Soldwedel, praised Usdane's appeal. ``We would like all of the
proceedings to be in public,'' he said. The Associated Press has
filed a similar request.
   Usdane, in a letter to Senate President Carl Kunasek and
Minority Leader Alan Stephens, urged that all deliberations be in
public and that closed meetings either be banned entirely or at
least require a majority vote.
   ``This will allow the public to know the senators who voted for
a closed conference,'' he said.
   Usdane also said he might boycott closed meetings if the changes
are not adopted.
   Several rank-and-file Republicans said they favored a change,
and Stephens, a Democrat, said he believed his caucus also would be
willing to go along with changes.
   Mecham is accused by a House resolution of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan, lending $80,000 to his car dealership from the
governor's protocol fund and obstructing justice. The Republican
governor has said repeatedly that he is innocent of all wrongdoing.
   Mecham also faces a criminal indictment over the $350,000 loan
and a May 17 recall election precipitated by a petition drive.

<HEAD>Waldheim Refuses To Step Down; Denounces `Slanders'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim dismissed a
rising chorus of calls for his resignation by saying he would ``not
retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and
wholesale condemnations.''
   In a nationally televised speech on Monday, Waldheim said his
conscience was clear about his wartime conduct, and he appealed for
the trust of ``you, my dear Austrians'' and for national unity.
   But by reiterating his refusal to quit in the 14-minute speech,
the president appeared certain to deepen divisions in Austria
caused by a report by a panel of international historians on his
wartime past.
   In the 202-page report issued last week, the six historians
questioned Waldheim's moral integrity, saying he was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did nothing
to stop them.
   Though the panel said it found no evidence Waldheim had
committed war crimes, it concluded he tried to cover up his
involvement in World War II, which was disclosed nearly two years
ago during the presidential campaign.
   The government appointed the panel at Waldheim's request after
the United States put him on a list of undesirable aliens, which
effectively forbids him to enter the United States.
   Walheim, a former U.N. secretary-general, admitted in Monday's
speech that he might have erred in not discussing his past as a
German army lieutenant in the Balkans from 1942 to 1945. But he
insisted he had never tried to conceal it and had ``a clear
conscience.''
   Without giving specifics, he told Austria's 7.5 million citizen
that ``parts of the report do not correspond to the facts but are
built on presumptions and hypotheses. For that reason, the
conclusions drawn cannot be upheld.''
   Waldheim, 69, appealed both to World War II compatriots and
those too young to know ``the horrors of this war'' to judge for
themselves whether ``your president is ... the distorted picture of
this officer of the Wehrmacht _ or ... a man who for decades of his
life worked for justice, tolerance and peace.''
   He said resigning would be against the wishes of those who
elected him.
   Waldheim said a ``convincing majority'' had elected him to a
six-year term in June 1986 and added, ``A head of state must not
retreat in the face of slanders, hateful demonstrations and
wholesale condemnations.''
   Waldheim won 53.6 percent of the vote in a runoff.
   Calls for Waldheim's resignation, including street
demonstrations, have increased since the report was issued.
   In an 80-minute interview for ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program
broadcast early today, Waldheim said his military service in
Hitler's army was a common experience for Austrians.
   ``If one pretends that I was lying because I did not give all
the details of my military career right from the beginning, this is
not something that I can accept,'' he said.
   Serving in the German army was ``the normal fate of a young
Austrian of let's say 20, 22 years of age. To make him responsible
for the wrongdoings of Hitler or the Nazi army, which I condemned,
this in not fair.''
   Socialist politicians, who opposed Waldheim's election as
titular head of state, were swift to condemn the speech. But the
president's conservative backers in the People's Party lauded the
performance.
   The two parties have governed in an increasingly fractious
coalition since national elections in November 1986 left neither
with a clear majority.
   Socialist Party Secretary Heinrich Keller called the speech ``a
great disappointment'' and indicated the country could do without
Waldheim as president.
   The Socialists have stopped short of calling outright for
Waldheim's resignation. On Sunday, however, Socialist Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky said that he might resign if too much of his time
is consumed by the Waldheim affair.
   Alois Mock, Austria's deputy chancellor and head of the People's
Party, said Waldheim's speech was ``brutally open'' and maintained
that the fuss would soon die down.
   But Economics Minister Robert Graf, another leading
conservative, said in a radio interview that Waldheim ``must take a
decision which is very important for our country.''
   In a radio interview several hours before the president spoke,
Graf said he was concerned about Austria's tainted image and
praised the comments Vranitzky made Sunday.

   A federal jury turned down a wrongful death
suit filed by the widow of former Indiana University football
player Denver Smith against the city of Bloomington and three
police officers.
   ``We were disappointed. Very, very disappointed,'' Cynequa
Smith, who had sought $1.8 million in damages, said after the
verdict Monday.
   Mrs. Smith's lawsuit claimed police officers had violated her
civil and constitutional rights, as well as those of her late
husband and the couple's 4-year-old daughter, when they fatally
shot Smith during a struggle over a gun on Sept. 12, 1983.
   Mrs. Smith's attorney, Rich D. Hailey, said he would decide
within a week whether an appeal would be filed.
   Mrs. Smith claimed her husband was mentally impaired when he was
shot. Her lawsuit alleged negligence on the part of Bloomington
police officers Steven Sharp, Randall Keller and James Ratcliff.
   Defense attorney Doug King said in closing arguments Sunday that
the three officers ``did only what they had to, not what they
wanted to do.''
   In his instructions to the jury, U.S. District Court Judge John
D. Tinder said they were to balance the plaintiff's claim that
Smith's rights were violated by the excessive use of force with the
defendant's contention that using deadly force was reasonable
because the officers had cause to believe Smith posed a threat to
their safety and lives.
   Smith was from Dayton, Ohio.

   Share prices opened slightly higher in London
today in quiet trading.
   Dealers attributed the quiet opening to the closure of the New
York market on Monday for a one-day holiday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index was up 3.1 points
at 1,742.3 at 9:45 a.m. local time. When the market officially
opened at 9 a.m., the index was up 2.3 at 1,741.5.
   Major shares were narrowly mixed in early trading. Banks
provided one of the few features with Lloyds up 7 pence at 260
pence and Midland up 4 pence at 412 pence. Dealers attributed the
rise to continuing optimism about resolving the Third World debt
crisis.
   The early trend followed gains in Tokyo overnight, where the
Nikkei index rose 138.19 to 24,345.66. The New York market was
closed Monday for the President's Day holiday.

<HEAD>Three Parents Arrested In Protest Over Transferred Teacher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 15 parents and community activists seized
an elementary school classroom to protest the transfer of a
teacher, and three parents were arrested in a demonstration one
protester called a ``great civics lesson.''
   Parents blocked the door to a room at Brentano Elementary School
on Monday while the third-grade teacher and about 30 students were
inside. They refused to let the new teacher enter to show ``that
sometimes you have to stand up against those kind of policies that
hurt people,'' said the Rev. Bruce Rickley, one of the protesters.
   After a six-hour impasse, the three parents were arrested and
charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanor, before they were
released on their own recognizance, said police officer John Lyons.
The other parents dispersed.
   ``They could go to jail up to a year for it. It is one thing to
protest _ it is another thing to deter the operation of a school,''
Lyons said.
   The transferred teacher, Louise DeGroot, had taught the children
since the beginning of the school year but was not yet certified,
she said. School officials considered her a substitute teacher.
   When a teacher at another school received certification, the two
were directed to switch classrooms as of Monday. But Ms. DeGroot
showed up Monday in her old classroom to protest.
   Ms. DeGroot, 40, said she hopes the protest will persuade the
school board to put her back in her classroom, but she realizes it
may jeopardize her future as a teacher in Chicago's schools.
   Ms. DeGroot was told she was being transferred Thursday after
school was over, and since Friday was a school holiday, she said
had no chance to say goodbye to her pupils.
   ``Children become very attached with a teacher, so it is very
traumatic for them. It's very traumatic for me too,'' Ms. DeGroot
said in a telephone interview Monday night.
   The protesters met Monday night and decided to start picketing
in front of the school this morning, Ms. DeGroot said.
   A teacher ``is not something to be ripped away from them without
a chance to say goodbye,'' said Rickley, whose three children
attend another school.
   Most of the students who were in the room when it was seized
about 9 a.m. Monday were removed and assigned to other classrooms
after police arrived an hour later, said Aracelis Figueroa, a
district superintendent for the city Board of Education. Four
students whose parents were involved in the protest remained in the
room throughout the daylong demonstration, she said.
   ``We figured this kind of thing was a great civics lesson,''
Rickley said.
   Removing their teacher was something the children ``understood
as very unfair,'' said Rickley, who knows Ms. DeGroot from North
River Community Church, the Baptist church where he preaches.
   Ms. Figueroa said Ms. DeGroot ``wants to be placed back at
Brentano, but there is no such thing as assigning anyone
permanently to a school as a substitute.''
   ``A substitute is just a substitute,'' Ms. Figueroa said.

   Hundreds of students rallied in the rain
outside a University of Massachusetts building to support its
occupation by black students protesting campus racism.
   Many of the estimated 200 students held lighted candles and sang
during the rally Monday night outside the New Africa House,
officials said.
   Earlier in the evening, the dozens of students occupying the
building evacuated it after a telephoned bomb threat, said
protester spokesman Dwayne Warren. They returned about 10 minutes
later when campus police found no bomb, Warren said.
   The students said they planned to present a revised list of
demands to Chancellor Joseph Duffey this afternoon, but refused to
provide details.
   Classes scheduled for New Africa House today were to be held in
other buildings because the university does not plan to evict the
students and because several faculty members refused to teach there
during the protest, said university spokesman James Langley.
   ``We see this as a short-term temporary thing. We don't want to
escalate tensions,'' Langley said, adding that officials hoped a
resolution to the dispute could be reached following the meeting
between Duffey and the students.
   The occupiers began getting support from white students Monday
as students began trickling back to campus after a long holiday
weekend. Several returning students said they had left before the
building was taken over Friday, and had been unaware of the protest.
   Between 50 and 200 students remained in the building through the
weekend, said Roscoe Robinson, 24, of Boston, a spokesman for the
protesters.
   ``The number fluctuates as people come and go, but at least 60
have remained in the building at all times,'' Robinson said.
   When asked how protesters were spending their time, he
responded, ``We're studying. We're students.
   ``We've set aside the third floor of the building as a study
hall and some of the graduate students with us, who are teaching
assistants, are working with students,'' Robinson said.
   The students had been scheduled to meet Monday with Duffey, but
the session was canceled because he left campus to visit an ill
brother.
   After becoming aware of the illness, the protesters sent Duffey
a sympathy card signed by more than 200 students. Duffey responded
by sending them a fruit basket and a card reading, ``I send
affection and respect.''
   The takeover was sparked by the alleged beating last weekend of
two black students by six whites following a dormitory party.
   A group of graduate students Monday were organizing an effort to
have white students and faculty wear black armbands in support of
the protest.
   ``It's a symbolic gesture, but the racism on campus has gone on
for too long and is far too prevelant,'' said graduate student
Frank Tripoli. ``It's time to begin putting an end to it.''
   Among the initial demands presented to university officials last
week was that five white students allegedly involved in the weekend
beating be suspended.
   Robinson refused to discuss specifics of the revised demands
until Duffey had a chance to review them. Robinson said the thrust
of the demands remained unchanged, but that the students had
revised the wording to make them more acceptable to administrators.
   About 9 percent of the 25,000 students at Massachusetts' largest
public university are minorities. There are 641 blacks enrolled and
about 500 are undergraduates, Langley said. Total undergraduate
enrollment is about 19,000 students.

<TEXT>
   About 1,300 Chinese students returned home last
year after completing studies in the United States, leaving 27,000
Chinese at American universities and colleges.
   The official China Daily today said 8,817 scholars have returned
from the United States since China began sending students abroad in
1979.
   China's overseas study program has become a matter of
controversy because of the large number of students who are
refusing to come home, opting instead for the better jobs and
living conditions they find abroad. Some of those who have returned
have had difficulty finding suitable work and readjusting to the
rigid political and social norms of their native country.
   The Beijing government last year announced regulations
tightening controls over students going abroad and requiring they
be ``ideologically and morally sound.'' However, officials stress
that China is still committed to sending students overseas to learn
skills needed in the nation's modernization drive.

   Police say they have interviewed about a
dozen people but have made no arrests in connection with fires that
have charred schools and churches and forced children in this town
into makeshift classrooms.
   Six fires have been set in the past three months, starting in
early December, when one of the town's two elementary schools was
torched twice within eight days, authorities said.
   Two churches, which opened their doors as temporary classrooms
for North Omak Elementary School students, and a church parsonage
have been set afire during the last two weeks. The latest blaze
destroyed Omak First Presbyterian Church early Monday.
   Last week, the Free Methodist Church sustained about $200,000 in
damage and another fire set there Saturday caused $30,000 in
damage, said Omak Assistant Police Chief Mike Cramer. Another blaze
hit the Methodist parsonage next door on Sunday, Cramer said.
   Omak Fire Chief Cal Bowling said the latest church fire
apparently was set by an intruder who broke into a basement window
flanked by evergreen trees.
   Fire, police and sheriff's investigators met behind closed doors
Monday to chart investigative and security plans. A $7,500 arson
information reward fund was set up under the Washington Insurance
Council.
   Police Chief Peter Sirois said police had interviewed about a
dozen people, and among them were two of three ``persons of
interest.''
   Investigators also were seeking to talk to four or five more,
Sirois said. He said two of them no longer live in the area but
frequently return for visits.
   He said investigators have ``limited phsyical evidence'' and the
next step is ``just a lot of hard work,'' including stepped-up
surveillance.
   Pastor Elbert G. Harlow, who lives across the street from the
Presbyterian church, said a roving custodian-security guard woke
him early Monday to alert him to the fire.
   ``It's got everybody on the edge,'' he said. ``They're nervous
... waiting to see what's going to happen next.''
   Added Mary Koch, managing editor of the weekly Omak Chronicle:
``It's affected everyone in town. People are very, very grim.''
   Cramer said there was no doubt that an arsonist was behind the
fires in December and January that destroyed the elementary school.
Arson also was the cause of the blazes at the Methodist church, he
said.
   ``They're a kook ... someone who is unbalanced,'' said Vic
Power, superintendent of Omak's school district.
   He said school officials have checked their records for any
former employee or student who might have a grudge, but have turned
up nothing.
   Cramer said the city's eight-person police force is making every
effort to catch the arsonist, whose work is beginning to take a
psychological toll on the town's 4,000 residents and its 1,800
students, including 450 from North Omak Elementary.
   ``When the first fire hit the school it devastated the kids. It
was tough for them to move. Now they're going to have to again,''
he said.
   Counselors and volunteers were helping children and parents cope
with the fires, Power said. The town has purchased trailers that
will be used as temporary classrooms, he added.

   A 25-year-old convict helped bring television to
China's remote northwest by developing a satellite receiver in his
prison workshop, the official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   Ren Huimin, serving a five-year sentence for fraud in a
penitentiary in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's capital of
Yinchuan, also has patented two other inventions, the report said.
   It said the satellite receiver designed and produced by Ren has
made it possible for Yinchuan residents to receive programs
transmitted from Beijing by China Central Television.
   He also invented an ultra-high frequency analogue switch which
turns lights on and off when people enter or leave a room, and an
infra-red automatic alarm used in the prison.
   The report said Ren taught himself physics, chemistry, optics,
electronics and electromagnetics and dropped out of school to do
independent research.

<HEAD>Pakistan Urges Moscow To Rejoin Talks on Afghan Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan today called on the Soviet
Union to rejoin efforts at finding a formula for a future Afghan
government, rather than pulling troops out of that country
unconditionally.
   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry gave a statement to reporters
saying that only by linking its proposed withdrawal to an agreement
on an interim Kabul government could Moscow assure an end to
Afghanistan's nine-year civil war.
   ``The withdrawal of its forces must be accompanied with
arrangements to ensure peace and stability inside Afghanistan.
Otherwise, the tragedy of Afghanistan ... will continue,'' the
statement said.
   A ministry spokesman, who cannot be named under news conference
rules, said Moscow has changed its position on a so-called
twin-track approach to reaching a U.N.-sponsored accord on ending
the Soviet's eight-year role in the war.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued a statement Feb. 8
setting a pullout date of May 15 provided that indirect talks
between the Islamabad and Kabul governments produce an accord at
least 60 days before that.
   However, Gorbachev also stated for the first time that a pullout
would not be contingent on a separate agreement on the makeup of a
transitional Afghan regime which would oversee such a pullout.
   This, according to Pakistani officials, means that fighting
between Afghanistan's governing communists and the Afghan
guerrillas could continue, preventing the return of 3.5 million
Afghan refugees who reside in Pakistan.
   The spokesman also claimed that the absence of a political
accord would make it impossible for Pakistan to abide by a key
element of a peace agreement already accepted by Islamabad, Kabul,
Washington and Moscow: an end to foreign military aid to Afghan
guerrillas.
   ``If the refugees continue to camp just miles from this very
porous border (with Afghanistan), it will be impossible for
Pakistan to guarantee (foreign) non-interference,'' he said.
   The Islamabad and Kabul governments, who have negotiated
indirectly at Geneva through U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez, have
agreed on the principles of non-interference, Afghanistan's future
status as a non-aligned country and the voluntary return of nearly
5 million refugees from Pakistan and Iran.
   At the next round of talks, scheduled for March 2, they are to
concentrate on the details of a withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   Moscow and Washington would serve as guarantors of an accord, as
the United States gives substantial military aid to the Afghan
guerrillas.
   An agreement at the next Geneva round, predicted by Cordovez and
the Pakistanis alike, would ostensibly mark the end of the Soviet
army's involvement in the conflict.
   The Moslem insurgency in Afghanistan began in 1978, before the
Soviet intervention in December 1979, ostensibly at the request of
the Moscow-backed Afghan communist regime and under the auspices of
a Friendship Treaty.
   Western analysts estimate 115,000 Soviet troops are now fighting
Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow the Marxist government.

   U.S. Rep. Dan Mica said he would kick
off his bid for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination despite polls
that show he is far behind his Democratic rival.
   ``I think Florida's ready for a new face. I think Florida is
just going to explode on the national scene in political prominence
and power. We need somebody who can go to Washington and hit the
ground running,'' Mica said.
   The 44-year-old former schoolteacher planned to announce his
candidacy here today at Palm Beach Junior College, then head to
Tampa to start a city-hopping swing across the state this week.
   Mica said Monday he has made 14 campaign-style stops in Florida
cities in recent weeks, and plans to build his race through
face-to-face campaigning across the state.
   ``I'm going to go anywhere where people want to talk to me,'' he
said. ``I don't want to be just a media candidate _ packaged. I
want to discuss issues.''
   After 10 years, he is yielding his seat representing the 14th
Congressional District in South Florida, one of the nation's
fastest-growing. He won his 1986 election with 74 percent of the
district's votes.
   Mica has had a high profile in Congress in foreign policy. As
chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, he traveled to
Moscow last year to probe concerns about security at the U.S.
Embassy. He also has had major roles in such important
Florida-interest areas as veterans' and long-term health care.
   However, initial statewide polls have indicated he runs 6-to-1

Coral, is the only declared Republican candidate.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explodes In Tehran, 10 Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded today in a
residential neighborhood of Tehran, wounding 10 people, damaging
shops and shattering apartment building windows, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The car was parked on a street in northern Tehran, said the
agency, which was monitored in Nicosia. It said those wounded in
the blast were taken to a hospital, where three were admitted and
seven discharged after treatment.
   IRNA said the ``bomb was planted by agents of the world
arrogance,'' but gave no other details.
   The explosion came five days after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
Islamic Revolution celebrated the ninth anniversary of its rise to
power.
   Last month, the official media said four people were hanged in
public for setting off car bombs in Tehran and Bakhtaran, in
western Iran. It did not elaborate on the bombings, but said the
four had been involved in smuggling cars from Iraq, Iran's war foe,
and rigging them with explosives.
   In August 1986, two major car bombings in Tehran and Qom, seat
of Iran's religious hierarchy and 100 miles south of the capital,
killed 33 people and wounded more than 200.
   The bombings were blamed on Iran's largest opposition group,
Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Warriors. The group, now based in
Iraq, denied the charges.

   Inspectors for the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration could shut down unsafe plants and
construction sites under a major overhaul of the nation's primary
job safety law advocated by the AFL-CIO.
   Although no such legislation is under consideration now, the
executive council of the 14.3-million member labor federation said
Monday it wants Congress to change the 17-year-old OSHA law once a
new president is elected.
   ``The act's penalty structure and criminal provisions must be
strengthened,'' the 36-member council of union leaders said in a
statement. ``Those provisions are badly out of date and fall far
short of those provided in more recent safety and health laws, such
as the Mine Safety and Health Act.''
   Inspectors for OSHA's sister agency, the Mine Safety and Health
Administration, now have the authority to shut down any unsafe mine
on the spot. OSHA inspectors lack that power except in rare
circumstances, and even then they must first obtain a court order.
   The AFL-CIO measure also would expand coverage under the OSHA
law to include workers in the nuclear and transportation industries
and some 14 million employees of state and local governments. All
of them are exempt now.
   In addition, it would mandate safety and health committees with
union or other worker representation at each job site.
   The committees would have the right to conduct their own
inspections, review an employer's hazard control measures and
direct a shutdown of a dangerous job site on their own, said
Margaret Seminario, the federation's deputy director for safety and
health.
   The initial reaction by Labor Department officials attending the
AFL-CIO's annual winter meeting here was positive.
   But Assistant Labor Secretary David Demarest said any
consideration of amending the law would first require a major
policy review within the department. That kind of action is not
even in the planning during the last year of President Reagan's
administration, he said.
   Business groups also want the law changed, but in a different
way. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has called for legislation that
would mandate cost-benefit analyses now being practiced as policy
under by adminstration before OSHA can issue new or toughen
existing health and safety regulations.
   The chamber also wants to prohibit OSHA from ``interference'' in
issues that it says more appropriately belong under the
jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, such as
responding to every worker complaint with a plant inspection, as
now required by the law.
   In the past year, unions have helped workers file complaints of
unsafe conditions with OSHA that have resulted in fines ranging up
to more than $2.5 million against companies such as IBP Corp., the
nation's largest meatpacker, and International Paper Co.

   The government said it will grant
political asylum to a Taiwanese dissident arrested last week with a
false passport if a U.N. agency attests to his refugee status.
   Miriam Defensor-Santiago, commissioner of Immigration and
Deportation, made the announcement Monday, four days after Hsu
Hsing-Liang was arrested at Manila airport trying to board a flight
for Taiwan.
   Hsu, who has been banned from Taiwan since 1979, was living in
Los Angeles.
   Mrs. Defensor-Santiago made the offer conditional on Hsu
obtaining a certificate from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees attesting to his political refugee status.
   Hsu was carrying a false Philippine passport when he was
detained Thursday. Customs agents became suspicious because he
could not speak Tagalog, the main Philippine language. Hsu told
reporters he had flown in from California in an attempt to slip
back into Taiwan.

<HEAD>Opinions Differ On Baby Boomers' Role In Presidential Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's baby boomers are poised for the
first time to swing a presidential election, according to a
University of Minnesota research fellow.
   ``There's a good chance the baby boom vote could play a key role
this year,'' said Harry Boyte, a research fellow at the Humphrey
Institute of Public Affairs.
   Boyte said a candidate who shows concern about the economy, job
security, home ownership and the future of children can win baby
boomer votes.
   He said, however, that would require tapping an ``underlying
social concern'' among older baby boomers who fought for civil
righs and women's issues and awakening a political interest in
younger baby boomers who have generally shunned activism.
   But Bill Morris, a private pollster in the Twin Cities, says
``there's a coalition out there waiting to be mobilized'' but that
none of the presidential candidates is doing it.
   But some political analysts say it can't be done because the
baby boomers are too varied to fit under one political banner.

<TEXT>
   The campaign of Democratic presidential
hopeful Bruce Babbitt is selling some computers but a spokesman
says that doesn't mean the former Arizona governor's campaign is
closing up shop.
   The Phoenix Gazette reported Monday that notices were posted on
bulletin boards in Babbitt for President campaign offices in
Phoenix, Washington, Des Moines, Iowa and Concord, N.H., offering
nine computers to staff members for $1,000 apiece.
   The Gazette's story referred to the notices as ``what may be the
most telling indicator of Babbitt's fortunes in Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary.''
   Campaign spokesman Scott Phelps denied that the computer sale
indicated the campaign was closing and said the campaign has more
computers than it needs now that last week's Iowa caucuses, where
Babbitt finished fifth, are completed.

   Humphrey scheduled the announcement for 10 a.m. in the Rotunda
of the Capitol.
   On Wednesday and Thursday, he is to hold a series of news

   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young will be part of a
panel of moderators questioning presidential hopefuls for both
major parties this week in nationally televised debates leading up
to the ``Super Tuesday'' primaries on March 8.
   The presidential debates will be held at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas with the Democratic debate set for Thursday
night and the Republican debate the following night.
   Joining Young on the panel are Martin Anderson, former adviser
to President Reagan on domestic and economic affairs, and
television journalist Roger Mudd.
   Young said he intends to focus first on international and
national economics, his primary areas of interest, but frame his
questions broadly. Young said viewers should expect no twisting
questions from him.
   ``I think it's a mistake to try to trick the candidates, to
undercut them, to put them on the spot,'' Young said. ``Ever since
Gerald Ford made a mistake, or Nixon didn't look good, people have
perceived debates as a pressure cooker which will eliminate

<TEXT>
   When harbor pilot Wright Skinner Jr.
fell into Winyah Bay, he became the fifth person to disappear in
the bay on Feb. 13 in the past 11 years.
   ``I don't think I'll go fishing on Feb. 13 next year,'' said
Dean Jordan, whose father and cousin drowned in the bay on Feb. 13,
1982. ``It is a little unusual because the day my father
disappeared out there the winds were coming from the northwest and
it was cold. These were the same conditions when Mr. Skinner went
out.''
   ``I've heard people call that area in Winyah Bay the Devil's
Triangle,'' said Bobby Goude, who helped search for Jordan's father
and cousin as a volunteer with the Winyah Rescue Squad
   Skinner, a second generation harbor boat pilot, had piloted the
freighter Tropical Sky out of Winyah Bay and was returning to the
trailing pilot boat when he apparently fell from a ladder leading
down to the awaiting boat. He landed in the mid-40-degree water at
3:30 a.m. Saturday.
   Skinner has not been found. Volunteers searched the area for
four hours Monday until foul weather forced them to stop.
   ``We will continue to search until the family says they want us
to stop,'' said Glenn Wilson, chief of the Winyah Rescue Squad.
   The Coast Guard has discontinued its search until further
developments, a spokesman said.
   On Feb. 13, 1977, David Browder and John Stanley Gore went to
search for a friend in their 10-foot outboard. Their boat was found
overturned the following day, while their friend was found safe in
his stalled boat. The bodies of Browder and Gore were found later
in Charleston, about 60 miles south of Georgetown.
   On Feb. 13, 1982, Hubert Jordan Sr. and his nephew David Jordan
left port in their 18-foot boat to go shad fishing. When they
didn't return after dark, a relative, Tom Swinnie Jr., went in
search of them. Swinnie found the bow of the Jordan boat sticking
out of the water.
   David Jordan's body was found 32 days later and Hubert Jordan
Sr. was found 50 days later, both near Charleston, Goude said.
   There are other stories about the mysteries of the bay.
   ``Two guys told me they were out on the bay one time and they
saw three men on a 40-foot shrimp boat out there, and they turned
their backs to the boat for a minute and when they turned around,
the boat and the men were gone and they never found it or the
men,'' Goude said. ``My son-in-law got stuck out on the bay about
two weeks ago and he said he was never going back because it was
very dark and eerie.''

   Thai and Laotian army chiefs today
discussed how to end a bloody border conflict, and a Thai spokesman
said there was a good chance the talks would lead to full-scale
talks between the countries.
   The nearly six hours negotiations were the first between top
officials since the fighting flared in November.
   Gen. Sisavat Keobounphan, chief of general staff of the Lao
People's Army, and Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth, commander-in-chief
of the Royal Thai Army, each led four-man military teams in the
talks in Bangkok.
   The Thai spokesman, Air Vice Marshal Sommot Sundaravej, said
they discussed a cease-fire and how far troops of both sides should
withdraw from the disputed hills where they have fought, incurring
hundreds of casualties.
   The border confrontation is the bloodiest since pro-West
Thailand and communist Laos clashed over three villages in 1984.
   Talks are to resume Wednesday, and both sides agreed not to
divulge details of the discussions until then.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Thin Trading, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against all major currencies
except the Japanese yen in quiet European trading this morning.
Gold prices fell slightly in thin trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they expected little activity in
Europe until U.S. markets opened following Monday's one-day holiday
for Presidents' Day.
   In West Germany, many traders stayed home because of carnival
festivities. Turnover was extremely low and most banks and
businesses in Frankfurt were preparing to close early today.
   ``We are waiting for the Americans to come in, but by that time,
we are already out,'' said one dealer at a Frankfurt bank.
   A trader in Milan said the dollar might pick up in New York
later today in reaction to Monday's report of a narrowing in
Japan's trade surplus to $3.072 billion in January from $8.601
billion in December.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.50 yen to a closing 130.50 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted slightly lower at 130.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates:
   _ 1.7145 West German marks, up from 1.7085
   _ 1.4060 Swiss francs, up from 1.4040
   _ 5.7880 French francs, up from 5.7705
   _ 1.9265 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9180
   _ 1,261.50 Italian lire, up from 1,257.50
   _ 1.27275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2658
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7385 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7455 late Monday.
   Bullion dealers said gold was drifting aimlessly, largely
because so many markets throughout the world are shut, depriving
London of any direction.
   In addition to New York being shut on Monday, many European
centers are closed or half-staffed for carnival and Hong Kong is
closed for the Chinese New Year.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $444.25 a troy ounce and
at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed the
same recommended price. It was down from Monday's late bid of
$445.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $444.75, down from $445.50 late
Monday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.35 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Monday's late bid.

<TEXT>
   Three birth control organizations serving Colorado
and Utah have won a temporary reprieve from new federal rules
barring federally funded family planning clinics from advising
pregnant women on abortion.
   U.S. District Judge Zita L. Weinshienk granted a preliminary
injunction Monday against the new rules, scheduled to go into
effect March 3, sought by Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood of
Denver, Planned Parenthood of Utah and the Boulder (Colo.) Women's
Health Clinic.
   She said the order applies only to the three plaintiffs' clinics.
   ``The order just says the government cannot put these
regulations into effect until we have a chance to hear it in a
final hearing,'' Weinshienk said in an interview.
   The judge said she expected new hearing dates to be set within a
week. She said two similar cases will be heard in federal courts in
Boston and New York this week.
   The Denver suit claims the new regulations violate the Title X
statute and the intent of Congress, censure free speech rights at
family planning clinics and violate the right of privacy of clinics
and their patients.
   The Department of Health and Human Services ruled that family
planning programs receiving federal funds may not provide pregnant
women with information on abortion or refer them to other sources,
even if they ask.
   Reagan administration officials have said the rule is intended
to make sure federal funds are not used to promote abortion, even
indirectly.
   Weinshienk accused the Reagan administration of trying to use
the regulations to circumvent Congress and amend legislation that
set up Title X of the Public Health Service Act in 1970 to provide
family planning clinics.
   ``Legislative history includes a groundswell of support in
Congress for women's rights to abortion even three years before the
Supreme Court decision'' legalizing abortion in 1974, she said.
   She said the new regulations represented a ``180-degree switch''
from past interpretations of the statute by previous
administrations.
   Weinshienk said she based her decision on many U.S. Supreme
Court rulings that barred rules that ``dictated to doctors what
they say to patients, which is what the regulations attempted to
do.''

<TEXT>
   The PLO today threatened to attack
Israeli targets around the world to avenge the killing of three
guerrilla commanders and the bombing of a ferry being readied for a
protest voyage by Palestinian deportees.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has blamed Israel for the
slayings on Sunday and the explosion aboard the Sol Phryne ferry on
Monday.
   ``Israel knows that the PLO is not handcuffed ... The blood of
our martyrs will not go unavenged,'' said a statement issued in
Nicosia.
   The PLO officers _ Col. Marwan Kayyali, Lt. Col. Mohammed Sultan
and Lt. Col. Mohammed Buheis _ were killed in a car bombing in
Limassol, on Cyprus' southern coast, apparently after arranging the
sale of the Cypriot ship to a PLO-affiliated firm for the so-called
``Ship of Return'' voyage to Israel.
   ``We had adhered to the Cairo Declaration to halt military
operations against enemy targets outside the borders of our country
(Israel),'' the statement said. ``It is not logical or possible for
the halt to continue unilaterally. This is a double-edged weapon,''
it added.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat declared during a visit to the Egyptian
capital of Cairo in 1985 that his guerrillas would restrict their
attacks in the Arab-Israeli conflict to targets inside Israel and
halt terrorist attacks on Israelis abroad _ a policy the PLO had
pursued since Arafat took over its leadership in 1969.
   An official at the PLO office in Nicosia said today: ``There are
alternatives. We are not desperate,'' when asked what the PLO
planned to do after the explosion that crippled the Sol Phryne.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not say
whether the PLO has found another boat to charter for the 130
deportees and hundreds of sympathizers and reporters who planned to
go on the voyage to protest the deportation of Palestinians from
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The PLO had tried to launch the voyage from Greece, but it was
repeatedly delayed, reportedly under Israeli pressure.
   The deportees, sympathizers and reporters were taken in buses to
Athens airport Monday and were told they would be flown to Cyprus
to board the boat. After news of the blast reached Athens, most
returned to their hotels.
   Another PLO official in Nicosia had disclosed that the
40-year-old ferry, which was sold Saturday only a few days before
it was to be auctioned, had a hole blown in it by ``an underwater
blast caused by a mine that was stuck, probably by frogmen, onto
the vessel. It was attached to a time fuse.''
   The boat was supposed to sail to the Israeli port of Haifa, but
Israeli officials have said they will refuse to let the vessel
enter their waters.
   The planned voyage resembles in some ways the 1947 trip of the
Exodus, in which Jewish refugees from Nazi death camps were turned
back by British forces as they tried to emigrate to Palestine.
   In Athens, Bassam Abu Sharif, the PLO's chief spokesman who has
been overseeing preparations for the voyage, said on Monday: ``We
are continuing our plans and we will sail, in spite of Israeli
terrorists who are using bombs against ideas, noble ideas.''
   Fouad al-Bittar, the PLO diplomatic representative in Athens,
said: ``The damage (to the ferry) is not very severe.''
   But the ship's captain, Cleanthis Vlahopoulos, said it would
take ``several months'' to make the Sol Phryne seaworthy again.
   A man claiming to speak for the Jewish Defense League on Monday
said the U.S.-based extremist group was responsible for the device
that planted the 6,151-ton Sol Phryne.
   ``The JDL is responsible for the bombing at Limassol,'' he said.
``This is only a warning. Next time we will bomb it with all the
people on it.''
   The man made the claim in a telephone call to The Associated
Press, but there was no way to authenticate it or verify the
caller's identity.
   He said ``no comment'' when asked if the JDL also was behind the
car bombing that killed the PLO officials Snday.
   The JDL advocates use of violence in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
It was founded in the early 1960s by New York-born Meir Kahane, now
a member of Israel's Parliament and head of extremist, anti-Arab
Kach Party.
   The head of the Jewish Defense League, Irv Rubin, told The AP in
a telephone interview on Monday from Los Angeles that JDL was not
involved.

   Daniel Day-Lewis orders most of the women he
meets in his new film, ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' to
``take off your clothes.''
   But in real life, he says, he's nothing like that.
   ``I didn't go around bedding chambermaids,'' he said in an
interview in the Feb. 22 issue of People magazine.
   And despite the sex-symbol status the 30-year-old Englishman is
now enjoying, he says he's mortified about ``the idea of all those
people seeing me nude!''
   Day-Lewis, son of the late English poet-laureate, C. Day-Lewis,
plays in his latest movie a lecherous Czech surgeon who chooses the
``heaviness'' of commitment over the ``lightness'' of freedom. The
movie is based on Milan Kundera's acclaimed 1984 novel of the same
name.
   Day-Lewis, who won raves for his role as a gay street punk in
``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and as a Victorian gentleman in ``A
Room With a View'' in 1986, says he's not worried about being
typecast as a sex symbol.
   If anything, he says, ``I'm in danger of being typecast as a
chameleon.''

   A teacher, a scientist and a linguist
are adrift at sea with only enough food and water for one to
survive before their raft reaches an island inhabited by a
primitive civilization.
   Who should be allowed to survive to enlighten the natives?
   The question of which field of learning is most important may be
as sticky as the one involving the chicken and the egg, but three
professors took it on during a ``raft debate'' at the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga.
   Thomas G. Waddell, a chemistry professor, opened the debate last
Thursday by noting that he knew how to make aspirin, antibiotics
and synthetic fabrics.
   ``If I'm saved, we can wear something besides animal skins,'' he
said. ``Faulkner should not be read nor classes taught while
dressed in animal skins.''
   But Eugene Bartoo, the school's head of curriculum and
instruction, countered the notion of better living through
chemistry.
   ``I'm sure the island is looking forward to polyester leisure
suits, one of the special contributions of chemistry to our
lives,'' he said, before arguing that his ability to train others
to teach made his specialty the most valuable.
   Reed Sanderlin, an English professor and language specialist,
argued that without a means to translate thoughts into written
words, the island's residents would have difficulty teaching others
or assimilating technology.
   ``Mr. Waddell can work magic, but what happens when he dies?''
Sanderlin asked. ``Mr. Bartoo can lead these children along the
beach and show them the possibilities of curriculum reform. But
what happens after that?''
   ``All of these things are important, Sanderlin said. ``The
trouble is that at some points in history you can't have them all
at the same time and you must make choices.''

   Kim Patterson took her fiance at
his word when he said he'd marry her anywhere. So on the big day,
she took Stephen Sweeney to the place where their romance began: a
grocery store.
   Streamers and balloons bedecked the meat aisle at the Mountlake
Terrace Food Merchant for the Valentine's Day wedding.
   Store employees hurriedly rearranged sacks of onions and
potatoes, while surprised shoppers paused.
   Sweeney, 30, took his place in front of the meat cooler as the
23-year-old Ms. Patterson, escorted by her father, emerged through
the vinyl door of the meat locker.
   Sweeney had vowed to marry his sweetheart ``anytime, anywhere,''
so she opted for the place they first met: aisle 15.

<HEAD>Report Says Shanghai Hepatitis Epidemic Under Control</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Shanghai health officials say a monthlong
epidemic of hepatitis is now under control, a report said today.
   The official news agency Xinhua quoted Public Health Bureau
officials in China's largest city as saying some patients are now
being discharged from hospitals and no new cases have been reported
in the past few days.
   Shanghai health officials said last week that 16,000 people in
the city of 12 million had contracted hepatitis, 90 percent from
eating clams contaminated in polluted coastal waters. Western
doctors in Shanghai estimated that the number of sick could be as
high as 40,000.
   Reports from the city said medical departments were adding more
than 25,000 hospital beds to the existing 2,820 in infectious
disease wards. Emergency wards were set up in some factories and
schools.
   The latest report appeared to allay earlier concerns that the
disease would hit a second peak this week as people became infected
from those already down with hepatitis.
   The report said hepatitis, a virus disease inflaming the liver
and causing vomiting, diarrhea and fever, is common to Shanghai, an
overcrowded city with serious sanitation problems.
   It said ordinarily there are 30 to 40 hepatitis cases a day over
the winter months, but in mid-January this year 130 people a day
were being hospitalized.

   Publisher and former Ambassador Walter
H. Annenberg has again remembered his old prep school, this time
with a $10 million donation.
   The founder of TV Guide has now given $30 million to the Peddie
School, from which he was graduated in 1927. Annenberg was not
expected to attend today's formal announcement of the gift, but
Gov. Thomas H. Kean was.
   The gift begins a fund-raising campaign marking the 125th
anniversary of the school, which has 500 students.
   Annenberg's first major gift came in 1983, when he pledged to
give $12 million in installments of $1 million a year. Other gifts
have totaled $8 million.
   In a statement, the former ambassador to Great Britain said,
``The private sector must take over to a greater extent and become
more involved.
   ``Those who are able to must shoulder more of the
responsibility, whether it be in support of independent or public
education.''

<HEAD>Marine Employees Strike Towing Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,500 tugboat workers and other marine
employees went on strike today against nine marine transport
companies after efforts to reach a new contract failed.
   Pickets said they hoped to shut down New York Harbor. ``We're
going to try,'' said Gordon MacDonald, who was on a picket line
this morning. ``It's our livelihood.''
   About 200 pickets went up about 12:01 a.m., said police Officer
Susan Henry, adding, ``It's been real quiet.''
   Police said Monday they were moving to head off possible
confrontations between strikers and replacement workers. Lt. Donald
Boyle said 100 officers would be assigned to watch towing companies
on Staten Island.
   Albert Cornette, president of Local 333 of the International
Longshoremen's Association, said his 2,500 members on Monday
unanimously rejected companies' demands to eliminate 750 jobs and
for wage and benefit concessions from 40 percent to 62 percent.
   ``We offered them a contract to keep them competitive,''
Cornette said, ``but ... all they want to do is break us.''
   He said he proposed the current contract with no improvements
for the next three years. ``But they want to eliminate our pension
plan; they want to take away vacations and eliminate overtime
pay,'' Cornette said.
   Officials of the marine-towing companies refused to comment.
   Salaries for Local 333 members range from $385 a day for
captains to $175 a day for deckhands, based on a 12-hour day with
overtime, Cornette said. He said members earn an average of $35,000
a year.
   It was too early to tell how the strike would affect the
movement of cargo through New York Harbor, according to shipping
officials.
   ``We'd like to make sure the cargo keeps flowing,'' said Gregory
Storey of the New York Shipping Association, an umbrella group for
shipping companies.
   Chief Petty Officer Kirk Wood of the Coast Guard's Governors
Island station said safety zones were being established in New
York-New Jersey waters. This means any ship of 1,600 gross tons or
more must check in with the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Service
before moving in or out of the area.
   Wood also said it appeared that large ships were avoiding New
York so they would not get stuck here without towing service.
   The last tug strike in the New York area ended in June 1979
after 88 days.

   The government plans to enact into permanent law
an anti-terrorism measure it introduced to counter the IRA,
allowing police to hold people without charge for a week, news
reports said today.
   The reports come at a time of worsening of Anglo-Irish
relations. Recently, Dublin suspended the processing of extradition
warrants from Britain.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., the Times of London and other
newspapers said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government plans
to enact the Prevention of Terrorism Act instead of having
Parliament renew it annually.
   The act would apply to all of Britain. To make it permanent,
Mrs. Thatcher must submit it to Parliament for approval.
   The Home Office refused to confirm the reports, but said in a
statement that Home Secretary Douglas Hurd is ``likely to be making
an announcement'' on the matter. The Times said the announcement
would come today.
   Dublin has criticized the act, so its permanent enactment is
thought likely to worsen Anglo-Irish relations, which deteriorated
sharply last month over Britain's refusal to prosecute police who
allegedly killed six unarmed Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland in
1982.
   The act, intended as a temporary measure when first introduced
in 1974 as a means to help combat the Irish Republican Army, is now
also used against international terrorism in general.
   It allows police to hold people without charge for up to seven
days without having to inform anyone or bring them before a court.
   The Irish government of Prime Minister Charles Haughey alleges
that British police have used the act to harass Irish people and
gather information on the Irish community in general.
   In some cases, Irish government ministers have been held at
British airports under the act, leading to diplomatic complaints.
   Critics say more than 1 million people have been detained under
the act at one time or another, but that less than 200 were
subsequently convicted of any offense. British government figures
show that of 225 people held under the act last year only 27 were
subsequently charged with an offense.
   But Mrs. Thatcher's government says the act has played a major
role in fighting terrorism. The government said the act allowed
police in June 1985 to prevent an IRA bombing campaign in mainland
British resorts.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the British from
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under
socialist rule.
   Haughey said after meeting Mrs. Thatcher at the European
Economic Community summit in Brussels on Friday that relations
between the two governments were at an impasse.
   It was the first meeting between the leaders since the London
government on Jan. 25 acknowledged there was evidence of a
conspiracy to obstruct justice following the killing of six unarmed
Catholics by police in three separate incidents in Northern Ireland
in 1982. Irish anger was sparked by Britain's announcement that it
would not prosecute the officers allegedly involved.
   Dublin, meanwhile, has suspended processing British extradition
warrants for suspects wanted in Northern Ireland and the British
mainland, the Irish Times reported Monday. It said the Dublin
government had accused British authorities of failing to comply
with terms of a new extradition law the Irish Parliament passed
Dec. 10.
   The terms include a requirement that supporting evidence should
accompany requests for extradition, and Attorney General Sir
Patrick Mayhew of Britain has refused to do so.
   Irish press reports said that, as a result, Irish law officers
have since taken no action on at least five British extradition
warrants, none of which concerned terrorist cases.

<TEXT>
   A power Sinhalese politician and
popular actor who was expected to run for president was
assassinated at his home today, a day after his political alliance
condemned recent killings by radical Sinhalese nationalists.
   Senior police officials blamed the death of Vijaya Kumaranatunga
on the outlawed People's Liberation Front, an ultra-nationalist
Sinhalese group.
   Kumaranatunga, 43, led the Sri Lankan Mahajana (People's) Party
and was expected to run as a candidate for president with the
backing of his party and two other small leftist groups.
   The popular film star was killed with a submachine gun while
talking to several people in the yard of his home in Polhengoda,
four miles east of Colombo, police said. Another man was injured by
the gunfire.
   Kamaranatunga's body was sprawled under a mango tree, with a
bullet hole through an appointment book he was carrying, witnesses
said. Relatives said he was about to leave for a luncheon at the
American Embassy.
   Besides condemining radical Sinhalese terrorists, Kumaranatunga
was a supporter of the Indian-Sri Lankan peace accord that aims to
end the insurgency by separatists from the Tamil minority.
   The People's Liberation Front has vowed to kill anyone who
supports the accord, and President Junius R. Jayewardene has blamed
the front for the deaths of more than 150 government officials and
members of his United National Party.
   Hundreds of people gathered at Kamaranatunga's home and Colombo
General Hospital, where the politician's body was taken. A scuffle
broke out near the hospital morgue, where teen-agers and elderly
women wailed over the death.
   Kumaranatunga's wife Chandrika, the daughter of former Prime
Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was at the hospital.
   Kumaranatunga was standing in his yard talking to four other
people when two men rode up on a motorcycle at about noon, said
Ignatius Canagaratnam, chief of the police crime detection bureau.
   The cycle passenger got off, opened fire with a submachine gun,
then escaped with the motorcycle driver, Canagaratnam said.
   On Monday, Kumaratunga's Mahajana (People's) Party and the two
other leftist parties issued a strongly worded statement condemning
killings of politicians by the People's Liberation Front.
   Kumaratunga was also one of the earliest and most vocal
supporters of the July 29 peace accord, which was sponsored by
India and designed to end a 4-year-old Tamil separatist guerrilla
war that has left about 8,000 people dead.
   His mother-in-law, Mrs. Bandaranaike, whose Sri Lanka Freedom
Party opposes the accord, was prime minister from 1960 to 1965 and
from 1970 to 1977. Her husband, S.W.F.D. Bandaranaike, was prime
minister from 1956 until his assassination in 1959.
   Kumaratunga's family is Sinhalese, the ethnic group comprising
75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   Tamils, who account for 18 percent, claim they are discriminated
against by the Sinhalese, who control the government and military.
   India sent troops to its island neighbor last July to enforce
the peace pact. After Tamil rebels rejected the accord and went on
a killing spree against Sinhalese civilians, India launched an Oct.
10 offensive to disarm the largest rebel group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   India says between 45,000 and 48,000 of its soldiers are now
deployed in Sri Lanka to disarm the rebels.

   Rio's raucous Carnival greeted the
dawn today with a spectacular but socially conscious samba parade,
capping off a night of revelry that spread from night clubs to the
slums.
   The last of Rio's top 16 samba schools paraded through the
80,000-seat open-air Sambadrome this morning, ending a 12-hour
parade and capping a glittering display of costumes, music and
dancing.
   Samba schools actually are neighborhood clubs located mostly in
Rio's poor hillside slums. Each one composes a samba based on a
historical, folk or political theme and then outfits 4,000 to 5,000
members who sing and enact that theme along the parade route.
   Most of the schools stuck to traditional samba themes. However,
as 1988 marks the 100th anniversary of the emancipation of Brazil's
slaves, this year's parade saw added emphasis on the role of black
people.
   Blacks and mulattoes make up a majority of the samba schools but
in general do not hold positions of wealth or authority in this
mixed-race nation of 141 mi

   A car burst into flames early today about 40 yards
from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's official London residence
and office, killing the driver, and police said no explosives were
found.
   Police bomb squad officers raced to 10 Downing St. shortly after
midnight fearing a possible terrorist attack.
   However, Scotland Yard later said in a statement: ``There was no
trace of an explosive device.'' It added: ``At no time did the car
make any attempt to enter Downing Street and therefore the prime
minister was not in any danger.''
   Independent Radio News said the victim had been out of work for
over a year and had killed himself to protest unemployment. The
unemployment rate in December was 9.7 percent.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said gasoline
cans were believed to have been found inside the car and that one
theory was that the driver deliberately started the fire in order
to commit suicide.
   Scotland Yard refused to comment on the reports or to identify
the badly burned driver pending an autopsy.
   The London Evening Standard identified the driver as Derek
Bainbridge from Worksop in central England and said he gave up his
job as a street sweeper 14 months ago.
   Mrs. Thatcher's office in a statement confirmed that the prime
minister had been at 10 Downing Street at the time of the incident.
   The Scotland Yard spokesman, speaking anonymously, said police
did not yet know what caused the green Vauxhall Viva auto to burst
into flames at the entrance to Downing Street from Whitehall, the
main thoroughfare in the area.
   ``A car pulled up in Whitehall at the entrance to Downing Street
and burst into flames. The fire was put out by London Fire Brigade
and the body of a man was found inside the car,'' the Scotland Yard
statement said.
   The incident was witnessed by a police officer on duty at the
metal security barriers that separate Downing Street from Whitehall.
   The car had been traveling down Whitehall from the direction of
Parliament, Scotland Yard said. Whitehall was sealed off for about
three hours as police investigated the burned-out auto before
removing it.
   Police estimated that the car was about 40 yards from Mrs.
Thatcher's residence. Downing Street is a very short, dead-end
street with No. 10 located toward the far end from Whitehall.

   Four unemployed Tanzanian
teenagers pleaded guilty today to the weekend hijacking of an Air
Tanzania Boeing 737 with 76 people aboard, including Home Affairs
Minister Muhidin Kimario.
   The plane never left Tanzania.
   The youths _ Muhsin Waziri Haji, 17, Juma Hussein Juma, 17, Iddi
Muhamed Hamisi, 17, and Jani Ameir Ramadhani, 18 _ said they were
trying to find a better life in another country.
   They will be sentenced Wednesday on charges of hijacking and
conspiracy to cause violence on an aircraft.
   In court before Magistrate Joseph Masanche, the four said they
started planning the hijacking last March because they wanted to
escape from family and financial problems. All are from Zanzibar,
the semi-autonomous Indian Ocean island that with the mainland
forms the Republic of Tanzania.
   The teen-agers, carrying two toy guns, a knife and a fake
grenade, hijacked an internal flight Saturday night between Dar es
Salaam and Kilimanjaro and ordered the pilot to fly them to London.
   Capt. Dominic Ngandile told the hijackers the plane needed to
refuel and suggested they land in Kenya. Instead, he flew the
aircraft back to Dar es Salaam, where the hijackers were
overpowered and arrested, 10 hours after the hijacking began.
   The flight carried six crewmen and 70 passengers. No passenger

   One policeman and a doorman employed by the training center
suffered from smoke inhalation, police said.
   None of the 80 bank employees staying at the training center was

   A ship carrying 17 stowaways from Romania

group had requested political asylum in Greece, a port authority
spokesman said.
   The Maltese-flagged cargo ship Captain Yiannis set sail seven
hours after docking in Piraeus harbor, said the spokesman, who
requested anonymity.
   ``The stowaways asked for asylum as soon as the ship docked and
we started the paperwork but the ship had to leave and they went

   He said the stowaways, identified only as 16 Romanians and one
Bulgarian, had boarded the vessel in Istanbul, Turkey.
   It was the third ship carrying refugees to dock in Piraeus in
the past four days.
   On Thursday, six Romanians stowaways on two cargo ships from
Istanbul asked for asylum. They were allowed to remain in Greece
while their requests were being processed.

   A few puddles were all that remained of the water at
the Trevi Fountain on Tuesday as surveyors began measuring the
landmark for a facelift, but that didn't stop visitors from
throwing coins into its empty basin.
   The water was turned off so that workers could carry out a
photographic survey in preparation for the first restoration of the
17th century fountain in more than 30 years.
   The restoration is aimed at removing discoloration caused by
smog. The project will last a year but will proceed in stages and
the water will run in the parts of the fountain where the work is
not being done.
   Officials said the work will cost about $830,000.
   The fountain, built of travertine and marble, was designed by
the sculptor Bernini in 1640 and executed by Nicola Salvi 90 years
later.
   Legend has it that a visitor who tosses a coin in the fountain
will return to Rome some day.

   French publishing giant Hachette announced Tuesday
the start of a Chinese edition of the women's magazine Elle in a
joint venture with the government-owned Shanghai Publishing House.
   Hachette, the biggest publishing company in France and the
second-largest in Europe, said the new Elle will be the first
Western magazine edited and printed in China.
   The first issue is scheduled to appear on 4,000 newstands in
July, with a second edition planned for October. Four editions will
be published in 1989.
   The publisher said the new Elle will bring foreign fashion to
Chinese women, and will include international luxury product and
cosmetic advertising, including some ads for items unknown to
Chinese consumers.
   Hachette already publishes versions of Elle in the United
States, England, Spain, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates. Plans are to expand the magazine this year into
Sweden, Brazil, Greece and West Germany. In 1989, Hachette hopes to
begin publishing Elle in the Soviet Union.

   The route is to be marked with 16 shiny black stones, beginning
at the monument to the heroes of the uprising in which poorly armed
Jewish fighters died resisting the final Nazi drive to liquidate
the ghetto's 60,000 remaining Jews.
   One stone marker will be placed near the mound at 18 Mila Street
built on the ruins of the bunker headquarters of Mordechai
Anielewicz, the leader of the uprising.
   It will end at the so-called ``Umschlagplatz'' or ``Loading
Square'' on Stawki Street, near the former railroad ramps. Between
July 1942 and April 1943, the Nazis loaded nearly 300,000 Jews onto
boarded-up cattle cars bound for the gas chambers of Treblinka,
about 60 miles northeast of Warsaw.
   The Umschlagplatz currently is marked by a modest bronze plaque
near a busy gas station, but a newly constructed monument will be
unveiled in April.
   PAP said Warsaw municipal authorities had allocated about
$132,000 for the project. International Jewish organizations raised
about $30,000, with some of the money covering the cost of
importing special stone-cutting machines.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC broke CBS News' 20-week winning streak last
week, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   For the week ending Feb. 12, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had an
average rating of 11.8 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had
an 11.1 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.9 and 19.
   The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with
televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are
tuned to that program.
   CBS dropped to third for several weeks last summer, but
rebounded in September when Nielsen introduced the new ``people
meter'' rating system. All three newscasts have long been engaged
in a tight race.
   Network analysts had no immediate explanation for ABC's showing.
However, last week's ratings could have been affected by coverage
of the Iowa caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential
race.
   ``We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or
coverage of Chernobyl, and with live programming like the Iran
hearings,'' said ABC News spokeswoman Elise Adde.
   ABC's prime-time special on Iowa ranked a respectable 44 out of
68. It followed the conclusion of ABC's miniseries ``Elvis and
Me,'' the season's highest-rated miniseries to date. NBC's Iowa
coverage ranked 63rd. CBS delayed its coverage of Iowa until 11:30
p.m. EST, after prime time.
   The last time ABC was first in news ratings was the week of Aug.
10, 1987.

<TEXT>
   An engineer accused of running a stop signal
and driving three freight locomotives into the path of a speeding
passenger train pleaded guilty today to one count of manslaughter
in Amtrak's deadliest crash ever.
   The state agreed to drop 15 other manslaughter counts against
former Conrail engineer Rick L. Gates in the Jan. 4, 1987, crash,
Baltimore County State's Attorney Sandra O'Connor told Circuit
Court Judge Joseph F. Murphy.
   The crash killed 16 people and injured more than 170 others. The
names of the other 15 victims will be added to the single count of
manslaughter by locomotive.
   The agreement was announced as jury selection for Gates' trial
was to begin. Mrs. O`Connor said the state has reserved the right
to ask for the maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a
$1,000 fine. Sentencing was set for March 29.
   Gates was operating three Conrail locomotives that prosecutors
say ran the stop signal in Chase, and wound up in front of an
Amtrak train traveling about 120 mph.
   After the hearing, Gates told reporters outside the courthouse,
``I am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence.
   ``I can't begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families. I
am sorry,'' he said.
   According to the statement of facts read in court today, the
signals told Gates to slow the locomotives to 30 mph and then to
stop before reaching the switch.
   The statement said that former Conrail brakeman Edward Cromwell
would have testified that he smoked a marijuana cigarette with
Gates in the train cab. However, experts could not agree whether
the marijuana would have impaired Gates' performance, said the
statement agreed to by both sides.
   The summary also said Gates failed to correct five safety
violations before he took the locomotives out of the Conrail yard
for the trip to Harrisburg, Pa., including a failure to have a
working whistle and speed warning light, and adequate train radio.
   Susan Horn, whose daughter, Ceres Millicent Horn, was killed in
the crash, cried and shook her head as the 48-page statement was
read.
   Federal investigators have said Gates, 33, of Essex, failed to
notice the stop signals because of marijuana and possibly alcohol
use. Gates has denied smoking marijuana while operating the train.
   Testimony had been expected to focus on drug use, warning
whistles and lights in the locomotive cab, and a series of approach
signals to the switch where four tracks converge to two at the
Gunpowder River railroad bridge.
   Cromwell has been granted immunity and had been expected to
testify that he and Gates fabricated a story to cover up their
marijuana smoking on the train.
   Chief Public Defender Donna Shearer said that defense attorneys
will try to discredit Cromwell by pointing out that he ran from the
scene while Gates stayed to ``help save lives.''
   Gates' attorneys said they will present evidence that the track
signals often malfunction, contrary to official statements.
   The county grand jury's indictment announced May 4 accused Gates
of gross negligence.
   Gates, who worked for Conrail for 14 years, has said signals
indicated he should slow down and proceed through the switch.
   But the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that
Gates failed to notice track signals or emergency warnings in the
cab because he was impaired by marijuana and possibly alcohol.
Blood tests taken immediately after the accident showed Gates and
Cromwell had traces of marijuana in their bodies, but a recent
court ruling in a different case could have hampered use of this
evidence by prosecutors.
   The men were tested under a Federal Railroad Administration rule
requiring urine or blood samples of any worker involved in a
serious accident, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco ruled last week that such tests are unconstitutional.
   The railroad administration has said it will appeal and the
ruling's effect on the trial remains uncertain. It stands as
official precedent only in the circuit court's area, which does not
include Maryland, but may affect judicial thinking elsewhere.
   Even if the evidence had been allowed, prosecutors would have
had to prove Gates was impaired by the drugs, not just that he was
using them.
   The trial could have implications for government control over
train operators and for more than $294 million in civil suits
arising from the crash. The railroad administration has said the
crash already has helped it in its battle for federal control over
licensing and training of engineers.
   The federal government had no authority to punish Gates or
Cromwell, both of whom resigned from Conrail.

<TEXT>
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim says his
service in Hitler's army reflects the ``normal fate of a young
Austrian'' during World War II and says he wants the United States
to release secret documents about his past.
   In an interview on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' broadcast early today,
Waldheim reiterated that he had a clear conscience and would not
step down as president despite growing opposition within Austria.
   ``I have not hidden anything of my military career,'' he said.
``I think this whole accusation is unfounded.''
   He gave the 80-minute interview to the network Monday,
immediately following a short televised speech to the Austrian
nation. In the speech he said that he rejects the conclusions of a
panel of experts commissioned by the Austrian government to review
his war record.
   In a 202-page report issued last week, the six historians
questioned Waldheim's moral integrity, saying he was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities during World War II and did nothing
to stop them.
   Though the panel said it found no evidence Waldheim, 69, had
committed war crimes, it concluded he tried to cover up his
involvement in World War II, which was disclosed nearly two years
ago during the presidential campaign.
   In his interview with ABC, Waldheim maintained that he could
still function in the ceremonial post of Austrian president despite
the controversy about his past. He was elected in June 1986 with
53.6 percent of the vote.
   The 69-year-old former United Nations secretary-general said the
United States, in putting him on a list of undesirable aliens last
year, had committed ``a serious violation of international law.''
   ``No state has a right to put a foreign head of state under its
own jurisdiction,'' he said.
   Waldheim said he wanted to appeal the ruling and have the secret
documents it was based on made public. But, he said, the State
Department said the only way to appeal the ruling was to apply for
a visa, which he said was unacceptable to a head of state.
   Waldheim lashed out at those who said he is lying about what he
knew and those who cite as evidence that in his writing about his
past he left out the details of his military career. He said his
military service in Hitler's army was a common experience for
Austrians.
   ``If one pretends that I was lying because I did not give all
the details of my military career right from the beginning, this is
not something that I can accept,'' he said. Serving in the German
army was ``the normal fate of a young Austrian of let's say 20, 22
years of age. To make him responsible for the wrongdoings of Hitler
or the Nazi army, which I condemned, this is not fair.''
   At the end of the interview, Waldheim appealed for understanding
from the American people.
   ``If I have misled my friends in the United States because I
didn't say anything as far as my military career is concerned, I am
sorry. ... It was not done purposely. Believe me. And I hope this
will be understood because I have so many friends in the United
States. And I hope they will believe me that I haven't done
anything wrong.''

   Two U.S. Navy warships have left the Black Sea
after an incident last week in which they were deliberately bumped
by Soviet ships off the coast of Crimea, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The cruiser Yorktown and the destroyer Caron steamed
uneventfully through the Turkish Straits and back into the
Mediterranean Sea on Monday, the Pentagon said.
   Spokesman Dan Howard declined to say where the two ships were
now bound.
   The Yorktown and Caron entered the Black Sea on Feb. 10 under
orders to assert international navigation rights. As a result, last
Friday the two ships moved inside the 12-mile limit claimed by the
Soviet Union while steaming past the Crimea Peninsula.
   In response, two Soviet warships deliberately bump the sides of
the Yorktown and Caron, causing minor damage and prompting the
United States to file a protest with Moscow.
   Unlike the Soviet Union, the United States claims a three-mile
territorial limit. The United States accepts other nations' claims
of a 12-mile limit, but it insists that foreign nations honor what
is known as the right of ``innocent passage'' for ships passing
through waters between three and 12 miles offshore.

   A long shot in Florida and a familiar name in Minnesota
announced their candidacies for U.S. Senate seats today, while
Pennsylvania Republican Sen. John Heinz III began his campaign for
a third term at a Pittsburgh subway stop.
   In Lake Worth, Fla., U.S. Rep. Dan Mica said he would run for
the Democratic Senate nomination despite polls showing he is far
behind former Gov. Reubin Askew.
   ``It's going to be a long 10 months,'' Mica, a 44-year-old
former teacher, told nearly 200 supporters and students at Palm
Beach Junior College. ``We're going to walk the state; we're going
to run the state; we're going to crawl the state if we have to.
We're going to win.''
   In St. Paul, Minn., Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III
declared his Senate candidacy after months of testing the political
water.
   Heinz, 49, on Monday began a two-day series of campaign stops to
announce his candidacy by telling a Pittsburgh crowd that economic
aid and help for the elderly are two of his priorities.
   Heinz, one of the wealthiest senators, said he was impatient
with congressional inaction on job-training assistance, trade
legislation, catastrophic health insurance and prescription drug
insurance for the elderly.
   Also Monday, former Philadelphia city controller Joseph Vignola
filed petitions to enter the April 26 primary for the Democratic
nomination to oppose Heinz, great-grandson of the founder of the
food maker H.J. Heinz Co.
   Humphrey is seeking to reclaim for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor
Party the Senate seat once held by his father, the late vice
president, and briefly by his mother, Muriel Humphrey Brown.
   Humphrey, 45, is expected to anticipate criticism from
Republicans and say he is running on his record, not his name. He
is challenging the GOP incumbent, Sen. David Durenberger.
   ``I will not trade on what I have not earned,'' Humphrey said
today at the state Capitol. ``I will build on what I have been
given.''
   Mica said Monday he plans to build his race through face-to-face
campaigning across the state. Initial statewide polls have
indicated Mica runs 6-1 behind Askew.
   ``I think Florida's ready for a new face,'' said Mica, who says
he expects to catch up by mid-summer, in time to win the September
primary.
   U.S. Rep. Connie Mack III, a well-funded conservative from Cape
Coral, is the only declared Republican candidate.

   The New Hampshire of white steepled
churches and tree-lined lakes still exists. But when presidential
candidates want to find lots of voters, they go to malls that could
just as easily be in New Jersey as in New Hampshire.
   Gone are the small southern New Hampshire farms whose owners set
up stands to sell eggs and sweet corn to weekend drivers from
Massachusetts. They've been replaced by high-tech companies and
suburban sprawl.
   Also ebbing is the personal touch that has been a hallmark of
many New Hampshire campaigns.
   There was a time when New Hampshire voters really did meet
presidential candidates, shake hands and question them eye to eye _
met most of them and often met them more than once.
   But most people who voted in the state primary on Tuesday,
especially those who live south of Concord, the state capital, got
no closer to a candidate than their television sets.
   Maybe that doesn't matter.
   Dayton Duncan, who was deputy press spokesman for Walter F.
Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign, is working on a book about
the New Hampshire primary. In four bitterly contested primaries, he
points out, the winner never set foot in the state.
   When Dwight D. Eisenhower beat Robert A. Taft in 1952 and Henry
Cabot Lodge upset Barry Goldwater in 1964, the winner not only
shook no voter's hand, he wasn't even in the country.
   Lyndon B. Johnson beat Eugene McCarthy in 1968 and Jimmy Carter
defeated Edward M. Kennedy in 1980. In both cases the winners were
incumbent presidents under severe challenge. They won without ever
campaigning personally in the state.
   Although he lost, McCarthy did well enough to startle observers
and send the first clear message that Johnson was in political
trouble.
   In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford campaigned three days in New
Hampshire and still beat challenger Ronald Reagan.
   The North Country most closely resembles the New Hampshire of
post cards and calendars. Nestled in the valleys of the White
Mountains are scores of towns and pristine lakes, stands of pine
and white birch.
   But look closely. Also part of that landscape now are massive
condominium developments, second homes to thousands of people in
the Northeast Corridor.
   In fact, candidates run the risk in New Hampshire that the hand
they shake may mark a ballot in some other state.
   George Bush greeted voters at Pheasant Lane Mall, the state's
newest and biggest enclosed paradise for shoppers. It sits on New
Hampshire's southern border and the odds are that the vice
president met more people from Massachusetts than from New
Hampshire.
   Six candidates spoke at a ``Rally Finale'' at the Mall of New
Hampshire. Their platform was set up between the Florsheim shoe
store and Zales Jewelers.
   Huge television screens projected the candidates' images
throughout the covered mall and that was how most people saw them.
Shoppers who tried to crowd in close enough to actually view a
candidate in the flesh were frustrated by a platform set up for
television cameras.
   ``We can't see, we can't see,'' they chanted.
   It was New Hampshire in 1988. At least that's what the sign on
the platform said.

   The Dragon swallowed the Rabbit at midnight
Tuesday, beginning a three-day party and a new year named for the
symbol of China _ lucky for business, marriage and the ``dragon
babies'' born before it ends.
   Nearly everyone in Hong Kong _ wealthy businessmen, factory
workers, maids, restaurant waiters _ left their jobs to welcome the
Lunar New Year with feasts, gambling and visits to relatives with
gifts of candy and ``Lai See'' (Lucky Money) for all the children
they know and many they don't.
   Posters in the gleaming subway system urged celebrants not to
carry such traditional objects as lighted joss sticks and roasted
pigs onto the trains.
   Markets in China were crammed with festival foods, railroad
stations were full of holiday travelers and signs emblazoned with
dragons heralded the start of the year 4686, named for the most
auspicious of the 12 animals in Chinese astrology.
   Thousands of people from Taiwan, to which the Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists fled after the communist victory of 1949, were
expected to visit the mainland. Last year, Taiwan's government
lifted a ban on visits to allow family reunions.
   At New Year, normally thrifty Chinese throw financial caution to
the winds and blow several months' pay on good cheer, gifts and
games of chance.
   Government statistics indicate about 400,000 of Hong Kong's 5.7
million people had left by Tuesday for holidays abroad, and many
more were expected to go.
   The pro-Beijing China Travel Service estimated 1.8 million
people from Hong Kong would spend the holiday in China, primarily
in the neighboring province of Guangdong, where many have their
ancestral roots.
   A company official said about 6,000 people from Taiwan were
expected to visit the mainland.
   Hong Kong businesses began closing during the day Tuesday, in
anticipation of the holiday, which officially ends Friday but will
run through the weekend for many. Extra service was added to the
city transport system to deal with the mobile feast.
   A fireworks display that cost more than $230,000 is expected to
attract hundreds of thousands of people to the shores of Victoria
Harbor on Thursday night.
   In China, the holiday has been renamed Spring Festival for the
1949 Communist victory and traditionally is the most important of
each year.
   State-owned newspapers say the luck believed to accompany the
dragon has led to a dramatic increase in the number of couples
registering for marriage in hopes of having a ``dragon baby.'' The
papers describe the attitude as ``feudal'' and lecture against it.
   Over the past decade, the communist authorities have taken a
more relaxed attitude toward other New Year customs formerly
classified as fedual.
   Folk fairs at temples and former temple sites have been revived,
giving the holiday some of the traditional flavor.
   A temple fair at Dragon's Pool Park in Beijing, one of the
year's special dragon-related activities, attracted more than
50,000 people Monday.
   The fair is the largest in the capital, with more than 10
troupes providing folk entertainment and several hundred stalls
lining the half-mile-long rim of the pool, selling 100 varieties of
snack foods, folk art, toys and clothing.
   Officials have restricted the supply of fireworks because of
casualties and damage caused in the past. The New Year customarily
was greeted with a deafening roar of firecrackers, which continued
virtually non-stop for several days.
   About $2.7 million worth of fireworks were sold in Beijing last
year and some families spent as much as 200 yuan ($54), the
equivalent of two months' pay.
   This year, the government reduced the supply by 30 percent.
Fireworks were blamed last year for 3,040 fires that killed 17
people and caused nearly $1 million in damage.

   Bob Dole dueled George Bush for Republican
advantage Tuesday in New Hampshire's kickoff presidential primary,
while Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis bid for a decisive victory
in the Democratic struggle for supremacy and survival.
   The first returns, as always, came from tiny Dixville Notch,
which gave 11 votes of hope to Vice President Bush and 6 to Dole.
Seven Notchers went Democrat, split 4-to-3 between second-place
contenders Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon.
   Pre-election polls said the GOP race was a tossup, with Kansas
Sen. Dole propelled by victory in last week's Iowa caucuses and
Bush struggling to rebound from a disappointing third-place finish
there.
   Rep. Jack Kemp and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, their
candidacies at stake, bid for third place against Pat Robertson in
the first test for the former television evangelist in a primary
election.
   To a man they said New Hampshire voters would deliver a surprise.
   ``It's going to be an interesting contest,'' Robertson said
during a chance election-morning encounter with Simon. ``I met
three of 'em that voted for me early so I hope that holds.''
   Dukakis' rivals conceded him a victory in advance. They vied for
second place and hoped to deny the Massachusetts governor a huge
victory that would give him a boost for the delegate-rich contests
ahead.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., Jesse Jackson, one-time front-runner Gary
Hart and Bruce Babbitt were back in the pack in the New Hampshire
surveys, with Babbitt and Hart hoping to avoid a drubbing that
would doom their campaigns.
   Gephardt and Simon, who finished one-two in Iowa and just ahead
of Dukakis, engaged one another in an angry fight over some Simon
TV ads critical of Gephardt's voting record.
   ``We're gonna run very well,'' Simon said Tuesday morning as he
aimed to upend the Missouri congressman and further scramble the
wide-open Democratic race.
   Dukakis cautioned, ``Anything can happen. New Hampshire voters
are very independent,'' but he was confident enough to talk about
his plans for March 8 when 20 states, including 14 Southern or
border states, will hold Super Tuesday primaries or caucuses.
   ``We're going to contest every one of those states,'' Dukakis
said. ``I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.''
   In terms of delegates, New Hampshire was small stakes indeed.
Democrats were allotting 18 of their 22 delegates to the national
convention next summer, with 23 spots at stake on the Republican
side.
   But it wasn't delegates that drew the candidates and their
television advertising dollars to a sparsely settled state with a
reputation for upsetting front-runners and elevating upstarts. It
was the prospect of momentum and the ability to attract campaign
funds needed next month.
   Then again, as New Hampshire boosters never tire of pointing
out, no one has ever won the White House without a victory in the
first-in-the-nation primary since the Granite State started going
first in 1952.
   There was every reason to believe that for some, the first
primary would also be the last.
   Babbitt conceded that New Hampshire voters had power of life and
death over his quest. Others were less direct, though Kemp and du
Pont were locked in a struggle with each other and Robertson to
emerge as a conservative alternative to the front-runners.
   Dukakis, the favorite son, had a different concern. His aides
pointed out that the largest margin in history for a contest of
this sort was 11 percentage points.
   And they worried aloud about winners in past Democratic
primaries in New Hampshire being viewed as losers because they did
worse that expected _ Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and Edmund Muskie four
years later.

   The traditional New Hampshire marathon became a sprint this year
in the eight days following last Monday night's Iowa caucuses. Iowa
jumbled the field somewhat, setting up Dole's confrontation with
Bush here and giving impetus to Robertson's hope to outlast Kemp
and du Pont among conservatives.
   Within days of his Iowa victory, Dole gobbled up Bush's once
once-commanding lead in the New Hampshire polls and said a
follow-up win here might all but assure him the nomination.
   The vice president retooled his style and his campaign message
in a bid to regain his footing. Scrapping the trappings of his
office, he largely abandoned formal speeches in favor of
campaigning in a ski parka and driving a forklift around a
lumberyard.
   He pleaded guilty to the faults of poor oratory and lack of
passion on the stump, but said that shouldn't be mistaken for lack
of concern. ``Here I stand, warts and all,'' he said, recalling
Abraham Lincoln's words. If he wasn't embracing President Lincoln,
it was President Reagan, and Bush ended his New Hampshire effort in
the same New Boston, N.H., town hall where Reagan ended his in 1980.
   If Reagan were not coattail enough, Bush campaigned Monday with
New England baseball hero Ted Williams and conservative hero Barry
Goldwater.
   Dole, riding the crest of his Iowa wave, tried not to offend.
``I want to be nice to everybody this week,'' he said. Even so, he
couldn't resist a few jabs at Bush as he vied with the vice
president for the support of Reagan's admirers.
   ``He did what I did in 1980,'' Bush said early Tuesday of Dole.
``He won in Iowa and came in and talked about momentum. I did what
President Reagan did. He (Reagan) came in and started talking the
issues as I've been doing ... and I think it's working.''
   Kemp branded Bush and Dole as certain tax raisers, and du Pont
thrust a ``no-tax pledge'' in front of Dole during a debate and
demanded that he sign it. (He didn't.)
   Kemp, unable to afford a fourth-place finish behind Robertson,
attacked the former minister for ``deliberate distortions'' on his
television advertising and in printed flyers.
   Robertson, whose second-place finish was the surprise of Iowa,
said New Hampshire might be startling, too. But he found himself
embroiled in an eleventh-hour controversy when the White House
denied his startling claim that there are Soviet nuclear missiles
in Cuba. And he was peppered with questions about statements he
made over the years from his TV ministry.
   Dukakis benefited from his decade's service as governor of
neighboring Massachusetts and his long-standing opposition to the
unfinished Seabrook nuclear power plant. His aides watched
anxiously to see whether Gephardt would develop a tidal wave of
momentum following his Iowa win, but it never materialized in the
polls.
   Gephardt delivered the same anti-establishment message that
carried him to his Iowa victory, but he found himself trying to
fend off attacks that he had flip-flopped on numerous issues over
the years, and fell into a nasty battle with Simon.
   ``When you say in a TV ad, `who do you trust,' you're really
bring into play motives, motivation and whether or not somebody is
reliable and I think that goes over the line,'' said Gephardt,
whose campaign demanded that Simon withdraw his commercials.
   Simon refused and said Gephardt was campaigning as a supporter
of Reaganomics in New Hampshire after posing as an opponent in Iowa.
   Gore, a no show in Iowa, spent time and money in New Hampshire
and hoped to develop a non-Southern base. But he diverted some of
his television money off into Southern and border states, a fresh
indication that his eggs are in one basket _ the Southern states
that begin to vote next month.
   Babbitt pleaded with the voters to accept his national sales tax
proposal to reduce the deficit, and he asked voters to prove the
pundits wrong in counting him out of the Democratic race.
   Hart campaigned extensively in the state that catapulted him to
prominence in 1984, and said his comeback would continue no matter
what.
   Jackson, like Gore looking for substantial support in the south,
chastised the others in a debate and urged his rivals to address
the issues. He did better than expected in Iowa and hoped to finish
in double-digits in New Hampshire.

<HEAD>Pentagon Rescinds Ban On Clearances For Naturalized Citizens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon, faced with an adverse court
ruling, has rescinded a virtual ban on security clearances for
naturalized citizens from countries deemed hostile to U.S.
interests.
   A federal judge who barred the Pentagon from enforcing the
regulation against two naturalized citizens from Vietnam was
informed by the Defense Department that the April 8, 1987
regulations had been rescinded and the lawsuit against them was
moot.
   ``United States citizens born in countries designated as hostile
or who have resided in those coutries for significant periods of
their lives will be considered for security clearances on an equal
basis with natural-born citizens,'' government attorneys told U.S.
District Judge Thomas F. Hogan in a memo filed last Friday.
   On Feb. 3, Hogan enjoined the Pentagon from enforcing the
regulations against Phong T. Huynh, an electrical engineer at the
Naval Surface Warfare Center and his sister, Vien U. Huynh, a
computer scientists at the same facility in Dahlgren, Va.
   The two had fled their homeland in 1978 by boat with other
refugees and emigrated to the United States where they both
obtained their formal education and American citizenship. The
Huynhs filed suit to challenge the regulations after being told
they would likely lose their security clearances and their jobs.
   When he granted an injunction in the Huynh case, Hogan urged the
Pentagon to rescind the regulations to avoid a lengthy court
battle. The judge said the regulations appeared to be unreasonable
and unconstitutional.
   The regulations generally barred security clearances for U.S.
citizens who had immigrated from 29 nations deemed hostile to the
United States. Besides Vietnam, the list of countries included
Soviet bloc nations, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Laos,
Nicaragua, Syria and Libya.
   An individual who was born in one of the 29 countries would be
eligible to obtain a security clearance only if the person had been
an American citizen for at least five years or has resided in this
country for at least a decade.

<TEXT>
   Police on Tuesday detained about 150
costumed people who tried to stage a carnival parade in the
southwestern city of Wroclaw mocking the government's economic
reform policies, an opposition activist said.
   The demonstration was staged by a group called Orange
Alternative, whose satirical street theater events are broken up
regularly by police, said Jozef Pinior, a Wroclaw opposition
activist.
   About 2,000 people gathered during the afternoon rush hour to
watch the carnival parade in the city's Old Town, which had been
announced in leaflets scattered around the city, Pinior said.
   But about 30 police vans and dozens of plainclothes and
uniformed policemen were also on the scene to break up the
demonstration, Pinior said.
   ``Second stage of reform: carnival. Third stage of reform:
fast,'' said a banner carried by several of the costumed
demonstrators, some of whom were dressed in penitents' garb, Pinior
said.
   The event took place on the eve of Ash Wednesday, the first day
of Lent, which is widely observed in this predominantly Roman
Catholic country.
   Demonstrators also played discordant music on various
instruments.
   Pinior said police spent more than an hour rounding up about 150
costumed demonstrators who gathered in groups and mingled with the
crowd in the streets.
   In some cases, police sprayed gas from hand-held canisters to
detain individual demonstrators, Pinior said. Police also conducted
frequent identity checks.
   A duty officer at Wroclaw police headquarters refused to comment
on the reported detentions.
   In previous cases, police have broken up Orange Alternative
events and released the participants after holding them for several
hours.

   Marsha Streiff won the Liberal leg of the
Shrove Tuesday trans-Atlantic pancake race for a second consecutive
year today, but for the sixth straight time the title went to
England.
   Mrs. Streiff, carrying a frying pan with a pancake in it,
completed the 415-yard course in 67.7 seconds. That was better than
her winning time of 70.1 seconds last year, but not enough to
better that of Leslie Byrne, a physical education teacher from
Olney, England.
   Running six hours earlier in Olney, Mrs. Byrne turned in a
winning time of 62.9 seconds.
   The British victory tied the series at 19 each. Mrs. Streiff, a
30-year-old mother of three, also won in 1985 and as a three-time
winner will not be able to compete again.
   ``I didn't think of the pancake, I just ran,'' said Mrs. Byrne.
``I haven't done any training, though sometimes when I take the dog
out for a walk, I have a little trot.''
   Mrs. Byrne outpaced 19 other women by about 10 yards at the end
of the 415-yard annual run from Olney's market square to its
14th-century church.
   The competitors all wore the traditional skirt, apron and head
scarf. About 700 spectators lined the twisting route in cool, sunny
weather in the Buckinghamshire market town of 3,300 inhabitants
about 40 miles northwest of London.
   Previously, competitors had continuously to flip a pancake in a
pan as they ran, but nowadays only a toss at the start and finish
is required.
   According to legend, the race has been run in Olney since 1445,
when a forgetful housewife left for church on Shrove Tuesday with
her frying pan still in her hand.
   Shrove Tuesday is the day English women traditionally make
pancakes to use up cooking fat before the start of 40 days of
fasting for Lent.
   After a lapse during World War II, Olney revived the race in
1948. People in the southwest Kansas town joined the race in 1950
to make the contest an international event after seeing reports of
the English competition.
   Mrs. Byrne received her prize of 100 pounds ($175), various
gifts from town merchants, an inscribed silver tray from the town
of Liberal, and a kiss from Clive Coverley, a ceremonial official
known as the town verger.
   Jackie Childs, a housewife who finished second, received 10
pounds ($17.50) and vouchers from local shops.
   A lemon juice company claimed a survey it conducted had found
that at least 63 million pancakes would be served in Britain today
and be sprinkled with 166,000 gallons of lemon juice made from more
than 2 million lemons.
   A host of British celebrities tossed pancakes in a 12-hour
marathon today at London's Waterloo train station to raise money
for charity.

   Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, pardoned 989 prisoners to mark the anniversary
of the Islamic revolution's rise to power, Tehran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
   The agency said 194 prisoners already have been freed and the
sentences on the others commuted.
   All 989 prisoners were detained in the provinces of Yazd and
Isfahan in central Iran, said the agency, monitored in Nicosia. It
did not say whether they had been jailed for criminal or political
offences.
   Khomeini had declared in a speech earlier this month that
special parole boards should review the cases of individual
prisoners, releasing those who had repented.
   There are no official figures for the number of people in
Iranian prisons. Tens of thousands have been detained and thousands
executed for opposing the fundamentalist Islamic regime ruling the
country since the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi in 1979.
The Islamic revolution seized power on Feb.11, 1979.

   The president of West Germany's federal archives
said Tuesday he repeatedly warned American officials at a U.S.-run
Nazi records center that documents were apparently being stolen
from the center.
   Hans Booms said he warned the center's American director, Daniel
Simon, of indications someone was pilfering Nazi records from the
center and selling them for profit through antique dealers since at
least 1982.
   He gave similar warnings to officials at the Interior Ministry
in Bonn, Booms said in a telephone interview from his office in
Koblenz.
   Simon, the director since 1974, said he received tips from
officials at the Federal Archives and eventually passed them to
West Berlin justice authorities.
   ``They notified me of a possible problem in 1982, and I
cooperated with them,'' he said. ``They gave us some tips and we
followed through.''
   Simon said U.S. officials asked West Berlin authorities to
investigate, but he declined to comment further ``because there is
an investigation under way.''
   This week, spokesman Volker Kaehne of the West Berlin Justice
Department said investigators suspect the deputy director of the
Nazi archives center was allegedly involved in the theft of tens of
thousands of Nazi-era documents from the center.
   He identified him only as a West German.
   Kaehne said prosecutors believe the missing documents were sold
to dealers around the world for considerable sums.
   The Berlin Document Center houses up to 30 million files and
documents captured from the Germans at the end of World War II.

   Champion market animals will be tested
for drugs for the first time this week at the San Antonio Livestock
Exposition, but no animal stands to lose a ribbon because of
doping, officials said.
   ``This is the first stock show where anything like this is being
done in the nation,'' Dr. Larry Ehrlund, a San Antonio veterinarian
who is coordinating the tests, told the San Antonio Express-News.
   Show officials said Monday that testing of champion market
steers, lambs and barrows is part of a survey by the Texas
Veterinary Medical Association.
   ``This is strictly for our information and the Texas Veterinary
Medicine Association's information as to whether they do have
(drug) residues,'' said Richard Traylor of the SALE executive
committee.
   ``We have no idea whether we have a problem or we don't have a
problem,'' Traylor said. ``This is more of a survey for
information.''
   Tests are designed to detect 25 different compounds representing
``just about every potentially abused drug imaginable,'' Ehrlund
said.
   Veterinarians are concerned that some show animals might be
given drugs such as diuretics, tranquilizers or anabolic steroids
which give the owner an unfair advantage, he said.
   A similar program will be conducted at the stock show in San
Angelo next month, and at other shows in Texas.
   No decision has been made about releasing the results, or about
what policy to set for next year concerning the tests, Traylor said.

   Ukrainian Communist Party leader Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky has been awarded the Soviet Union's highest civilian
honor, the Order of Lenin, in honor of his 70th birthday, the Tass
news agency said Tuesday.
   Announcement of the award appeared to solidify the position of
Shcherbitsky, long rumored to be in trouble with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform-minded leadership, one day before a plenary
meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   The policy-making Central Committee is the only group empowered
to make changes in the ruling Politburo. Shcherbitsky has been a
full member of the ruling body since 1971.
   Shcherbitsky and his Ukrainian party organization have come in
for sharp criticism for failing to meet targets for industrial and
farm production. In a Jan. 26 report, the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda said a meeting of top Ukrainian party officials criticized
Shcherbitsky and other top officials by name.
   It said local officials receive too many directives from the
top, even though central authorities are inefficient and seem to
not have worked out a general development plan for the republic.
   Shcherbitsky has survived other criticism and predictions that
he was about to be ousted, perhaps indicating that Gorbachev does
not have the strength to replace him or does not want to risk
alienating Ukrainians.

   The president of Mississippi Bar
Foundation Inc. says he will file complaints against a judge who
interrupted a speech by the head of the American Bar Association.
   ``(Hinds County Chancery) Judge (Paul) Alexander's conduct was
totally unacceptable from either a citizen of Mississippi, a member
of the state bar, or its judiciary,'' Sherman Muths Jr. of Gulfport
said. ``In my opinion, he should be both disciplined and punished.''
   Muths said he was filing complaints with the commission on
judicial review and the complaints committee of the Mississippi
State Bar.
   Muths and Larry Houchins, executive director of the state bar,
said Alexander interrupted ABA President Robert MacCrate at the
foundation's 25th anniversary banquet Friday in Jackson.
   Alexander refused to comment on the incident.
   Brant Brantley, director of the state Commission on Judicial
Performance, often called the judicial review commission, said the
commission may take action against a judge for activities on or off
the bench.
   Houchins and Muths said MacCrate was discussing progress
Mississippi had made in the legal sphere and cited examples of
Mississippians who've made a mark on the nation's judicial system.
   Alexander reportedly stood up and commented that he was tired of
the speech, then sat down. MacCrate responded by saying he was
sorry Alexander felt that way, bar members said.

<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of two species of the
daddy-longlegs insect family in Edgewood County Park may block a
proposed 18-hole golf course.
   Both species are called the Edgewood Park harvestman, of
Sitalcina minor. They live only in serpentine rock formations in
the park's hills, and several conservationists want the habitate to
be preserved.
   ``Constructing a golf course would wipe out the whole harvestmen
populations,'' said Thomas F. Briggs, a science teacher at San
Francisco Lowell High School.
   ``These are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world,'' he
added.
   Briggs discovered one of the species in 1983 and the other in
1985. Both have eight legs, and bright orange-red bodies that
measure about 1 millimeter. Unlike spiders, daddy-longlegs do not
spin webs.
   Along with Darrell Ubick, an entomologist, Briggs has submitted
a proposal to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the
species discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected
creature, which could halt any development of their only known
habitat.
   San Mateo County purchased the 468-acre site in 1980 from the
state and has been attempting to build a golf course there for
several years.
   ``This little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a
golf course,'' said Barbara Kootz of nearby San Carlos, a golfer
and leader of pro-development interests in the area.

   The University of Michigan has
established a Center for National Statistics to gather information
on truck safety and truck travel on U.S. highways, the university
said Tuesday.
   The center, which will be financed with public and private
money, will conduct surveys of truck accidents and travel, publish
statistics and conduct research on risk factors in accidents
involving large trucks, according to Linda Wilson, the university's
vice president for research.
   The center will use survey methods that allow accurate
compilation of fatal truck accidents and truck travel. The methods
were developed under an 8-year-old research program supported by
the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and other federal and
trucking groups.

   A minor earthquake shook cupboards Tuesday
near the three-state corner of Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia,
but no injuries were reported, earthquake officials said.
   The quake, which occurred northwest of Bristol at 10:26 a.m.,
measured 3.2 on the Richter scale, said Jill Hart, with the Center
for Earthquake Research and Information at Memphis State
University. A quake of 3.5 magnitude can cause slight damage.
   The tri-state area is seismically active, although it's not
noted for having major earthquakes, Ms. Hart said. The exact center
of the quake was not yet located, she said.

   A West German who was critically injured when a
boulder hit a tour bus needs rehabilitation treatment, but the
state may not pay for it and his family can't afford it.
   Markus Lang is ready to leave Denver General Hospital, where he
has been for the past six months, but no rehabilitation center in
Colorado or West Germany will accept him without assurances that
someone can pay the bills.
   Lang was the most severely hurt of the 15 people who were
injured when the 7{-ton boulder hit the Gray Line Tour bus on U.S.
40 last Aug. 10. Eight people were killed in the accident.
   After seven brain operations and seven operations on his crushed
limbs, Lang's right leg and left arm remain in casts. Vision in his
remaining eye is impaired.
   The boulder was accidentally dislodged by a Colorado Highway
Department crew. Last month, the state attorney general's office
sought a court order upholding the state's $400,000 total liability
limit for the accident as well as the state's immunity to lawsuits.
The request is pending.
   Despite Gov. Roy Romer's vow that Colorado would take
responsibility, there are no assurances the state will pay for
Lang's extended rehabilitation.
   Lang's parents are in their 60s and cannot afford to pay for the
treatment, said his mother, Rita, who flew to Denver from her home
in Benninger, West Germany. She spends every day reading and
talking to Lang.
   Lang, 24, speaks in simple English to the nurses, but answers
his mother's questions in German. He has begun feeding himself and
can sit up.
   Denver General Hospital has no long-term rehabilitation program
and plans to discharge Lang within a few weeks.
   The hospital also has filed a collection notice against the
state for more than $350,000 in unpaid hospital bills for Lang's
treatment.

<HEAD>Residents Upset Over Location of Hospice for AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opening of a six-bed hospice for dying
AIDS patients has drawn protests from neighbors who say they aren't
afraid of catching the deadly disease but do fear the facility will
lower property values.
   The Shawn Hughes hospice, named after the man hospice officials
say was the first employee of the nearby city of West Hollywood to
die of AIDS, opened Monday in a leased, bungalow-style
three-bedroom home.
   Unhappy neighbors say they fear the hospice will bring
ambulances, hospital supply trucks, and, eventually, cars from the
county coroner's office to their quiet residential street.
   ``It's like living next to a hospital,'' said Tom Meleck, whose
home is directly behind the hospice.
   But City Councilman Michael Woo said the hospice is not a
hospital, but ``a place where AIDS patients can die with respect
and dignity.''
   Some residents had attempted to keep the facility from opening,
saying it needed a zoning variance to operate in the neighborhood.
But the city attorney's office said that hospices could operate in
residential zones as long as they were kept to a maximum of six
beds, Woo said.
   Alex Hensel, who leased the home to Hospice Los Angeles@Long
Beach, said he was shocked by his neighbors' reaction.
   ``What I found out is that except for the two closest neighbors
... the rest were only concerned about property values _ `After so
many years here, I'm going to lose...,''' Hensel said.
   ``This isn't a hospital,'' he added. ``It's just a chance for
people in their last few days to have some warm feelings in their
hearts,''
   Hospice Los Angeles@Long Beach operates two other hospice
facilities in Long Beach. The newest hospice costs $7,000 a month
to run, and operators are hoping for a $200,000 county grant to pay
bills for the rest of the year.
   ``Without it, we may have to close this place down,'' said
Executive Director Ron Wolff.
   More than 1,200 people in the Hollywood-Wilshire area were
diagnosed between 1981 and 1987 as having AIDS, said Peter Kerndt,
medical director of the Los Angeles County AIDS Epidemiology
Department. Sixty-two percent of them have died.
   ``Until now, there has been no facility in the city that gives
the victims, who are our neighbors, a decent place to die in
peace,'' Woo said. ``This is long overdue.''

   A young polar bear believed to have
drifted from Greenland to Iceland on an ice floe was shot and
killed by a farmer, conservationists said.
   The polar bear, weighing about 150 pounds and estimated to be
one year old, was seen on Sunday swimming along the coast near the
town of Haganesvik in northern Iceland.
   Residents feared that the animal would be a danger to people and
livestock, and a farmer, Sigurbjoern Thorliefsson, killed it with
one shot from a distance of 20-30 yards several hours after it was
seen.
   Sverrir Scheving Thorsteinsson of the Icelandic Hunting Society
said Monday that efforts should have been made to capture the
animal alive with a sedative gun so that it could have been
returned to its natural habitat.
   It is illegal to kill polar bears in Greenland and Norway,
Thorsteinsson told the daily newspaper Morgunbladid.
   Experts believe the polar bear drifted about 250 miles to
Iceland on pack ice from Greenland.

   Attorney Roy Grutman is seeking nearly
$500,000 from the PTL ministry for his services while the Rev.
Jerry Falwell was in charge.
   Grutman, of New York, was one of the most prominent lawyers in
the ministry's affairs since founder Jim Bakker resigned last March.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court has issued a notice of a hearing on March
2 to determine payment for legal fees and expenses.
   The notice shows Grutman has applied for fees of $442,753.50 and
expenses of $30,741.08. The application would cover Grutman's
services through Dec. 31.
   It lists an alternative fee of $435,402.50 to cover Grutman's
services through Oct. 27.
   Bakker and his lawyer, Ryan Hovis of Rock Hill, have said
Grutman misrepresented himself as Bakker's personal attorney in the
March meeting in Palm Springs, Calif., that precipitated Bakker's
downfall.
   Grutman insisted he told Bakker he was representing PTL, not the
Bakkers.
   On Oct. 27, Grutman left the PTL case, alleging that PTL
bankruptcy examiner William E.S. Robinson of Columbia was in league
with those who wanted to bring Bakker back to PTL.
   Robinson denied that charge.
   Other fee and expense applications to be considered in
bankruptcy court March 2 include:
   _About $180,000 for Bruce Magers, counsel for National City Bank
of Minneapolis. The application covers June 12, 1987, through Jan.
31, 1988.
   _About $150,000 for Robert N. Robinson, attorney for the
unsecured creditors' committee.
   _About $150,000 for Robinson, PTL examiner and consultant.
   _About $110,000 for Allman, Spry, Humphreys, Leggett &
Howington, attorneys for PTL Trustee David Clark. The application
covers the period from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31.
   _About $100,000 for Nelson, Mullins, Riley & Scarborough,
counsel for PTL builder Roe Messner. The request covers Aug. 10
through Dec. 22, 1987.

<HEAD>Iraq Reports 25th Raid on Tanker This Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq said Tuesday its warplanes made the
25th air raid of the year on an Iranian tanker in the campaign to
destroy Iran's oil exports and end the 7-year-old war.
   Only a few of the raids have been confirmed by shipping agents,
salvage executives or other independent sources.
   Iran said its aircraft made a damaging raid on a petrochemical
plant near Basra, Iraq's southern provincial capital. The report by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency gave no details and Iraq
did not comment.
   Another U.S.-escorted convoy of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers made
its way down the Persian Gulf and a new Navy command ship, the
Coronado, arrived in the gulf with four other American warships.
   A dispatch from the official Iraq News Agency news agency said
warplanes attacked ``a very large maritime target,'' the standard
phrase for a supertanker, off the Iranian coast overnight.
   It did not give an exact time for the raid and there was no
independent verification.
   The news agency quoted a military spokesman, not identified, as
saying Iraq ``will continue to destroy naval targets that ferry
Iranian crude because oil revenues are being used to finance the
aggression against Iraq.''
   Iran uses its own and chartered tankers to move crude oil from
the Kharg Island export terminal in the northern gulf, which is a
frequent target of Iraqi bombers, to makeshift terminals in safer
waters about 450 miles down the gulf.
   Included in the U.S.-escorted convoy, which left Kuwait on
Sunday, were the 294,739-ton Townsend, an oil products carrier, and
the 46,723-ton liquefied gas tanker Gas Princess, escorted by the
missile frigate Reuben James.
   It was the 12th this year and 36th since convoys began last
July. The United States has given U.S. registration and American
flags to 11 Kuwaiti tankers so the Navy can protect them.
   The 17,000-ton Coronado will become flagship of the U.S. Middle
East Force in the gulf and the La Salle, command ship in the region
for many years, will undergo a major overhaul at Yokosuka, Japan.
The Coronado did similar duty in 1981-82.
   In other changes, the 18,000-ton helicopter carrier Okinawa is
leaving and command will be transferred in late February to Rear
Adm. Anthony Less from Rear Adm. Harold J. Bernsen.
   Other Navy arrivals, the missile cruiser Wainwright and frigates
Samuel B. Roberts, Simpson and Jack Williams, replace departing
ships but the Okinawa will not be replaced when it sails for
California this week with the last four mine-sweeping helicopters.
   U.S. officials say withdrawal of the Okinawa, which will cut the
gulf force from 17 ships to 16, is part of a plan to reduce the
cost of the escort operation, now running at an estimated $25
million a month.
   Both Iran and Iraq reported raids on military and other
installations at the southern end of the 730-mile border war front.
The activity appeared connected to Iranian preparations for a
long-anticipated winter offensive.
   Diplomatic sources in Kuwait say Iran has marshaled about
300,000 men in the southern area near Basra, where it has mounted
several major offensives since the war began in September 1980.

<HEAD>Cut in Hospital Profits Said Threat to Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medicare budget-trimming has squeezed hospital
profits to the point where health care for the elderly could be
threatened, according to testimony Tuesday before the House Aging
Committee.
   The ``hospital operating profit margins are just one indicator
that the federal government may have cut into the heart of an
already-shredded safety net protecting the elderly,'' said Rep.
Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif., the committee chairman.
   Hospital average profit margins under Medicare's payment system
were above 14 percent in 1984 and 1985, then dropped to 9.6 percent
in 1986, according to federal statistics. Projections show that
hospitals, on the average, will lose money on Medicare patients by
next year.
   ``We are approaching a critical juncture where further
reductions and a lack of predictability could begin to have an
effect on the provision of care to this nation's elderly and
poor,'' said a statement submitted by the American Hospital
Association.
   Congress, at White House urging, has enacted in the past few
years a cost control system for Medicare, and President Reagan is
expected to propose further belt-tightening in the fiscal 1989
budget he submits on Thursday.
   The Medicare program doubled in cost between 1980 to 1987, to
$80 billion, and is expected to exceed $100 billion next year.
   Dr. Donald Young, executive director of the Prospective Payment
Assessment Commission, which reports on the Medicare payment
system, said the downward trend in hospital profits appeared to be
continuing and ``the access of Medicare beneficiaries to quality
care could be threatened.''
   However, he said the most important reason for the profits
decline was not a reduction in Medicare payments but the continuing
increases in hospital costs. There have been ``few signs recently
that hospitals are changing their behavior'' to increase efficiency
or productivity, he said.
   Eric Shulman, legislative director for the National Council of
Senior Citizens, said the figures ``may have grave consequences for
all older Americans,'' in part because of industry priorities.
   ``I find it unconscionable that the hospital industry would
first react to news of declining profits by threatening to subject
patients to lower-quality care and to deny them all the care they
may require,'' he said.

<HEAD>Campaign Turns South With Gore, Jackson Hoping to Derail
Front-runners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New Hampshire's survivors turn South on Wednesday for the next
major battleground of the presidential campaign, with Tennessean
Albert Gore Jr. hoping to waylay the front-runners on his home
ground but Northerner Michael Dukakis saying he is conceding
nothing.
   Among the Republicans, George Bush is counting on superior
organization in the South to hold off Bob Dole, and Pat Robertson
is hoping a strong showing in South Carolina can give him a boost
heading into the Super Tuesday primaries.
   Democrat Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, said Tuesday in
New Hampshire, ``We're going to contest every one of those states.
I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.''
   Jesse Jackson, a Southerner like Gore, was welcoming the change
of scenery to a region where he has been at or near the top in
polls of Democratic voters. His support is particularly strong
among Southern blacks.
   After New Hampshire, several candidates were heading to South
Dakota and Wyoming where lower-stake contests are scheduled between
now and March 8.
   But it is on that date, known as Super Tuesday, that more than
one-third of the states will vote, including most of the South, in
the closest thing ever to a national presidential primary. And most
of the candidates are responding by turning their attention, time
and money southward for what Gore called ``the main event'' of the
campaign.
   What they will find is a massive territory where a thorough
television campaign means buying airtime in 20 or more separate TV
markets. That's an enormous expense and obstacle, particularly for
those such as Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon who are saddled with
debt.
   Gore, the Tennessee senator who claimed a pass to Super Tuesday
regardless of New Hampshire's verdict, said in Washington on
Tuesday that Jackson would be his principal competitor in the South.
   He criticized Jackson's defense-cut proposals, said his own
experience was more ``directly relevant'' and said, ``Democrats in
all parts of the country are really hungry for a victory in 1988
and interested in finding a nominee who can offer the best chance
of beating the Republicans in the fall.''
   Jackson, in recent speeches, has argued against what he says is
a common though often-unspoken view that he cannot win in 1988
because he is black, no matter how well he does in the South and
elsewhere.
   On the Republican side, Robertson was pointing to South
Carolina's GOP contest on the Saturday before Super Tuesday. The
expected low turnout of that primary, combined with Robertson's
constituency of fundamentalist Christian voters, made that
Bible-belt state a likely spot for another strong showing by the
former television preacher.
   While Dole engaged Bush in the New Hampshire primary, the vice
president was said to have a far superior organization throughout
the South. It was a strong Southern organization _ in a much more
limited regional primary _ that rescued former Vice President
Walter Mondale's nomination hopes after he fell short in New
Hampshire in 1984.
   Still, Bill Brock, Dole's campaign manager, said of the Bush
campaign's claim to have a ``firewall of support'' in Southern
states: ``It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.''
   Gephardt, the Democratic winner in Iowa's caucuses last week,
seemed a likely candidate to oppose Gore for the
moderate-to-conservative Southern Democratic and independent vote
that Gore has been trying to appeal to since laying out relatively
conservative stands on defense and foreign policy issues last fall.
   Dukakis has a strong Southern organization and was seen as
particularly strong in Florida.
   ``I think Gephardt is the one with the most potential to do well
among Southern white voters, besides Gore,'' said Merle Black, a
University of North Carolina political scientist.
   ``He can take votes away from Gore,'' said Claibourne Darden, an
Atlanta-based polltaker and analyst.
   Facing that possibility, Gore had begun stressing an appeal to
blue-collar voters _ in contrast to his earlier strategy of
concentrating on endorsements from the Southern political
establishment.
   He toured a mill in North Carolina last week and stood in a
Virginia train yard with Johnny Cash where he shouted, ``This party
and our country has to stand up for the average working men and
women.''
   The Southern campaign will include at least three Republican
debates and four among the Democrats.
   Dukakis has been the most successful fund-raiser among the
Democratic candidates and thus at an advantage in the Southern TV
wars. But Gore's campaign has been hoarding its money, and he said
he will spend at least $2 million in the region.
   Gore campaign manager Fred Martin said, ``We must do well on
Super Tuesday _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it. We have a
three-week campaign.''

<HEAD>US To Resume Aid To Fiji, Send Ambassador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will discuss the resumption
of aid to Fiji and send an ambassador to the Pacific archipelago in
an attempt to encourage the country's return to democratic rule,
the State Department said Tuesday.
   ``In view of recent developments in Fiji that have set that
nation on a course leading to the restoration of constitutional
government, ambassador-designate Leonard Rochwarger will be
proceeding to Fiji in the near future to assume his duties in
Suva,'' said spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   The previous U.S. ambassador ended his tour of duty in Fiji
prior to the May 14, 1987 coup which overturned the island's
parliamentary democracy and brought to power Col. Sitiveni Rabuka.
The ambassador was not immediately replaced, partly as a sign of
U.S. displeasure with the military takeover.
   ``The United States continues to deplore the circumstances that
undermine democratic institutions in Fiji,'' said Mrs. Oakley. ``At
the same time, the return of executive authority to civilian hands,
and the public commitment of the interim civilian government ... to
a process aimed at restoring constitutional government, is a
positive step that we wish to encourage,'' she added.
   Fiji returned to civilian rule in December, when Rabuka
appointed former governor-general Sir Penaiai Ganilau as president
and Ganilau returned Sir Kamisese Mara to his former post of prime
minister. Rabuka retains control of security matters.
   Mrs. Oakley said the State Department was also starting
consultations with Congress on resuming the 1.3 million dollars in
economic aid which was suspended following the May coup. Congress
is expected to unfreeze the funds.

<HEAD>Defense Chief Asks Harsher Laws To Fight Communist Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES W. HATTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said
Tuesday that harsher laws are needed to combat the 19-year-old
communist insurrection and recalled that he asked earlier for the
death penalty to be restored.
   But he said said the rebellion was not at the stage where a
state of national emergency was needed, while President Corazon
Aquino was quoted as saying suggestions she would impose martial
law were ridiculous.
   Ramos noted at a news conference that 18 months ago, he
recommended that the government enact tougher laws to help the
military fight the New People's Army. These included lengthening
the time suspected rebels could be held without charge and
restoring the death penalty for ``heinous crimes'' such as treason
and rebellion.
   ``After a thorough assessment of the insurgency situation and
the efficacy of the various government countermeasures and
programs, the position of the (Defense Department and military) is
that the present situation is not _ I repeat not _ of such gravity
as to make compelling a declaration of a state of emergency,''the
defense chief said.
   ``There is no need for the public, especially the international
audience, to be put in a state of alarm and apprehension over this
issue.''
   Ramos was apparently trying to spike widespread speculation that
the military was pressuring the government to declare martial law.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate defense committee,
told reporters he discussed the issue Tuesday with the president
and she assured him she would not declare a state of emergency and
``never really seriously considered'' it.
   ``Cory even described the idea of resorting to martial rule as
ridiculous,'' he said.
   The senator said Congress had moved to improve the military's
effectiveness, but that calls for a state of emergency were
``counterproductive'' here. The Philippines has bitter memories of
eight years of martial law imposed by President Ferdinand Marcos
from 1972-81.
   About 100 communist rebels attacked a militia post on Mindanao
island, killing a militiaman, the military reported Tuesday.
   It said rebels attacked the outpost at Pangatalan village before
dawn Monday near Sindangan, about 470 miles southeast of Manila in
Zamboanga del Norte province.
   Other rebels ambushed a detachment of soldiers sent to the
village, and a civilian was killed by a stray bullet, the report
said. The rebels then fled.

<HEAD>Funds For State Anniversary Celebration Wiped Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Virginia's financial troubles have
eaten up the funds set aside for celebrating the 125th anniversary
of statehood this summer.
   Norman Fagan, state Department of Culture and History
commissioner, said his agency had saved $100,000 for the party. But
before the any plans could be completed, the money was taken to
help pay the state's massive backlog of bills.
   ``We'll have something, but it will be small and modest. But
that might be more appropriate,'' Fagan said Tuesday.
   The money would have been used to educate people about the
anniversary, provide grants for local governments to throw their
own celebrations, and print a special edition of a journal of West
Virginia history.
   In addition, Fagan had hoped to have a shindig on the state
Capitol grounds this summer, as well as a celebration at
Independence Hall in Wheeling.
   Instead, Fagan lamented, ``We're down to a tiny ceremony.''
   West Virginia was granted statehood on June 20, 1863, after
delegates from the northwestern counties of what was then Virginia
met in Wheeling and voted to join the North during the Civil War.
   The $100,000 fell victim to the state's bills, which amount to
more than $200 million and are piling higher each day.
   The Legislature is working on a measure that would allow Gov.
Arch Moore to borrow $50 million to pay some of the bills. As part
of that legislation, Moore identified some areas where cuts in
state spending could be made, and that included the Department of
Culture and History.
   Nevertheless, Fagan said the state's anniversary won't go
unnoticed. Every year there is a celebration at Independence Hall,
and Fagan said this year will be no different.
   ``It's too important in our history to let it go by,'' he said.

<HEAD>AT&T Presses Case for Big Federal Phone Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
argued Tuesday that the company should be awarded government
telecommunications contracts worth millions of dollars because a
General Services Administration employee leaked secret AT&T bid
information to competitors.
   AT&T attorney C. Stanley Dees told the GSA board of contract
appeals that the federal agency had received information on at
least three occasions suggesting that AT&T's price had been
disclosed, but GSA let the bidding proceed anyway.
   GSA attorney Edward Gregorowicz defended the contracts to
upgrade the federal telephone system, known as FTS, saying there
was no basis for AT&T's charges.
   ``The real issue is that AT&T has been the queen mother of the
FTS network for 25 years ... it got fat, fell asleep and lost its
throne,'' Gregorowicz said.
   The contracts, worth $55 million for 12 large electronic
switches, are being investigated by the GSA's inspector general's
office, the Justice Department and the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
   The procurement has been watched closely because GSA is also
handling the bidding on contracts for an all-new federal phone
system worth as much as $25 billion over 10 years.
   AT&T, the only company to bid for all 12 switches, protested
after it won contracts for only five switches. It had been the sole
bidder for four of the five.
   Regional Bell phone companies won contracts for the other seven
_ Bell Atlantic, BellSouth and US West each got contracts for two
switches in their areas and Pacific Telesis got one.
   AT&T says it should get the contracts for all 12 switches
because of the alleged GSA improprieties.
   After the contracts were awarded last October, AT&T charged that
GSA had misled the company during bidding and evaluated AT&T's bid
differently than the regional companies' proposals in an effort to
give the contracts to companies other than AT&T.
   Later, AT&T added another charge _ that GSA engineer Sureshar L.
Soni provided confidential AT&T price information to Bell Atlantic,
BellSouth and US West.
   BellSouth has offered to withdraw from its contract because its
own internal investigation found that its bid may have been
compromised by information passed to the company.
   Soni has refused to answer questions about his role in the
procurement, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination in a deposition earlier this month. He also
refused to answer questions about his daughter, Neelam, who was
hired by BellSouth as a manager-trainee last April when bids were
being formulated.
   Bell Atlantic and US West deny they received proprietary
information and used it to develop their bids. Bell Atlantic has
said the information Soni offered was of no value because he
appeared to be restating AT&T's current rates, which are publicly
available.
   GSA alleges that AT&T also may have received confidential
information and used it to develop its bids. AT&T says that when
Soni told an AT&T official the company's initial bid for the
Washington, D.C., switch was ``not good enough to win,'' he was
stating the obvious since AT&T knew its initial bid did not reflect
GSA's required 10 percent discount of current prices.
   Gregorowicz said AT&T could have raised alleged improprieties
with the board of contract appeals during the bidding, but did not.
   ``This conduct cannot be rewarded by the board,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose soldier husband was killed in
the Tet offensive 20 years ago this month said she has learned the
Army misplaced his body for two weeks at a time when she was told
he was missing in action.
   Brenda Reed Sutton, who has been researching a book looking at
the Vietnam War from a widow's viewpoint, expressed outrage and
disbelief this week at her latest information from a chaplain in
her husband's unit.
   ``If they'd told me the truth, my family and I would have been
able to put this to bed a long time ago,'' she said.
   She said she wasn't told her husband had been killed until two
weeks after the Army told her he was missing in action. She
continued to write him letters, sometimes as often as three times a
day, during that period.
   It was a month before his body was returned home; she was never
allowed to see the body, she said.
   The latest information came from Paul Hinsky, the chaplain with
Capt. James ``Eddie'' Reed's company in the Mekong Delta. After
reading a Feb. 1 Associated Press story about Sutton's efforts to
finally learn the hazy circumstances behind her husband's death,
Hinsky and several of Reed's soldiers got in touch with her.
   Hinsky, who now lives in Plainville, Mass., said he was the
first person to reach her husband after the attack atop an old
French stronghold called ``Fort Courage'' 20 miles south of the
former capital of South Vietnam.
   The chaplain assured her that ``he (Reed) never knew what hit
him'' and confirmed what she had heard last summer from several
enlisted men: A young American soldier who believed his short
mortar round killed Reed and three other officers went berserk that
night and had to be shipped out.
   Hearing from the chaplain, Sutton says, was ``quite a touching
moment. I'd always wondered who was the first person there. Then 20
years to the day later I hear from this warm and caring chaplain
who tells me Eddie was a tremendous person and says `Your husband
never suffered.'''
   He also told Sutton, she said, that ``The Army screwed up. They
lost his body.''
   ``I can't imagine how they could have misplaced his body,'' and
then delayed telling her he was dead, she said.
   She continues to be stymied, she said, in her efforts to secure
a copy of a reported full investigation into the fatal events of 20
years ago.
   Although Sutton said she's still angry over the Army's handling
of the case, she said she's happy at having achieved so much in her
attempt to reconcile herself to the death of her husband, her high
school sweetheart in Kingsport, Tenn.
   One soldier, she said, told her this month that Eddie was ``the
best officer in Vietnam.''
   ``It warms my heart to know how much the men cared about him,''
she said. ``Now I know that they felt pain at losing him, too.''
   Her two children, including a 23-year-old son who joined her on
an emotional trip back to Vietnam last fall, are ``thrilled'' with
the news that their father was mourned by his soldiers, she said.
   Several publishers, Sutton said, have expressed interest in her
manuscript, tentatively titled ``Silent Partner: A Vietnam Widow's
Story.''

   The State Department expressed hope Tuesday
that Paraguayan President Alfredo Stroessner will use his
re-election victory to expand democratic participation in his
government.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the department was ``not
surprised'' by the outcome of Sunday's election, which Stroesser
won by a lopsided margin.
   Stroessner, an Army general, has ruled Paraguay since 1954 and
is the longest serving head of government in the Western Hemisphere.
   The United States regards Paraguay as a military dictatorship,
one of the few countries in the hemisphere that does not practice
democracy.

   The military govermment closed one
university campus Tuesday after hundreds of stone-throwing students
broke through police barricades in a protest of the arrest of nine
student leaders.
   The registrar of the University of Nigeria's Nsukka campus, U.
Umeh, said he had closed the university on the advice of the
government. He said it was hoped this would avert further damage.
   The government radio and Lagos newspapers had reported that
university students in Nsukka, an eastern city, and nearby Enugu
marched in both cities on Monday.
   The reports also said that students in Enugu threw stones at
police.
   The arrested student leaders will be arraigned next week before
a special tribunal on arson charges stemming from student
demonstrations in June 1986.
   Students said police killed 19 students during that unrest, over
the expulsion of several male students for allegedly visiting
female dormitories.
   Authorities said four students were killed. A government
commission later said police mishandled the demonstrations and a
top police official was dismissed.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan says that he and his wife of 35
years cope with crisis together because, ``She has made it so
natural for us to be as one that we never face anything alone.''
   Reagan, in an article in the March issue of McCall's magazine on
his relationship with his second wife, was asked how she is helping
him cope with the Iran-contra affair.
   ``It's always our problem _ to be dealt with as something
affecting the two of us,'' he said, ``Nancy sees this problem as
something that happened to us together.''
   Mrs. Reagan said she shared that sense of devotion: ``I knew I
was in love when I became more concerned about Ronnie than about
myself.''
   The pair were married in March 1952, after 11 months of
courtship that began with ``kind of a blind date,'' said Reagan,
then an actor. ``In case things didn't click, I told her on the
phone that I had an early call on the set the next morning, so that
evening's date would have to be short.''
   The couple ended up staying out late listening to Sophie Tucker
at a nightclub. ``Since that date, 37 years ago, Nancy has been the
leading lady of my heart,'' Reagan said.
   Anything he'd like to change about his leading lady?
   ``Well, Nancy worries when she thinks something might upset me
or might go wrong,'' Reagan said. ``If she would only realize that
nothing important can go wrong as long as I have her.''

<HEAD>Bangladesh President Cracks Down On Opposition As Election Nears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three major opposition politicians were
arrested Tuesday in an apparent attempt to quiet anti-government
forces before the March 3 parliamentary elections.
   The arrests came one day after opposition parties criticized
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's plan to use army troops to
provide security for the elections, which are being boycotted by a
coalition of 21 anti-government groups.
   Ershad said he would deploy troops at voting places after more
than 100 people were killed last week during village council
elections. Most of the deaths were blamed on clashes between
supporters of rival candidates.
   Sajeda Chowdhury, secretary of the Awami League, and retired
Cols. Akbar Hossain and Oli Ahmed, leaders in the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, were arrested at their homes in the early hours
Tuesday, representatives of both parties said.
   Awami League official Najma Rahman said Mrs. Chowdhury had just
returned from an Awami League meeting when she was taken to Dhaka's
central jail.
   Ashraf Hussein, a Nationalist Party official, said government
agents also carried out raids early Tuesday on the residences of
other party leaders but did not find them home.
   The government made no announcement of the arrests, following
the pattern set when the opposition's main leaders, Sheik Hasina of
the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Nationalist Party, were
arrested before previous elections.
   Mrs. Zia and Sheik Hasina were put under house arrest for a
month after their parties led a campaign beginning in November to
demand Ershad's ouster.
   Under emergency laws declared just after the anti-Ershad
campaign began, police can arrest and detain people without charge
or trial for an indefinite period. More than 30 people have been
killed in violence connected to the opposition campaign.
   The Awami League and Nationalist party blamed Ershad for failing
to control last week's election violence. But on Monday they also
condemned his plan to employ the army for security.
   ``The army is a sacred institution meant for safeguarding the
country's independence and sovereignty,'' Mrs. Zia said in a
newspaper interview published Tuesday. ``They should not be dragged
into politics.''
   The Awami League issued a statement saying: ``The government is
playing with fire. The decision must be withdrawn.''
   A source in the ruling Jatiya Party said Monday that Ershad's
decision followed an appeal from leaders of parties participating
in the polls. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Ershad, a 58-year-old former army general, seized power in a
bloodless coup in 1982 and was elected president in 1986. The
opposition condemned that election as rigged and said no fair vote
can be taken with Ershad in power.
   The president dissolved Parliament on Dec. 6 and called for
elections to try to placate the opposition, but the major parties
agreed on a boycott. Ershad's Jatiya Party, an alliance of 73 minor
parties, and dozens of independents are running.

<HEAD>USDA Announces Effort To Develop Recreational Services in National
Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local governments, businesses and
private groups are being asked to help finance and develop more
recreational services in federally owned national forests, the
Agriculture Department announced Tuesday.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the department's Forest Service,
said the move is in response to increasing demands for more
recreational areas and service, and to help relieve pressures on
federal spending.
   ``The squeezed budget is a factor,'' Robertson told a news
conference. ``We just can't simply do the job, financing it all out
of the federal budget.''
   Robertson said the ``Challenge Cost-Share Program'' was
authorized by Congress on a pilot basis at a level of $500,000 for
the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1. Of that, $100,000 was
earmarked for the Tonto National Forest near Phoenix, Ariz., with
the remainder available to other regions to supplement money put up
by local people, companies, state agencies, municipalities or other
groups.
   Some 31 recreation projects have been approved and will be
underway this spring and summer he said. Restoration and
improvement of existing facilities, areas and trails are typical
goals.
   The $500,000 of Forest Service seed money was met with $908,000
from various partners involved in the 31 pilot projects.
   One of the objectives of the program will be to provide more
facilities on national forest land located near cities.
   ``We really need to look at these urban Americans and how they
can use the national forests to meet their recreational needs,''
Robertson said.
   What will the project mean to Americans who visit national
forests?
   ``It will mean more camp sites, more picnic areas, more trails,
more opportunities for people to visit the national forests,'' he
said.
   Private investors will be encouraged to develop new campgrounds,
marinas, ski areas. No increase in user fees is being proposed at
this time, but that is comething that eventually will have to be
faced, he said.
   Asked if the plan means opening the door for major private
development on national forest land, Robertson replied:
   ``Yes, we are opening that door, but we also need to work with
those private sector proposals to see if they fit into the overall
scheme'' for recreation development.
   Robertson said the recreation project is patterned after a
similar Challenge Grant program that Congress initiated in 1986 to
improve fish and wildlife on national forest lands.
   The Forest Service administers 191 million acres, or about 8{
percent of the U.S. total land area. Although most is in the West,
the land is scattered among 156 national forests in 42 states and
Puerto Rico. Robertson said that if all of it could be put into one
place, it would be an area 10 percent larger than Texas.
   Robertson said the proposed budget that President Reagan is
scheduled to send Congress on Thursday for the 1989 fiscal year
that will begin on Oct. 1 will include $3 million for the
recreation cost-share program, up from the $500,000 in pilot funds
this year. The one for fish and wildlife will be requested at $5
million, compared with $1.5 million in fiscal 1988.

   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard
Feynman, who worked on the development of the atomic bomb during
World War II and helped investigate the 1986 Challenger space
shuttle disaster, died at age 69.
   A professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute
of Technology since 1950, Feynman died Monday night at UCLA Medical
Center from complications due to recurrent abdominal cancer, said
hospital spokesman Rich Elbaum.
   In 1965, Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Julian
S. Schwinger and Shinichero Tomonaga for developing an improved
theory of quantum electrodynamics. The three men worked
independently in the 1940s and arrived at the same theory, which
allows scientists to predict the effects of electrically charged
particles on each other in a radiation field.
   ``In the death of Richard Feynman, the world has lost one of its
greatest intellects,'' said Lee A. DuBridge, president emeritus of
Caltech.
   Marvin L. Goldberger, director of the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, N.J., and a former Caltech president, recalled
Feynman as ``a towering figure in 20th-century physics'' who was
``always curious, always modest, always ebullient, always willing
to share his deep insights with students and colleagues.''
   Feynman was a member of the atomic bomb project staff at
Princeton in 1942 and 1943 and at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
in New Mexico from 1943 to 1945.
   During a committee investigation after the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, which killed the seven
crew members, he emerged as one of the leading critics of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Feynman accused NASA of erratic attention to safety matters that
he likened ``to playing Russian roulette.''
   Born in New York on May 11, 1918, Feynman graduated from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science
degree in 1939. He received a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1942.
   Feynman's scientific interests developed early with the aid of
his father, a clothing salesman, who taught him elementary
mathematics and read his toddler son scientific studies.
   ``I grew up with him and I knew him through many stages, and he
is just a terrific guy,'' Feynman's cousin Frances Lewine said
early today.
   The young scholar joined the Cornell University faculty in 1945
as an associate professor of theoretical physics and remained there
until moving to Caltech in 1950.
   It was at Cornell that Feynman did the work that led to his
Nobel Prize.
   He was also a dynamic writer. His 1985 autobiography, ``Surely
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman,'' on the New York Times best-seller
list for 14 weeks, demonstrated his canny humor and strong like for
formality.
   He also wrote, ``QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter,''
an explanation of quantum electrodynamics published in 1986, and
was co-author of the 1963 textbook, ``The Feynman Lectures on
Physics.''
   He was especially popular with Caltech students, who honored him
for teaching excellence in 1982.
   Despite his stature as a professor, he continued to teach
freshman physics classes over the years and to ham it up in school
plays, once taking on the role of a bongo player in the musical
``Guys and Dolls.''
   Caltech officials reported that when Feynman became ill a few
years ago, students and teachers overwhelmed local medical
facilities with offers to donate blood.
   His many honors and awards included Princeton's Albert Einstein
award, the Atomic Energy Commission's E.O. Lawrence Award, the
Oersted Medal for teaching, the Niels Bohr International gold medal
and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Einstein award.
   He is survived by his wife, Gweneth; son, Carl; daughter,
Michelle; and sister, Joan.

<HEAD>ADN: Soviets Have Begun Dismantling Intermediate Range Rockets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 7 grafs to UPDATE with more details of removal.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has begun dismantling
intermediate range nuclear rockets stationed in East Germany, the
state-run news agency ADN reported Tuesday night.
   According to the report, rockets stationed near Neubrandenburg,
north of Berlin, have been dismantled, crated and are ready for
transport back to the Soviet Union.
   Under a treaty signed in Washington in December by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the superpowers
agreed to eliminate the medium-range missiles.
   The U.S. Senate has yet to ratify the treaty.
   ADN said Soviet soldiers ``are making the last preparations to
return their SS-12 rockets'' to the Soviet Union.
   The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the
intermediate range missile pact, which banned weapons with a range
from 300 to 3,000 miles.
   The news agency quoted a Soviet officer as saying that the
``troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in
our unit.''
   ADN said a group of East German journalists toured the missile
base and were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers there.
   East German leader Erich Honecker in January indicated that
Soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in East Germany could
be removed ahead of schedule, but gave no specific timetable for
their withdrawal.
   The ADN report did not say how many rockets were ready for
transport back to the Soviet Union. It also did not say if other
missiles stationed in East Germany had been dismantled or how many
troops were scheduled to leave.
   The report, written by an ADN correspondent, described
preparations under way to ready the rockets for transport.
   Cranes were used to load the dismantled rockets into transport
containers, the report said.
   ``We were convinced that the last rockets were ready for
transport to the location where they will be destroyed,'' the ADN
correspondent said.
   The rockets are to be sent back to the Soviet Union by rail, the
report said.
   According to figures released after the superpower agreement was
signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven
practice missiles were stationed at the site _ which holds the
largest numbers of SS-12s in East Germany.
   In all, there are 54 SS-12s in East Germany, the figures said.

<HEAD>Defense Says Demjanjuk's Alibi is Sound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense attorney in the Nazi war crimes trial
of John Demjanjuk said in closing arguments Tuesday his client's
alibi was sound and that contradictions in his testimony were due
to memory lapses and pressure from investigators.
   Demjanjuk is ``confused about all of his movements,'' not only
about details of what he did during World War II, defense attorney
Yoram Sheftel said Tuesday, the first anniversary of the trial.
   Demjanjuk, 67, a retired Ohio autoworker, is accused of being
``Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadistic guard who operated gas chambers
that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinka death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942 and 1943.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk claims that he's a victim of
mistaken identity. He has said he served in the Soviet army, was
captured by the Germans in 1941 and remained in prisoner-of-war
camps until 1943.
   Sheftel rejected prosecution charges that Demjanjuk invented an
alibi. If Demjanjuk's testimony was contradictory in parts, it
should be attributed to memory lapses, Sheftel said, noting that
his client could also not remember simple facts about his family.
   ``The accused forgot,'' Sheftel said. ``If he made up an alibi,
he would not forget it. If someone concocts an alibi, you work it
out, think it out, maybe write it out. It's very easy to do. ''
   Sheftel also claimed his client could not be expected to
remember all events coherently because investigators pressured and
intimidated him. He said police told Demjanjuk before the trial
they would ``put a rope around his head.''
   Sheftel also said Israeli police deployed a Ukrainian-speaking
guard to befriend Demjanjuk and elicit incriminating information,
but the effort backfired because Demjanjuk stuck to his version of
the events.
   Sheftel said the few details Demjanjuk has provided about his
whereabouts in World War II mesh with testimony of historians
called by the prosecution. He also said Demjanjuk couldn't have
known the facts unless he had personally experienced them.
   In one instance, Demjanjuk told the court he was laying railroad
tracks after becoming a German prisoner of war, Sheftel said.
   The attorney cited testimony by a prosecution witness who said
the German high command at the time gave high priority to repairing
railway tracks damaged in the Crimea battle.
   Sheftel acknowledged that Demjanjuk lied in filling out a 1948
application for immigration to the United States by stating he was
a Polish farmer.
   Sheftel said Demjanjuk lied because he didn't want to be
returned to the Soviet Union for fear he would be executed after
serving in an anti-Communist unit at the end of the war.
   The defense is to complete closing arguments this week. The
three-judge panel is expected to render a verdict in April. If
convicted, Demjanjuk faces a death sentence.

<HEAD>Fed Chief: Economy `In Equilibrium,' But Not Campaign Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday the economy seems ``in equilibrium,'' but that he couldn't
make the same claim for presidential campaign rhetoric.
   ``There is a gross distortion of reality'' on trade issues in
the political debate, he suggested.
   Greenspan's comments on the economy appeared to signal that the
Fed was unlikely to move, at least soon, on U.S. interest rates,
preferring to take a wait-and-see approach.
   There had been some speculation that the central bank was on the
verge of lowering its discount rate, the rate it charges for direct
loans to banks and other financial institutions, in an effort to
stimulate the economy.
   The discount rate has been at 6 percent since last September.
   ``The relationships at the moment among all the major financial
variables seem to be in relative balance,'' Greenspan said in a
speech to the Bretton Woods Committee, a private organization that
follows issues of international finance.
   Greenspan's comments on politics, made during a
question-and-answer session, appeared to be a dig at the
``get-tough'' trade policies advocated by Democratic presidential
candidate Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   The Fed chairman was asked by a member of the audience _ former
Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill. _ what he thought of Gephardt's advocacy
of strong trade legislation during his presidential campaign.
   ``It played well in Iowa,'' where Gephardt finished first in
last week's Democratic caucuses, ``and it ought to play well with
this committee,'' Percy said.
   Greenspan, a Republican who was chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers under President Ford, replied: ``The problem I
have with what's going on in Iowa is that there is a gross
distortion of reality.''
   Were Greenspan's remarks a direct rebuke to Gephardt, or more a
comment on presidential campaign statements in general?
   ``I don't know what he meant,'' said Joseph Coyne, Greenspan's
spokesman.
   Percy later told a reporter his question to Greenspan ``was
facetious. I don't want to see protectionism playing well in
politics.''
   Gephardt is the sponsor of House-passed legislation calling for
mandatory trade retaliation against Japan and other nations that
maintain large surpluses with the United States through unfair
trade practices.
   The Reagan administration has vowed a veto if the legislation _
now before a House-Senate conference committee _ is enacted with
such a provision, which it considers overly protectionist.
   A ``get-tough'' policy toward trading partners has been a
central part of Gephardt's campaign.
   Asked about interest rates, Greenspan said ``evidence of the
most recent past'' was in the direction of ``emerging stability''
in the economy of the United States and other industrial nations.
   Economic variables ``seem to be in equilibrium. And I suspect
they will stay there,'' Greenspan said.
   He said the economy appears to be weathering last October's
stock market plunge, and that he is encouraged by recent data
showing a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit.
   However, Greenspan said prospects for buoyant economic growth
throughout the industrial world this year ``are patently not
great.''
   He voiced support, meantime, for a proposal for a $75 billion
increase in World Bank funds sought by bank President Barber
Conable, saying it was needed to help developing nations pursue
sound economic policies.
   Conable told the conference the increase was desperately needed
so the 151-nation world lending organization could fight what he
called ``an abundance of absolute poverty.''
   ``Without this adjustment, there is no future for many of these
countries,'' he said.
   And Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III told the gathering
that winning support from Congress for the U.S. share of the
increase _ which will cost the nation about $80 million a year _
would not be easy this year.
   ``We're going to be pushing it hard,'' he said.
   Baker also said his 3-year-old strategy for easing Third World
debt by encouraging new loans from commercial banks and tying them
to economic reforms in the debtor nations remains the best appraoch.
   Proposals that would wipe out a portion of the existing debt of
Latin American and other developing countries is ``a path that
would lead both debtors and creditors off the cliff,'' Baker
contended.

   If you have an urge to send somebody a message in
a bottle, Edna Hulbert can give you some hints. She started
throwing bottles in bodies of water 66 years ago, when she was 17.
   She's received replies from people in France, England and Spain,
and even played matchmaker to a French couple getting married in
June.
   ``It doesn't cost any money and I'm hearing from people I never
knew. There was no end to the fun I've had,'' said Mrs. Hulbert, 83.
   Although she doesn't drink, Mrs. Hulbert prefers liquor bottles
because they float best. She used to pour her late husband's Scotch
into empty mustard and ketchup jars so she could have the empties.
   She tossed her first message into the Mississippi near St. Louis
and has since lobbed bottles into the Hudson River, the Thames in
England, the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas, a Montana lake and
the canals of Amsterdam.
   She doesn't recommend lakes: ``They don't go very far. They go
in a circle.''
   Over the years about 30 people have responded, many of them
young men looking for a girlfriend. A French man and woman who
lived in towns about 100 miles apart each found one of her bottles;
Mrs. Hulbert told the girl about it.
   ``She wrote to him and he wrote to her and now they're going to
get married. I was thrilled to hear that,'' says Mrs. Hulbert, who
has been invited to the wedding.
   Bottle messaging, like life, is not all fun and games. A bottle
that went into the Fox River near Oshkosh, Wis., brought a citation
for littering from the local police.
   ``I ignored it,'' she says.

   The long and winding road to fame began
and ended here for Rex, the wandering raccoon hound.
   Three weeks ago he was just an ordinary stray roaming Route 30.
This week, he's sharing the cover of People magazine with comedian
Robin Williams.
   Rex disappeared from Arthur and Emilie Thomas' yard in April
1985. He was missing for 2{ years until he was picked up last month
by animal control officer Cathy Barrows.
   Rex made the ``Dog of the Week'' column in a local weekly and
the Thomases reclaimed him. That story made the Brattleboro
Reformer, then spread across the nation.
   Since his return the Thomases have been swamped with calls and
letters, and some of Rex's lost years are being filled in.
   A man in Bennington, 40 miles west of Brattleboro, said he found
Rex after he saw a van with New Jersey plates dump the hound on the
road.
   The man already had three dogs and could not take another in, so
Rex was given to friends. Where Rex went next is not known, and the
trail to fame fades until it reappears in Brattleboro.

<TEXT>
   The jailed mother of an abandoned girl whose
lower legs were amputated because of severe frostbite should be
allowed to visit her hospitalized daughter, according to a hospital
counselor.
   Darlwin Britt, who is 24 and unemployed, faces charges of felony
child neglect and is being held in the Lake County Jail on $50,000
bond her lawyers have said she can't pay.
   A hospital staff member says, however, that Ms. Britt's daughter
needs to see her mother and that a supervised visit may help the
girl recover.
   The child, Darlwin Carlisle, 9, has talked with her mother once
by telephone, but has not seen her mother since the girl was found
last month locked in an unheated and abandoned Gary apartment.
   Her legs were amputated below the knee after gangrene threatened
to develop into a possibly life-threatening infection.
   ``It needs to be done in a planned way,'' said Mary Martone, the
coordinator of the child abuse program at Chicago's La Rabida
Children's Hospital and Research Center, where the girl is learning
to walk on artifical legs.
   ``I basically think it would be appropriate for the parent and
child to have contact,'' she said in a recent interview.
   The child's father, Edward J. Carlisle of Fort Wayne, and other
relatives have visited the child, hospital officials say.
   Others who believe Ms. Britt should be allowed to visit her
daughter include Gary City Councilman Roy Pratt; Constance
Mack-Ward, the director of the Gary Commission for Women, and Jean
Thurman, director of Project Justice and Equality.
   They contend the lack of support that mothers such as Ms. Britt
receive from the system is at least partly responsible for cases of
child neglect and abuse.
   ``We release condemned murderers to go to funerals,'' said
Pratt. ``We release hardened criminals on bail. I understand
wanting to punish the mother. I was angry, too, until I looked at
the side of the mother.''

<TEXT>
   Former highway patrolman Craig Peyer's penchant
for long talks with young women drivers ended in murder on the
night he met Cara Knott, a prosecutor said in final arguments
Tuesday.
   Deputy District Attorney Joe Van Orshoven told a jury that
Peyer's practice of pulling women over on the Mercy Road exit of
Interstate 15, then talking to them for an hour or more, led to the
woman's death.
   Knott was strangled with a rope, the prosecution contended.
   ``We know that Craig Allen Peyer had a custom, a habit, a
practice,'' Van Orshoven said of the traffic stops.
   On Dec. 27, 1986, when Knott died, ``something went wrong. She
wasn't like these other youngsters,'' Orshoven said.
   She became anxious and scratched her assailant's face, Orshoven
said.
   The prosecutor showed the jury a family photo of the vivacious
Knott, and then three coroner's photos of the dead woman, with
strangulation marks on her neck and bruises on her face.
   The prosecution's witnesses included 22 women who said they had
been pulled over by Peyer at the Mercy Road exit, and that he had
kept them talking for an hour or more about highway safety and
other innocuous topics. None claimed that Peyer made advances or
attempted to harm her.
   In his final arguments, defense attorney Robert Grimes contended
that some of those witnesses had lied.
   Peyer, 37, has already been fired by the California Highway
Patrol, which concluded that he killed Knott without justification.
He is appealing his dismissal.
   Knott's body was found the day after her murder below a bridge
on a frontage road on Interstate 15, the highway Peyer was assigned
to patrol the night of the killing. Peyer, a 13-year CHP veteran,
was arrested 18 days later.
   Testimony in the trial ended Feb. 9, but closing arguments were
postponed last week after a prosecutor broke a tooth at breakfast
and was unable to deliver his summation.
   The prosecution's case rest largely rests on blood samples,
microscopic fibers and testimony of witnesses about Peyer's
behavior during prior traffic stops and his comments to colleagues.
   Fiber experts testified that microscopic fibers found on Peyer
and Knott matched threads found in each other's clothing. A rope
found in Peyer's patrol car also was said to match marks on the
victim's neck.
   There was testimony that blood found on the victim matched
Peyer's type, but the jury was instructed to disregard that.
   Witnesses testified that Peyer had three scratches on his face
the night of the murder. He told other officers he fell while
pumping gas and hurt himself on a chain-link fence.
   A CHP officer testified that Peyer once pointed out the Mercy
Road offramp and noted that it would be a good place to dump a body.
   Peyer did not take the stand, but defense witnesses have
attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses and praised the
veteran officer's professional performance.

   A glittering samba parade Tuesday
highlighted Rio's famous Carnival, while in country towns, ordinary
Brazilians donned humble costumes and danced in the streets.
   Police used clubs and tear gas to break up a rock fight among
spectators leaving the ``samba school'' parade. Three people were
arrested and two hospitalized with injuries, a police spokesman
said.
   A celebrant who may have been offended by the sexual tone of a
television network's coverage of gala balls punched an anchorman
during a live broadcast. Among others, the network had shown a
woman, from the waist up, who wore only a silver tiara and said she
was dressed as the Statue of Liberty.
   The last of Rio's top 16 ``samba schools'' paraded through the
80,000-seat, open-air ``sambadrome'' at 9 a.m., ending a two-day
spectacular featuring 75,000 brilliantly costumed participants who
sang, danced and pulled elaborate floats.
   In the towns and villages, the dances were much less elaborate,
but in many places local governments provided free street bands.
   Carnival began Saturday and, at noon Wednesday, this nation of
141 million people will begin the slow process of reopening
businesses, newspapers, banks and government offices.
   Daytime temperatures of more than 90 degrees aided the festive
atmosphere. Some costumed revelers ran short of energy and could be
seen stretched out asleep on beaches, sidewalks and parked cars.
   Samba schools are neighborhood clubs, most in the poor hillside
slums, that compete each year for a coveted local prize by
composing sambas based on historical and folk themes. Each school
puts 4,000-5,000 people in the parade, who relate the chosen theme
through lyrics, dances, costumes and allegorical floats.
   Many of the raucous club balls, which attract tens of thousands
of people, were held Tuesday.
   At the Scala nightclub, a man punched Nei Costa of TV
Bandeirantes, a commercial network that was broadcasting three of
the parties simultaneously.
   Costa cried: ``I've been attacked! I can't understand it!'' and
private security guards hustled the assailant off. His name and
complaint were not revealed.
   Bandeirantes cut back and forth to reporters assigned to all
three clubs, providing closeups of bare and nearly bare breasts,
gyrating pelvises other scenes appropriate to leering commentary.
   The ``Statue of Liberty'' appeared in the Bandeirantes broadcast
from the Kittens Ball at the Monte Libano Club.

   NATO needs to decide what new short-range
nuclear weapons to build in view of the treaty eliminating
medium-range atomic missiles from Europe, Senate Democratic leaders
said Tuesday.
   ``I don't think there is a clear consensus in the alliance about
just exactly where we go from here,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   ``I do think there is a consensus for the modernization of
short-range nuclear weapons,'' but there is no agreement yet on
specifically which weapons to build, he said.
   Nunn and Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., were among a
group of key senators who visited U.S. allies in Europe last week
as part of the Senate's consideration of the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty negotiated two months ago by President Regan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The treaty would eliminate medium-range missiles on both sides,
but would allow both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Warsaw Pact to build nuclear weapons with a range of less than 300
miles.
   Byrd told reporters that European leaders told the senators
``that the INF treaty should be approved without amendments and
that following that, NATO should procede with modernizing those
ground-based nuclear weapons that are eligible under the treaty.''
   ``The general consensus was that the allies should not go for
the third zero option,'' said Byrd, referring to calls from some
European politicians for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
   ``They should plan to improve the range of those short-range
theater weapons that would be allowed, and not emphasize the
modernization of short-range artillery-type weapons.'' said Byrd.
   But Nunn, at the reopening of hearings by his committee on the
treaty, said NATO needs to decide specifically what type of
short-range weapons to build.
   The options include nuclear-tipped artillery shells, which have
a range of 15 or 20 miles, and longer-range weapons, such as the
Lance missile.
   In 1983, NATO ministers agreed to build a new generation of
short-range weapons, but that decision has not been implemented.
   The Reagan administration has urged NATO to improve its
non-nuclear weapons to offset Soviet numerical advantages in
conventional weapons. The alliance has long relied on the
possibility of using nuclear weapons to deter a Soviet attack.
   Edward L. Rowny, one of Reagan's top arms control advisers, told
Nunn's committee Tuesday that ``Soviet officials have frankly
admitted to me that the cutting edge of their political and
military power lies in their conventional forces.''
   ``They may be attempting to mesmerize the West with nuclear
reductions while protecting the utility of their conventional
superiority,'' Rowny said.
   Another witness, Ronald Lehman, who helped negotiate the INF
pact, noted that ``a substantial number of U.S. nuclear weapons
will remain in Europe'' after the INF treaty.
   But NATO has never had a ``politically easy'' time when it built
new nuclear weapons, Lehman said.
   ``Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union hopes that a new arms control
agreement will have a soporific effect on Western security concerns
which will weapon NATO's defenses,'' he said.
   Retired Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, former supreme alllied
commander, told the Foreign Relations Committee that NATO should
build a number of new short-range atomic weapons.
   They include an air-to-ground missile, new artillery shells, and
an updated version of the Lance, Rogers said.
   He also urged approval of what he said are ``low-cost'' steps
NATO could take, including a comprehensive arms control strategy.
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President
Carter, told the Armed Services Committee ``it would be a mistake''
to go along with efforts to negotiate for the elimination of all
nuclear weapons.
   Meantime, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said the Democratic
leadership will go ahead and offer an amendment proposed by Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., that would require the administration to
adhere to the view of the treaty outlined by administration
witnesses.
   Biden recently underwent surgery and is not expected to return
to work before the treaty comes up for a vote, Cranston said.
   The proposal stems from an ongoing dispute between the
administration and congressional Democrats over how to interepret
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Democrats want a
``narrow,'' or restrictive, interpretation, while the
administration has said it has the right to move to a ``broad''
interpretation that would allow tests of Reagan's Star Wars
anti-missile program.
   Secretary of State George Shultz recently wrote Nunn and Byrd
that administration witnesses are speaking authoritatively, meaning
that some future administration won't be able to change its view of
the what the treaty means.

   A car exploded in flames about 120 feet from Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's official residence early Tuesday, and
news reports said the driver committed suicide to protest
unemployment.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the
driver _ a 41-year-old man _ left a suicide note saying: ``Too
young to retire, too old to live.''
   Scotland Yard declined to comment on the unattributed report.
   Police bomb squad officers raced to 10 Downing St. around 1 a.m.
fearing a possible terrorist attack, but authorities said no
explosives were found.
   The car stopped at the entrance into Downing Street but did not
try to enter the dead-end street, which is fenced off with metal
security barriers, police said. The interior of the car then was
engulfed in flames, they said.
   Mrs. Thatcher's residence and office is situated about 40 yards
down the street ``and therefore the prime minister was not in any
danger,'' Scotland Yard said in a statement.
   Mrs. Thatcher's office confirmed that the prime minister had
been at 10 Downing St. at the time but was not involved in any way.
   A London radio station, Independent Radio News, said the driver
had been out of work for over a year and had killed himself to
protest unemployment. Scotland Yard refused to comment on the
report or to identify the badly burned man pending an autopsy
Wednesday.
   The London Evening Standard identified the driver as Derek
Bainbridge from Worksop in central England and said he gave up his
job as a $131-a-week road sweeper 14 months ago.
   Press Association quoted Bainbridge's sister, Mary Jackson, as
saying he had been depressed over being unable to find work.
   ``He wanted to work and became quite depressed lately,'' she
said. ``He didn't talk much and didn't go out a lot.
   ``He used to sit in his room for hours looking out of the
window, and lately he left his home only to visit the Social
Security center,'' she said. ``In my heart, I can respect what he's
done and why, but I still wish he hadn't done it.''
   A Scotland Yard spokesman, speaking anonymously, said the car
had been registered by someone in Worksop, but declined to give
further details.
   The number of jobless has doubled from 1.3 million in 1979, when
Mrs. Thatcher won the first of her three terms in office, to 2.6
million in December, for an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, the
government says.
   Unemployment topped 3 million between June 1983 and April 1987,
becoming one of the country's worst problems.
   News reports said gasoline cans were believed to have been found
inside the car. But Scotland Yard said police did not yet know what
caused the green Vauxhall Viva auto to burst into flames at the
entrance to Downing Street from Whitehall, the main thoroughfare in
the area.
   ``A car pulled up in Whitehall at the entrance to Downing Street
and burst into flames. The fire was put out by London Fire Brigade
and the body of a man was found inside the car,'' it said in a
statement.
   The incident was witnessed by a police officer on duty at the
barriers that close off Downing Street.

   John F. Lehman Jr., who was secretary of the
Navy in the first six years of the Reagan administration, has been
tapped for promotion to captain in the Naval Reserve.
   Lehman, a naval flight officer, was selected along with more
than 450 other commanders to receive a fourth stripe in fiscal
1989. The promotion list was approved by Navy Secretary James H.
Webb for submission to Congress on Feb. 11, the service said
Tuesday.
   In an interview with the Navy Times newspaper, Lehman discounted
suggestions that his former high position played a role in the
promotion.
   ``The fact that I have drilled faithfully for 23 years and
always done my best'' likely led to the promotion, he said.
   Lehman left the government last April to write and pursue a
career in investment banking.

   ``Broadcast News'' and its stars _
William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks _ headed the favorites
to be on the list Wednesday when nominations for the 60th annual
Academy Awards are announced.
   ``Broadcast News,'' directed by James L. Brooks, and Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor'' loomed largest in speculation
leading up to the announcement at dawn.
   The two films have attracted the majority of critics' praise and
prizes, and each bears its maker's stamp. Brooks wrote, produced
and directed ``Broadcast News,'' a caustic incisive view of how
networks report the news. Bertolucci co-wrote and directed ``The
Last Emperor,'' the tragic life of China's boy ruler, Henry Pu Yi.
   ``Moonstruck,'' ``Empire of the Sun'' and the year's most
talked-about film, ``Fatal Attraction,'' also figured to be well
represented among the nominees.
   In the performing categories, Miss Hunter was widely expected to
be nominated as best actress for her ``Broadcast News' role as a
producer torn between a brilliant reporter, played by Brooks, and
an empty-headed but telegenic anchorman, played by Hurt.
   Also prominently mentioned for best actress were Cher, as the
widow who rediscovers passion in ``Moonstruck,'' and Glenn Close as
the vengeful single woman in ``Fatal Attraction.''
   Academy president Robert Wise and Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine
will announce the nominations at the Academy's Wilshire Boulevard
headquarters shortly after 5:30 Wednesday morning. The reason for
the early hour: the announcement will be carried live by NBC's
``Today,'' ``CBS Morning Show,'' ABC's ``Good Morning, America''
and Cable News Network.
   Ratings for the Oscar awards show have been slipping in recent
years, so the awards can use all the publicity they can manage.
   Wise and MacLaine will recite nominees in 23 categories, ranging
from best picture to best cartoon. One category will be missing:
best original song score. The requirements are five original songs
by one writer or team of writers for a single film, and not one
film qualified.
   Oscar will have a new but familiar home for the 60th ceremonies
on Monday, April 11. The ceremonies are going back to the cavernous
Shrine Auditorium near the Los Angeles Coliseum, because the Music
Center could not provide enough capacity or rehearsal time.
   The Shrine, where the music industry Grammy awards were held in
past years, housed the Oscars twice in the late 1940s. The
television Emmys will also be presented there this year and the
American Music Awards are held there. The Grammys are emanating
from Radio City Music Hall in New York this year.
   Samuel Goldwyn Jr. is repeating as the Oscarcast producer. So
far he has scheduled these stars as hosts and presenters: Chevy
Chase, Audrey Hepburn, Michael Douglas, John Lone and Joan Chen
(``The Last Emperor''), Anjelica Huston, John Candy, Paul Newman
and Marlee Matlin.

   The National Symphony Orchestra will be guest
orchestra at the Casals Festival in San Juan, Puerto Rico, next
June and will make its seventh foreign tour under music director
Mstislav Rostropovich later in the summer, officials announced
Tuesday.
   The foreign tour will begin in August in Athens, Greece, with
possible performances later in Italy, southern France and Spain.
   Rostropovich, who fled the Soviet Union in 1974 because of
artistic restrictions, was non-committal when asked whether he
hoped to take the National Symphony on a tour of his homeland. If
Soviet authorities extend an invitation, he told reporters, ``then
we will respond.''
   Rostropovich said he exchanged ``polite words'' with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a White House state dinner during
the December summit talks between Gorbachev and President Reagan,
but that nothing serious was discussed.

<HEAD>France to Attend NATO Summit For First Time in Two Decades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand announced Tuesday he
will attend the NATO summit meeting next month, making him the
first French chief of state to do so since France left the
alliance's military wing in 1966.
   The summit, to be held March 2-3 in Brussels, is ``very
important'' because it will ``define the politics of disarmament''
for members of the North Atlantic Treaty Allaince, Mitterrand said
on French television.
   ``I must be there and, there again, I must represent France, and
France must speak with one voice,'' he said.
   Mitterrand, a Socialist, and conservative Premier Jacques Chirac
have attended summit meetings together since Chirac's conservative
coalition came to power in March 1986.
   In a television interview Tuesday night within hours of
Mitterrand's announcement, Chirac said he ``naturally'' would
attend also, but added, ``I don't believe this summit is very
important.''
   No French president has assisted at a NATO summit since 1966,
when France, under President Charles de Gaulle, withdrew from the
alliance's military wing to assure the independence of its own
nuclear force.
   Mitterrand also confirmed he will not reveal whether he will be
a candidate in presidential elections in April until sometime after
the NATO summit. Politicians who have met with him have said he
would make his decision known in early March.
   Mitterrand, who holds a steady lead in the polls, has been
widely criticized for leaving the electorate in doubt.
   Someone, Mitterrand said, must ``guard the state'' since Chirac
is campaigning for the presidency.
   Referring to the recent European Economic Community summit and
the upcoming NATO summit, Mitterrand said he risked losing his
authority if he were not running and risked becoming too involved
in political debate if he were.
   ``All internal political debate must come after these two
events,'' he said.

<HEAD>Humphrey, Mica, Launch Bids for Senate Seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III, son of the
late vice president, announced Thursday he will seek the Democratic
nomination for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican David
Durenberger.
   Former Vice President Walter Mondale, who served with Humphrey's
father in the Senate, looked on in the Capitol Rotunda as the
45-year-old attorney general launched his campaign with an attack
on Durenberger's priorities.
   Meanwhile, in Florida, U.S. Rep. Dan Mica said he will challenge
popular former Gov. Reubin Askew in seeking the Democratic
nomination to replace three-term Sen. Lawton Chiles, who is
retiring.
   Humphrey, who has led Minnesota's top law office for six years
and served in the state Senate for 10 years before that, said he is
campaigning on his own record, not that of his father, who died in
1978 and was briefly succeeded by his widow, Muriel.
   ``My father's accomplishments, with my mother's help, are
unparalleled in this century,'' Humphrey said.
   Humphrey said he could never take his father's place.
   ``But I know I can take Mr. Durenberger's,'' he said.
   He charged Durenberger, elected in 1982, had failed his
constituents.
   ``His priorities have been Star Wars, Contra aid, Judge (Robert)
Bork, cutting Social Security, slashing Medicare and turning his
back on the deficit,'' said Humphrey.
   Leon Oistad, Durenberger's campaign manager, said Humphrey's
announcement speech was ``riddled with distortions'' about
Durenberger's record.
   Humphrey faces an uphill battle in his bid to unseat
Durenberger, lagging behind the incumbent in both fund-raising and
the polls. The latest poll, conducted last month by the St. Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch, WCCO-TV and WCCO Radio, showed Durenberger
leading Humphrey by 51 percent to 38 percent.
   Oistad said Durenberger has not decided when he will officially
enter the race.
   The only other announced candidate is Polly Mann, 67, a
co-founder of Women Against Military Madness, running as an
independent.
   Mica, a 44-year-old former school teacher and fifth-term
congressman, dismissed sentiment among some Democrats that there
should be no challenge to Askew in the race for the Florida Senate
seat.
   ``If you've read the papers, it looks like a handful of
political kingmakers are trying to say, `We'll select the
candidate; only one person should run,' he said.
   ``I've got news for them. There are 12 million people in this
state who will have a voice.''
   Mica has had a high profile in Congress in foreign policy and as
chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which last year
took him to Moscow to look into concerns about security at the U.S.
Embassy.
   He has been a supporter of President Reagan's Central America
policy, but this month voted against the Contra aid package, saying
the peace process should be given some time.
   Initial statewide polls have indicated he runs 6-to-1 behind
Askew. Mica says he can catch up by mid-summer.
   On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack III is the only
declared candidate.
   On Monday, Pennsylvania Republican Sen. John Heinz III announced
he will seek a third term.
   Heinz, 49, kicked off his campaign with a two-day series of
stops. Former Philadelphia city controller Joseph Vignola filed
petitions to enter the April 26 primary for the Democratic
nomination to oppose Heinz, great-grandson of the founder of the
food maker H.J. Heinz Co.

<HEAD>Historians Criticize Play on Lenin, Stalin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts grafs 1-3 to raise reference to critics.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three historians have criticized a new play that
equates Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin with his successor,
dictator Josef V. Stalin, and provides a negative picture of 70
years of Soviet history.
   The criticism of the Mikhail Shatrov's play ``Onward ... Onward
... Onward'' was contained in a half-page article published Tuesday
in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   The play was published in December and is to be performed this
spring in Moscow. Shatrov, a leading writer, has used the greater
artistic freedom of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms to produce plays
on historical subjects that previously could not be touched by
Soviet artists.
   A play published last spring reviewed Lenin's decision to pull
revolutionary Russia out of World War I against the advice of many
of his supporters.
   The new work takes the form of a debate among Bolsheviks and
their opponents looking back over 70 years of Soviet history at the
1917 revolution that brought communists to power.
   The historians, G. Gerasimenko, O. Obichkin and B. Popov,
accused Shatrov of using Lenin as a conduit for his own ideas and
treats the Bolshevik revolution as an accident instead of the
historical certainty that Soviet theorists claim it was.
   They said Shatrov's play equates Stalin and Lenin, echoing those
who claim ``that the methods of Stalin are identical to those of
Lenin, that Stalin starts his roots from Lenin's epoch. Thus the
author unequivocally gives a negative description not of Stalin
alone but the whole period of the socialist construction of this
country,'' they said.
   Pravda has criticized the play briefly before, but the lengthy
article Monday was the most detailed and serious rejoinder.
   In Shatrov's play, Stalin is made to answer for the purges in
which millions died by his former comrades who also became his
victims. But in one scene, Lenin says that he is to blame for not
making sure before his death in 1924 that Stalin never would be
able to take supreme power.
   The plan ends with only Stalin and Lenin on stage. Shatrov
expresses the wish that Stalin would leave the stage, but he
remains.

<TEXT>
   A somber nation marked the 1,000th day of captivity
Tuesday of journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, but neither French nor
Iranian officials offered much hope that the hostage would leave
Lebanon soon.
   Marathon runners carried a large chain to symbolize Kauffmann's
captivity during a 1,000-kilometer trek from Brittany in northwest
France to a barge on the Seine, where politicians and loved ones
called for Kauffmann's release.
   ``It is important that the captors know that all of France is
united,'' his wife, Joelle.
   ``I came here to express my solidarity,'' said Human Rights
Minister Claude Malhuret.
   The Newspaper Guild of America, the Prague-based International
Organization of Journalists and the Journalists' Committee for the
Liberation of French Hostages in Lebanon all issued statements
appealing for the freeing of Kauffmann and other captives.
   The education ministry asked that the statement by the French
group be read in classrooms.
   But the name of another hostage, Middle East researcher Michel
Seurat, abducted with Kauffmann on May 22, 1985, was barely
uttered.The Shitte Moslem group Islamic Jihad, which claimed the
abductions, announced March 5, 1986, that Seurat had been executed.
   Seurat's wife, Mary, asked that his name no longer be mentioned
in nightly newscasts that count off the hostages' days of captivity.
   ``We would like even more to be close to them, to tell them to
hold on, that nothing will be neglected and nothing is,'' President
Francois Mitterrand said on television.
   ``But it is so hard, so difficult in the face of this pitiless
act to arrange that Jean-Paul Kauffmann and our other Frenchmen
held hostage be freed one day.''
   Kauffmann, 43, a reporter for the newsweekly Evenement du Jeudi,
and Seurat were taken hostage as they drove from the Beirut airport
following Kauffmann's arrival.
   Two other French hostages, diplomats Marcel Carton, 64, and
Marcel Fontaine, 45, kidnapped March 22, 1985, have passed their
1,000th days as captives.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held of the 22 foreign hostages in
Lebanon. He was captured March 16, 1985.
   Six French hostages, most of them held by the Organization of
Revolutionary Justice, have been freed since conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac came to power in March 1986.
   In each case, France thanked Iran, which has influence over the
groups holding Westerners captive.
   Iranian Vice Minister Ali Reza Moayeri, in a French television
interview Tuesday, said that Iran was not to be counted on for the
freeing of more hostages.
   Iran ``benefits from a very important influence (in Lebanon)
that can be used to free Western hostages, including French, but at
a time when we have satisfying relations with France,'' Moayeri
said.
   ``For the moment, diplomatic relations being broken between our
two countries, no move in favor of the hostages can be undertaken.''
   France severed relations with Iran on July 17 after a dispute
over an embassy employee who refused to submit to questioning about
a series of bombings in Paris.
   ``Never would we have imagined seeing the 1,000 days,'' said
Kauffmann's mother, Odette. ``I never thought myself capable of
facing such a test.''

<TEXT>
   A Conrail engineer who ran a stop signal and
caused an Amtrak crash that killed 16 people pleaded guilty to one
count of manslaughter Tuesday in a bargain that will bring him no
worse than five years in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Rick L. Gates, 33, who was scheduled to begin a trial on 16
counts of manslaughter by locomotive, was operating the three
linked Conrail engines Jan. 4, 1987, when they skidded in front of
an Amtrak passenger train carrying 660 people. The worst accident
in Amtrak's history left 16 dead and more than 170 injured.
   Gates was granted the guilty verdict after attorneys agreed to
include in the single misdemeanor count the names of all 16
fatalities. Prosecutors reserved the right to ask for the maximum
sentence of five years and $1,000.
   Baltimore County Circuit Judge Joseph F. Murphy set sentencing
for March 29. Gates remained free on $11,500 bail.
   Despite the admission by Gates and brakeman Edward Cromwell that
they smoked marijuana in the cab, prosecutors said expert witnesses
were ``unable to render an opinion regarding impairment.'' Blood
and urine samples showed that both men tested positive for
marijuana.
   ``This is the first-ever manslaughter by locomotive verdict,''
said Sandra O'Connor, Baltimore County state's attorney and the
chief prosecutor. ``This will send a message that (operators)
cannot work under the kind of negligence that Mr. Gates did.''
   But prosecutors, she said, were not certain the judge would have
sentenced Gates, if convicted, to 16 consecutive five-year terms.
Mrs. O'Connor said one reason she decided to accept the plea
agreement was the recent federal appeals court ruling against
automatic post-accident drug testing for all railroad workers.
   Families of victims, survivors and friends filled the small
courtroom, some crying and others shaking their heads while a
prosecutor read a 42-page statement of facts detailing the crash
and actions by Gates and Cromwell.
   After the hearing, Gates told reporters outside the courthouse,
``I am ultimately responsible for the crash and for my negligence.
I can't begin to imagine the pain and grief of the families. I am
sorry.''
   ``The sentence is woefully inadequate,'' said Arthur Johnson, a
founder of Safe Travel America, whose daughter Christy was killed
in the crash.
   ``I am grossly disappointed that he can cause tens of millions
of dollars in damage and kill 16 people and still face only five
years on a misdemeanor charge,'' said Dr. Roger Horn, whose
16-year-old daughter Ceres was killed.
   Cromwell, who was not charged, was granted immunity from
prosecution and was scheduled to testify against Gates.
   The statement, agreed to by both sides, blamed Gates for missing
two track signals and allowing the locomotives to skid through a
switch where four tracks converge to two about 600 yards before the
Gunpowder River Bridge crossing.
   The statement revealed that Gates lied to the National
Transportation Safety Board about the track signals and about his
and Cromwell's drug use on the train.
   According to the statement, the first signal 1.7 miles from the
switch indicated that the Conrail engines should slow down and stop
before crossing onto the Amtrak track. Gates had insisted the
signal told him to proceed.
   The statement blamed Gates for failing to replace a cab warning
light bulb and fix a whistle that was taped over. Either warning
device would have alerted Gates to the stop signals, the statement
said.
   The statement also reported that Cromwell said he and Gates had
smoked part of a marijuana cigarette in the cab shortly after
leaving Baltimore.
   Following the crash, Cromwell ran back to the Conrail engines to
get his marijuana pipe, which he then discarded in the yard of a
nearby home, the statement said. He left the scene while Gates
stayed to help the rescue effort, the statement said.
   Gates and Cromwell met at Cromwell's home on Jan. 6, the night
before they met with NTSB investigators and agreed to a version of
the events that would not incriminate either of them.

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Says West Germany Should Keep Short-Range
Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary George Younger said Tuesday that
a refusal by West Germany to continue deploying short-range nuclear
missiles would leave a ``gaping hole'' in NATO's ability to back up
conventional forces with a nuclear threat.
   Younger also said he hoped NATO will make decisions as early as
this spring on modernizing nuclear forces following the superpower
agreement to withdraw their land-based medium-range missiles from
Europe.
   ``I think they (West Germany) will talk about it a lot, raise it
a lot, but not actually press it because ... it would leave a
gaping hole in flexible response,'' Younger said, speaking at a
lunch for American reporters.
   NATO flexible response strategy calls for the use of nuclear
weapons, starting with the shortest range, if conventional forces
are being overrun.
   The superpower agreement has provoked a furious argument in West
Germany about whether to modernize, or even maintain, missiles with
ranges up to 300 miles after the superpower agreement.
   West Germany, the East bloc's closest neighbor, sees itself as
being left uniquely vulnerable to nuclear attack both as the main
depository of short-range missiles and the only Western ally within
range of similar Soviet missiles.
   ``By far, greater danger faced by us and by Germany is the huge
conventional imbalance _ those thousands of (Soviet) tanks which
are ready to roll across the north German plains,'' said Younger.
   On modernizing remaining nuclear forces, Younger said he hoped
decisions could be made at NATO's military planning group meeting
in April, but this might not be possible until the autumn.
   ``We shall be in a position to decide as soon as we see the
proposals,'' said Younger.
   He said that if NATO ``lowers its guard now,'' the Soviets will
never agree to the proposed halving of superpower long-range
missiles, or do deals on chemical and conventional weapons.
   His remarks reflected the British view that the United States
should not negotiate with Moscow on eliminating short-range
missiles unless there is agreement to ban chemical weapons and cut
Soviet superiority in conventional armaments.
   Asked about a recent suggestion by U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci that the United States might withdraw troops from Europe
if West Germany rejected nuclear missiles, Younger said any
American troop withdrawal would ``send the wrong signal.''
   It was vital, he said, to NATO cohesion that nobody doubted
America's commitment to the belief that ``the defense of the
Western free world starts in Europe.''

   The Cabinet on Tuesday approved an ordinance that
will give government employees a taste of the five-day workweek.
   Beginning in April, about 1.1 million public sector workers will
alternate between the new system and the old one of six-day
workweeks, said Katsunari Miyoshi of the Management and
Coordination Agency.
   The new system will give workers two five-day weeks and two
six-day weeks each month.
   The Cabinet move came more than six years after the five-day
system was started on a trial basis in November 1981, Miyoshi said.
   Japan's trading partners, including the United States, have
called for shorter working hours for Japanese workers. Increased
leisure time translates into greater spending, which helps boost
Japan's domestic consumption and correct its trade imbalances.
   In the private sector, 50.9 percent of Japanese companies with a
workforce of 30 or more currently operate on a five-day workweek,
according to a Labor Ministry survey.

<TEXT>
   Eleven companies conspired in a
bid-rigging scheme that inflated the price of lunchroom milk by at
least $10 million over a decade, an antitrust lawsuit charged
Tuesday.
   ``The ultimate effect of the conspiracy was to take coins from
the pockets of Florida's school children. We find that to be
shameful,'' said Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth,
holding up empty half-pint milk cartons similar to those sold in
schools.
   The federal civil suit, filed in Miami by the attorney general's
office, represents the largest antitrust action ever taken against
the milk industry and may be as far-reaching as the highway
bid-rigging scandals that rocked some states in the late 1970s,
Butterworth said.
   The investigation, Butterworth said, could result in criminal
charges in Florida and may spread to other states as well.
   The suit was filed against seven major milk producers and four
Florida distributors, alleging that high-level officials of the
companies established production levels, divided the Florida market
among themselves and fixed an inflated price on half-pint cartons
of milk over the past 10 years.
   Company spokesmen had little to say about the allegations on
Tuesday.
   The attorney general said the overcharges exceeded at least $10
million because, his office estimated, the price of each carton was
inflated by more than 1 penny. More than 1 billion cartons were
sold during the 10-year period.
   Butterworth said the state is seeking more than $30 million from
the companies, or three times the amount of the alleged
overcharges. If the state is awarded damages, the money will be
distributed to the public school boards in 32 Florida counties that
bought the milk and resold it to students, he said.
   Dairy processors named in the suit were Southland Corp. (Velda
Farms) of Dallas; Borden Inc. of Columbus, Ohio; Flavorich Inc. of
Louisville, Ky.; Dean Foods Products Co. of Chicago; Pet Inc. of
St. Louis, Mo.; Kraft (Sealtest) of Chicago; and Hart's Dairy (Dean
Foods) of Fort Myers, Fla.
   Distributors named in the suit were Marshall Simmons Enterprise
of Mango; Pierson Distributors Inc. of Opa Locka; H&T Distributors
Inc. of Homestead; and Butler Foods of Naples. All four are in
Florida.
   ``We understand that the Florida attorney general has filed a
lawsuit ... We have not been served with a copy of the suit,'' said
William Fischer, financial vice president of Dean Foods.
   ``We are aware the investigation has been going on in Florida
and that a number of our employees have been subpoenaed over the
past few months. Other than that, we really don't have anything
else to add,'' Fischer said.
   Scott Horne, a media relations assistant for Kraft, was not
immediately available for comment, his secretary said.
   Borden spokesman Chris Tilton said the company had not seen a
copy of the lawsuit and had no comment.
   There was no immediate comment from other milk producers
contacted. The four Florida distributors referred telephone calls
to the companies whose products they distribute.
   ``These companies went to extraordinary lengths to conceal their
conspiracy from government officials,'' Butterworth said. ``The
scope and design of the conspiracy made it almost impossible for an
individual school district to detect it.''
   Butterworth said the attorney general's office has been feeding
data from Florida school boards into a computer for analysis for
the past two years. He declined to say what prompted the
investigation.
   The lawsuit alleged the conspiracy involved Florida counties
south of Ocala and mostly affected the Dade, Broward and
Hillsborough school districts. The 32 counties buy about 171.8
million cartons of milk a year at an annual cost of $25.7 million.

   Accusing management of union-busting tactics,
2,500 tugboat workers and other marine employees went on strike
against nine companies Tuesday. The walkout had little effect on
the flow of goods through New York Harbor, officials said.
   ``My understanding from this morning is that boats were being
loaded,'' said Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   ``No problems,'' said Gregory Storey of the New York Shipping
Association, an umbrella group for deep sea shipping companies.
   Albert Cornette, president of Local 333 of the International
Longshoremen's Association, said his 2,500 members unanimously
rejected the companies' demands for the elimination of 750 jobs and
for wage and benefit givebacks.
   ``They have been telling our people, `We'll bust you.' What does
that mean?'' asked Cornette. ``They said they would take a strike
rather than renew or negotiate our contracts.''
   Negotiations were suspended Monday and no further meetings were
scheduled, Cornette said.
   Police established a temporary base on Staten Island near seven
of the companies, which have hired temporary replacements for the
strikers.
   Five firms have locked the workers out and four have not come to
terms, Cornette said. He said the union has signed with nine other
companies, and 10 others have unexpired contracts.
   Officials of the marine-towing companies refused to comment.
   Salaries for Local 333 members range from $385 a day for
captains to $175 a day for deckhands, based on a 12-hour day with
overtime, Cornette said. He said members' wages average about
$35,000 a year.

<HEAD>Approval Announced For Expanded Use Of Experimental AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental drug for treatment of one of
the main life-threatening infections associated with AIDS was
approved for wider use Tuesday.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said
trimetrexate has been moved into the ``treatment investigational
new drug'' category for treatment of certain Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia patients.
   However, because the drug has potentially lethal side-effects it
must be used in conjunction with another drug called leucovorin
that mitigates those effects.
   Under Food and Drug Administrations conditions accompanying
approval for wider use of trimetrexate, it is to be distributed to
patients who have shown a severe adverse reaction to the two drugs
already on the market for treating Pneumocystis carinii.
   Elaine Baldwin, a spokeswoman for the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that means trimetrexate is
likely to be available to about 300 patients nationwide.
   She said it will be made available free to patients who qualify,
with NIAID _ a branch of the National Institutes of Health _ and
the manufacturer, Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J.,
handling distribution and bearing the cost.
   Despite the existence of two powerful drugs to treat the rare
form of pneumonia, scientists involved in clinical trials have been
interested in the possibility that trimetrexate may prove less
toxic for some patients when it is used in conjunction with
leucovorin.
   ``This treatment IND will allow us to offer an important
treatment alternative to severely ill patients who cannot tolerate
the standard therapy,'' said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci.
   Under the so-called treatment IND category, drug developers and
researchers can make promising experimental drugs available to
patients with immediately life-threatening diseases before the
drugs have passed full safety and efficacy review by the FDA.
   That makes it more widely available to certain patients, but
under more carefully controlled conditions than when a drug wins
approval for general marketing.
   Bowen made the announcement at the start of a two-day seminar
sponsored jointly by the FDA and American Medical Association to
familiarize health professions with the new treatment IND rules
that went into effect late last year.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.

   A distraught, naked man set fire to his home
and jumped through a window into the flames and died, police said
Tuesday.
   Brian E. Morgan, 28, was despondent over a breakup with his
girlfriend, whose parents own the Hollywood Hills house in which he
had been living, police Lt. Roger Fox said.
   Morgan's body was recovered in the living room late Monday
night, Fox said.
   Neighbors reported Morgan set fires inside the house before
running outside and trying to ignite a gas meter, police Detective
John Clark said.
   When that failed he lighted a towel he was carrying and told
onlookers, ``I have to die,'' Clark said.
   When firefighters arrived shortly after 11 p.m. they saw the
naked man standing on the porch of the flaming house, city Fire
Department spokesman Jim Wells said. ``Then he dove through the
window,'' Wells said.
   Therapists were called in to counsel firefighters traumatized by
witnessing the suicide, Wells said.
   Damage was limited mainly to the living room and was estimated
at $15,000.
   Authorities declinded to identify the homeowners or their
daughter.

   Another field trial has been approved for
testing genetically altered tomato plants that can survive spraying
of a chemical herbicide to kill surrounding weeds, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said a permit for the
field test was issued to E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.,
Wilmington, Del. The company expects to begin testing this spring
near Brandenton, Fla.
   The genetically engineered plants were designed to tolerate
sulfonylurea, described as a new class of low-risk chemical weed
killers. Glosser said his agency ``completed a thorough review of
the methodology and scientific data and determined that the tests
would not have a significant impact on the environment.''
   By using plants that can withstand herbicides, farmers could
kill weeds without having to worry about hurting their crops.
   The du Pont field trial is the third test approved by the USDA
agency. Previously, permits were issued to Calgene Inc., Davis,
Calif., for tobacco and tomato plants that tolerate the herbicides
bromoxynil and glyphosate.
   Glosser said the field tests are all similar. Two groups of
plants _ one genetically engineered and the other conventionally
grown _ are sprayed with the same herbicide.

   Angolan army troops killed
four South African soldiers in a clash in southern Angola, South
African army commander Gen. Jamie Geldenhuys said Tuesday.
   Geldenhuys said the soldiers were killed during the weekend when
Angolan troops fired a Soviet-made anti-aircraft gun at a vehicle
in which the soldiers were riding, but gave no further details
about the time or place.
   His statement Tuesday was the first confirmation from South
Africa of repeated reports from the Marxist Angolan government that
South African forces were still fighting in support of the Angolan
rebel movement, UNITA.
   ``Since the weekend, UNITA has achieved resounding success and
FAPLA (the Angolan government army) is now retreating in disarray
and trying to organize a desperate last stand,'' he said.
   The Angolan Defense Ministry said South African forces launched
a new attack east of the southern city of Cuito Cuanavale Sunday,
leaving ``considerable casualties on both sides,'' Angola's
state-run ANGOP news agency reported Tuesday.
   The ANGOP report, in a dispatch monitored in Lisbon, Portugal,
apparently referred to the same battle.
   The South Africans announced fighting a major battle in November
against Cuban- and Soviet-led Angolan forces at Cuito Cuanavale,
and later reported the deaths of more than 40 South African and
South-West African soldiers in Angola, without specifying where or
how they died.
   Since announcing in December that its forces were withdrawing
from Angola, the South African Defense Force has refused to comment
on Angolan government estimates of South African troop strength.
   ANGOP quoted the Angolan Defense Ministry as estimating Tuesday
that 7,000 South African troops remained in Angola's southern
Cuando-Cubango province after recent reinforcements.
   ANGOP reported heavy fighting was still under way late Monday 12
miles east of Cuito Cuanavale.
   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi claimed his troops forced the
government soldiers out of Cuito Cuanavale several weeks ago. He
said UNITA now surrounds the deserted town, which had been the
annual starting point for the government's dry-season offensives
against rebel strongholds in the southeast.
   The rebels also receive military aid from the United States,
while the government receives Soviet military aid and has a
reported Cuban support force of 40,000 regulars in the mineral-rich
nation.
   In Lisbon Tuesday, UNITA released a statement saying it has
allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross to resume its
activities in the war-wracked southern African nation.
   The note, signed by UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, said the rebels
``authorized resumption of (Red Cross) activities to the (Angolan)
people.''
   UNITA has been fighting a wide-ranging bush war since 1976, the
year after Angola secured its independence from Portugal, to force
the government to share power.

<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO on Tuesday condemned
Israel's ``use of excessive force'' against Palestinian civilians
on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, its first-ever
rebuke of Israel.
   The condemnation was issued by the 14.3-million-member labor
federation's executive council an hour after meeting with Secretary
of State George Shultz. Shultz is scheduled to make a week-long
visit to the Middle East Feb. 24 to promote new negotiations
between Israel and Jordan on Palestinian self-rule.
   The AFL-CIO blamed Islamic fundamentalists for ``fueling the
flames of violence in the occupied territories,'' but said the
Palestinian demonstrations did not warrant unnecessary force used
by Israeli defense forces.
   ``No doubt such incidents can be attributed to the inexperience
of the Israeli army in riot control and other police functions, and
to the frustrations of Israeli soldiers as they confront young
Palestinians hurling stones and petrol bombs,'' the federation
said. ``These factors may explain, but they cannot excuse, and the
AFL-CIO cannot condone, the use of excessive force against
civilians.''
   The federation, however, rejected what it called a ``notion that
Israel must now redeem itself by turning the West Bank and Gaza
Strip over to the Palestine Liberation Organization.'' More than 50
Palestinians have been killed and thousands of others have been
injured or arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied territories
since early December.
   Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the labor federation, said it is
the first time the AFL-CIO has made any criticism of an Israeli
action. ``They haven't crushed children's hands before,'' he said.
   The annual winter meeting of the labor leaders here was Shultz's
last stop of an extended weekend in southern Florida to gain
support from traditional friends of Israel for his effort to soften
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's opposition to entering new
peace negotiations.
   Shultz addressed a meeting of the B'Nai B'rith Anti-Defamation
League in Palm Beach on Friday, seeking help from the U.S. Jewish
community in pressing Shamir to show more flexibility.
   ``There's been so much emphasis on the process ... direct
negotiations on the one hand, an international conference or some
kind of international vehicle on the other ... that the discussion
has become a little sterile,'' he said Tuesday. ``If we are going
to get going, we need to talk a little bit more about the substance
of what might happen.''

<TEXT>
   Comedian Red Skelton will read a
tribute to his longtime friend Frederick Loewe during a public
memorial service Wednesday in the composer's desert home.
   Loewe, who collaborated with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner on classic
songs for ``My Fair Lady,'' ``Brigadoon,'' ``Camelot,'' ``Gigi''
and other musicals, died Sunday. He was 86.
   The memorial service will be held in Loewe's Palm Springs home
at 11 a.m. Wednesday, with Skelton delivering the eulogy, Diana
Wiefel of Wiefel & Son Funeral Home said Tuesday.
   ``His music will be immortal. The world will always hear him
speak, feel his emotions, for he has only put on a shroud that
makes him invisible,'' Skelton, a friend for 45 years, said Monday.
   Loewe will be buried Wednesday during a private ceremony at
nearby Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, Ms. Wiefel said. The
time wasn't disclosed to assure privacy.
   Loewe was the co-creator of songs like ``On the Street Where You
Live,'' ``If Ever I Would Leave You,'' and ``They Call the Wind
Maria.''
   Among the Lerner-Loewe musicals were ``Brigadoon'' in 1947,
``Paint Your Wagon'' in 1951, ``My Fair Lady'' in 1956 and
``Camelot'' in 1960. The duo produced ``Gigi'' in 1958 as a movie
and in 1973 for the stage.
   Loewe won Tony awards for his work on ``My Fair Lady'' and
``Gigi.''
   Some of the songs the team produced were ``Almost Like Being in
Love,'' ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' ``Get Me to the Church
on Time'' and ``Thank Heaven for Little Girls.''
   Loewe married the former Ernestine Zerline in 1931 and was
divorced 26 years later. The couple had no children.
   Lerner died in 1986.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Feb. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.86 million head,
up 8 percent from a year ago and 3 percent from two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.76 million
head, down 2 percent from a year ago but 1 percent above two years
ago.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.66 million head, up 4 percent from a year
ago and 5 percent more than in January 1986. The report said those
were the largest January feedlot placements since 1974.
   As of Feb. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year
earlier in six states and down in Iowa. The states account for
about three-fourths of the nation's beef production.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
tates. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Feb. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   Mayor Andrew Young apologized Tuesday to local
ministers for remarks last week about presidential candidates Pat
Robertson and Jesse Jackson which were interpreted as being
critical of preachers.
   Young, speaking last week to a group of student journalists,
said, ``I don't think you can go directly from the pulpit to the
presidency.'' Though Young was specifically critical of Robertson,
a former television evangelist, in his speech, he also extended his
remarks to include black preachers, of which Jackson is one.
   Young, himself an ordained Congregationalist minister, told
black clergymen Tuesday his remarks were intended to be
tongue-in-cheek.
   ``I consider myself a preacher,'' Young said. ``I in no way
intended or suggested that there was anything involved in the
ministry of the gospel that should be taken lightly. I think I was
guilty of making a tongue-in-cheek statement that I think the
audience understood (and) implied no disrespect.''
   Suggesting that Robertson and Jackson lack the experience to be
president, Young told the students: ``If you're a preacher, you
talk for a living, so even if you don't make sense, you learn to
make nonsense eloquently.
   ``Not that black preachers are different from white preachers,
but black preachers start out not intending to make sense,'' he
said.

   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson is scheduled to attend a rally this weekend for striking
Mobil employees, a union official says.
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox and Texas AFL-CIO President
Harry Hubbard also plan to attend the Saturday afternoon rally,
said Jimmy Herrington, secretary and treasurer for the local Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union.
   About 1,350 Mobil employees went on strike Feb. 4 over the
staffing of a new centralized control center at the refinery. Mobil
wants to use supervisory employees, while the union insists that
its members work the jobs.
   Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Local also struck Mobil because the company wants to relax some
rules regarding which employees can perform electrical work.

   Key supporters of Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
were invited to view the Democratic presidential contender via
satellite at ``Countdown to Super Tuesday'' breakfasts in the
immediate wake of the New Hampshire primary.
   Gore's campaign said Tuesday the candidate would speak from
Houston to countdown breakfasts in more than 50 locations in the 20
states that select convention delegates on March 8, Super Tuesday.
   Gore's remarks for the Wednesday morning telecast were
characterized by his campaign manager, Fred Martin, as ``a national
message'' broadcast to ``the people who will carry his message to
the voters on Super Tuesday.''
   Gore wrote off the Iowa caucuses and spent little time in New
Hampshire, preferring to direct his resources on his native South
and its rich lode of delegates.

<HEAD>Police Seeking Four Men Who Forced 40 Partygoers to Strip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police hunted Tuesday for four men who
burst into a recording studio wielding machine guns and ordered
about 40 partygoers to strip before robbing them.
   Witnesses said the bandits were looking for Twin Cities vocalist
Alexander O'Neal, who recently topped the black music charts with
``Fake.'' But O'Neal was not at the party, which followed a concert
by him in Minneapolis, when the men burst into the small studio in
the basement of a St. Paul beauty salon.
   Joseph Karriem, a victim and the son of the salon owner, said
the robbers appeared to be under the mistaken impression that
members of O'Neal's band had brought with them a significant amount
of money earned from the concert.
   ``They came ready to rob Fort Knox,'' Karriem said.
   ``They were looking for the money from the Orpheum,'' said
Karriem's mother, Tommie. ``They came in here looking for Alexander
O'Neal.''
   Police had no suspects, Lt. Robert Anderson, head of the St.
Paul police robbery unit, said Tuesday.
   However, Anderson said investigators believe none of the money
stolen was concert proceeds. The total value of goods and cash
stolen has yet to be compiled, he added.
   According to Ms. Karriem, the men who broke up the party at 4
a.m. Monday forced some guests to strip to their underwear and
others to strip completely.
   ``We were all deathly afraid,'' said Ms. Karriem. ``These were
terrorists. They made us lay on top of each other naked in the
corner and pointed the machine guns at our heads. They told us what
they were, Thompsons and Uzis.''
   ``Anytime anyone would look up from the floor, the robbers would
threaten to shoot,'' police Sgt. Michael Schwab said Monday. ``They
took everything _ jewelry, wallets, keys, coats.''
   O'Neal's bass player, Rocky Garrity, walked in during the middle
of the robbery and was beaten with a gun until he went into
convulsions, said Ms. Karriem. Garrity was treated at St.
Paul-Ramsey Medical Center and released, authorities said.
   Joseph Karriem said the bandits ``had plenty of time to leave,
but they wanted to torment us. ... They were even talking about
wasting the police.
   ``I've never seen anything like this in St. Paul or
Minneapolis.''
   Karriem said he believes the party-goers were set up by someone
who knew about the celebration.
   Witnesses said the gunmen left a message for O'Neal, 34, who
went to Houston after the concert Monday.
   ``They told us to tell Alex that their children didn't have
nothing for Christmas, but they had something now,'' Karriem said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration said Tuesday it has
begun an investigation into allegations that the government of
South Korea has unfairly restricted U.S. cigarette sales in its
markets.
   ``The Korean cigarette market is approximately $2.1 billion (a
year) and is totally controlled by government monopoly,'' U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a statement announcing
the investigation.
   The inquiry could lead to retaliatory tariffs against South
Korean products if the government finds that the Korean
restrictions constitute an unfair trading practice.
   The government action came on a petition filed last month by the
U.S. Cigarette Export Association, which contends that Korean
barriers are causing U.S. firms to lose $500 million annually in
potential exports.
   In his statement, Yeutter said the industry petition ``raises
questions about whether policies of the Korean government restrict
U.S. companies from open and non-discriminatory access to the
Korean cigarette market.''
   ``During the investigation, the United States will make
additional efforts to resolve this issue with the Korean
government,'' Yeutter said, noting that the petition had been
accepted ``following extensive consultations between the two
governments over the past two years aimed at achieving open and
non-discriminatory market access.''
   Earlier this month, the U.S. government stripped duty-free
import treatment from products from South Korea and three other
Asian exporters _ Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.
   The United States last year ran a $7.1 billion trade deficit
with South Korea.
   In a related move, the American Meat Institute on Tuesday filed
a petition protesting a South Korean ban on the import of
high-quality beef, claiming the ban is costing it $5 million a
year. The government has 45 days to act on the petition.

Shot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Assailants tossed two hand grenades
into a crowded Hindu temple during a religious festival Tuesday,
killing at least five people and injuring 10 others, police and
eyewitnesses said.
   Police said the grenades were flung at the Kathiresan temple in
the heart of Colombo on the main Galle Road. More than 60 people
were inside the temple at the time of the explosions, temple
officials said.
   The temple's clock, which was shattered in the blasts, showed
the time of the attack as 7:51 p.m. Coconuts, bananas and beetle
leaves brought by devotees as sacred offerings were scattered
throughout the temple's blood-splattered inner chambers.
   The victims of the blast were believed to be Tamils. Police,
army officials and a temple priest refused to speculate on who
might be responsible for the attack.
   The explosions at the temple occurred just hours after a major
politician and popular film star, Vijaya Kumaranatunga, was gunned
down by suspected Sinhalese extremists at his home. Another person
injured in the gunfire later died in the hospital.
   Police said they did not know if the two attacks were related.
   Sri Lanka has been torn by Tamil separatist violence in the
north and east. The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu and form 18
percent of the country's 16 million people, say they are
discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   S. Pathmanabha, a priest at the Kathiresan temple, told The
Associated Press he was about to begin the main ceremony of the
Shivaratri religious festival when the blasts occurred.
   More than 100 army troops and policemen cordoned off the area
and launched a massive search for the assailants. The police also
searched for other hidden explosives in the vicinity.
   An officer from the army's bomb disposal squad said the grenades
were M-14s believed to be manufactured in Singapore.
   Police blamed Kumaranatunga's death, meanwhile, on the outlawed
People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese organization that
opposes the India-Sri Lanka peace accord signed July 29 to end the
Tamil ethnic war.
   Kumaranatunga, 43, had supported the accord, which grants some
autonomy to Tamil-dominated areas in exchange for a surrender of
arms. The largest Tamil rebel group has rejected the accord.
   More than 45,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to disarm the
Tamil rebels and enforce the peace accord. India is involved
because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils and its role
as a regional power.
   Kumaranatunga, a leader of the Sri Lanka Mahajana (People's)
Party and son-in-law of former Prime Minister Sirimavo
Bandaranaike, was expected to run as a presidential candidate of a
three-party alliance in 1989. The alliance issued a statement
Monday, condemning the killings of politicians by Sinhalese
militants.
   Kumaranatunga was gunned down when two men rode up to him on a
motorcycle at about noon and opened fire with an AK-47 or a T-56
submachine gun, according to Ignatius Canagaratnam, chief of the
police crime detection bureau.
   The gunmen escaped after the crime, Canagaratnam said. The other
victim of the attack was identified as Upali Sarath, an artist, he
said.

<TEXT>
   The PLO said Tuesday it will attack
Israeli targets to avenge the killing of three guerrillas and the
bombing of a ship intended to carry Palestinians on a protest
voyage to Israel.
   Abu Nidal's dissident PLO group, known for terrorist attacks,
also vowed revenge.
   Two of the bodies, of Mohammed Sultan and Mohammed Buheis, were
flown to Amman, Jordan, for burial.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has blamed Israeli secret
service, Mossad, for the killings Sunday and the explosion Monday
on the ferry Sol Phryne, both in Limassol. The ferry was holed
below the waterline.
   Cyprus condemned both attacks but made no accusations, and said
an investigation was being conducted to determine whether the
events were related.
   A PLO statement issued in Nicosia said: ``Israel knows that the
PLO is not handcuffed. ... The blood of our martyrs will not go
unavenged.''
   Sultan, Buheis and the third guerrilla, Marwan Kayyali, were
killed in a car bombing in Limassol, on the southern coast.
   They apparently were attacked after arranging the sale of the
Sol Phryne to a PLO-affiliated company for the ``ship of return''
voyage to Israel with 130 Palestinians who have been expelled from
Israeli-occupied Arab territories. The trip originally was to have
begun at Piraeus, Greece.
   In Athens, PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said the three men
were not linked to the voyage.
   ``We deny completely any relationship between the three who were
assassinated by the Israelis two days ago in Limassol and the
journey of return,'' he told reporters. ``We deny any relationship
between the three martyrs and chartering the boat. ... We deny also
... that the ship was bought by the three men.''
   He said they were ``on a different mission.''
   ``We are continuing our plans and we will sail, in spite of
Israeli terrorists who are using bombs against ideas, noble
ideas,'' Abu Sharif said.
   Cleanthis Vlahopoulos, captain of the ferry, said ``several
months'' would be needed to make the Sol Phryne seaworthy again.
   In Lebanon, a statement by the Abu Nidal group pledged to avenge
the guerrillas' deaths with ``double, swift retaliation.''
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, has been blamed
for terrorist attacks around the world since splitting from Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah guerrillas in the early 1970s. He is
wanted in Europe and the United States.
   A senior PLO official in Nicosia said the slain guerrillas were
not members of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council, but ``they
were popular, active and well-respected officers with whom Abu
Nidal had worked before he split from Fatah.''
   Also in Lebanon, a group calling itself Islamic Jihad Squads in
Palestine said it would kill Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
Israel Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon ``as a price for this
crime.'' The threat was contained in a statement delivered to a
Western news agency in Beirut.
   A man claiming to speak for the U.S.-based Jewish Defense League
said Monday it was responsible for the attack on the 6,151-ton Sol
Phryne.
   ``The JDL is responsible for the bombing at Limassol,'' he told
The Associated Press in Nicosia by telephone. ``This is only a
warning. Next time we will bomb it with all the people on it.''
   The head of the Jewish Defense League, Irv Rubin, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview Monday from Los Angeles
that the bombing was a ``righteous action'' but his organization
was not involved.
   Shamir has said the voyage would be considered ``a declaration
of war'' and Israel would stop it ``in the ways it sees suitable.''
   Israel's transport minister, Chaim Corfu, appeared to suggest on
Tuesday that his government was behind the bombing.
   If the PLO obtains another vessel, ``its fate will be the
same,'' he said on Israel radio. ``We knew we wouldn't allow the
boat to reach Israel. If we could prevent its departure, that was
obviously the right thing to do.''

<TEXT>
   A new disease-resistant iceberg lettuce,
Autumn Gold, may be on the market within a year, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   According to developer Edward J. Ryder, a USDA scientist at
Salinas, Calif., Autumn Gold resists mosaic virus, which causes
lettuce plants to have small, distorted heads and unhealthy-looking
dark and light green patterns.
   The virus is spread through lettuce fields by green peach
aphids, which use needle-like mouth parts to pierce a leaf and suck
its juices.
   ``Growers will find the variety ideal for November and December
harvest in the San Joaquin, Palo Verde and Imperial valleys of
California and the desert farmlands of Arizona,'' Ryder said in a
statement issued in Washington.
   Most of the nation's winter lettuce comes from those areas.
   Paul T. Orsetti, president of Brinker Orsetti Seed Co., Inc.,
Watsonville, Calif., said results from trials of Autumn Gold in
California and Arizona ``seem to be very promising, so we are
optimistic about the variety.''

<TEXT>
   The superconducting super collider, a $4.4 billion project
sought by seven states, was warmly supported by people attending
public hearings in Texas and Michigan on Tuesday.
   ``Contrary to some other areas in the United States who are
reluctant to participate in this razor edge of technology and
engage in what I call frontier spirit, we in Texas believe in this
project and this community is 100 percent behind it,'' Gov. Bill
Clements said at a hearing in Waxahachie.
   Only a few people among about 600 who attended a hearing at in
Stockbridge, Mich., expressed reservations. A union official
described the mood at that session as a ``pep rally,'' with young
women handing out buttons extolling the SSC and banners and road
signs declaring, `Michigan Is the Place To Be.''
   Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina and Tennessee also
are semi-finalists in the selection process. New York dropped out
because of strong local opposition at its proposed site.
   Scientists say the super collider, a huge atom-smasher 53 miles
in circumference, will provide new depth in high energy physics
research.
   When completed in 1996, the facility is expected to provide
2,500 jobs and an annual payroll of $270 million.
   Clements spoke near the beginning of a public hearing on the
environmental impact of the project on Ellis County, south of
Dallas.
   Officials said 112 people had signed up to make comments during
the 4{-hour hearing Tuesday afternoon. A second hearing was
scheduled for the evening.
   Local and state officials asserted the project has overwhelming
support in the area southeast of Lansing, Mich.
   ``People have questions, but once those questions are answered,
people are overwhelmingly supportive,'' said state Rep. Debbie
Stabenow, a Democrat whose district would include part of the
accelerator.
   Tuesday's meeting was advertised by the U.S. Department of
Energy as an ``environmental scoping'' session to explain the
project and allow citizens a chance to comment about issues which
should be considered in preparing an environmental impact statement.
   ``This is not a public referendum, but it is important we
understand how people feel,'' said Brian Quirke, a spokesman for
the DOE.
   ``Michigan needs it for (economic) diversification,'' said Dick
Howlett, a member of the Stockbridge Village Council, which
unanimously supports the project.
   He said some property owners who would be displaced are worried
about compenstation, but he said three-quarters of the people who
attended a recent council meeting supported the project.
   However, one man questioned whether the project had a military
application.
   ``I personally feel it will be a tool used for military uses,''
said Steve Grose of Onondaga. ``There is no doubt it would be used
for military means.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's armed forces are running short of
a critical spare part _ uniforms.
   The situation has gotten so bad, according to a new survey, that
the Marine Corps is issuing IOUs for coats to enlisted men and
women.
   Moreover, the Navy is reducing its supplies of peacoats and blue
jumpers at military exchanges to clothe recruits graduating from
boot camp; the Air Force has reduced from two to one the number of
blue service coats issued to many recruits, and the Army is running
out of coats, short-sleeve shirts, field caps and trousers.
   As the newspaper Navy Times stated Tuesday: ``The naked truth is
that the military is running out of uniforms.''
   The independent newspaper said it had surveyed the four services
and found agreement that the shortage could be traced to the
Defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia. That center has
been wracked over the past year by a kickback scandal involving a
handful of clothing companies and some Defense Department employees.
   ``Recovering from the indictments (is) our major problem,'' said
Paul Zebrowski, the deputy director of the center's Clothing and
Textile Directorate.
   ``It became impossible to do business with those companies. And
even before, our production base was very small.''
   The Marine Corps appears to be the hardest hit, the newspaper
said, with dwindling stocks of all three types of its uniform coats.
   A recent directive instructed Marine boot camps to issue one
complete green uniform to recruits along with ``an appropriate `due
member' certificate (IOU) for the coats not issued.''
   Clothing stores also have been told to stop selling dress blue
Marine coats ``except to those individuals in receipt of orders
where the blue uniform is required for the performance of duty,''
the directive added.
   In the Navy, men and women already in the fleet are finding
reduced selections of uniforms at exchanges when they need to
replace worn clothes because the service is giving boot camps first
priority.
   ``We feel very strongly that a recruit will have a full seabag
when he leaves (boot camp),'' said Becky Atkins, a Navy uniform
official.
   The Army is giving its recruits one field cap now instead of
two, and last August started running low on certain sizes of coats
after clothing contractors were debarred for misconduct.
   The Air Force, meanwhile, has been forced to cut back its issue
of blue service coats to many recruits from two to one. Those with
coat sizes in short supply are being given cash allowances to buy
their second coat after graduation, said Capt. Beth Unklesbay.
   Zebrowski declined to predict when the shortages might be
alleviated, saying: ``We're fighting this on an item-by-item
basis.''

<HEAD>Scientists Say US, Soviet Nuclear Warheads Should Be Dismantled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of American scientists on Tuesday
disputed Reagan administration statements that it was not practical
to verify the dismantlement of nuclear warheads under an arms
control agreement.
   Members of the Federation of American Scientists outlined at a
news conference a dismantlement plan worked out earlier this month
in conjunction with the Committee of Soviet Scientists Against the
Nuclear Threat, headed by Roald Sagdayev, head of the Soviet
civilian space agency.
   Jeremy J. Stone, president of the U.S. group, and members Frank
von Hippel and Theodore B. Taylor, said they were concerned that
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci may have raised ``misconceptions''
in defending the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact. The pact
calls for the elimination of all medium-range U.S. and Soviet
missiles.
   Carlucci and other administration officials, defending the
treaty against conservative Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said it did
not require the destruction of warheads from the banned missiles
because verifying that step could expose secrets on how the devices
are built.
   The administration further argued that destroying the warheads
would free up weapons-grade plutonium which could be used by
terrorists. And officials said the Soviets could simply produce
more weapons material to replace any destroyed.
   Although Stone, Taylor and Von Hippel support the INF pact, they
took issue with Carlucci, and proposed a system under which
warheads could be dismantled and the material either used in
reactors or buried underground.
   Under the plan, the Soviet Union and United States would each
designate a dismantlement site, which would be closely monitored to
prevent the clandestine entry or exit of nuclear material, said
Taylor, who worked in the national laboratory at Los Alamos in
1949-56 designing nuclear weapons.
   Nuclear warheads entering the site would be ``tagged'' for
identification and ``fingerprinted'' by neutron probes, x-rays or
gamma rays which the scientists said would verify that the devices
contained nuclear materials but would not disclose their inner
workings.
   The warheads would then be dismantled behind closed doors at the
nation which owned them, and inspectors from the other nation would
verify that nuclear material had left the site.
   In the case of American warheads, Soviet ``inspectors'' would
only have to verify that a batch of nuclear warheads had entered a
U.S. dismantlement facility and that, after all the warheads had
been dismantled and their components destroyed beyond recognition,
no intact nuclear warheads remained inside, the scientists said in
a statement.
   Taylor and Von Hippel recommended that weapons-grade plutonium
from the warheads be mixed with radioactive wastes and buried.
   They recommended that highly enriched uranium also used in
nuclear weapons be used to fuel reactors for electric power plants.
The estimated cost of dismantling the warheads, about $6 billion,
would be dwarfed by the value of the fuel, about $50 billion, they
said.
   Taylor said in a paper that ``the approximately 1,000 tons of
U-235 (enriched uranium) and 200 tons of plutonium in the world's
more than 50,000 nuclear warheads could be consumed as fuel in all
U.S. and Soviet nuclear power plants in seven years, or in all the
world's nuclear power plants in about three years.''
   Von Hippel acknowledged that the scientists had not devised a
fool-proof plan to enable each side to be assured that the correct
type and number of warheads were being dismantled under an arms
control agreement involving multiple systems.

<HEAD>Gannett Foundation Announces Grants To Spur Literacy Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gannett Foundation announced 21 grants
Tuesday totaling $1.35 million in its Literacy Challenge, a program
aimed at spurring the growth of adult literacy services.
   The aim of the Literacy Challenge is to stimulate state-level
activity among adult-literacy groups and agencies. The foundation
says it is the largest non-government source of funds for such
cooperative efforts.
   The Rochester, N.Y., foundation, with assets of more than $600
million, has committed a total of more than $5 million to adult
literacy projects since 1985. It has spent $2.5 million on the
Literacy Challenge alone.
   Nine awards went to new proposals and 12 were renewals in the
program's second and final year.
   Gannett Foundation President Eugene C. Dorsey said, ``From the
quality of the new proposals and the success so far of the renewal
projects, we believe these states have taken major steps toward
providing adult non-readers with coordinated, effective
opportunities to learn to read.''
   Literacy experts say at least 25 million adults cannot read, and
millions more struggle with the printed word.
   The new projects are:
   Alabama, $75,000 for the Alabama Public Library Service to start
an Alabama Literacy Coalition; Alaska, $77,000 to Nine Star
Enterprises to support three projects of the Alaska Literacy
Challenge Coalition;California, $100,000 to the State Department of
Education on behalf of the California Alliance for Literacy to help
train caseworkers; Delaware, $52,000 to the State Department of
Public Instruction on behalf of the Delaware Coalition for Literacy
to recruit more volunteer tutors and other activities.
   Also, Kentucky, $100,000 to the Kentucky Foundation for Literacy
to develop tutor-training kits and model programs; Mississippi,
$100,000 to the State Department of Education to reduce the dropout
rate from adult literacy instruction; New Mexico, $100,000 for the
New Mexico Coalition for Literacy to launch projects involving two
Indian pueblos, a Hispanic job-training organization and two
community agencies; New York, $100,000 for the Literacy Volunteers
of America in New York state on behalf of the state Literacy
Council and Department of Education, to hold regional caucuses of
teachers, tutors and adult learners.
   The dozen projects that won grant renewals were: Illinois, the
State Board of Education, $49,500; Indiana, the Governor's
Voluntary Action Program, $45,500; Maine, Department of Educational
and Cultural Services, $49,500; Massachusetts, Literacy Volunteers
of Massachusetts, $50,000; Minnesota, Minnesota Adult Literacy
Campaign, $50,000; Nevada, State Library and Archives, $48,000;
Oregon, Oregon State University Foundation, $45,500; Pennsylvania,
Penn State University, $50,000; Puerto Rico, Department of
Education, $48,000; Rhode Island, Rhode Island Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education, $27,000; Tennessee, Tennessee
Literacy Coalition, $50,000; Washington state, Washington Literacy
Inc., $44,000.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Injunction On Japanese Gillnet Fishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A permit that would have allowed Japanese
salmon fishermen to accidentally catch seals, killer whales and
other mammals violated an animal-protection law, a federal appeals
court ruled Tuesday.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld a preliminary
injunction issued by a federal district judge last June that halted
gillnet fishing for salmon by Japanese fleets in the Bering Sea off
Alaska.
   In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel rejected an appeal by the
Federation of Japan Fisheries Cooperative Association to overturn
the preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson.
   The injunction was obtained by an environmental group and a
native Alaskan fisherman's organization to stop the accidental
taking of sea lions, fur seals, white porpoises and killer whales
that could be ensnared in the nine-mile-long gillnets.
   As issued by the secretary of commerce, the three-year permit
would have allowed the Japanese fleet to accidentally catch 5,250
Dall's porpoises in the northern Pacific Ocean _ including 789 in
the Bering Sea.
   The court ruled that the permit, which allowed the Japanese
fishing fleet to pay fines for the fur seals it accidentally took,
violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
   ``The interest in maintaining healthy populations of marine
mammals comes first and the secretary cannot ignore the fur seals.
He can include the northern fur seals in the permit only if he
makes the requisite findings,'' the court said in an opinion by
Judge Gerhard Gesell.
   ``Lacking such findings the permit cannot issue. Moreover, he
may not allow the federation merely to pay the price for taking
protected marine mammals; and he must face up the taking of other
marime mammals the record shows will inevitably occur if gillnet
fishing is permitted,'' Gesell said in the opinion joined by Judge
Ruth B. Ginsburg.
   Judge Kenneth Starr filed a dissent, saying the majority
decision ``is unsupported by the text, structure, or legislative
history of the statute.''
   The injunction was obtained by the Center for Environmental
Education and the Kokechik Fishermen's Association.

   Israel's deputy chief of staff said Tuesday
some soldiers had committed ``totally unacceptable'' acts against
Palestinians, and hospital officials reported eight Arabs wounded
by troops in the West Bank.
   Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak also said more than 200 Israelis had been
injured, most of them lightly, since Arab riots began Dec. 8 in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said 53 Palestinians had been
killed, but the United Nations puts the number at 54.
   Barak and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin confirmed that some
soldiers used a bulldozer to bury four Palestinians alive near
Nablus in the West Bank. The general declared: ``This pattern of
behavior ... is totally unacceptable under the standards of the
Israeli Defense Forces and any civilized norms. Whoever is found
responsible for this event will be punished.''
   Neighbors rescued the four Arabs shortly after they were buried.
   Young Palestinians set fire to a bus Tuesday, burned tires and
built road blocks in the occupied territories and Arab east
Jerusalem, where a general strike virtually closed down Arab
communities and neighborhoods.
   Riot police stopped a bus carrying Israeli Arab high school
students from school in Haifa to their homes in Umm al Fahm and
beat several of them, the daily newspaper Al Hamishmar reported.
   An official at Umm al Fahm confirmed the report to The
Associated Press. Police declined comment.
   Transport Minister Chaim Corfu appeared to suggest Israel bombed
a ferry that was to carry Arab deportees from a Cyprus port to
Israel. If the Palestine Liberation Organization obtained another
vessel, he said, ``Its fate will be the same.''
   ``We knew we wouldn't allow the boat to reach Israel,'' he said
on Israel radio. ``If we could prevent its departure, that was
obviously the right thing to do.''
   In the West Bank, a soldier punched and shoved an Israeli
cameraman working for NBC News.
   The soldier said he asked the cameraman, Ofir Moradov, to stop
filming a protest, but NBC correspondent Martin Fletcher said
Moradov did not hear the request. The army said the soldier was
convicted of ``unbecoming conduct,'' but would not reveal his name
or the sentence.
   Barak said soldiers had not choice but to use beatings in an
attempt to curb the riots.
   ``Whatever amount of force is needed ... is something that in my
judgment is forced upon us by the situation,'' he told a news
conference of foreign reporters.
   ``We can't easily put the realities of life into a simple set of
orders. The situation created during the control of a violent riot
is much more complicated than it might seem.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on a visit to Italy: ``We
want to put an end to the riots and restore normal life. On the
other hand, we don't want to kill people. ... I hope in the near
weeks we will find the most right methods.''
   ``We have to handle it in the most human limitations,'' he said,
addressing a news conference in English. ``We have to defend
ourselves and at the same time continue our efforts for finding
peace.''
   Rabin, questioned about the beating policy during debate in
Parliament, said the orders to use force were necessary and ``to
the best of my knowledge and judgment, are legal.''
   He said the burial of the Arabs at Nablus ``will be treated with
the full heaviness of the law. It's not imaginable that such an
incident would happen in the Israeli army.''
   Barak said the army is succeeding in ``gradually (improving) the
caliber of behavior of our forces,'' but added: ``We are
confronting a new type of threat. We cannot afford to yield to it,
and we are not going to.''
   He said protesters are ``led by a nucleus of activists who enjoy
the support and cooperation of the masses.''
   ``The organization is on the local, sometimes regional, level,''
he said, and the core consists of ``two or three thousand
relatively young people.''
   The general, who directed military intelligence in 1983-86, said
he sees no quick end to the disturbances. He attributed the riots
to ``decades of frustration on the personal, economic and political
levels,'' not outside incitement.
   Five people were wounded by gunfire and 12 injured by rubber
bullets or beatings at the Fawwar refugee camp, where about 4,000
Palestinians live near Hebron in the West Bank, said officials at
Hebron's Alia hospital. One described the wounds as ``moderate to
light.''
   Israel radio said a riot started Tuesday evening and residents
stoned Israeli soldiers, who fired several shots and wounded one
protester. The military command said it was checking the reports.
   In Kabatiyeh, a West Bank village 35 miles north of Jerusalem,
soldiers opened fire to disperse protesters and wounded two young
Arabs in the legs, the Arab-run Palestine Press Service reported.
It said another Palestinian was wounded during a protest in nearby
Jenin.
   Doctors at Jenin hospital confirmed treating three men for
gunshot wounds.
   Army officials reported a protester wounded at Kabatiyeh after
he tried to wrest a gun from a soldier, but said they had no
information about other shootings.

   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said Tuesday
his coalition will survive a split over President Kurt Waldheim's
conduct in World War II, but the issue is isolating Austria from
the rest of the world.
   The Socialist chancellor, in coalition with a conservative party
that supported Waldheim for the presidency, also repeated his
threat to resign if the Waldheim affair is not resolved.
   Waldheim said he will sue Der Spiegel, a West German magazine
that printed a copy of a document purportedly linking him to
deportation of civilians in the Balkans, where he was a lieutenant
in the German army. The magazine has retracted the story and said
the document probably was a fake.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain will
reopen the files on six commandos taken prisoner in 1944 on the
German-occupied Greek island of Alimnia.
   ``We have taken the allegations concerning Dr. Waldheim very
seriously, particularly those concerning British servicemen,'' she
told the House of Commons in a written reply to a question.
   An international commission of historians that investigated
Waldheim's past said in its report that it could not prove a
connection between him and the commandos, but found the initial
``W'' on transcripts of interviews with the six men. The report
suggested that Waldheim knew the Gestapo shot captured commandos.
   After meeting with Deputy Chancellor Alois Mock, head of the
conservative People's Party, Vranitzky told reporters: ``We have
clearly affirmed the intention to have this government continue.''
   His statement seemed designed to quell speculation that
divisions over Waldheim might dissolve the coalition.
   The chancellor runs the government and the presidency is largely
ceremonial. The Socialists are the senior partner in the coalition
with the People's Party, which backed the former U.N.
secretary-general for president in 1986.
   Vranitzky criticized Waldheim for what he called failure to take
a clear stand on key points of the report by the commission of
historians. The 202-page document said Waldheim was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities, must have known about them and did
nothing to stop them.
   In a televised speech Monday, the president said he would not
resign and asked Austrians to unite behind him.
   Mock, one of Waldheim's staunchest backers, said Tuesday the
president's speech ``offered dialogue and said clearly he is
conscious of his integral role.''
   But Vranitzky repeated his threat to resign, saying he can only
lead ``in good conscience ... if the working conditions are such to
allow me to assume these obligations in a responsible way.''
   Vranitzky also voiced concern about the impact of the affair on
Austria's tourism, economy and its relations with other Western
countries.
   Major U.S. travel operators are flying Americans to Budapest
rather than Vienna, he said, adding: ``Our business people cannot
be easy about that.''
   Referring to Austrian efforts to establish closer trade links
with the European Community, Vranitzky noted, ``We can't be
indifferent to the fact that in the whole year 1987 only two
government leaders visited us.''
   The Soviet and Liechtenstein premiers were in Austria last year.
   ``What I really think is necessary for everybody in this country
_ and therefore also for the president _ is to try to emerge from
this isolation, out of this self-chosen inner emigration,''
Vranitzky said.
   Waldheim spokesman Gerold Christian said it was unclear exactly
on what charges Waldheim planned to sue Der Spiegel. Under Austrian
law, the president must instruct state prosecutors to begin any
legal proceedings on his behalf.
   Der Spiegel published in its Feb. 1 edition a copy of a telegram
allegedly linking Waldheim to the deportation of more than 4,000
civilians from the Kozara region in Yugoslavia in 1942.
   A copy of the document was sold to Der Spiegel by a Yugoslav
journalist. The original could not be found. Der Spiegel in its
current issue apologized for publishing what was ``most probably a
fake.''
   In May, Waldheim instructed state prosecutors to sue World
Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman for asserting that
Waldheim was ``part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.''
   Late last year, Waldheim ordered prosecutors to sue the Austrian
magazine Wiener, which published a supplement on the Waldheim
affair.
   A poll conducted for the conservative Vienna daily Die Presse
reflected rising public pressure for Waldheim to resign. The
telephone poll was based on interviews with 440 Austrians.
   Forty-six percent of those who responded were against
resignation and 37 were in favor. Two weeks ago, a similar poll
said 72 percent of those surveyed opposed Waldheim's resignation.
   Forty-five percent of those polled said they wouldn't vote for
Waldheim if an election were held on Sunday, while 34 percent said
they would.

   A federal judge Tuesday reset the start of
Teamsters President Jackie Presser's trial on labor racketeering
and embezzlement charges to July 12, the second time the case has
been delayed.
   Presser, 60, is accused of creating a $700,000 scheme in which
people were paid for doing no work at Teamsters Local 507, where he
is secretary-treasurer. He was charged in 1986 with two counts of
labor racketeering, one of embezzlement and two of filing false
reports with the government.
   Two co-defendants, Harold Friedman and Anthony Hughes, also are
to stand trial then. Friedman is a Teamsters vice president and
Local 507 president, and Hughes is the local's recording secretary.
   At an informal session with lawyers in the case, U.S. District
Judge George W. White said he was rescheduling the trial date ``not
knowing what Mr. Presser's condition may be.'' Friedman and Hughes
``should be ready to go to trial,'' whether or not Presser is
ready, he said.
   Pending legal matters caused the original trial date, Aug. 10 of
last year, to be delayed. The trial was reset to Monday, but was
delayed because of Presser's health problems and a matter pending
before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals pertaining to defense
discovery of evidence.
   White said he expects the trial to start on the assigned date
this time ``unless the court of appeals tells me differently.''
   Three of Presser's predecessors _ Roy Williams, Jimmy Hoffa and
Dave Beck _ were convicted of federal crimes after becoming
president of the union and resigned their posts. Another
predecessor, Frank Fitzsimmons, never had a police record and died
while in office.
   Presser assumed leadership of the 1.6 million-member union April
21, 1983, when a Teamsters executive board allowed him to complete
the five-year term of Williams. He was re-elected in May 1986, a
few days after he was indicted.
   Last year, Presser underwent surgery for removal of a lung
tumor, but his doctors have since declared him free of cancer.
Chemotherapy and radiation treatments, however, have caused him
health problems, and he is recuperating in Phoenix, said John R.
Climaco, Presser's lead defense lawyer.
   At Tuesday's hearing, Climaco said Presser would agree to
undergo a physical examination next week at Georgetown University
Medical School with an endocrinologist the Justice Department has
selected.

<TEXT>
   Police and civilian auxiliary officers
patrolled near churches, a historic cemetery and in the center of
this Baltic capital Tuesday, preventing demonstrations to mark
Lithuania's brief independence.
   Jadvyga Beliauskiene, a Roman Catholic activist, told reporters
shortly before midnight Monday that four Lithuanian nationalists
were under house arrest to stop them from leading protests.
   A high profile by police, showing a harder line by Soviet
authorities against expressions of Baltic nationalism, seemed to
deter any large-scale showing of national feeling.
   Western reporters brought to Vilnius by the Soviet Foreign
Ministry for a government-approved visit were followed constantly
in cars and on foot as they visited Lithuanian activists and
traveled through winding medieval streets to visit sites where
protests had been scheduled.
   Ms. Beliauskiene, a former member of an anti-communist partisan
movement in the 1940s who spent 12 years in prison, was one of
about 200 people who signed a petition to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in January asking that authorities not ``terrorize''
people who wanted to celebrate Lithuanian independence.
   Tuesday marked the 70th anniversary of Lithuania's declaration
of independence from Soviet Russia months after the Bolshevik
revolution brought the Communists to power. Lithuania was
independent until it was absorbed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   In Moscow, the officials Soviet news agency Tass said U.S.
Ambassador Jack Matlock on Tuesday declined to receive official
representatives of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic who
came to protest ``U.S. interference in the republic's internal
affairs.''
   Thirty-two U.S. Senators have written to Gorbachev asking him
not to interfere with this week's demonstrations and religious
services in the Soviet republics of Lithuania and Estonia.
   The state-controlled Soviet news media has criticized similar
congressional statements in the past for inciting public
demonstrations in the Baltic republics.
   
   Activists called on citizens to pray at two Vilnius churches and
lay flowers at a monument to Polish-Lithuanian writer Adam
Mickiewicz and the grave of Jonas Basanavicius, a doctor and
champion of the Lithuanian language who died 61 years ago, on Feb.
16, 1927.
   The monument to Mickiewicz was the scene of a demonstration on
Aug. 23 marking the anniversary of the 1939 German-Soviet
non-aggression pact that consigned most of Lithuania to Soviet
control.
   ``We want to raise the consciousness of people so they remember
they have the right to be free,'' said Ms. Beliauskiene, 59, who
works as a file clerk in a government AIDS laboratory.
   Witnesses said one woman was led away by police after she laid
flowers at the monument to Mickiewicz on Tuesday evening. But they
said she apparently was not arrested.
   Nijole Sadunaite, a Roman Catholic activist who spent six years
in prison and exile for her role in distributing religious
literature, met reporters Monday night in the stairwell of an
apartment house guarded by uniformed and plainclothes police.
   A uniformed officer told reporters that if they entered the
apartment, they would be responsible for anything that happened to
Ms. Sadunaite, 49.
   Ms. Sadunaite said KGB agents had attacked her, ripping the
buttons from her coat and punching her in the stomach. She said her
only goal was to ``honor the memory of the dear Lithuanian people
who died for our independence.''
   ``We don't use tanks, we don't use machine guns, we don't even
use profanity,'' she said nervously. ``Even if they strike us, we
do not strike back.''
   Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city, also appeared quiet.
   Mayor Petras Staskunas told Western reporters who visited the
city that dissident reports that nationalists had been injured in a
scuffle with police on Sunday were not true.
   ``There were no incidents in Kaunas on Sunday. We know these
emigre organizations want things to happen here but nothing has
happened,'' he said. ``We know there are extremists in this city.
We won't hide it. But they have no influence or support.''
   At the Rasu Cemetery, in the snow-covered hills near the center
of Vilnius, at least 18 policemen in gray coats and fur hats and
auxiliary policemen wearing red armbands stood near the black
granite pillar that marks the grave of Basanavicius.
   Bouquets of tulips and a lily had been placed on the grave and a
solitary candle flickered in the chilly morning breeze, but there
were no protesters.
   One of the two auxiliary policemen guarding the graveyard's
white-washed stone gate said, ``We're here to keep up order.''
   Asked why so many police were deployed on the streets and at the
historic sites, a member of the Vilnius Soviets, or local
government, said, ``We have a saying in Lithuanian: One drop of tar
will spoil the whole jar of honey.''
   Police patrols of up to five members each strolled along Lenin
Prospekt, the major shopping thoroughfare in this city of 600,000
people.
   About 20 worshipers, mostly elderly women wearing kerchiefs
against the cold, attended 7:30 a.m. Mass at St. Anne's, one of the
churches where activists had called for Lithuanians to pray.
   Beside the red brick Gothic church, which dates from the late
14th century, 15 policemen and auxiliary officers stood guard at
the monument to Mickiewicz.

   An American who was the first member of the Irish
Republican Army to be extradited from the United States was
convicted Tuesday of gunning down a London policeman in a
``cold-blooded killing untinged by any remorse.''
   William Quinn, a San Francisco native, was sentenced to life in
prison by Judge Christopher Rose after a jury returned the guilty
verdict at the Old Bailey criminal court.
   Quinn, who pleaded innocent to killing off-duty officer Stephen
Tibble, 21, in February 1975, refused to say anything during his
five-day trial and showed no emotion as the verdict was read.
   He lost a widely publicized, five-year battle against
extradition that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Rose told Quinn the shooting was an ``appalling, cold-blooded
killing untinged by any remorse on your part, and motivated no
doubt by the terrorist activities on which at that time you were
engaged.
   ``You shot repeatedly and at point-blank range a man who was in
fact a police officer, though you could not have known he was other
than an ordinary member of the public,'' the judge said.
   Carlene Rohan, Quinn's U.S. lawyer who testified for the
defense, said Quinn would not have been convicted in the United
States.
   ``The evidence of identification would not have been permitted
there,'' she said.
   His mother, Juanita, attended the trial but had no comment on
its outcome.
   The judge accepted a defense plea not to set a mandatory minimum
sentence, which could free Quinn in 10 or 15 years.
   Quinn, who is of Irish ancestry, was living in San Francisco
when he became an IRA supporter and made trips to Ireland in 1971
and 1974, court testimony indicated. Prosecutors alleged that he
and four other men were sent to mainland Britain to carry out a
string of bomb attacks.
   A man identified as Quinn was leaving a house in west London on
Feb. 26, 1975, when two police officers on a burglary patrol became
suspicous and stopped him for questioning.
   Quinn fled but was confronted by Tibble, who was off duty and
driving by on motorcycle when he stopped to assist the other
officers. Prosecutors charged that Quinn fired two shots into
Tibble's chest with a handgun.
   Quinn was arrested in Ireland on suspicion of belonging to the
outlawed IRA. Police, meanwhile, arrested Quinn's's accomplices,
located the murder weapon and found a bomb-making operation in a
house near where the slaying occurred. Quinn's fingerprints were
found on a road map and other items.
   Quinn fled to San Francisco but was arrested in 1981 by the FBI
on a British warrant, setting in motion a protracted legal battle
that culminated in early 1986, when a U.S. Appeals Court ruled 2-1
in favor of his extradition.
   He was extradited in October 1986 after the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to hear his argument that the police shooting was a
political offense, and therefore not covered by the U.S.-British
extradition treaty.

   Richard P. Feynman, the brilliant,
mischievous physicist who called his Nobel Prize ``a pain in the
neck'' and helped shatter NASA's claim that cold weather didn't
doom the shuttle Challenger, has died of cancer at the age of 69.
   The theoretical physicist, who also helped develop the atomic
bomb during the Manhattan Project of World War II, died Monday
night at UCLA Medical Center after an eight-year battle with
abdominal cancer, said hospital spokesman Rich Elbaum said.
   The California Institute of Technology professor was noted for
``his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles, his provocative
mischievousness, his indignant impatience with pretension and
hypocrisy, and his talent for one-upping anybody who tries to
one-up him,'' Al Hibbs, a former student and NASA scientist, said
in the introduction to the best-selling 1985 autobiography ``Surely
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!''
   It was certainly in character for Feynman to conduct an
impromptu experiment as a member of the presidential commission
that investigated the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle
Challenger in which all seven crew members died.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
initially played down any possibility that cold weather impaired
the resiliency of O-ring seals on the shuttle's booster rockets,
thus allowing burning fuel to erode through the rings to cause the
fatal blast.
   But at a recess during the comission's hearings in February
1986, Feynman showed O-ring resiliency was sharply reduced by cold.
He compressed a piece of rubber-like O-ring material with a simple
clamp, dropped it into a glass of ice water, pulled it out and
released the O-ring piece, demonstrating that it lacked any
resiliency for a few seconds.
   ``I believe this has some significance for our problem,'' he
said.
   The commission agreed in its final report, concluding Florida's
pre-launch freeze contributed to an O-ring failure that caused the
accident.
   Feynman also wrote an appendix to the commission's final report,
accusing NASA of playing Russian roulette with the shuttle fleet
and astronauts' lives and of exaggerating the rockets' safety ``to
the point of fantasy.''
   Born in New York City on May 11, 1918, Feynman started learning
mathematics while still in his high chair. He earned a degree from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939, then earned a
doctorate at Princeton University in 1942. After working on the
Manhattan Project, he moved in 1945 to Cornell University, where he
did his Nobel-winning studies, then moved to Caltech in Pasadena in
1950.
   In 1965, Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Julian
S. Schwinger and Shinichero Tomonaga for developing an improved
theory of quantum electrodynamics. The theory allowed scientists to
predict the effects of electrically charged particles on each other
in a radiation field.
   ``The truth was, I didn't really want this prize,'' Feynman said
in his autobiography, explaining how the recognition disrupted his
privacy and his life.
   ``It's nice that I got some money _ I was able to buy a beach
house _ but altogether, I think it would have been much nicer not
to have had the Prize because you never, any longer, can be taken
straightforwardly in any public situation,'' he wrote. ``In a way,
the Nobel Prize has been something of a pain in the neck.''
   Feynman often refused to explain his prize-winning work, once
declaring: ``Hell, if I could explain it to the average person, it
wouldn't have been worth the Nobel Prize.''
   Cornell University Professor Hans Bethe, a former colleague
there and on the Manhattan Project, called Feynman the greatest
theoretical physicist in the United States after World War II.
   ``Feynman was not an ordinary genius. He was a magician,'' said
Bethe, who himself received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1967.
``Nobody could have done what he did.''
   Marvin Goldberger, director of the Institute for Advanced Study
in Princeton, N.J., and a former Caltech president, called Feynman
``a towering figure in 20th century physics'' who was ``always
curious, always modest, always ebullient, always willing to share
his deep insights with students and colleagues.''
   Yet Feynman took pleasure in promoting his image as a fun-loving
man who enjoyed outings to Las Vegas, where show girls ``were all
beautiful, and I just love beautiful girls.''
   In his book, Feynman also told how he demonstrated inadequate
security at Los Alamos National Laboratory by learning to pick
locks on file cabinets containing the nation's A-bomb secrets,
which didn't amuse his superiors on the top-secret Manhattan
Project.
   Feynman was especially popular with Caltech students, who
honored him for teaching excellence in 1982. He continued to teach
freshman physics classes and to ham it up in school plays, once
taking on the role of a bongo player and appearing in the musical
``Guys and Dolls.''
   Caltech officials reported that when Feynman became ill a few
years ago, students and teachers overwhelmed local medical
facilities with offers to donate blood.
   Feynman is survived by his second wife, Gweneth, and two
children.
   Private funeral services for Feynman will be held later this
week and will not be announced. A public memorial service remains
to be scheduled, a Caltech spokesman said.

<HEAD>Cinderella Story: Studio Known For Kid Films Making Impact With
Adult Fare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The Disney Studios' decision to tap into the
adult film market and shed its role as the maker of squeaky-clean
movies is paying off big this week, as three Disney movies rank
among the top five at the box office.
   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' was the biggest pull at the box office
over the weekend for a fifth consecutive week, while the Disney
film ``Shoot to Kill'' debuted at No. 2 and the studio's hit
``Three Men and a Baby'' held on for fourth.
   It was Disney's best showing ever.
   It isn't a record, however. Thirteen months ago, Paramount was
the reigning champ with three films at the top of the weekly box
office list _ ``Golden Child,'' ``Star Trek IV'' and ```Crocodile'
Dundee.''
   The three current Disney films have kept turnstiles spinning
with a total take so far of $200 million, studio spokesman Dick
Cook said Tuesday, adding, ``It's really a matter of having good
pictures. We've been very lucky.''
   Cook is quick to point out that periods of glory in show
business are often brief.
   ``This business runs in cycles. We're all just very pleased,''
Cook, senior vice president of the Disney-Touchstone distribution
arm Buena Vista Pictures. ``We feel good about what's happening and
will try to keep it going.''
   John Krier of Exhibiter Relations Co., which charts the weekly
movie box office performance, said the studio shouldn't be so
modest.
   ``When they take three out of the top four that's pretty darn
good,'' Krier said.
   The studio Cinderella story got its start in 1984, when the
Disney movie division was floundering and it started Touchstone
Films. Shortly afterward, Michael Eisner, a Paramount executive
when that studio enjoyed such hits as ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,''
became as chairman and chief executive officer of Disney.
   Touchstone's first release was the mermaid comedy ``Splash.'' A
steady stream of hits followed, including ``Down and Out in Beverly
Hills,'' ``Ruthless People,'' ``Color of Money'' and ``Outrageous
Fortune.''
   Disney also has a penchant for releasing old, reliable animated
features. This winter's reissue of ``Cinderella'' added $33.5
million to studio coffers and it gave Disney its best winter season
ever.
   ``We've been very fortunate since Thanksgiving by having four
movies perform extremely well,'' Cook said. ``And we have very high
expectations for our films in spring and summer.''
   Disney-Touchstone will soon release the thriller ``D.O.A'' with
Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, then the animated feature ``The Fox and
the Hound'' and ``Return to Snowy River'' before heading into its
summer lineup.
   ``We're certainly at a record-breaking pace already. There are
some very good pictures coming this summer, which should put us
over for another record year,'' Cook said. Last year's $4.2 billion
box office take industrywide was a record.
   ``Big Business'' with Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin, the Steven
Spielberg film ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' and ``Cocktail'' with
Tom Cruise are set for summer release by Disney-Touchstone. A
reissue of ``Bambi'' is also in the works.

<HEAD>Cold Front Hits Mississippi Valley, Central Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front swept across the central Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley on Tuesday, dropping up to 4 inches of snow and
drenching roads with freezing rain. Weather elsewhere was mostly
mild.
   Snow was scattered from southeastern Minnesota and northeastern
Iowa into central and eastern Wisconsin. Snow also fell across the
lower Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley into northern New York
state and northern New England.
   In Wisconsin, 3 inches of snow fell at Neenah, Fond du Lac and
Sheboygan. Up to 4 inches were reported at Decorah and Cresco in
northeastern Iowa, and a few inches fell across southeast Minnesota.
   Scores of morning rush-hour traffic accidents were blamed on
freezing rain in northeastern Ohio.
   Elsewhere, snow showers developed across northern Colorado, but
only about 2 inches were expected.
   In Southern California, winds of 25 to 35 mph whipped the Owens
Valley and gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph were possible Wednesday.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 0.30 inch at Newport News, Va.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 76 degrees at McAllen,
Texas, and Palm Springs, Calif. The early-morning low for the
nation was 14 degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered rain showers from
Arkansas and the lower Tennessee Valley into the lower Mississippi
Valley and eastern Texas, and across western and northern
Washington. Scattered snow showers were forecast in northwestern
Montana, upper Michigan and from northeastern Ohio through northern
New York state into northern Vermont.
   Highs in the 20s were forecast from the upper Mississippi Valley
across the northern Great Lakes and northern New England; in the
50s and 60s from Oregon across the western Great Basin, southern
Rockies, southern Plains, lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys
into the southern Atlantic Coast region; in the 70s across southern
Texas, southern Florida and central and southern California into
the desert southwest; and in in the 30s or 40s across most of the
rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Five Newspaper Unions Drop Opposition To News-Free Press Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five newspaper unions dropped their opposition
Tuesday to the proposed partial merger of two Detroit newspapers,
saying joint operation is the ``only way to assure the survival''
of the Detroit Free Press.
   In briefs filed with the Justice Department, the unions urged
Attorney General Edwin Meese III to approve the agreement.
   The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press have requested
permission to merge their advertising, circulation and production
departments and to enter into a profit-sharing agreement under a
law designed to protect newspaper competition when one of the
publications is in danger of going out of business. The newspapers
would retain separate news and editorial departments.
   Justice Department spokesman Mark Sheehan said he expected Meese
to ``act as promptly as he can'' on the proposed agreement.
   A Justice Department administrative law judge, Morton Needelman,
in December upheld a recommendation by the department's antitrust
division that the proposed joint operating agreement be disapproved.
   Directors of Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the Free Press,
countered by stating their intent to close the 156-year-old
newspaper if Meese fails to approve the JOA.
   Attorneys for Knight-Ridder and for Gannett Co. Inc., owner of
the News, argued in January that the board's decision introduced a
new element into the case that made it imperative that Meese
approve the agreement.
   The antitrust division, in a brief filed Tuesday, argued that
evidence in the case showed that Knight-Ridder, at the time the
newspapers announced their application of the joint operating
agreement in 1986, was willing to continue subsidizing the Free
Press.
   ``Whether a newspaper is failing within the meaning of the
(Newspaper Preservation Act) should properly be determined as of
the time it enters into a JOA agreement, not on the basis of
decisions made in the face of subsequent failure to win approval
under the statute,'' the division said.
   The division also asserted that Needelman was correct in arguing
that the News had not attained a clearly dominant position in
Detroit market and therefore the Free Press was not a failing
newspaper.
   The unions dropping their opposition to the merger were Detroit
Typographical Union No. 18; Newspaper Drivers and Handlers, Local
372; Graphic Communication International Union, Local 289M; Detroit
Mailer's Local No. 2040; and Detroit Newspaper Printing and Graphic
Communications Union, Local 13N. They represent employees at both
newspapers.
   The unions said the decision by Knight-Ridder directors and
evidence in the case ``led us to conclude, after very careful
consideration, that the Free Press is in `probable danger of
financial failure' within the meaning of the Newspaper Preservation
Act.''
   ``We have further concluded that the JOA is the only way to
assure the survival of the Free Press and the preservation of two
independent editorial voices in Detroit,'' the unions said.
   One union remained opposed to the partial merger. The Newspaper
Guild, Local 22 representing editorial employees, vote 349-84
Monday night to continue opposition to the JOA.
   Guild officials bargained and then voted without knowing that
the other unions had reversed their opposition to the JOA, said
Donald Kummer, administrative officer of the guild's Local 22.
   ``Unless we can resolve the problems that have existed since
this thing was announced, I don't see any change in my position,''
he said.
   The newspapers asserted that union opposition had been based on
the premise that a JOA would mean a loss of 600 to 1,000 jobs at
the newspapers.
   The unions ``now clearly understand that the status quo will not
be maintained if the JOA is denied, but rather the Free Press will
close and all 2,200 jobs at the Free Press will be lost,'' the
newspapers said.
   The News and the Free Press have long been locked in a battle
for newspaper dominance in Detroit. The News, which is the larger
newspaper, has lost $75 million since 1979, and the Free Press has
lost $100 million, according to Knight-Ridder.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev criticized
Britain and other Western European countries Tuesday for what he
called a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to
eliminate intermediate-range missiles.
   Gorbachev met with Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of
Britain, who defended Britain's nuclear policy at a news conference
in the Soviet capital.
   ``While generally approving the INF treaty, the leaders of NATO
countries have been acting as though the situation in Europe since
its signing had only worsened,'' Gorbachev said, according to a
report by the official Tass news agency.
   ``Otherwise, it was impossible to explain the latest wave of
praise for the `nuclear deterence' strategy, plans for so-called
`compensation,' all manner of projects for the joint manufacture of
newest weapons, the Franco-West German military rapprochment, and
so forth,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet leader also said Britain had grown less enthusiastic
about a chemical weapons ban, and that the West was dragging its
feet at a conference in Vienna to work out a format for new talks
on conventional forces in Europe.
   Gorbachev, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and other
Soviet officials regularly have criticized European leaders after
the Dec. 8 superpower summit for urging the modernization of their
weapons systems to make up for the loss of U.S. Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles in Europe.
   In East Germany, the official news agency ADN reported Tuesday
that the Soviets had begun dismantling intermediate nuclear
missiles.
   Howe, at a news conference after his meeting with Gorbachev,
defended Britain's policy of keeping and modernizing its nuclear
force.
   ``Peace has indeed been upheld in the past 40 years by the
nuclear deterrent,'' Howe said. ``The deterent resoures available
need to be kept up to date, to be modernized.''
   ``Modernization is not a euphemism for circumventing the INF
treaty,'' he added.
   Gorbachev and President Reagan signed an agreement in December
to eliminate their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles from
Europe as well as the rest of the globe. The two sides now are
trying to negotiate a 50 percent cut in their arsenals of
long-range weapons.
   The U.S.-Soviet agreement is awaiting U.S. Senate approval. In
the Soviet Union, the treaty has been approved by the ruling
Communist Party and must be passed by the Supreme Soviet, which is
expected to give its endorsement.

   A man who apparently traveled to Florida to
shoot his former wife and her boyfriend was in jail Tuesday,
charged in a mistaken identity shooting spree that left an elderly
woman dead at the wrong address, police said.
   John Edward Boggs, 55, of Vermilion was arrested Monday and
transferrerd Tuesday from Erie County to Lorain County, where he
was jailed awaiting a court appearance in county Common Pleas
Court. Boggs' attorney, Charles F. Adams, said no date for the
court appearance had been set.
   A 70-year-old woman was killed and two others were wounded in
the shooting last Thursday in Zephyrhills, a town in central
Florida. Boggs faces one count of first-degree murder and two
counts of attempted murder, according to Pasco County, Fla.,
Sheriff Jim Gillum.
   Boggs was a crane operator at USX Corp.'s Lorain Works until he
retired in 1985, according to USX spokesman Thomas Ferrall in
Pittsburgh. He and his wife, Geraldine, were granted a divorce on
Jan. 11.
   Authorities said Boggs' intended victims apparently were his
ex-wife and Gerald Rush, who live in the same town but in a
different mobile home park six miles from the shooting scene.
   Pasco County Sheriff Jim Gillum said Boggs visited the Colony
Hills Mobile Home Park in Zephyrhills looking for a resident with
the last name of Rush. A park secretary showed him where Harold
Rush lived.
   Boggs broke into Harold Rush's mobile home with a shotgun and
handgun and started shooting, Gillum said. A single blast killed
Nigel Maeras, 70, and injured her daughter Betsy Ritchie, 50, and
Harold Rush, 69.
   ``Apparently, he believed he was shooting Mr. (Gerald) Rush and
his (former) wife. On his return to Ohio, it's very possible he
thought he killed'' them, Gillum said.
   Vermilion police chief Roland Fleming said Boggs was arrested
Monday after Florida authorities issued a warrant for his arrest.
Fleming said Boggs was stopped in his car and did not resist.
   ``It was a one in a million case of mistaken identity,'' Gillum
said.
   Harold Rush and Ms. Ritchie were in stable condition Tuesday at
East Pasco Medical Center. The two Rushes are not related.
   At first, police were stumped by the shooting. But then, a
detective recalled Geraldine Boggs calling days earlier and saying
her former spouse was en route to Florida to kill her and her
boyfriend, Gillum said.
   Detective Linda Johnson then questioned a secretary at the
Colony park and learned a man had been looking for the Rush
residence.

   The Soviet Union has begun dismantling part of its
intermediate range nuclear arsenal in East Germany, the state-run
news agency ADN reported Tuesday.
   The step makes ``an important contribution toward disarmament
even before'' a U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate the medium-range
missiles is ratified, ADN said.
   According to the report, rockets stationed near Neubrandenburg,
north of Berlin, have been dismantled, crated and are ready for
transport back to the Soviet Union.
   ADN did not say how many had been dismantled or when the rockets
will be transported back to the Soviet Union. East German
television late Tuesday showed soldiers loading missile crates onto
transport vehicles.
   The disarmament treaty was signed in Washington in December by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but the
U.S. Senate has yet to ratify it. The Supreme Soviet is expected to
approve it.
   Under the agreement, the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in East
Germany and in Czechoslovakia are to be destroyed within 18 months,
and longer-range U.S. and Soviet missiles within three years.
   In Washington there was no immediate reaction at the State
Department, but a U.S. official said the Soviets were free to
dismantle the missiles before the treaty took effect.
   The official, who demanded anonymity, said U.S. inspectors will
go to East Germany and all other Soviet missile sites to verify the
Soviets were complying with the treaty.
   West German government officials Tuesday night declined comment
on the report.
   There was no immediate comment in Moscow, but Gorbachev on
Tuesday criticized Western European countries for what he called a
lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement to eliminate
intermediate-range missiles.
   In a report by the official Tass news agency, Gorbachev
criticized Western European governments for ``the latest wave of
praise for the `nuclear deterrence' strategy ... all manner of
projects for the joint manufacture of newest weapons, the
Franco-West German military rapprochment, and so forth.''
   ADN said Soviet soldiers ``are making the last preparations to
return their SS-12 rockets'' to the Soviet Union.
   The rockets are shorter-range weapons included in the
intermediate range missile pact, which banned weapons with a range
from 300 to 3,000 miles.
   The news agency quoted a Soviet officer as saying that the
``troops are very proud that nuclear disarmament is beginning in
our unit.''
   ADN said a group of East German journalists toured the missile
base and were allowed to interview Soviet soldiers there.
   The ADN report described preparations under way to ready the
rockets for transport. Cranes were used to load the dismantled
rockets into transpot containers, it said.
   ``We were convinced that the last rockets were ready for
transport to the location where they will be destroyed,'' ADN said.
   The rockets are to be sent back to the Soviet Union by rail, the
report said.
   East German leader Erich Honecker in January indicated that
Soviet intermediate range rockets stationed in East Germany could
be removed ahead of schedule, but gave no specific timetable for
their withdrawal.
   The ADN report did not say if other missiles stationed in East
Germany had been dismantled or how many troops were scheduled to
leave.
   According to figures released after the superpower agreement was
signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven
practice missiles were stationed at the site _ which holds the
largest numbers of SS-12s in East Germany.
   There are three other SS-12 rocket sites in East Germany.
   In all, there are 54 SS-12s in East Germany, the figures said.

<TEXT>
   Caspar Weinberger, the former defense
secretary, questioned Tuesday whether fundamental policy changes
are taking place in the Soviet Union and whether Mikhail Gorbachev
can keep his post as top leader.
   ``I think we have to be very careful if we assume there are
major policy changes,'' Weinberger said. ``I don't know ... how
firmly seated is the present regime. I don't think any of us really
know that.''
   ``I'm not sure anybody would be allowed to be general secretary
of the Communist party of the Soviet Union who is very different,''
from the past, Weinberger told the Washington Foreign
Correspondents Association.
   Soviet forces in Afghanistan suggest that ``things are not all
that changed in the Soviet Union,'' Weinberger said. ``I don't see
any change in world domination as their goal.''
   It ``should take two weeks, or four at the outside'' for the
Soviets to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, he said, despite their
current talk of a 10-month timetable.
   The sincerity of Gorbachev's offer ``can only be judged when
withdrawal is complete ... (when) they've left and the Afghan
people can have the kind of government they want,'' he said.
   Weinberger, who was succeeded by Defense Secetary Frank Carlucci
late last year, described as ``surface changes,'' the new look at
the Kremlin. ``Gorbachev smiles from time to time, he wears much
better clothes, and he's younger and apparently in better health''
than past leaders, he said.
   ``The principal change I see in the Soviet Union is that they
are now actively courting world public opinion, campaigning for a
favorable world press and this is so new and so novel that they are
getting it,'' he said.

Christian and Moslem leaders Tuesday to help win the release of two
Scandinavian relief workers who were kidnapped in southern Lebanon
11 days ago.
   Also Tuesday, the United States condemned an assassination
attempt against Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
   U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding flew to Beirut from
Tunisia and went straight to a meeting with Lebanese Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Fuad Turk in Christian east Beirut.
   ``I asked ambassador Turk to work for (the Scandinavians')
release as soon as possible,'' Goulding told reporters after the
meeting.
   The two captives, Jan Stening, 44, of Sweden, and William
Jorgensen, 58, of Norway, served with the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees. They were
grabbed on Feb. 5 near the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon.
   The agency has blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting
individually and without political motivation or links to any
organization.
   After meeting with Turk, Goulding crossed Beirut's dividing
Green Line to the Moslem sector, where he held an hour-long meeting
with Sunni Moslem acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss at his home.
   Goulding told reporters afterward the two had discussed the
Lebanese situation in general as well as ``this very serious
problem of the two (kidnapped) UNRWA officials.''
   Asked if there had been any progress in efforts to free the
captives, Goulding said: ``No. It remains a puzzling, difficult and
worrying case.''
   ``I'm indeed hopeful,'' Goulding said. ``I can't say that the
release will be tomorrow, but I think it's very important for the
Arab cause, the Palestinian cause and for the Lebanese cause that
they should be released as soon as possible.''
   Goulding said that during a visit to Tunis last weekend he urged
Palestine Liberation Organization Chief Yasser Arafat to work
toward the release of the Scandinavian captives.
   Arafat had earlier ordered his PLO commanders in southern
Lebanon to spare no effort in winning their release.
   Goulding also met with Shiite Moslem parliament speaker Hussein
Husseini.
   In Washington, a State Department statement called the attempted
assasination of Gemayel on Friday ``a reprehensible act'' and
condemned those responsible.
   ``The government of Lebanon continues to have our full
support,'' the U.S. statement said.
   Three Beirut airport employees were jailed after police found a
bombed beneath the pilot's seat on a jetliner that was to take
Gemayel, 44, from the Lebanese capital to Cyprus.
   Assassinations, car bombings and kidnappings have plagued
Lebanon since a civil war broke out in 1975. An estimated 130,000
people have died in the violence.

   Lobbyists for special-interest political
action committees believe many members of Congress give them scant
attention unless they make campaign contributions, a group that
advocates campaign finance reform said Tuesday.
   A survey of 50 PAC directors and lobbyists found the PACs see
themselves as victims in a campaign system that forces them to
trade contributions for access to lawmakers who decide issues of
importance to the unions, businesses and other interest groups the
PACs represent.
   One PAC director told of seeing a ``little black book'' in which
a congressman kept the names of contributors and referred to it
when a lobbyist sought a hearing with him.
   The individual said members of Congress have told him, ``Well, I
like your organization, but you haven't given me a contribution.''
   The interviews with the PAC officials were conducted by the
Center for Responsive Politics, a political research organization
that is critical of PAC influence in politics.
   The group said the PAC officials agreed to talk on condition
their names would not be used in the report. Among the PACs
represented were some of the largest, such as the $5
million-per-election American Medical Association PAC, and the
smaller PACs that give less than $50,000 in total contributions to
candidates.
   The group's report said the PAC officials freely admitted they
contributed to Congress members to ensure access. Some expect not
only a meeting but a sympathetic ear.
   One was quoted as saying that, ``A lot of people think a PAC
gives you access. Well, you can get access without a PAC. What I am
saying is sympathetic access.''
   The PAC officials also acknowledged the frequent practice of
giving overwhelmingly to incumbents during a campaign, and then if
the incumbent loses, helping the winner to retire a debt in order
to establish influence with the new legislator.
   ``PACs said they felt they were manipulated by members of
Congress, who constantly apply pressure for money. The PACs we
talked to said they felt unrelenting pressure to attend
fundraisers, that they were unfairly being held responsible for
skyrocketing campaign costs and that the public held them in low
repute,'' the center's report said.
   When a member who has received a PAC's donation votes against
that PAC's interest, it doesn't sit well, the report said.
   ``In one case we gave to a member thinking that we would get
something and it didn't work. We'll never give to that member
again,'' one PAC director was quoted as saying.
   Some 4,000 PACs are registered with the Federal Election
Commission. They represent a spectrum of special interests from
environmental and foreign policy concerns to farm, corporate, labor
and gun-control interests.
   Election law limits each PAC to a maximum $5,000 contribution to
any one candidate, in contrast to the limit for individual
contributions of $1,000.
   Congress has yet to approve any of the legislative options it
has had under consideration for some time to restrict the role of
PACs in elections by putting a ceiling on how much in total PAC
money any one candidate could accept, or eliminate the need for
PACs by instituting public financing for congressional campaigns.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of five
Central American governments on Tuesday prepared for a meeting to
evaluate compliance with a peace plan.
   Ricardo Acevedo Peralta, the Salvadoran foreign minister, told
local reporters Tuesday the diplomats were to take up verification
measures for the peace plan during their meeting scheduled
Wednesday.
   The peace plan, signed last August by the presidents of the five
nations, calls for cease-fire and reconciliation talks between the
governments and rebels forces of El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala.
   It provides for general amnesties and free elections in each
country and a ban on all outside military assistance to regional
insurgencies.
   Acevedo Peralta said the foreign ministers also will discuss
their upcoming session with representatives from the European
Economic Community in Hamburg, West Germany in March.
   The region's presidents agreed during their January summit
meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica to immediately implement the peace
accord, but they did not specify a timetable for reaching
individual objectives.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced immediately after
the summit the Sandinista government was suspending its nearly
six-year-old state of emergency, which curbed civil liberties.
   Ortega also agreed to direct cease-fire talks with the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels for the first time. Negotiators for
the two sides met in San Jose Jan. 28 and are scheduled to resume
the talks in Guatemala on Thursday.
   Cease-fire talks in El Salvador and Guatemala have stalled.
   The foreign ministers to meet Wednesday are: Alfonso Cabrera of
Guatemala, Carlos Lopez Contreras of Honduras, Miguel D'Escoto of
Nicaragua and Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto of Costa Rica, in addition to
Acevedo Peralta.
   The five have taken over the functions of the peace plan's
original verification commission, which was composed of
representatives from the Organization of American States, the
United Nations, the Contadora Group nations of Mexico, Colombia,
Venezuela and Panama, and Contadora's support group of four other
Latin American governments.

   Opponents in Parliament lost a final bid Tuesday
night to water down a Conservative government bill restricting the
promotion of homosexuality.
   The amendment sought to limit to teaching in schools a blanket
stipulation that local government authorities must not
``intentionally promote homosexuality.''
   The House of Lords, the non-elected upper chamber of Parliament,
defeated the amendment 90-48, meaning the bill is virtually certain
to become law by June 1.
   A Labor Party member, Lord Longford, charged that the bill,
which has already passed its key legislative stages in the elected
House of Commons with large majorities, smacked of a ``general
queer-bashing campaign.''
   Government Home Office Minister Lord Caithness retorted that
``gay pride'' programs and the promotion of gay rights in youth
clubs run by some local authorities sought to glamorize
homosexuality.
   ``Young people are susceptible to these intolerable
influences,'' said Lord Caithness.
   ``Activities such as a Lesbian Gay Strength and Pride Week are,
in the government's view, at least as likely to glamorize
homosexuality in the minds of impressionable young people as
anything a teacher might do,'' he said.
   The House of Lords can delay and suggest changes to legislation
but cannot overturn bills approved by the House of Commons.
   Critics charge the bill will heighten hostility toward
homosexuals and reflects prejudices of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. She complained last fall that children were being taught
``they have an inalienable right to be gay.''
   Critics say the word ``promote'' is so vague it could mean local
authorities censoring the works of famed homosexual writers such as
Oscar Wilde.
   Local authorities run public libraries, some theaters and most
state schools.
   The government has denied prejudice, but accused some left-wing
local authorities of using state funds to promote homosexuality as
an acceptable way of life.
   Under the proposed law, complainants could bring a civil suit
against local authorities and auditors could also penalize them for
misusing funds.
   In wording gay rights groups said was particularly offensive,
the measure stipulated that local authorities must not ``promote
the teaching in any maintained (state) school of the acceptability
of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.''
   Homosexuality between consenting adults has been legal in
Britain since 1967.
   Left-wing councils, including those running inner city London,
boroughs and the northern cities of Manchester and Sheffield, are
derided by conservative newspapers for grants to gay and lesbian
community groups.

   The aging N Reactor, shut down amid safety
concerns prompted by the Soviet nuclear accident at Chernobyl, will
be placed in indefinite ``cold standby,'' the Energy Department
said Tuesday.
   The decision means that the reactor, which for 25 years has
produced plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal, will be
mothballed next year after the completion and testing of $100
million in safety improvements.
   Lawmakers said Congress is expected to go along with the
decision, which is included in President Reagan's proposed spending
plan for the next fiscal year. The budget is to be presented to
Congress on Thursday.
   About 2,600 workers will eventually lose their jobs at the
reactor, located at the Hanford nuclear reservation in central
Washington state.
   Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., said that the ripple effect from those
layoffs could eventually result in a total of up to 7,000 people
loosing their jobs in the Tri-Cities, Spokane, Yakima and the
Seattle area.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington said the decision to close the
reactor was a result of a review of the nation's future need for
plutonium conducted by the Department of Defense.
   Under ``cold standby'' status, fuel will be removed from the
reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued, the DOE
said.
   The reactor could be cranked up if the demand for plutonium
increases, but a restart could take up to three years to complete.
   ``The N Reactor has been a key part of our national security
complex for more than 20 years and those who have been associated
with it can be proud of its contribution to the security of the
United States,'' Herrington said in a statement.
   Herrington said DOE was ``committed to a sensitive, orderly
transition. It is the goal of the department to do everything
possible to assist those people who will now need to find new
jobs.''
   The N Reactor is one of four DOE-run reactors that produce
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. The other three, located
at the Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., are running at 50
percent power because of safety concerns.
   The N reactor was shut down in January 1987 for safety
improvements prompted by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the
Soviet Union. The N Reactor is similar in design to that Soviet
reactor, although U.S. officials said it was considerably safer. It
is operated for the Energy Department by Westinghouse Inc.
   The announcement ends months of speculation about the future of
the N Reactor. The decision was reached following meetings that
involved Herrington, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, James
Miller, director of the Office of Management and the Budget, and
White House chief of staff Howard Baker.
   As recently as December, DOE officials had told Congress that
the reactor would probably be restarted this spring.
   But Herrington said it was decided that plutonium produced by
the three Savannah River reactors, along with the recycling of
plutonium from retired nuclear weapons could meet demand.
   Evans and Morrison, who blamed budget cuts for the decision,
said they were ``disappointed.'' But, they said, at least the
department would finish the safety improvements and not shut the
reactor immediately. Layoffs would thus come gradually.
   ``If there is any good news in this, and there isn't much, that
is it,'' Evans said.
   Both Evans and Morrison said they would push for expanded
funding for the clean-up of highly radioactive defense waste at the
Hanford reservation and also for the conversion of a mothballed
Washington Public Power Supply System nuclear plant at the Hanford
reservation into a new defense production reactor.

   Bob Dole _ who came from behind only to
fall back in the final week of the presidential primary campaign _
sought Tuesday to put a positive face on his second-place finish.
   ``It looks like (Vice President George) Bush may have won ... so
we've made up a lot of ground here in the last few days,'' the
Senate minority leader said.
   ``It's been, as I've said for some time, a two-person race.
We've made a lot of progress the last few days. We didn't quite
pull it off here, but we feel pretty good about it,'' Dole said in
an interview.
   Earlier, Dole blamed unfair attacks for the results.
   ``If it hadn't been for the distortion of my positions on tax
increases and an oil import fee, I'd be 10 points ahead,'' he said.
   ``You shouldn't distort someone's record. I could do that to
him, but I won't.'' He pledged, however, ``to straighten out my
record. It's not going to take long.''
   Dole won convincingly in the first major test of the season,
beating Bush 2-1 in last week's Iowa caucuses.
   Polls before the caucuses showed Dole trailing Bush by as much
as 20 percentage points in New Hampshire, but Dole came on strong
to make the race a virtual dead-heat as the voting began.
   Dole was upbeat early Tuesday.
   ``It feels good, like it did in Iowa last Monday,'' he said.
   Bush, with a home just outside New Hampshire on the Maine coast,
had long considered New Hampshire friendly territory, just as Iowa
was seen as home turf for Dole, who is from neighboring Kansas.
   Dole also benefited from President Reagan's comparatively low
popularity among Republicans in Iowa, and suffered from Reagan's
strength in New Hampshire, where Reagan beat then-rival Bush 2-1 in
the 1980 GOP primary.
   ``The fact the vice president moves out of New Hampshire with 35
percent of the vote in a state which has 2 percent unemployment, a
state in which Ronald Reagan is 82 percent popular ... I don't
think that bodes well for what will happen (for Bush) down South,''
said Sen. Warren Rudman, Dole's most prominent New Hampshire backer.

   You sensed it was over when Ted Williams and
Barry Goldwater stepped into the batters box.
   New Hampshire, which derailed George Bush's ``Big Mo'' in 1980,
delivered for him in Tuesday's Republican presidential primary. The
results dealt a serious setback to Bob Dole, but considerable
damage was also done to three fellows named Robertson, Kemp and du
Pont.
   For as long and Bush and Dole continue their duel, the chances
pale for one of the conservative challengers to make a serious run
for the nomination. The also-rans _ Pete du Pont, Jack Kemp and Pat
Robertson _ finished in a clump in New Hampshire, meaning none
could claim victory even in the sub-contest for second-tier
momentum.
   For one of the three to challenge Bush or Dole, he needed a
clear shot as the campaign moved into the South. Now it seems
certain that the spotlight will stay on the frontrunners with at
least a tad interest in how Robertson will do in the Bible Belt.
   Pete Teeley, Bush's spokesman, said New Hampshire Republicans
chose Bush because of his leadership and because of his economic
proposals and because he was a candidate with 20 years foreign
policy experience as opposed to Dole who had served only in
Congress.
   Bush had a different explanation, one based on personal history.
   ``He did what I did in 1980,'' he said of Dole. ``He won in Iowa
and came in and talked about momentum. I did what President Reagan
did. He (Reagan) came in and started talking the issues ... and I
think it's working.''
   Dole complained, as losers generally do, that his views had been
distorted, an indication that issues _ he cited oil import fees and
taxes _ rubbed the wrong way for Dole in the conservative Granite
State.
   The memory may linger of du Pont waving a piece of paper in
Dole's face and challenging him to sign ``the pledge,'' that is,
the pledge not to raise taxes no matter what.
   That was Sunday night. On Monday, things got worse for Dole. And
better for Bush.
   In his darkest hour, with his lead in the polls squeezed to just
about nothing and many of the pundits laughing behind his back,
Bush brought out the best hitter in the history of New England
baseball and the fellow the Republicans call ``Mr. Conservative.''
   Ted Williams posed for pictures with Bush and Goldwater, the
retired senator from Arizona and 1964 GOP standardbearer, stumped
by his side and cut a memorable televised campaign ad. He said of
Bush: ``He's the man to continue the conservative revolution we
started 24 years ago.''
   In the ad, broadcast as a hefty percentage of Republican voters
were making up their minds, Bush said, ``I sense a rising tide ...
with your help it will carry me to the White House.''
   This is the sort of thing that Bush needed, not only to blunt
Dole in his bid for a knockout punch, but also to keep Robertson,
Kemp and du Pont at bay.
   They, or at least those who survived, figured to make their move
in the South and would have liked a clear shot at the winner of the
Bush-Dole duel. But with Goldwater putting his conservative arms
around Bush's shoulders, and with Bush newly invigorated for his
battle with Dole, there is suddenly less room in the inn for Kemp,
du Pont or Robertson.
   Dole was clearly disconsolate Tuesday night.
   Early in the evening, with the votes being counted, Dole said:
``If it hadn't been for the distortion of my positions on tax
increases and an oil import fee, I'd be 10 points ahead.'' The vice
president portrayed Dole all last week as an advocate of an oil
import fee and likely to cave in to pressures for a tax increase.
   ``It's unfortunate,'' said Dole, ``that the vice president of
the United States, who knows better, would sink to that level. But
he did it, he knows it's false on its face and he'll have an
opportunity to answer to that from now on.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
celebrated a resounding victory in New Hampshire's Democratic
primary Tuesday night, declaring that ``the best America is yet to
come.''
   ``Last week in Iowa, our message started to shine through and we
won a bronze,'' he told more than 1,000 cheering supporters
gathered at a restored mill building. ``Tonight here in New
Hampshire, our message came through loud and clear. We went for the
gold and we won it.''
   With just under 90 percent of the precincts counted, Dukakis had
about 36 percent of the vote. Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen. Paul
Simon, who grabbed the first two spots in the Iowa caucuses, were
battling it out for second.
   Dukakis, who will take his campaign South on Wednesday, sought
to put to rest questions about his strategy for the region.
   ``The fact of the matter is, I don't have a Southern strategy,''
he said. ``I don't have a Northern strategy or a Western strategy.
I have an American strategy.''
   He said, ``We believe in the kind of politics where you say the
same thing wherever you go in this country ... The people of
Arkansas and Kentucky are not voting for a zip code, they're voting
for a president of the United States.''
   As a Northeastern liberal, Dukakis faces his stiffest test in
the Southern states. But as the Democrat with the biggest campaign
warchest, Dukakis has been able to send a plethora of staff to the
region.
   He is working particularly hard in Florida with its Jewish
population _ Dukakis' wife Kitty is Jewish _ in Atlanta, viewed as
the capital of the South, and in Texas, where he is seeking the
Hispanic vote.

   Among the also-rans, Gary Hart and Bruce
Babbitt failed in New Hampshire to extract themselves from the
bottom of the seven-man Democratic heap, but Pete du Pont's
slow-but-improved showing on the Republican side Tuesday gave him
cause for hope.
   None of the last-tier candidates was counting himself out as
votes from the nation's first primary rolled in. But in the days to
come, New Hampshire still could send a few candidates packing
before Super Tuesday rolls around March 8.
   Proving that in politics all things are relative, du Pont, who
was running fourth in the five-man Republican field, said: ``This
has been a terrific evening for us here in New Hampshire.''
   He had finished fifth in a six-man field _ before the withdrawal
of Alexander Haig _ in Iowa's caucuses a week earlier.
   Du Pont's showing was just shy of Jack Kemp and ahead of
Robertson, according to partial returns. All three trailed
front-runner George Bush and his main rival, Bob Dole.
   For the Democrats, Babbitt edged out Hart. Ahead of them were
Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore, each of whom had solid organizations
awaiting them in the South. Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon were in
the strong second tier behind winner Michael Dukakis.
   Hart, who won New Hampshire when he ran in 1984 but whose
candidacy has failed to catch fire since he re-entered the 1988
race, called his meager showing at the bottom of the Democratic
pack this time ``disappointing ... but not discouraging.''
   The former Colorado senator said he expects to be a candidate
``as far ahead in the future as I can see'' but he was pragmatic
about the need to start picking up some solid support that would
translate into the dollars and delegates needed to win nomination.
   ``I understand that there are standards that have to be met in
terms of delegates and votes,'' he said. ``It will take at least 30
to 60 days to determine if I can put together a viable candidacy.''
   Babbitt, who had said prior to the New Hampshire primary that
its voters had the power of life and death over his candidacy,
insisted he wasn't ready to start planning his funeral just yet.
   ``I'm going to move on for a couple of days to Washington in a
couple of days and call and talk to my supporters all over the
country and ask them this question: How ... can we keep this reform
movement alive?''
   Jackson said he met with Babbitt on Tuesday night and discussed
getting his support.
   ``Our message has tremendous overlap ... I hope that in time we
will work out some common ground in terms of our politics,''
Jackson said.
   Robertson failed to repeat his dramatic second-place showing
from Iowa, but had never claimed he'd sweep New Hampshire. He had
better prospects in sight in the South and plenty of money on hand
to propel him forward.
   One of the also-rans from the Iowa caucuses never even made it
as far as the New Hampshire primary. Haig last week bowed out and
threw his support to Dole.

   The U.S. ambassador to Honduras on
Tuesday denied American newspaper reports linking high-ranking
Honduran military officers to Colombian cocaine traffickers.
   ``I am the principal and highest official of the United States
in Honduras and I totally disavow this situation that has appeared
in the newspapers of my country,'' Ambassador Everett Briggs said
during a news conference in Tegucigalpa.
   Briggs called the stories ``very imaginative and inventive.''
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo on Tuesday called the reports and
effort to discredit his government and said he summoned Briggs on
Monday to clarify the State Department's position on the matter.
   The reports, Azcona Hoyo said, constitute a campaign ``to
discredit the armed forces and my government, which has taken a
series of actions to combat the narcotraffickers.''
   The New York Times reported Feb. 11 that high Honduran military
officials had become involved with a powerful Honduras-based
narcotics trafficker, Juan Ramon Matta, in shipping cocaine to the
United States. The article cited Reagan administration officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It added the Reagan administration was increasingly concerned
about the Honduran armed forces' connections with Colombia's
Medellin cartel, producer of up to 80 percent of all the cocaine
shipped to the United States.
   On Sunday, the Miami Herald reported Gen. Humberto Regalado
Hernandez, the armed forces chief, was suspected by U.S. officials
of protecting Colombian traffickers who used Honduras as a staging
base for cocaine shipments from Colombia to the United States.
   Briggs told reporters: ``The attitude of General Regalado
Hernandez has been honest and thanks to this we now wage a war
without quarter against the international drug traffickers.''
   Briggs announced the United States, at the invitation of
Honduras, will open a permanent office in Tegucigalpa next month to
monitor drug flows.

   Vice President George Bush's ties to the Reagan
administraton and support among voters who chose a candidate at the
last minute helped him recover from his Iowa debacle and win New
Hampshire's Republican primary, polls said Tuesday.
   Among the Democrats, Michael Dukakis' political organization and
his performance as governor of neighboring Massachusetts helped
bring about his strong primary victory, the exit polls said.
   While pre-election polls had indicated an extremely tight race
between Bush and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas,
voters who made up their minds in the final days of the New
Hampshire race selected Bush, pollsters said.
   ``The polls had it neck-and-neck, and Bush is winning by more
than that,'' said Jerry Strom, a polling consultant for NBC News.
``The reason is that the late deciders were going to Bush.''
   One possible reason was Bush's organization. CBS News found
there was a substantially higher proportion of Bush voters who had
been contacted directly by the Bush campaign than Dole supporters
who had heard from the senator's campaign. ``I think the thing that
won it for Bush was his organization,'' said Warren Mitofsky, the
CBS polling chief.
   Bush, after leading strongly in public opinion polls in New
Hampshire, saw his advantage melt away after he finished third in
the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8, beaten by Dole and former television
evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Late polls showed Bush's decline in New Hampshire halt; one by
CBS Sunday and Monday gave him a slim 4-point lead over Dole. ``We
said he had a small lead, and that's what it looks like,'' said
Mitofsky.
   Los Angeles Times and the CBS News-New York Times polls found
that Bush's government experience weighed in his favor. A third of
Republicans told CBS that experience was the most important factor
in their vote, and 54 percent of them voted for Bush, to 37 percent
for Dole.
   Dole beat Bush among Republicans who said they were chiefly
looking for a strong leader, with 48 percent to 21 percent for
Bush. But that group made up a smaller share of the Republican
vote, 19 percent, CBS reported.
   The Los Angeles Times found that a sizable portion of
Republicans in New Hampshire favored the Reagan administration,
more so than was the case among Iowa Republicans, and they
predomninantly supported Bush, said Times polling chief I.A. Lewis.
``People think of Bush as someone just representing whatever Reagan
does, and they like that,'' Lewis said.
   ``Identification with with the Reagan administration clearly
helped Bush,'' said Mitofsky, of CBS. ``Reagan is popular and the
people who like Reagan went for Bush fairly strongly.''
   Moreover, ``Bush is doing well because of his long and solid
support here,'' said Lewis. He said his poll indicated that almost
half of Bush's supporters decide last year to vote for the vice
president.
   But many final decisions were made virtually at the last minute:
Of just over 1,000 Republicans surveyed by CBS as they left the
polls, 46 percent said they had decided on a candidate after the
Iowa caucuses and 32 percent said they decided in the last three
days of the campaign.
   Strom said NBC found that voters who decided in the last few
days went predominantly for Bush, as did those who decided more
than three weeks ago. ``Bush was winning early and late and Dole
was winning in the middle,'' immediately after his Iowa victory,
Strom said.
   NBC's poll found that 14 percent of the Republican voters made
their final decision on primary day, and they went for Bush, 36
percent to 29 percent for Dole. Those who decided during the
weekend, 11 percent of the total by NBC's measure, also went for
Bush, 44 percent to 31 percent for Dole.
   NBC also found that one potential trouble area for Bush never
developed: While half the Republicans believed Bush knew more than
he was saying about the Iran-Contra affair, only a fifth thought it
mattered, Strom said.
   Decisions also were made late among Democrats; 38 percent said
they chose their candidate in the last three days. Support for
Dukakis was broad _ he won among liberals, moderates and
conservatives alike, according to an ABC News-Washington Post exit
poll.
   The CBS exit poll found that 42 percent of Dukakis supporters
had been contacted by the governor's campaign workers, while the
other campaigns contacted only a third of their voters.
   It also found that 55 percent of the Democratic voters gave
Dukakis and excellent or above average rating as governor of
neighborhing Massachusetts, and 59 percent of them voted for him.
   The margin of sampling error for the polls was about 3 percent.

<HEAD>Clavell's `Noble House' Miniseries on NBC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With any joss _ that means ``luck'' in Chinese _
there'll be something to do next week rather than spend eight hours
on NBC's mind-numbing miniseries, the ignoble ``Noble House,''
based on James Clavell's best-selling novel of the same title.
   The plot is preposterous, the acting spotty, the music overdone,
the love scenes embarrassing, the special effects fakey. And after
investing eight hours _ two hours a night, Sunday through
Wednesday, on NBC _ everything is tied up neatly at the end, not
through any clever plot twist, but because of an act of God. Thanks
a lot.
   Pierce Brosnan, late of ``Remington Steele,'' is a fine actor,
but he's too pretty for Ian Dunross, a tough, middle-aged corporate
kingpin descended from Scottish pirates. Then this suave, exotic
fellow is given as a love interest gawky Deborah Raffin as
gosh-darn American Casey Tcholok, a perky corporate raider.
   Casey is a tip-o'-the-hat to feminism. The rest of the women in
the cast are the typical array of hookers, mistresses, or, at best,
secretaries.
   Ben Masters manages a believable performance as deceptively
affable Linc Barlett, Casey's boss and honcho of a huge California
conglomerate. But it's the villains who get the best of the
miniseries _ John Rhys-Davies as jealous Quillan Gornt, longtime
Noble House rival, and Khigh Diegh, the most fun of all as Four
Finger Wu, a wily bandit who operates from a junk in Hong Kong
harbor, cuffing his honest son into helping toss hapless henchman
overboard.
   The miniseries was shot in London and on location in exotic Hong
Kong.
   As the miniseries opens, Dunross is becoming the new tai-pan, or
boss, of Noble House, a huge Hong Kong-based trading company. He
has inherited a financial mess from his predecessor (Denholm
Elliott) and must struggle to keep the company from going under.
   To that end, he entertains a merger offer by a Linc's company,
Par-Con Industries.
   Enter Linc, accompanied by Casey, come to Hong Kong to cut a
deal. Talk about your ugly Americans _ during their brief stay,
banks fail, stock markets plunge, fires rage, buildings collapse,
and murders are most foul. Anybody with a lick of sense would
skedaddle back to the States and chalk it up to poor junket
planning. And a people who place so much emphasis on joss _ as the
Chinese must, since the word turns up several times a night _ would
surely notice that these two haven't exactly brought a ray of
sunshine to their happy port city.
   Shortly after Linc and Casey arrive, Linc secretly meets with
Gornt, who entices Linc with a possible joint raid on the Noble
House. Casey, in the meantime, is linking up with Ian. Everyone
remains irritatingly pleasant in between natural disasters.
   Also in the meantime, bandits play keep-away with a stolen,
broken half-coin that figures in an inscrutable ancient tradition
entitling the bearer to a lucrative ``favor'' from the Noble House.
   Though the plot is supposed to take place over a few days, it
seems like years. Time passage is such a problem that at one point,
the characters have to explain in dialogue what has happened when
and remark how it all seems so long ago.
   For viewers, it will all seem so long ago, too. ``Noble House''
isn't good enough to be good, or even bad enough to be good. As a
four-hour junk-TV snack, maybe. But for anyone willing to invest
eight hours _ good joss.

<HEAD>Is Full Employment Here?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the surprise of those who believed an
economic downturn would be under way by now, the number of people
with jobs is at an all-time high, generating concern of an entirely
different sort.
   The new concern, finding expression among popular economists, is
that the nation's full-employment level might be approaching, and
with it the possibility of rising wages.
   In short: inflation.
   As with all economic fears, this too could evaporate. But there
exists some statistical evidence to suggest that a long period of
wage stability could be nearing an end if the economic expansion
continues.
   In theory, the approach of full employment means upward pressure
on wages and a need to rely on less-skilled workers, which combine
to lower productivity and force prices higher.
   More than 114 million civilians were employed in January 1988,
more than 5 million above the figure for January 1986. While the
labor force has risen in that time, the jobless rate has fallen to
5.8 percent from 6.7 percent.
   The so-called full employment level _ in which all who are
willing and able to work have jobs, other than for those who are
between jobs _ is difficult to forecast, since it reveals itself
mainly in labor shortages and rising wages.
   Viewing various sets of statistics, economist J. Patrick Bradley
of PNC Financial Corp., a Philadelphia bank-holding company,
believes full employment hasn't been reached, ``given the modest
gains in wages relative to inflation.''
   Various reasons are offered for the absence of strong wage
gains, such as a decline in the level of unionism and a tendency
for workers to be older and more experienced, and already at peak
earnings.
   But, says Bradley, such explanations make little difference.
``It merely means that the full-employment rate has not yet been
reached and, therefore, is not yet a source of inflationary
pressure.''
   Those who place their faith in quarterly economic surveys by the
National Federation of Independent Business are less certain that
full employment is still a distance away.
   That survey, released this week, shows very strong hiring plans
among that organization's 500,000 members. Coupled with already
record-high employment levels, such intentions could be interpreted
as spelling trouble.
   Dean William Dunkelberg of Temple University's school of
business, who conducts the survey, found 23 percent of firms had
job openings in the final quarter of 1987, and that 19 percent plan
to raise employment in the current quarter.
   ``These are the strongest hiring plans recorded since 1978 on a
seasonally adjusted basis,'' he said, noting that the intent to add
workers was especially strong in manufacturing, with 28 percent of
such companies planning to hire.
   The same survey suggested that wage pressure has begun showing
up, with 23 percent of all companies reporting higher labor costs
in the final quarter of 1987.
   Simultaneously, the survey showed what Dunkelberg termed a
surprising 5 percentage-point jump in plans to raise compensation,
bringing to almost one-quarter the number of companies with such
plans.
   He reasons that, ``The rather large jump in plans to increase
compensation may be an early indication that the long-expected
problems on the wage front may have finally arrived.''
   Partly as a consequence, the percent of companies planning to
raise prices jumped 6 points to 27 percent of all companies. That
increase was the highest recorded for January in three years.

<HEAD>Many Jewish Women Trapped In Marital Limbo</HEAD>

   They're married, but not married. They're
divorced, but not divorced. That's the paradoxical plight of
thousands of religiously observant Jewish women in broken marriages.
   Although civilly divorced, the man won't grant a religious bill
of divorcement, called a ``get.''
   Only the man can do that under Jewish law, as observed in
Conservative and Orthodox Judaism, and if he doesn't, that leaves
her in an ambiguous state, her marriage ended civilly, but still
binding her religiously.
   ``She's in a limbo, neither married, nor unmarried,'' says
Benita Gayle-Almeleh of the American Jewish Committee who has done
special research into the problem, urging rabbinical action to
remedy it.
   In such circumstances, she points out, the woman is ``not free
to remarry, to pick up the pieces and go on with her life. Her
marriage has been dissovled but not dissolved.''
   Mrs. Gayle-Almeleh estimates at least 35,000 Jewish women across
the country are trapped in that situation, 15,000 of them in New
York state alone.
   ``They're in a terrible predicament,'' she said in an interview,
maintaining that the problem has reached crisis proportions. Jewish
law requires no religious release for men to remarry, but does for
women.
   ``It has a tremendous impact on the entire family in trying to
raise and socialize children. It's a continuous irritant and cause
of tension. It has the built-in possibility of a continually
fractured family.''
   She said men withhold the religious ``get'' for various reasons,
sometimes for emotional, financial or other blackmail to gain
concessions about property or child custody.
   ``This happens plenty of times,'' she said. ``In essence, it's
extortion.'' She said the possibility of a religious divorce ``is
dangled in front of the aggrieved spouse'' to meet various demands.
   In other cases, she said women can't obtain religious divorces
because the former husband is simply neglectful, lazy, refuses it
in vindictiveness after the breakup, drops out of sight or some
fluke of cirumstances.
   Without a ``get,'' the civilly divorced woman under Jewish law
is termed an ``agunah,'' or ``anchored wife,'' not free to remarry
since further sexual union would be considered adulterous and any
offspring would be ``mamzerim'' or ``bastards,'' Mrs. Gayle-Almeleh
said.
   ``Such children are forbidden to marry other Jews, and to this
day, they carry a terrible social stigma.''
   Mrs. Gayle-Almeleh, program specialist in AJC's Interreligious
Affairs Department and coordinator of its Women of Faith program,
said ``this painful religious problem demands creative and
immediate action.''
   She commended the New York Board of Rabbis for a recent
resolution urging sanctions against any former spouse who refuses
to provide a ``get'' after a civil divorce if the woman wants one.
   Such sanctions would involve denial of synagogue membership
privileges such as the honor of being called to read the Torah.
   Mrs. Gayle-Almeleh called the action a ``positive step,'' but
said the likelihood was that if a man had refused to supply a
``get'', he ``may well be beyond the point of caring.
   ``For anyone willing to flout community morals this way, his
being called to read the Torah probably doesn't make a big
difference,'' she said. However, she said the system ``may be
effective in some few instances.''
   The board also recommended that all rabbis urge couples to sign
prenuptial agreements saying that in event of civil divorce, both
partners will cooperate in arranging for a ``get.''
   That, however, wouldn't solve prior situations.
   She also cited drawbacks to a recently recently enacted New York
State legislation saying a Jewish husband who filed for civil
divorce must also grant his wife a ``get'' if she wanted it.
   She said the constitutionality of the law has been questioned as
on the ``slippery slope of church-state entanglement,'' and it's
also questionable if Jewish law should be subjected to legal
systems and courts in 50 states.
   Furthermore, she said that such legislation, ``puts the burden
on women to get the state to compel relief. It would require
emotional time-consuming and costly litigation,'' an ``unacceptable
route'' for many women.
   In Reform Judaism, a civilly divorced woman doesn't also need a
religious divorce to remarry, but it is required in Conservative
and Orthodox branches.
   ``It's one of the few instances in which Jewish law is rife with
the possibility of mischief,'' Mrs. Gayle-Almeleh said.
   In a recent address on the problem to a woman's conference in
Philadelphia, she said that through the centuries, rabbis have made
various efforts to temper ``the one-sidedness of biblical law'' on
the matter.
   She said attempts have been made to ``get around the dictum that
only a man has the right to divorce (religiously),'' but
nevertheless, a religious divorce is never granted ``in the absence
of, or without the consent of, the husband.''

   A preliminary draft of a U.S. Catholic
bishops' letter on women advocates that ``all ministerial roles be
studied in terms of their openness to all persons in the church.''
   Portions of the draft, prepared by a committee and still subject
to change before presentation to the full body of bishops, were
read to an academic conference here by Archbishop William Levada of
Portland, Ore., Religious News Service reports.
   Regarding the ordination of women, firmly rejected by the
Vatican but increasingly favored in polls of American Catholics,
the draft says:
   ``Continuing reflections, dialogues and heated controversies in
regard to the ordination of women demonstrate the importance of
further study in order to deepen the understanding of this
question...''
   Saying the Vatican does not consider limiting to the priesthood
to males a ``question of justice or equal rights,'' the draft adds:
   ``It is acknowledged that certain reasons advanced in the past
in support of the tradition arise from prejudicial attitudes toward
women. Such arguments _as an example that women are inferior or in
a state of subjection to men or are incapable of governing _ are
rejected.''

<HEAD>Linda Kelsey at Home With Children on New NBC Comedy</HEAD>

   Linda Kelsey, with two toddlers of her own,
feels at home when she's working on the set of her new NBC comedy
series, ``Day by Day.''
   In the new series, getting a tryout on NBC, Kelsey and on-screen
husband Doug Sheehan give up their jobs to stay home and run a
day-care center.
   She was a lawyer, and he was a stockbroker, and they feel a need
to devote more time to their new baby than they did to their
teen-age son. One of the show's creators is Gary David Goldberg
(``Family Ties'').
   ``Gary said I was in his mind from the beginning,'' said Kelsey.
``I knew him, because he produced `Lou Grant.' I didn't know,
however, if I was the only candidate or one of many. He wondered
why I was so tentative. I told him, `Gary, I don't know how many
people you're seeing, but I'd really love to be in it.' He said,
`You are it. There's no one else.'
   ``Gary says it's the story of his own life. He's wanted to do
this for several years. When he was a struggling writer in Berkeley
he and Diane Meehan had their first child. They ran a day care
center at home. It's a situation filled with such comedy.''
   Goldberg was also responsible for getting a child-care center
built at Paramount Studios, where the show is filmed. Kelsey
frequently brings her two children, Sophia Nellist, 4, and Margit
Isabella, 8 months.
   NBC is going all out to launch ``Day by Day.'' It will be
telecast this Monday and Thursday, then begin its regular schedule
on Sunday, March 6, replacing ``My Two Dads,'' which will
temporarily become a roving ``designated hitter'' on the NBC
schedule.
   ``Sophie sometimes plays on the set with the kids before we
start work,'' Kelsey said. ``When it's time to start filming, up
goes her hand and she says, `I'm not in this!' Which makes me very
happy. At home she can work her father's computer and is teaching
herself to read.''
   She and her husband, Glenn Strand, a computer systems analyst,
live in Ojai, 70 miles northwest of Los Angeles. She commutes by
limousine. ``I take a little nap in the car and when I get home I'm
refreshed,'' she said.
   Kelsey starred for five years as reporter Billie Newman in ``Lou
Grant,'' and after that was in the TV movie ``Baby Girl Scott'' and
the miniseries ``Nutcracker: Money, Murder and Madness.''
   ``I haven't done a lot since `Lou Grant,' but it was by choice
because I had two children,'' she said. ``Then six months ago I did
a play and it whetted my appetite to get back to work.''
   She says it was her frequent appearance on ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' that led to her casting in ``Lou Grant.''
   ``Being a guest star, I thought, was the easiest thing in the
world,'' she said. ``I could do some shopping,run errands. In a
series I'm there all the time. When I was a guest star I didn't
realize that Mary was in almost every scene.
   ``One show was based on `All About Eve,''' she said. ``I come in
all innocent and take over Sue Ann Nivens' job. I was Eve
Harrington to her Margo Channing. Betty White was nominated for an
Emmy for that show.''
   She was a guest on such shows as ``Doc,'' ``M-A-S-H'' and ``The
Rockford Files,'' and most of producer Quinn Martin's shows, such
as ``Streets of San Francisco'' and ``Barnaby Jones.''
   ``Those were great shows for the actors,'' she said. ``You could
get in Quinn Martin's repertory company and do his shows. Those
were great parts. You were the murderer. I thought then I'd never
do a series. All of the good parts went to the guest stars. Things
have changed so much now. Look at `L.A. Law' with its wonderful
parts for the regulars.''
   ``Day by Day'' has 12 children, five of whom have speaking roles.
   ``They saw 600 children,'' she said, ``and interviewed them
apart from their parents. The two key questions were `Do you want
to do this?' and `Do you want to do this many different ways?' We
wanted kids who wanted to do it, not those whose parents were
pushing them. We got kids who want to be here.''
   Kelsey relaxes by weaving, knitting, spinning and doing
needlework.
   ``I don't have much time right now,'' she said. ``But it's so
relaxing. It shuts out the world. I weave a lot of fabrics, but I
can't bear to part with them. I think if I make them into
children's clothes they'll get dirty.''

   It's a still night on McClellan Street when a
dozen cops, guns drawn, spill from a dark van and race up to a
two-story brick house. A 280-pound narc aims an iron battering ram
at the door.
   Shouts break the silence: ``Police officers! Search warrant!''
   Running footsteps rumble inside.
   The door is down in 35 seconds, and police flood in. Three
minutes later, six people are handcuffed. The search for drugs
begins, with officers lifting ceiling panels, rummaging in drawers,
shaking a Virgin Mary statue.
   It's another night in Detroit's war against crack, another raid
against potent chunks of cocaine that have snuffed out lives,
destroyed families, clogged courts and jails and created an
epidemic some say may be the worst in the nation.
   ``Crack is like a cancer,'' says Wayne County Sheriff Robert
Ficano.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The McClellan raid, police say, netted three arrests, two ounces
of crack, which fell out of one suspect's pants leg, and more than
$1,000 in cash. Scenes like this occur round-the-clock in Detroit.
   Since Mayor Coleman Young announced a new assault on crack more
than two months ago, police average a dozen raids a day. Hundreds
have been arrested. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in drugs have
been seized.
   ``I think it's at a war stage _ us against them,'' said City
Councilman David Eberhard. ``If we don't clean up the drugs,
they'll take over. We can't turn the city over to the criminal
element.
   ``I think the community needs to know we're doing something,''
he added.
   The high-profile raids are aimed to show just that. The early
focus has been on crack houses and small-time operators to show
citizens as much as traffickers that police mean business.
   ``We attacked the visible part first ... to get public
awareness,'' said Commander Joel Gilliam, who oversees the police
department's narcotics unit. He said larger traffickers will be
targeted next.
   Detroit's crack problem is staggering. According to police,
state and federal officials:
   _ Up to 40,000-50,000 people in Detroit and the surrounding area
have a $50-a-day crack habit, totaling more than $900 million a
year.
   _ On a given day, about 1,300 crack houses are operating in
Detroit. Thousands more dealers work street corners or other
locations.
   _ Cocaine-related emergency room visits to Detroit hospitals
increased seven-fold from the last half of 1984 to the first half
of 1987. In New York, by comparison, the increase in such visits
was about 2{ times.
   _ The practice of trading sex for crack is believed largely
responsible for Detroit's huge increase in a penicillin-resistant
strain of gonorrhea _ from 15 cases in 1985 to 2,344 last year.
   Statistics, however, cannot capture the mind-boggling brutality
that pervades the lives of crack dealers and addicts.
   Horror stories are endless: a teen-age woman involved in a crack
dispute is branded 20 times with a heated potato masher then shot,
the gun barrel pressed against her forehead; a baby dies of drug
intoxication after nursing at her cocaine-using mother's breast;
crack users sell their food stamps, beds, even protective bars on
their windows for another piece of the precious rock.
   ``You'll sell your mama, you'll sell your daddy,'' Gilliam said.
``You'll steal, you'll break into cars, you'll prostitute. It's
called the glass pimp. You won't eat. You won't sleep. That's how
addicting it is.''
   Many cities, including New York, Dallas and Los Angeles, have
crack problems. But William Coonce, special agent-in-charge of the
local Drug Enforcement Administration office, believes Detroit may
be the worst.
   He attributes the problem to an explosive combination: hard
economic times, access to guns, 5,000 to 10,000 abandoned
buildings, lack of opportunities for teen-agers _ and a per capita
murder rate that in 1985 and '86 was the worst in the nation. In
1987, there were 645 homicides, three fewer than the year before,
police said.
   Gilliam estimates 60-65 percent of Detroit's killings are
drug-related.
   Some people have become frustrated. Two men recently admitted
setting fires last fall at an alleged crack house in an attempt to
drive dealers from their neighborhood. They've been charged with
arson.
   One of the two said the community supported them and noted ``it
was like a neighborhood project.''
   Other people are simply frightened.
   ``The neighbors are scared to death. They're all running for
cover,'' Coonce said. ``Very definitely, it's out of hand.''
   Violence and crack feed on one other. Crack, a blend of cocaine
and baking soda, boiled and dried and broken into rocks, can take
effect in 10 seconds. It can create a false sense of confidence,
making users do crazy things.
   One man stabbed two relatives dozens of times, then took money
from one of the victims and spent it on crack, police said.
   ``You sniff cocaine and you rise to the top of the mountain,''
Gilliam said. ``You smoke crack, you shoot to the top. ... You've
got to pull them off the ceilings to lock them up.''
   Crack is popular in the inner city because rocks cost as little
as $5 or $10. And while Detroit is the main marketplace, trade has
expanded into the suburbs.
   Sheriff Ficano said his narcotics unit seized $2 million in cash
last year, double that of 1986. Authorities also estimate up to 50
percent of crack customers in Detroit are suburbanites.

   Police say one of crack's most frightening aspects is heavy
teen-age involvement.
   ``We've got kids going to school with $3,000 and (business)
beepers in their pockets,'' Gilliam said. ``They don't want to be
brain surgeons. They want to be instantly gratified. ... You have
immature adolescents with no goals. Give them a gun. Put them on
crack. They have no compunction about killing someone.''
   Gilliam said their philosophy is: ``You live fast, you die
young, you make a beautiful corpse.'''
   He said teens, including his daughter, are so jaded they read
obituaries. ``She wants to know who in her age group has been
shot,'' he said. ``It's a damn Vietnam body count. It's a whole
different society out there.''
   Teens also know if they get caught ``they're relatively immune,
at least from long stretches of time'' because 85 percent are out
of prison in 15 months, said Ron Schigur of the county prosecutor's
office.
   A 15-year-old can be waived to adult court, he said, but judges
are often reluctant to allow that.
   Crack, however, spans all ages. In December, police arrested a
72-year-old woman and said they found crack in her sock.
   Trafficking often occurs in houses where violence and sex are
commonplace. Police tell of finding rotting bodies in basements and
13-year-old girls offered as incentives for deals.
   Trading sex for crack has been tied to a phenomenal increase in
penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhea. Michigan had 2,797
cases last year, up from 187 in 1986, probably the fastest rate of
increase in the nation, said Tim Lindman of the Michigan Department
of Public Health. Most were in Detroit.
   ``There's a good deal of sex going on in crack houses, basically
anonymous sex,'' said George Gaines, deputy director of Detroit's
Health Department. ``People are saying, `I don't know who it was.
This was a one-time situation.'''
   Although the crackdown may ease some of these troubles, Detroit
still has problems.
   Residential drug treatment programs are crowded. And the Wayne
County Jail was overcrowded 83 percent of the time in 1987, Ficano
said, noting that triple-bunking or building a new jail are among
options considered.
   While many support the crackdown, experts say it isn't a
complete solution.
   ``This is going after the supply. ... We still have a population
that wants drugs'' and will find a way to get them, said Jacqueline
Morrison, senior project consultant at the Wayne State Research
Addiction Institute.
   Experts also say churches, parents and schools must play a role
in education, and attitudes must change.
   People must ``recognize the fact that when folks don't have
jobs, then they feel hopeless and they turn to hopeless things like
drugs,'' said Wayne County Commissioner Alberta Tinsley-Williams.
   Still, she said, the raids are a beginning.
   ``There's a sense of urgency in Detroit,'' she said. ``You've
got to start somewhere.''

   At the tender age of 18, when most teen-agers are
thinking about college and careers, Richard Wershe Jr. faces life
in prison.
   The blond, baby-faced Wershe was convicted last month of
possessing eight kilos of cocaine, worth about $5 million. Police
said that represented the largest single cocaine seizure in city
history.
   Wershe was sentenced Feb. 4 to the mandatory penalty of life in
prison without parole.
   In a city where the fight against drugs is an uphill battle,
this case represented a critical government victory, said William
Coonce, special agent-in-charge of the local office of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   ``Our total ability as a system to function was at stake,'' he
said. ``If we couldn't convict this guy, as out-front, as brash, as
arrogant as he was ... what could we do?
   ``It was a very important sign to the community ... we can do
the job as well as (deliver) the message _ if you deal in these
quantities, you're going to go to jail for life.''
   But, Coonce added: ``It's almost insulting to our profession
that any 18-year-old could get to this kind of stature without us
being able to snuff him out a long time ago. ... The fact this guy
is so young is symbolic of what's going on in this city.''
   Wershe, known on the street as ``White Boy Rick'' because most
of his associates are black, still faces two other drug charges.
   His father, Richard Sr., who has sued the police, alleging
harassment, recently told The Detroit News he and his son worked
for several years as federal drug informants.
   The FBI and DEA have declined comment.
   The younger Wershe was ``at the top echelons of trafficking'' in
Detroit, supplying cocaine to a major crack dealer under
investigation, Coonce said.
   ``Even though he looks like Baby Face Nelson,'' Judge William
Hathaway said in a hearing last year, ``as far as this court is
concerned he's worse than a mass murderer.''
   Wershe's conviction stemmed from a May 1987 incident in which
police found the cocaine in a box underneath a porch in the back of
a house; they said he had dropped it there after fleeing officers.
   According to testimony, Wershe was riding in a car stopped for a
traffic violation in front of his grandmother's house. A fight
broke out when police tried to grab a bag they later retrieved
containing $29,000.
   Wershe ran from the car, but was later recaptured.
   More than an hour later, officers found the drugs in a box in a
backyard a block from the grandmother's home. At the trial, a
neighbor said Wershe ditched the box in her yard and offered her
$500.
   Defense attorney Edward Bell said Wershe has nothing to do with
the drugs and didn't know how they got there.
   He argued Wershe was the victim of police brutality _ defense
witnesses said he was punched and hit with a pistol _ and the drug
charges were concocted to conceal the beating.
   The government acknowledged police ``thumped'' Wershe, but said
there was no excessive force.
   The defense also suggested authorities planted the drugs and
pinned it on Wershe, but prosecutors argued it was ludicrous to
believe police carry around 17.6 pounds of dope just in case.
   During the trial, Wershe was often surrounded by people wearing
furs and gold and carrying telephone pagers sometimes associated
with drug dealers.
   ``He was a local folk hero for the young people (who came to
court),'' Coonce said.
   Bell later said many of the ``kids hanging around the court''
were simply curious.
   Wershe's father has been charged with threatening a police
officer who testified against his son. Wershe Sr. has filed two
multi-million dollar lawsuits against the Detroit police and
others, alleging harassment, invasion of privacy and other charges.
   Though Coonce said Wershe's sentence may deter some, it will not
stop the flow of drugs in Detroit. As he said, ``There's not going
to be any lack for cocaine.''

   Here are some statistics on cocaine use and related problems in
the Detroit area. The war on crack was announced Nov. 30.
   _ From Dec. 1 to Feb. 5, 914 adults were arrested on
drug-related felony charges; 1,900 were charged with misdemeanors,
according to police and court records.
   Officials say 240 juveniles were arrested on drug-related
charges, both felonies and misdemeanors. Also, 830 weapons, 93
vehicles, about $690,500 and drugs estimated to be worth $5.2
million were seized.
   _ In 1987, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized 4,964
weapons nationwide. Of those, 511, or slightly more than 10
percent, were seized by the Detroit office, first among DEA
branches, said William Coonce, special agent-in-charge of the
agency's local office.
   _ Two-thirds of men arrested in Detroit for serious crimes
tested positive for the recent use of illegal drugs, according to a
study of 12 major cities released in January by the Justice
Department. Positive results ranged from 79 percent in New York
City to 53 percent in Phoenix, Ariz.
   _ A 1987 state report found increases in cocaine and crack use.
The report by Richard Calkins of the Michigan Department of Public
Health found:
   _ Admissions to state-financed treatment programs in cases in
which cocaine was the primary drug jumped 72 percent in Wayne
County (including Detroit) from fiscal year 1985-86 to the
following year.
   _ Almost 25 percent of cocaine admissions to state-financed
treatment in the Detroit metro area involved crack in the 1986-87
fiscal year.
   _ In a nine-month period from the end of 1986 to 1987, crack as
the primary drug for Detroit cases referred to state-financed
treatment increased from 35 percent to more than 50 percent.
Cocaine as the primary drug fell from 12 percent to less than 1
percent in the same period.

   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $12.2
billion in December as exports hit new records, but the overall
$171.2 billion shortfall for 1987 still measured the highest ever,
the government reported.
   December's merchandise trade deficit was down from $13.2 billion
in November and from $17.6 billion in October, and was the smallest
figure since a $11.9 billion trade gap in January 1987, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
   The improvement was driven by a 4.2 percent rise in exports,
which reached record levels for the second month in a row.

   Business inventories jumped 0.8 percent in
December, the government said, as the backlog of unsold products

   The Commerce Department said Friday that inventories held on

$701.87 billion in December following even larger increases of 0.9
percent in November and 1.1 percent in October.

   The steepest climb in food prices in nearly 18
months, only partly offset by falling energy costs, pushed
wholesale prices up at a brisk 0.4 percent in January, the
government said.
   The increase, if it continued for 12 months, would amount to an
annual wholesale inflation rate of 4.6 percent, compared with the
2.2 percent increase for all of 1987.
   A selection of goods priced at $10 in 1982 cost $10.62 last
month, up from $10.57 in December and $10.40 in January 1987, the
government said Friday.

   The massive Tax Reform Act of 1986 will
probably cause agricultural investment to decline at least through
the early 1990s, a report by the Agriculture Department said.
   Most of the investment decline can be laid to the law's repeal
of the investment tax credit, which allowed up to 10 percent tax
credit for qualifying capital improvements, the report said Friday.
   Most farm machinery, equipment, many farm structures and certain
livestock operations qualified for the full 10 percent credit.

<TEXT>
   Britain's first major industrial strike in several
years, the 8-day-old national walkout by more than 32,000 Ford
autoworkers, has not been primarily about money.
   Instead, it is an emotional dispute over the auto maker's push
to impose more Japanese-style work practices on reluctant employees.
   Such practices, including computerization, more flexibility
among workers and the cutting of auto-part inventories, have
angered hourly workers enough for them to reject a sweetened offer
from Ford by more than a 60 percent margin, even though union
negotiators had recommended it.
   Ironically, such practices also have made Ford Motor Co. Ltd.,
British subsidiary of the U.S. auto maker and the largest auto
maker in Britain, especially vulnerable to this strike.
   The company's production in Europe was quickly affected when the
walkout began Feb. 8 because the new efficiency at its European
plants means they also now are more interdependent.
   The strike, Ford's first British strike in nearly a decade, has
halted production at all Ford's 22 British plants.
   The action also has prompted the layoff of more than 9,700
workers and disrupted production at a Ford plant in Genk, Belgium,
which suffered a shortage of British-made parts.
   It also has threatened production at Ford plants in West Germany
and Spain, which also rely on parts made at Ford's British plants.
   In addition, it has cost Ford $40 million a day, at showroom
prices, in lost British car production.
   Talks between the Transport and General Workers' Union, which
represents two-thirds of the workers; representatives of the 11
unions that represent the rest, and company officials resumed today
after an 11-day hiatus.
   ``Our primary goal has been to improve efficiency and
productivity,'' said a Ford spokesman, who wasn't identified, in
accordance with British custom.
   Ford believes it needs to impose more efficient manufacturing
methods to boost productivity and better fight off its competitors,
such as Nissan Motor Co., in a market burdened with overcapacity.
Nissan operates a highly productive plant in Sunderland in
northeast England.
   ``We are not attempting slavishly to copy the Japanese. We are
attempting solutions to our own problems,'' the Ford spokesman said.
   Ford wants to introduce more flexibility so that, for example, a
skilled worker could work on a production line. But some skilled
workers apparently balk at working alongside unskilled workers.
   And some workers also appear to fear being overworked.
   Strikers have criticized Japanese-style work practices. But the
Economist said: ``The strike has been led by men in Dagenham
(assembly plant), in booming east London, where workers feel they
can demand big bribes in return for changing their work habits. Not
so in northeast England.''
   Indeed, not all British workers have reacted this way to the
increasing use of such manufacturing methods at Japanese and
non-Japanese plants throughout Britain.
   Many British workers in poorer areas of the country, such as the
northeast, have felt downtrodden by the class system and are
intimately familiar with Britain's widespread unemployment. These
have eagerly embraced the Japanese practices of equality and job
security.
   The new manufacturing techniques Ford imposed _ some worker
flexibility, computerization and the slashing of inventories of
auto parts to reduce costs _ increased the auto maker's
productivity and profitability sharply.
   Each Ford employee produced 9.5 cars in 1986 vs. 6.4 each in
1984 in Britain. Ford produced more than 383,000 cars in 1987 in
Britain.
   The British subsidiary's pre-tax profit tripled to about $569
million from $191 million in 1986, analysts estimate. Ford won't
report its results for a few months.
   Union officials said opposition to Ford's offer also centered on
its three-year term, the first of its kind ever sought in the
British auto industry. Previous contracts have been for one or two
years.
   Some workers said they also object to linking their pay
increases to government statistics for inflation because they claim
the government underestimates the true rate of increase in consumer
prices.
   The company's sweetened three-year contract offer included a pay
rise of 7 percent in the first year followed by rises of 2.5
percent above the level of inflation in the scond and third years.
   The present pay of a middle-range worker is $327 a week.
   The last major industrial strike in Britain was a yearlong
walkout by more than 90,000 coal miners in 1984-1985.
   Ford's British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978.

   Stock prices drifted in a narrow range in
moderate activity today, as interest rates rose in the credit

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down most of the

   Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 567 up, 786 down and 468 unchanged.
   The volume of shares traded totaled 74.44 million as of noon

session.
   The stock market was closed Monday for the President's Day

   Analysts said stock trading today was subdued by a continued
rise in interest rates in the bond market.
   Bond prices fell about $8 for each $1,000 in face value by
midday, following similar declines Friday following several
government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest
rates.
   The government said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.2
billion in December, but interest rates rose on speculation the
trade figures reflected economic strength which could prevent the
Federal Reserve from easing credit.
   Furthermore, the Labor Department reported a 0.4 percent rise in

<HEAD>Limited Earnings Fall 28 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Limited Inc. reported Tuesday a 28 percent
drop in earnings for its 1987 fourth quarter, in part because of
poor performances by two divisions and slowed consumer demand for
women's apparel.
   Earnings for all of 1987 were up slightly from the previous
year, the retailer said.
   For the fourth quarter, Limited's earnings totaled $63.3
million, or 35 cents a share, compared with $87.5 million, or 46
cents a share, in the final three months of 1986.
   Sales for the latest quarter totaled $1.01 billion, up from
$982.1 million.
   Profits for all of 1987 increased 3 percent, to $235.2 million,
or $1.25 a share, from $227.8 million, or $1.21 a share, the
previous year.
   Sales rose to $3.53 billion from $3.14 billion.
   ``During the third and fourth quarters, a major fashion cycle
matured and reached saturation,'' said Leslie H. Wexner, Limited
chairman. ``Consumer demand for women's apparel slowed.''
   Wexner said the company's Lerner and Lane Bryant divisions
performed below expectations, but noted that Victoria's Secret and
Limited Express increased earnings during the year ``in spite of
disappointing fall and Christmas sales.''
   During 1987, the company said it added 413 new stores, including
two 15,000-square-foot Limited Super Stores. The company also
bought back 10.8 million shares of stock for $240 million, leaving
178.8 million shares outstanding at year's end.
   Limited operates Limited, Limited Express, Henri Bendel,
Victoria's Secret, Lerner, Lane Bryant and Lerner Woman stores.

breakfast sausage market between the two Dallas-based companies,
whose officials praise each other's products as high quality.
   Jimmy Dean Meat Co. ranks first nationally, while the regionally
distributed Owens Country Sausage leads in Texas, according to both
companies' most recent A.C. Nielsen Co. market share figures that
exclude link and microwave sausage.
   Each claims to be the leader in the Southwest region, although
they decline to release those figures.
   ``We're tough competitors, but there's plenty of room,'' says
former entertainer Jimmy Dean, who heads his company of the same
name.
   ``They are formidable competitors. We continually go at it tooth
and nail with each other,'' says Jerry Owens, chairman of the
venerable, 60-year-old Owens Country Sausage.
   Both Jimmy Dean and Jerry Owens personally pitch their products
on TV. The two Texans speak with an easy drawl about home and
family and hearty breakfasts.
   Dean's celebrity status came almost 30 years ago when his ``Big
Bad John'' country-western song hit the charts. He also hosted a
television variety show.
   His answer on how he got into the sausage business is his
standard one _ even in a telephone interview from his boat, the
``Big Bad John,'' floating somewhere south of Miami where Dean is
wintering:
   ``Had you ever seen my act, you would realize diversification
was imperative. I was in the hog business in Plainview and the
market fell out and we were losing out. Quality sausage was
something I didn't think existed,'' said Dean, a remark sure to
leave the Owens people aghast.
   Dean founded the company with his brother, Don, in 1969. But the
brothers waged a nine-year legal battle when Jimmy Dean made
critical remarks about his brother's management of the company in
the 1970s. Don Dean is no longer with the company.
   In 1986, Jimmy Dean was ordered by a Dallas jury to pay Don
$500,000 in damages for violating a 1980 agreement to keep quiet
about his brother. A federal appeals court overturned that last
year.
   Family relationships at Owens have been smoother.
   Owens attained his reputation selling sausage as his father,
C.B. Owens, did before him. But from his appearance and manner,
Owens could easily pass for a country-western star himself.
   ``Our emphasis is on our family's involvement (with the company)
on a day-to-day basis and the family heritage and a history of
reliability and consistency,'' he said, sporting a western-cut
corduroy jacket, plaid shirt and thin gold chain around his neck.
   Jerry Owens' son, Stewart, is now president of the company.
   Jerry Owens said it never really occurred to him to do anything
but take over the family business, which started back in 1938 with
the idea of using ham, loin and shoulder cuts in sausage _ instead
of using it to ``get rid of the trimmings.''
   ``Pork sausage was an abused product,'' Owens explained.
   While both companies are headquartered here, both are now owned
by bigger out-of-state corporations that allow them to continue to
market their products under their own brand names.
   While Dean is distributed nationally, Owens is marketed from
Arizona to Mississippi and as far north as Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   In 1984, Jimmy Dean Meat Co. was acquired by Chicago-based Sara
Lee Corp., which also owns other smaller sausage companies. Owens
was acquired by Bob Evans Farms Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, in 1987.
   ``I think that's a big enough market that both are highly
regarded in their respective areas. I don't sense that either one
is out to murder the other,'' said Elliott Schlang, senior vice
president of Prescott, Ball & Turben, an investment firm in
Cleveland.
   He called the Bob Evans-Owens merger a ``very nice geographic
expansion,'' though it's too early to tell if it will be successful.
   While their advertising harks back to home cookin' and simpler
times, both sausage companies also are venturing into more
modern-day markets _ with biscuits and microwave foods that are
quick and easy to serve.
   ``Convenience is the deal today,'' Owens said. ``Lifestyles are
kind of changing with more working moms. Breakfast in many
households has become getting a bite on the run.''
   His latest TV commercials show Owens hawking a sausage biscuit
that can be heated in the microwave oven.
   Likewise, the Jimmy Dean company is pushing English muffins
topped with ham and cheese or sausage. Dean said the company will
soon be test-marketing a small packaged hamburger, but declined to
give more details.
   Mesquite-smoked sausage is being marketed in the Dallas area,
while microwaveable sausage is being tested in several markets,
said Ed Jenkins, vice president for marketing at Jimmy Dean.
   The Owens family also plans to get into the restaurant business,
relying on the expertise of Bob Evans' successful chain in the
Midwest to help get a new restaurant in Irving, Texas, off the
ground in March.

   T. Boone Pickens, whose previous attempts
to buy Lakewood-based KN Energy Inc. have been rejected by the
company, is now angling for a spot on KN's board of directors.
   Pickens was nominated for the board Friday by Mesa Limited
Partnership of Amarillo, Texas, a concern controlled by him. Mesa
owns 445,200 shares of KN's 9.1 million outstanding common shares,
or about 4.9 percent stake.
   Shareholders will vote on new directors March 24 at KN's annual

   ``We need to get 20 percent of the vote to get Boone elected,''
said Mesa spokesman David Batchelder. ``We think we can do that.

Securities and Exchange Commission.
   ``We really couldn't speculate regarding Mesa's intent,'' Buxton
said.
   Pickens first bid for the Lakewood company in September 1983,
buying 337,000 shares, or 3.9 percent of the common stock, for
$44.50 a share. He offered to swap 3.5 shares of Mesa common for
each share of KN common shares.

   ``Hillbilly'' goes to work each day not knowing
whether he'll face armed drug dealers, snarling pit bulls or scared
children cowering behind closed doors.
   He lives in a world of danger and split-second decisions.
   Hillbilly, code name for a 37-year-old Detroit narcotics
officer, is ``shotgun man'' on a crew conducting daily drug raids.
He's a foot soldier in the city's war against crack.
   Armed with a 12-gauge shotgun, Hillbilly is the first cop to
enter dark crack houses and abandoned buildings. Followed by a crew
of six to eight others, he secures the premises, looking for guns
and people carrying them. The task takes about 30 tense seconds.
   The job takes a lot more: steel nerves, a quick mind and plenty
of guts.
   ``You never get used to it,'' he said. ``You're always scared.
You'd be a fool if you weren't. ... Your mind is more occupied with
the entry. You always get a lump. ... Fear of the unknown.''
   Judgment is critical. ``You have a decision to make,'' he said.
``You hope it's the right one.''
   Hillbilly, given the nickname by co-workers because of his
Kentucky roots, has been a cop for 17 years, 11 in narcotics. In
that time, he's seen or heard it all: pit bulls guarding crack
houses, people who've used children as shields and dealers who sat
upstairs while a hooded, bound victim of an execution-style murder
rotted in the basement.
   ``Their world is drugs,'' he said. ``Everything else is
immaterial.''
   Hillbilly said a contract was put out on his life years ago. He
had 24-hour guards.
   He's also had a bullet whiz through his jacket sleeve and had
partners shot. Once, suspects in a house started shooting through
the door as the cops approached. The officer carrying a battering
ram was hit. Hillbilly pushed him aside. He kept moving.
   Hillbilly and other narcotics officers wear bulletproof vests
under blue jumpsuits and caps. The glow-in-the-dark word ``police''
is emblazoned on their heads, backs, chests, arms and shoulders.
   After hundreds of raids, Hillbilly says fighting drugs is
``definitely frustrating.''
   ``You'll drive yourself crazy if you think the judges are not
putting them away,'' he said. ``We try not to dwell on that. We
just tend to lock that out.''
   He cited one recent case in which a woman and her son were
arrested and weapons and crack were seized. Weeks later, police
raided the same place, he said, discovering more weapons and drugs.
   ``What's depressing and frightening to us is they pick up the
guns so easily,'' he said. ``We'll probably end up (there) in
another two or three weeks.''
   Hillbilly also has no illusions about his impact on drug
trafficking.
   ``We're not naive to think we're stopping any major drug
distributors in the area,'' he said. But each complaint, he said,
must be pursued, no matter how small.
   ``It's nice when you get a few of the bad characters off the
street,'' he said. ``Whether we're helping society... Well, they
have to want to help themselves.''
   Hillbilly said the worst part of the job is when cops are
killed. ``It's heartbreaking.'' You wonder, he said, ``Is it all
worth it? For eight rocks (of crack), he's laying in the casket?''
   But, he added, ``You shake it off. You go back.''

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange finished
slightly lower Tuesday as continued hesitance by institutional
investors overshadowed better-than-expected economic figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 4.6
points, or 0.26 percent, lower at 1,734.6.
   The index traded narrowly all day. Volume totaled 293.6 million
shares, up from 248.3 million Monday but still a low level.
   Market makers tried to boost prices after favorable news late in
the morning on Britain's public sector borrowing requirement and
industrial production. But the data failed to stimulate much
activity, and the gains eroded slowly.
   Among the FT-SE 100 shares, declines led advances by 49 to 27,

   Stock prices were narrowly higher in moderate
activity today, as interest rates rose in the credit markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down most of the
morning, was up 4.64 points to 1,987.90 at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 725 up, 722 down and 472 unchanged.
   The volume of shares traded totaled 94.21 million as of 2 p.m.

   The stock market was closed Monday for the President's Day

   Analysts said stock trading today was subdued by a continued
rise in interest rates in the bond market.
   Bond prices fell about $6 for each $1,000 in face value by
midafternoon, following similar declines Friday following several
government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest
rates.
   The government said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.2
billion in December, but interest rates rose on speculation the
trade figures reflected economic strength which could prevent the
Federal Reserve from easing credit.

<HEAD>Crisis Looms Because Workers Lack Basic Skills</HEAD>

   A telephone company attempting to recruit
workers finds 84 percent of applicants fail the entry-level test. A
congressional study shows most high-school juniors cannot write a
simple letter seeking a summer job.
   A steelworker misorders $1 million in parts because he cannot
read well. An insurance clerk who doesn't understand decimals pays
a claimant $2,200 instead of $22.
   Illiteracy caused by poor education has become an economic time
bomb, threatening both the quality of the American work force and
the nation's ability to compete on world markets, government
policymakers say.
   The Department of Education estimates more than 27 million
Americans older than 17 cannot read or write well enough to perform
basic requirements of everyday life. Another 45 million are
considered barely competent in basic skills.
   That means more than 72 million _ one out of every three adults
_ may lack the reading and writing skills they need to find work.
And the number is growing annually by more than 2 million, federal
officials say.
   These statistics coincide with a surge in demand for workers who
not only can read and write, but who also can use computers,
understand technological concepts and think independently in an
economy that is shifting to services and information and away from
manufacturing.
   Moreover, this erosion of worker literacy comes at a time when
America's competitors in Asia and Europe are forging ahead with
educated work forces that may come to dominate the high-technology
business of the 21st century.
   ``We need to determine what to do with the substantial fraction
of our population that's ill-equipped to compete in a global
economy,'' said Indiana University professor Lawrence Mikulecky.
   A study commissioned by the Department of Labor titled
``Workforce 2000,'' published last June, estimated that between now
and the end of the century, for the first time in U.S. history, a
majority of all new jobs will require postsecondary education.
   This prospect presents a great risk to minority workers, who
historically have lacked the schooling and skills needed to exploit
job opportunities, said the study conducted by the Hudson
Institute, a private research organization.
   If that pattern persists, the study said, ``by the year 2000,
the problems of minority unemployment, crime and dependency will be
worse than they are today. Without substantial adjustments, blacks
and Hispanics will have a smaller fraction of the jobs of the year
2000 than they have today, while their share of those seeking work
will have risen.''
   The problem is compounded by a declining number of people
entering the labor pool, a consequence of the sharp dropoff in
birth rates that followed the postwar baby boom.
   Some personnel executives say the literacy crisis already has
hurt them. New York Telephone Co. discovered last year that 84
percent of its New York City applicants flunked the company's
entry-level exam, which included basic questions on vocabulary and
numerical relationships.
   The Business Council for Effective Literacy, a
corporate-sponsored group, has documented instances in which
employees misordered millions of dollars in parts, overpaid bills
and endangered work-place safety. In one case, a feedlot operator
who misread a label killed a pen full of cattle by giving them
poison instead of grain.
   Foreign companies building factories in the United States also
have been rudely awakened. At Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S.
manufacturing operations, for example, personnel managers now test
the educational level of all prospective employees.
   ``They're not just assuming that because someone comes in with a
high-school diploma, he's going to be prepared,'' said Paul Jurmo,
program associate at the Business Council for Effective Literacy.
   Definitions of literacy vary greatly, but some tests have served
as important guides. In 1985, for example, the Department of
Education asked 3,400 people aged 20 and older to answer at least
20 of 26 simple questions correctly. Nearly 13 percent failed.
   Other measurements are considered equally discouraging. A study
mandated by Congress in 1984 found that fewer than 400 of 2,000
11th graders could adequately write a note applying for a summer
job at a swimming pool.
   College Board test scores have fallen about 8 percent over the
past 20 years, while test performance abroad has risen. In an
international calculus and algebra test done a few years ago, the
best U.S. 12th graders came in last among students from the most
developed countries. Japanese finished first.
   Estimates on the cost of work-place illiteracy also vary but are
believed to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The
Institute for the Study of Adult Literacy at Penn State University
has said the cost is at least $225 billion per year, just in terms
of lost productivity, welfare and related crime and prison expenses.
   In addition, at least $25 billion is spent by companies and
private groups to upgrade worker education, but most of this effort
reaches only a small fraction of those who need it most, says David
Harman, a Columbia University professor who has done extensive
research in the area.
   A great deal of illiteracy remains obscured, partly because many
older employees are sensitive about their lack of skills, fearing
they could be fired or face ridicule by seeking help.
   Some devise elaborate ways to conceal inability to read or
write, including feigning nearsightnedess or taking job
applications home to have spouses complete them, said Eli Zal,
executive director of Literacy Volunteers of New York City Inc., a
nonprofit group that organizes classes for adults.
   There are some encouraging signs. Millions of illiterate or
barely literate adults are starting to take advantage of a growing
range of educational programs offered not only by voluntary and
government groups, but labor unions and employers themselves.
   The federally funded Adult Basic Education program, the largest
single literacy effort in the nation, enrolled 3.1 million people
in 1986, up from 2.5 million in 1984.
   Many large companies have started contributing money to
community efforts, drafted tutors to help disadvantaged workers and
organized schools of last resort to provide basic instruction.
   General Motors Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.,
for example, together spend at least $700 million annually on adult
education. Other companies such as Polaroid Corp., Standard Oil
Co., Ford Motor Co. and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group offer
remedial classes in plants and offices.
   Part of this corporate effort arises from a gradual realization
among executives that it's in their long-term interest to have an
adaptable and educated work force. But many in business still may
not appreciate the magnitude of the crisis, according to Robert W.
Goddard, publication director at Liberty Mutual Insurance, who
wrote on the subject in a recent issue of Personnel Journal
magazine.
   ``The major force driving corporate America to attack illiteracy
is the same one that united the colonies 200 years ago: Either hang
together on this issue, or hang separately,'' said Goddard.

   Two nights a week, Demetrius Mosley leaves his
job at a toy-store warehouse for a midtown Manhattan skyscraper,
where volunteers help him read newspaper ads and write simple
sentences in a frayed notebook. Three months ago, he could barely
write his name.
   ``It takes a lot for a person to say, `I need help,''' said
Mosley, 26, who is enrolled in a class run by Literacy Volunteers
of New York City Inc. ``A lot of people are scared to admit it.''
   At 6:30 p.m., the Gulf & Western building's 40th-floor cafeteria
becomes a school where Mosley and about 70 other adults, many of
them poor and unable to read beyond the second-grade level, receive
tutoring in the literacy demands of everyday life, ranging from
paying the rent to getting a driver's license.
   Some seek help to read dime-store novelettes. Others want to
study the Bible or even opera librettos, Literacy Volunteer
officials said.
   But for many, the training is vital to their ability to work and
earn a paycheck.
   The students are taught by professionals including advertising
executives, accountants and teachers, some from Manhattan's swank
private schools. All are recruited by the Literacy Volunteers,
which holds classes in 10 sites citywide.
   ``When adults don't know how to read and write, they don't have
much faith in themselves,'' said Eli Zal, executive director of the
Literacy Volunteers. He said the group gets a large part of its
budget from corporate donors.
   Because of television publicity and a growing awareness of the
nation's illiteracy problem, the Literacy Volunteers office has
been inundated not only with applications from prospective
students, but tutors as well. There is a 10-month waiting list for
student spaces and for the first time, a waiting list for tutors,
who receive a special training course before teaching a class.
   ``These people really want to learn. That's what is exciting to
me,'' said Ann Heininger, a 30-year-old volunteer tutor who works
for Coopers & Lybrand, a large public accounting firm.
   She began tutoring about three years ago and it has since become
a regular part of her routine, she said. During that time, she has
helped students learn to scan help-wanted ads and write notes to
creditors about disputed bills. She recalled helping one student
read a gambling handbook.
   ``I try to get my students to help each other,'' she said. ``One
of the biggest things is to get their confidence up, and that
strategy helps.''
   Mosley, one of a half-dozen students taught by Ms. Heininger in
her current class, said he decided to seek help partly because of
his job at a Toys R Us warehouse, where he needed to recognize the
names of games and other toys.
   ``When I first came to this class, I couldn't read. Picking up a
book was like a disease,'' he said. ``But now, no problem. When you
come to realize you can do this, it's great.''
   Nizam Ali, a 28-year-old student in Ms. Heininger's class, said
he sought help after watching a TV ad about illiteracy 10 months
ago. Unable to read, Ali only had been able to get errand jobs or
other work that didn't require filling out a job application, he
said. Now he is reading simple romantic novels and wants a
high-school diploma.
   ``Since I started here, it's done a lot for me,'' he said. ``I
know how to do things. Write a check, read a sign. The teachers
here, they help you a lot. They have a lot of patience.''
   Zal estimated nearly 70 percent of Literacy Volunteer students
are employed, and most want improved skills to help them at work.
Although that is important, Zal said, he is concerned about what he
called a preoccupation with work-place literacy that also could be
harmful.
   ``It's one thing to learn how to read names on a paint-chip
chart for your job,'' he said. ``But where does that person go to
learn to read a bedtime story to his children? If work-place
literacy is where it stops, it is rather frightening.''

`Dumbing Down'</HEAD>

   Although many employers realize they must
bolster workers' skills to stay competitive, others are
restructuring so employees often don't have to read, write or think
_ a change some educators call ``dumbing down.''
   Examples already abound, from the automatic teller machines at
banks to the electronic scanners at grocery checkouts, to the
pictures of hamburgers instead of digits on the cash-register
buttons at fast-food outlets.
   Supporters of these computerized innovations say they raise
efficiency and cut overhead and retraining costs. Critics agree
such strategies can be helpful but often are based on the
assumption that illiteracy in the work force is intractable.
   ``There are jobs that will be dumbed down. The problem is that
someone has to service the computers that do the thinking,'' said
Eunice N. Askov, director of the Institute for the Study of Adult
Literacy at Penn State University.
   Another problem, she said, is that dumbing down decreases job
security and will likely raise turnover rates at jobs in which
promotions are unlikely.
   ``Of course, people want to be able to advance in their jobs,''
she said. ``Fast-food cashiering is a dumb-down job. But employees
can't advance, so they eventually drop out.''
   Lawrence Mikulecky, an Indiana University professor and literacy
expert, said some companies opt for the dumbing-down approach
simply because of the retraining costs, which can become
prohibitive among workers who lack a high-school education.
   ``To give you an idea of the magnitude, it takes about 100 hours
to move somebody up one grade level. So from sixth grade to high
school, you're talking about a substantial amount of time,'' he
said.
   ``You're talking about hundreds and hundreds of hours of
training. Nobody takes those decisions lightly,'' he said. ``It's a
major investment, and companies have to take a look at who's worth
investing in.''
   Many companies dispute the argument that replacing people with
computers is a long-range danger to a skilled work force. Large
grocery chains, for example, have found automatic checkout systems
that track inventory can alleviate time-consuming clerk jobs and
free workers for more challenging tasks, such as managing
delicatessen counters.
   At the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., a leading chain with
more than 1,100 stores, computerized checkouts have raised
accuracy, decreased customer waiting time and largely eliminated
the need for clerks to stamp individual prices on items, said
company spokesman Michael Rourke.
   ``I'm not sure I would buy the premise that the technology is
put in place to make decisions for the workers,'' he said. ``I'm
saying the technology we're putting into effect is to improve
efficiency, and improve speed in making decisions, and hopefully
overcome some of the menial labor tasks.''
   On a broader scale, such a strategy is part of the long-range
plans of automaking giant General Motors Corp., which once
predicted it would go from one technical job for every 5.6 manual
jobs to a 1:1 ratio by 1995. The company already is ahead of
schedule.
   One possible result of such a trend, educators say, is a
polarization of the work force into a small number of highly
trained professionals and a majority of employees largely unable to
advance from relatively simple tasks.
   ``When your choice is, `I can't hire somebody for under $12 an
hour, and it's going to take me 500 hours of training,' then maybe
you fire six of those people and have the one remaining directed by
a computer,'' Mikulecky said.

   Corn and soybean futures closed lower while wheat
finished mostly higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices were pressured by a variety of factors, including
speculative profit-taking, increased farmer selling on cash markets
and improved soybean growing conditions in South America.
   Corn futures also retreated on profit-taking and farmer selling,
analysts said.
   Wheat prices for near-month delivery declined slightly while the
deferred-month contracts advanced on expectations the Soviet Union

   Stock prices were higher in moderate activity
today, as interest rates rose in the credit markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down most of the
morning, was up 10.11 points to 1,993.37 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York

   The volume of shares traded on the Big Board totaled 112.19
million as of 3 p.m. EST.
   The stock market was closed Monday for the President's Day

midafternoon, following similar declines Friday following several
government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest
rates.
   The government said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.2
billion in December, but interest rates rose on speculation the
trade figures reflected economic strength which could prevent the
Federal Reserve from easing credit.

<TEXT>
   Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. on Tuesday reported its
earnings plunged 38 percent in the quarter following the October
stock market collapse, while revenue fell 14 percent during the
period.
   Bear Stearns, parent of the investment firm Bear, Stearns & Co.,
reported net income of $36.8 million, or 40 cents a share in the
third fiscal quarter ended Jan. 29. In the year-ago quarter, Bear
Stearns reported net income of $59.6 million, or 70 cents a share.
   Revenue during the period totaled $447.2 million, down from
$520.2 million in the year-ago quarter.
   For the company's second fiscal quarter, which ended Oct. 30,
1987 and included immediate results from the Oct. 19 stock market
crash, the company reported a net profit of $413,000.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Greenberg said the
company was pleased with its performance ``during this difficult
environment.''
   Greenberg noted that Bear Stearns has ``approximately the same
number of employees we had on Oct. 1, 1987, and we expect the
number of increase materially in the next 30 days.''
   The company said in a statement it employs about 6,000 people in
13 offices worldwide.
   Bear Stearns also noted it repurchased 150,000 shares of stock
during the third fiscal quarter and ``may continue to purchase
shares in the future.''
   For the nine month period, the company reported net income of
$85.1 million, or 91 cents a share, down 33 percent from $128.8
million, or $1.51 a share in the pervious nine-month period.
   Revenue for the period totaled $1.37 billion, up 5 percent from
$1.31 billion in the year-ago period.

   An afternoon rally carried stock prices higher
in moderate trading today in spite of a continued rise of interest
rates in the credit markets.
   The stock market was closed Monday for the President's Day
holiday.
   Analysts said stock prices were depressed in the morning by
higher interest rates. But the bond market erased some of its
losses later in the day and stock prices climbed in the afternoon.
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, down $10 for
each $1,000 in face value in the morning, was down only about $3.40
by the end of the New York Stock Exchange session.
   Bond prices had begun to fall Friday following several
government economic reports pointing to stable or higher interest
rates.
   The government said the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.2
billion in December, but interest rates rose on speculation the
trade figures reflected economic strength which could prevent the

   Italian Financier Carlo De Benedetti
went to court Tuesday to prevent three units of Societe Generale de
Belgique from raising capital and to set limits for the sale of any
assets by the companies, according to two of the businesses
involved.
   De Benedetti is trying to take effective control of Societe
Generale, Belgium's biggest holding company, and is working to
thwart capital increases that would dilute his stock in the firm.
   Officials of Gechem and Cimenteries CBR confirmed that they and
officials of Tractebel appeared before the Brussels commercial
court Tuesday in an action initiated by Cerus and Dumenil-Leble,
two French-based companies in De Benedetti's camp.
   Cerus officials confirmed this was a new initiative but they
declined any further comment about it.

<HEAD>Ashton-Tate, Compaq Announcing Software On Wednesday</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release after 10:30 p.m. EST; time set by sources.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashton-Tate Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. have
scheduled announcements for Wednesday that mark the personal
computer industry's steady transition to a more powerful internal
``traffic cop.''
   Ashton-Tate Corp. is to unveil a vastly improved version o its
D-Base software, the dominant program for managing information
stored in personal computers.
   D-Base IV is capable of running under the new ``traffic cop,''
Operating System-2, the state-of-the-art software for directing
traffic inside a personal computer.
   Separately, Compaq is to announce Wednesday it is beginning
deliveries of Operating System-2 for use in Compaq personal
computers.
   The announcements mark the growing acceptance of Operating
System-2 since its announcement last April by Microsoft Corp. The
software allows computers to run several jobs at the same time and
to handle bigger programs than can be handled by its predecessor,
MS-DOS.
   OS-2 will supersede MS-DOS as the operating system of choice by
the end of 1990, with 3.7 million copies shipped that year vs. 1.5
million copies of MS-DOS, Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge,
Mass., predicted recently.
   Ashton-Tate's D-Base IV should help the Torrance, Calif.-based
company against challengers such as Borland International Inc.,
Microrim Inc. and Oracle Corp., according to analysts who got
previews of the product.
   ``This product is a major advance over D-Base III Plus in almost
every dimension,'' Edward M. Esber Jr., chairman and chief
executive, said in an interview Tuesday.
   Ashton-Tate had more than 60 percent of sales of data-base
managers for personal computers last year, the company says.
   Houston-based Compaq is highlighting the ability of its
computers to run Operating System-2 as part of a public-relations
battle with International Business Machines Corp., which says its
new Personal System-2 computers are best suited to run OS-2.
   Compaq is to have 21 independent software developers _ including
Ashton-Tate _ at an industry forum, commenting on their plans for
programs that will take advantage of OS-2's features.
   Compaq intends to demonstrate that Operating System-2 runs
faster on Compaq computers than on IBM computers, although IBM was
involved in OS-2's development, Michael Swavely, Compaq's vice
president of marketing, said in an interview Tuesday.
   The new version of Ashton-Tate's D-Base features a redesigned
look known as ``what you see is what you get'' and spares computer
novices from having to do any programming to enter or retrieve
information from the computer.
   For advanced users, a new programming language includes 245 new
or improved commands and incorporates the industry-standard
Structured Query Language created by International Business
Machines Corp.
   In addition to running under the new Operating System-2, D-Base
IV can also run under Microsoft's older MS-DOS, which is still the
one used on most personal computers.
   D-Base IV includes a compiler that allows it to run 10 times as
fast as D-Base III Plus, Ashton-Tate said. The compiler reduces the
instructions in a program to a machine language that a computer can
read rapidly.
   Esber said the new version contains about 400,000 lines of
programming code vs. 106,000 in D-Base III Plus.
   The price is $795, up from $695 for D-Base III Plus. Current
D-Base users can buy upgrades to D-Base IV for $175.
   Esber said the program was being announced early because the
company will be showing it in a national tour led by IBM that
begins next week.
   Some of Ashton-Tate's competitors have stumbled in efforts to
beat the company to the market with data-base managers that work
with Operating System-2.
   Borland and Oracle have failed to meet their own deadlines for
data-base managers that run under Operating System-2. However, they
may still beat Ashton-Tate to market, because Esber said D-Base IV
might not be available until the end of July.

<HEAD>Northwest, Union Spar Over Possible Flight Attendants Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines' announcement that it
will lay off 5,300 mechanics and baggage handlers if its flight
attendants strike is a ploy to pit the two unions against each
other, a union official says.
   Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said Monday that the
announcement made in a letter was only a precaution required by
International Association of Machinists labor contracts with
Republic Airlines. Northwest acquired Republic in 1986.
   But Jeff Musto, a spokesman for the Teamsters, said Northwest's
letter was ``a ploy to play the unions against each other and lower
morale.'' He said the letter would backfire and draw the unions
closer together.
   The letter was sent last weekend to 2,900 mechanics and 2,400
baggage handlers represented by the IAM. In it, Northwest said:
``Although your company does not expect a flight attendants strike,
it is impossible to predict whether the flight attendants will
actually go on strike.
   ``You may be placed on temporary no-work status due to a
reduction in force'' if there is a strike.
   Northwest's 6,500 flight attendants, represented by the
Teamsters, can strike at 11:01 p.m. Feb. 26. Bargaining between the
airline and the union is expected to resume next week.
   The IAM, which represents 20,000 ground workers at Northwest,
and the pilots union have not said whether they will honor a strike
by flight attendants.

<HEAD>Firestone, Bridgestone Announce Joint Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. said Tuesday it
planned to spin off its worldwide tire business into a $1.5 billion
joint venture to be 75 percent owned by Tokyo-based Bridgestone
Corp.
   Firestone said the transaction, which must be approved by its
shareholders, was expected to result in a $1 billion cash
distribution to Firestone shareholders as part of a major financial
restructuring, according to a joint statement.
   The company also said its board of directors adopted a ``poison
pill'' takeover defense.
   Firestone stock soared $9.25 to $45 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading following the disclosures.
   The surprise announcements came amid speculation that Firestone
would sell its Akron, Ohio-based tire division to the Italian tire
manufacturer Pirelli SpA.
   According to the trade publication Rubber & Plastics News,
Firestone was the world's fifth-largest tire company in terms of
sales, with 1986 tire sales of $2.3 billion.
   Firestone posted total profit of $103 million and revenue of
$3.8 billion in the year ended Oct. 31, 1987.
   The tentative agreement with Bridgestone calls for Firestone to
transfer tire assets and liabilities with an equity value of about
$1.5 billion to the joint venture.
   The venture would be financed initially with $750 million in
equity from Bridgestone, $250 million from Firestone and $500
million in debt, the statement said.
   Bridgestone would own about 75 percent of the company, and
Firestone 25 percent, the statement said.
   The two companies plan to operate the joint venture, which will
be known as the Firestone Tire Co., as ``a relatively autonomous
business unit, subject to the direction and control of a board of
directors consisting of persons representing the owners,'' the
statement said.
   Firestone spokesman Robert Troyer said the company would retain
its 1,500 car care centers; Firestone Diversified Products, which
includes divisions that manufacture industrial and building
products; Firestone Synthetic Rubber and Latex Co., which
manufactures synthetic rubber and operates a rubber plantation in
Liberia, Africa; and Firestone Car Rental Inc.
   Troyer said the tire division employs 30,000 people worldwide
while the rest of Firestone's businesses employ 23,500.
   The joint venture would be based in Akron, Ohio, and would be
assigned the exclusive right to use Firestone's name on tires
throughout the world.
   The tentative agreement also calls for the joint venture to
arrange contracts for raw materials with Firestone's remaining
businesses and to supply tires to its car care centers.
   In a related move Tuesday, Firestone's board adopted a ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover plan to guard against unfriendly suitors.
   The plan would take effect if any person or group buys 20
percent or more of Firestone's common stock without board approval.
The company said the plan was ``intended both to ensure that
Firestone's shareholders will retain the benefits of a joint
venture with Bridgestone and to protect the full value of its
shareholders' investment in the company.''
   Weekend news reports in Rome and Milan, Italy, quoted Pirelli
officials as saying their company had the financial strength to
acquire Firestone and added that Pirelli representatives had
visited Firestone's world headquarters in Chicago last week.
   ``I have no comment on the Pirelli deal,'' said Firestone
spokesman Robert Troyer. ``That story was based on rumor, and I
have no comment on rumors.''
   The announcement on the Bridgestone deal came as Firestone's
board met in Chicago for a regularly scheduled session.
   Firestone is the third-largest tire manufacturer in the United
States, behind Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and Uniroyal Goodrich
Tire Co.
   In previous interviews, Firestone Chairman John J. Nevin had
acknowledged the company might withdraw from the tire business.
   Firestone structured the tire business as a freestanding unit
last November when its corporate staff moved from Akron to Chicago.
The company will seek shareholder approval next month to change its
name to Firestone Inc. It was not immediately known if shareholders
would be asked to approve the joint venture at that meeting.

<HEAD>Northrop Net Soars; Absence of F-20 Costs Cited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. said Tuesday its earnings rose
275 percent in the fourth quarter and 129 percent for the year,
primarily because of money saved from the cancellation of its F-20
Tigershark program.
   The results also reflected a higher level of research and
development on several classified projects for the Pentagon.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company earned $34.9
million, or 74 cents per share, compared to a year earlier when it
netted $9.3 million, or 20 cents per share.
   Revenue for the most recent period rose 6.6 percent to $1.77
billion from $1.66 billion.
   For the full year, the company's profits jumped to $94.2
million, or $2.01 per share, compared to $41.2 million, or 89 cents
per share, while revenue rose 7.8 percent to $6.05 billion from
$5.61 billion.
   The major factor in the increased earnings, the company said,
was the absence of spending on the F-20, a fighter canceled in late
1986. Those costs totaled $236 million in 1986, including $105
million in the fourth quarter.
   Northrop poured more than $1 billion in its own money into
developing the F-20, which was designed primarily for foreign
countries as a lower-cost alternative to the F-15 and F-16. But it
was never able to find any buyers.
   However, 1987 results were depressed by a second-quarter $125
million writedown on a classified government project widely
believed to be the Stealth bomber.
   Northrop earnings also were depressed by an unspecified amount
as the company continued to pump its own funds into developing a
prototype of the Air Force's 21st century warplane, the Advanced
Tactical Fighter.
   Northrop and Lockheed are leading competing teams of defense
contractors seeking a $40 billion production contract for the ATF.
   Aerospace was Northrop's only business to show improvement. It
had an operating profit of $59.2 million in the fourth period
comared to a loss of $4.8 million a year earlier. For the full
year, it earned $220.1 million, compared to $66 million in 1986.
   The company's electronics unit saw operating profits drop to
$23.6 million from $36.8 million for the quarter and to $70 million
from $99.7 million for the year, primarily because of lower revenue
and profit margins on the MX missile program.
   The company's aerospace services segment posted a loss of
$300,000 for the quarter, compared to a profit of $4.3 million a
year earlier. For all of 1987, its profit was $10.3 million, less
than half its 1986 level of $21.5 million.

   Farmers Group Inc. reported its earnings rose
by 46.6 percent in the fourth quarter and 25.7 percent for the
year, but much of the gain was accounted for by a tax adjustment.
   Without that adjustment, the company's earnings were up 17.6
percent for the quarter and 15.5 percent for the year, in line with
what the insurer predicted earlier this month.
   The results, released Monday, come as Farmers is trying to fend
off an unsolicited $4.13 billion takeover bid by the American
subisidiary of London-based BAT Industries PLC.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company netted $86.9
million, or $1.26 per share, compared to $55.5 million, or 80 cents
per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose by 13 percent to $302.3 million from $267.4 million.
   For the full year, the company's net jumped to $268.3 million,
or $3.88 per share, in contrast to $213.5 million, or $3.09 per
share, in 1986. Revenue rose 11.8 percent to $1.13 billion from
$1.01 billion.
   Results for the most recent quarter and 1987 included a gain of
$21.6 million, or 31 cents per share, from the tax adjustment.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
domestic trading Tuesday after turning in a mixed performance
overseas.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a late bid for gold of $444.15 a troy ounce, down from
Friday's late bid of $445.50. U.S. currency and commodity markets
were closed Monday in observance of Presidents Day.
   Traders said the dollar fell back after rising late last week on
a government report that the U.S. trade deficit for December shrank
for the second consecutive month.
   ``There was a lack of follow-through buying, particularly on
behalf of the Japanese,'' in reaction to the improved trade
picture, said Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   He noted traders were ``looking to the dollar's downside'' after
dealers overseas failed to show greater enthusiasm for the trade
figures.
   Robert Ryan, a senior trader at Irving Trust Co., noted that
while there was no major news to move the dollar, the currency also
was depressed because of an ``unwinding of cross positions,'' in
which dealings in other currencies affect the dollar.
   In European trading, the dollar was mostly firmer, although
dealers could not pinpoint any definite trend. Foreign exchange
dealers said markets were quiet, with some West German markets
closed for a holiday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 130.50 Japanese yen, down from
131.00 yen late Monday. Later in London, the dollar traded at
130.30 yen. In New York trading, the dollar closed at 130.385 yen,
down from 130.925 yen on Friday.
   The British pound fell to $1.7440 from $1.7455 in London
dealings. In New York, it cost $1.74625 to buy one pound, more
expensive than late Friday's $1.74175.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.71045 West German marks, down from 1.7115;
1.4040 Swiss francs, down from 1.4087; 5.7805 French francs, down
from 5.7820; 1,258.00 Italian lire, down from 1,260.75, and 1.2685
Canadian dollars, up from 1.26445.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday's late rates,
included: 1.7120 West German marks, up from 1.7085; 1.4038 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4040; 5.7815 French francs, up from 5.7705;
1.9200 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9180; 1,260.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,257.50; and 1.2687 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2658.
   Gold bullion prices varied, rising in London to a late bid price
of $445.50 a troy ounce, up from $445.10, but falling in Zurich to
$444.50 bid, down from $445.50. Hong Kong markets were closed for
the Chinese New Year.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion traded at $445
a troy ounce, down from $445.30 a troy ounce on Friday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.39 bid a troy ounce,
up from $6.35. On the Comex, silver closed at $6.355 a troy ounce,
down from $6.370 on Friday.

<HEAD>Irving Bank Rejects Revised Bank of New York Buyout Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. on Tuesday rejected the
current $1.08 billion buyout offer from Bank of New York Co., and
launched another sharp verbal attack against its unwanted suitor.
   Irving's board of directors rejected as ``significantly
inadequate'' Bank of New York's offer to pay $15 in cash and 1.575
shares of its own stock for each of Ie. Bank of New York dipped 12{ cents
to $29.75 a
share, giving its offer an indicated value of nearly $62 a share.
   Bank of New York's latest offer is its second revised proposal
since the bank holding company initially offered to pay $80 in cash
and securities for Irving last September. Bank of New York revised
the offer to $68 in cash and securities following October's stock
market crash, and lowered the offer a second time late last month.
   Irving bitterly has rejected all three overtures in the rare
hostile bank takeover attempt, and maintained it wanted to remain
independent.
   ``The new proposal is even worse for Irving shareholders than
earlier BNY proposals,'' stated Joseph A. Rice, Irving's chairman.
``The revised offer continues to promise a deal in which Irving
shareholders are grossly uncercompensated while assuming very
substantial risk.''
   ``We deeply regret that BNY persists in its ill-conceived
efforts,'' he said.
   Owen Brady, a Bank of New York spokesman, said the company
regretted Irving's rejection but would continue seeking a meeting
to discuss a merger. He reiterated Bank of New York's stance that
it reserved the right to revise its offer when warranted.
   Irving also announced that its board increased the regular
quarterly dividend on its common stock to 60{ cents per share from
56 cents per share. The dividend is payable March 31 to
shareholders of record on March 1.

   Borden Inc. said Tuesday it had agreed to buy
two food companies, two chemical specialties concerns and a
wallcoverings company for an undisclosed price.
   Separately, the company's chairman, R.J. Ventres, told
securities analysts Borden expects first-quarter profit growth of
more than 15 percent.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Borden rose $1 a
share to $52.62{.
   The latest acquisitions are:
   _Raineri Foods, a pasta maker based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   _Vicaplast Industria e Comercio de Plastico Ltda., a film
producer and printer based in Sao Paulo.
   _Mantecados Nevada Inc., Puerto Rico's second largest ice cream
producer.
   _Societe Francaise Polymeres Ouvres, a manufacturer of food
packaging material based in Nimes, France.
   _Bob Mitchell Design, a high-fashion wallcoverings company based
in San Gabriel, Calif.
   Earlier this year, Borden acquired the Borges wallcovering
company of West Germany and Humpty Dumpty Foods, a snack producer
based in Montreal.
   It said the price for the seven acquisitions amounted to about
$80 million and that the seven companies had combined sales of more
than $141 million.
   The company has invested more than $1 billion in acquiring 45
companies since March 1986.
   In remarks to securities analysts meeting in St. Petersburg,
Fla., Ventres said the strength of the company's businesses and the
``cycle-resistant nature'' of the markets it serves would boost
overall profit by ``better than 15 percent'' in the first three
months of 1988 compared with a profit of $44 million in the first
quarter of 1987.
   He said sales for the full year should exceed $7 billion for the
first time in 1988. In 1987, Borden reported a profit of $267
million, or $3.62 a share, on revenue of $6.51 billion.

   Stock investors ignored bad news on interest
rates, the dollar and commodity prices Tuesday as the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks cracked the 2,000 barrier for the
first time since early January.
   The Dow industrials rose 22.71 points to 2,005.97, its first
finish above 2,000 since suffering a 140.58-point plunge on Friday,
Jan. 8.
   The Dow indicator has risen 110.25 points in the last five
trading sessions.
   ``For a market that's not supposed to go up, that's a pretty
good performance,'' said Jack Baker, head of block trading for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Stock analysts were at a loss to explain the market's strong
performance, especially in light of a recent rise in interest
rates. Usually higher rates hurt stock prices by threatening to
slow down the economy and by providing an attractive investment
alternative to stocks.
   Interest rates, after a big rise Friday, continued to climb
Tuesday. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to
8.46 percent as its price fell about $3 for every $1,000 in face
value.
   Stocks got no help from the dollar, which weakened slightly
against most major currencies.
   And metals prices _ an early warning sign of commodity inflation
_ rose strongly.
   ``It's kind of befuddling,'' said Charles Jensen, technical
analyst for MKI Securities Corp. in New York.
   Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did not
appear to move the market. Greenspan said in a Washington speech
that the economy seems to be in equilibrium and gave no indication
that the Fed was ready to change its monetary policy.
   Big Board volume totaled 135.38 million shares, against 144.86
million in last Friday's session. The stock market was closed
Monday for Presidents Day.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by 880 to 620 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 487 stocks unchanged.
   Firestone shot up 9\ to 45. The company said it planned to spin
off its worldwide tire business into a $1.5 billion joint venture
to be 75 percent owned by Tokyo-based Bridgestone Corp.
   Publishing companies were higher on takeover speculation
following Pearson PLC's $283 million deal Monday to buy
Addison-Wesley. Houghton Mifflin rose 3~ to 31~ and Grolier rose 1[
to 13\.
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific rose ~ to 45{ in heavy trading.
Olympia & York, the Canadian developer, began a tender offer to
increase its stake in the company by up to 14 million shares.
   Federated Department Stores jumped 3[ to 63}. Campeau Corp. said
it was prepared to offer $66 a share to acquire the company in a
definitive merger agreement.
   Among blue-chip stocks, International Business Machines rose 1}
to 113}, General Motors rose 2[ to 69\ and General Electric rose |
to 43~.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 156.41 million shares.
   The NYSE index rose 1.10 to 145.96.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 3.02 to 299.09,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 2.20 to 259.83.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.93
to 278.93. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market rose 1.47 points to 354.74.

   Eastern Airlines has corrected many of the
safety problems that led to a $9.5 million fine two year ago, but a
small airline Eastern is enlisting to combat a possible strike
faces safety penalties of its own, the Federal Aviation
Administration disclosed Tuesday.
   The separate FAA findings surfaced as Eastern's safety record
came under renewed scrutiny at a congressional hearing where
Eastern pilots at times laughed derisively at some of the
assurances on safety made by Eastern executives.
   Eastern has been in the midst of labor problems for months, with
charges by the unions that Eastern's management is cutting corners
on safety. The 10,000-member machinists union has been locked in
talks under a federal mediator and Eastern's 4,000 pilots have not
said whether they would work if the machinists went on strike.
   Thomas J. Matthews Sr., ake by mechanics, Eastern might be
forced out of business. Eastern has lost $900 million since 1978,
including $181.7 million last year.
   Two years ago Eastern was fined a record $9.5 million by the FAA
for a broad range of maintenance and record-keeping violations. In
a followup report on the airline since the fine, the FAA said
Tuesday that while many of the maintenance problems appear to have
been resolved, some concerns persist.
   A three-month review of Eastern that ended last November ``shows
substantial progress has been made,'' Anthony Broderick, the FAA's
associate administrator for aviation standards, said in a statement
accompanying the report.
   ``However there are areas that need attention, including
maintenance procecures that identify repeated failures of the same
item,'' he said.
   Broderick also said that Eastern still must reduce the number of
postponed maintenance items carried over from day to day on
aircraft. And the FAA report noted that while Eastern's management
has improved manuals, operating specifiations and maintenance
inspection procedures, agency inspectors could not say for certain
``if (Eastern) is now complying with its (own) program and
procedures.''
   Eastern, in a statement from its Miami headquarters, noted that
the FAA report shows Eastern has take action to deal with 52 of the
53 areas of concern cited two years. The airline said the FAA's
latest review reflects attempts by the carrier to correct past
problems.
   ``Over the past two years, Eastern has concentrated on upgrading
the quality of its flight and maintenance performance,'' Phil
Bakes, Eastern's president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
   But a separate FAA report prompted questions among some members
of Congress about Eastern's recently announced plans in event of a
strike at the Miami-based airline.
   Eastern recently said it was leasing 26 of its jetliners to
Orion Air Lift Services Inc., a cargo carrier based in Raleigh,
N.C., and that in event of a strike Orion would fly some of
Eastern's routes using its own personnel.
   But a report issued by the FAA on Monday cast doubts on Orion's
safety record. The agency disclosed that it is preparing to take
enforcement action, including a civil penalty, against Orion for
past safety infractions.
   Government scrutiny of Orion documented ``a large number of
serious safety infractions'' including ``systematic difficulties''
with the use of operating and maintenance handbooks and training
programs, said Broderick, the FAA official.
   The infractions found at Orion ``are being corrected to prevent
similar occurrences in the future'' and the corrections ``permit
Orion to safely operate its cargo business,'' said Broderick in a
statment, although not specifically addressing the question of
whether Orion would be permitted to operate scheduled passenger
service.
   The FAA must approve such authority.
   During the hearings on Captitol Hill, Eastern was accused of
using Orion to break a possible strike.
   On the basis of the FAA report, Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill.,
chairwoman of the subcommittee, characterized Orion as ``an airline
in near shambles,'' including problems with pilots' and mechanics'
training, maintenance records and management.
   James L. Heffernan, an Orion vice president, told the
subcommittee that virtually all of the problems cited by the FAA
have been corrected.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators reached agreement Tuesday to end a
nine-day strike that has halted production at Ford Motor Co.'s 22
plants in Britain and cost the automaker more than $300 million,
company and union officials said.
   The deal will be submitted to Ford's 32,000 striking workers on
Thursday, and if approved, could allow the automaker to resume
production next Monday, officials said.
   The settlement came after Ford agreed to a two-year pact with
total minimum pay hikes of 14 percent, negotiators said. Ford
previously insisted on a three-year contract, which auto workers
opposed.
   Ford said it will guarantee full pay to union members who are
temporarily laid off. The company said it would not permanently
terminate any worker who does not volunteer to leave.
   The agreement also stipulates that work-rule changes would be
decided at the plant level instead of being imposed by management,
said Mick Murphy, chief negotiator for the 12 unions involved.
   The contract also provides for increased pension benefits and an
improved health plan.
   ``We see it as a truly historic victory, not only for Ford
workers but for trade unionists up and down the country,'' Murphy
said after nine and a half hours of talks.
   The deal was called a ``potential victory for common sense'' by
John Hougham, chief negotiator for Ford Motor Co. Ltd., the British
subsidiary of the U.S. automaker.
   He denied that the automaker was pressured into the agreement by
its Detroit-based parent or Ford of Europe.
   The walkout, which was Ford's first strike in Britain in nearly
a decade, began Feb. 8, three days after contract talks broke down.
   Under terms of the agreement reached Tuesday, weekly wages for
an assembly worker making a basic 184 pounds, or $320, will
increase to 197 pounds, or $343 in the first year of the new
contract, negotiators said.
   Talks to provide the same benefits for hourly and white-collar
workers will be completed within two years, the company said.
   ``I do believe the company will get the changes (in work
practices) it wants,'' Murphy said. ``But they will get them under
the circumstances when they will carry the workforce with them.''
   ``There will be cooperation to bring about the changes we
need,'' Hougham said.
   The strike prompted the layoff of more than 9,700 workers and
disrupted production at a Ford plant in Genk, Belgium, which
suffered a shortage of British-made parts.
   The strike has cost Ford 23 million pounds, or about $40 million
a day, the automaker has estimated.
   Ford's British workers last walked out for nine weeks in 1978.

   Sales of existing homes held steady in 1987 at
close to 4 million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the
October stock market collapse, a national real estate trade group
reported Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing
single-family homes and condominiums totaled 3.885 million units
last year, down a slight 0.3 percent from the 1986 level of 3.897
million units. Sales in both years were the fastest pace of this
decade.
   Alaska and Lousisiana, two states which had suffered a big slump
in sales because of depressed energy industries, enjoyed a rebound
last year, leading the country along with Massachusetts with the
largest percentage gains.
   Meanwhile, the average price of an existing home rose to a
nationwide median of $84,300 at the close of last year, an increase
of 5.1 percent in 1987, slightly ahead of the rise in consumer
prices, the association said.
   New York City and Boston maintained their rankings as the most
expensive places to buy homes while Providence, R.I., and Hartford,
Conn., had the biggest percentage price gains out of 53
metropolitan areas surveyed.
   The median price of an existing home averaged $180,800 in New
York City and $178,600 in Boston during the final three months of
the year. At the other end of the scale, the most affordable
housing was in Des Moines, Iowa, where the median sales price was
$52,000.
   The Northeast, which has been a hot real estate market for
several years, had the four top cities in terms of percentage price
increases. Home prices were up 32.2 percent in Providence, 21.7
percent in Hartford, 20 percent in Washington, D.C., and 18.2
percent in Albany, N.Y.
   Fourteen cities in the survey, concentrated in depressed energy
and farm areas of the country, saw home prices decline during 1987.
The biggest price drop was 7.2 percent in Houston followed by a 5.6
percent decline in Oklahoma City.
   In all, 22 states enjoyed sales increases in 1987, led by a 26.2
percent surge in sales in Alaska and identical increases of 18.8
percent in Louisiana and Massachusetts. Alaska and Lousiana were
both rebounding from big sales declines in 1986 while the
Massachusetts increase followed a sizable 1986 advance.
   Also enjoying big gains were Georgia, with an 18.5 percent
increase and North Dakota and Maine, with advances of 17.9 percent
and 14.3 percent respectively.
   ``The Northeast continues as the strongest region but we saw
considerable strength in the South and Midwest, two areas which had
been lagging the rest of the country,'' said John Tucillo, chief
economist for the realtors group.
   Twenty-two states suffered sales declines last year, led by a
13.8 percent drop in Washington state. Sales fell off 13.3 percent
in Virginia, followed by declines of 9.7 percent in both Maryland
and Oklahoma. Sales were off 9.5 percent in the District of
Columbia.
   Analysts said that one factor which pushed up 1986 sales was a
last-minute rush to close sales and reap capital gains profits
before the new tax law took effect on Jan. 1, 1987.
   Tuccillo predicted that price increases nationwide should be
lower than the 5.1 percent rise in 1987 with sales expected to
decline by around 8 percent, in part because of slower economic
growth.
   Tuccillo predicted that the Northeast will continue to have the
highest home prices of any region, but he said the rate of increase
should slow.
   ``A leveling off is occurring after a long period of overheated
activity,'' he said. ``The losses incurred by those in the New York
financial community are still having a lagging effect on home
buying in that area.''

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Fall As Freeze Fears Fade</HEAD>

   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices fell sharply
Tuesday as warmer weather moved into Florida's orange-grove country
and melted fears of a freeze.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly higher;
grains and soybeans were mixed; precious metals were lower; energy
futures retreated; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Forecasts late last week for cold weather in Florida had some
orange juice traders on the New York Cotton Exchange worried but
the orange crop escaped freeze damage, said Judy Ganes, an analyst
in New York for the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Rich Cantor of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc., said last
weekend may have held the season's last threat of a freeze.
   ``Florida escaped what may have been one of its last cold spells
from a seasonal perspective,'' Cantor said. ``People may have seen
that and sold it off.''
   Ms. Ganes also noted a widening of the gap between prices for
near-term and deferred delivery. The March contract settled 2.40
cents lower at $1.661 a pound, more than 5 cents higher than the
settlement price for May delivery.
   The pattern indicated concerns about tight supplies for
immediate delivery, she said.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in position-evening in front of the Agriculture
Department's monthly seven-state cattle-on-feed report.
   The report, issued after the close, showed an 8 percent increase
during January in the number of a cattle being fattened for
slaughter.
   The total of more than 7.85 million head on feed was greater
than most analysts had expected, which could drive cattle futures
lower on Wednesday, said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago for
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   However, the report also showed 1.66 million head placed on
feedlots during January and 1.76 million head removed from feedlots
to be slaughtered.
   Stanley said those numbers indicated supplies and demand for fed
cattle were running close to even, which should limit any downward
move in prices.
   ``I think the near-term bias for the markets shouldn't be too
affected,'' Stanley said. ``The feedlots are current and the
near-term supply side of this market is doing just fine.''
   Live cattle settled .22 cent to .50 cent higher with February at
71.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .33 cent higher
with March at 83.37 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .40 cent
higher with February at 47.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .42 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 55.70 cents
a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures closed lower while wheat finished
mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices were pressured by a variety of factors, including
speculative profit-taking, increased farmer selling on cash markets
and improved soybean growing conditions in South America.
   Corn futures also retreated on profit-taking and farmer selling,
analysts said.
   Most wheat contracts advanced on rumors the Soviet Union was set
to buy at least 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   After the close, the USDA announced it had sold 16.1 million
bushels of surplus wheat Friday at its weekly auction. The USDA had
said it expected to sell 25 million bushels, and it set a target of
25 million bushels for this Friday's auction.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents lower to 3{ cents higher with March at
$3.31 a bushel; corn was 1\ cent to 2} cents lower with March at
$1.98\ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to 12 cents higher with
March at $1.91} a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8{ cents lower
with March at $6.20{ a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures retreated slightly in quiet trading on
the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Jack Barbanel, an analyst in New York for Gruntal & Co., said
the gold market was poised at a crossroads formed by opposing ideas
about the future of the U.S. economy.
   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.10 lower with April at $447.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 1.5 cents lower with March at
$6.375 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures dipped slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in light, technically-based trading, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 25 cents
lower with March at $16.67 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to
.32 cent lower with March at 46.37 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .14 cent lower to .01 cent higher with March at 46.29
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures moved higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 3.30 points higher at 262.20. The
underlying spot index closed up 2.19 points at 259.82.

   California First Bank, which is controlled
by the Bank of Tokyo Ltd., said Tuesday that it has agreed to
acquire Union Bank in a deal valued at around $750 million.
   The transaction represents the largest investment ever by a
Japanese bank in a California financial institution, said Dan
Williams, an analyst for Sutro & Co. Inc. in San Francisco.
   ``They're getting close to being a major California bank,'' he
said.
   The deal will more than double the size of Cal First to a total
of $15.2 billion in assets with 167 California offices, making it
the state's fifth largest commercial bank. Los Angeles-based Union
currently is fifth, trailing Bank of America, Security Pacific,
Wells Fargo and First Interstate.
   Seishichi Itoh, president and chief executive officer of Cal
First, said the bank had signed a letter of intent to acquire Union
from London-based Standard Chartered PLC.
   Bank of Tokyo owns 77 percent of California First, known until
several years ago as Bank of Tokyo of California.
   California First spokesman Mike Colwell said the merger makes
``a good match'' because Union is a major business bank and Cal
First mainly serves individual consumers.
   However, Standard & Poor's Corp. was critical of the deal and
placed its credit ratings of all Cal First, Bank of Tokyo and Union
Bancorp of California on its ``CreditWatch'' list. S&P noted Union
Bank's narrowing margins and high overhead expenses and said
``these concerns are exacerbated by Bank of Tokyo's relatively
large exposure to sovereign borrowers with payment difficulties.''
   The merger is part of a growing interest among the Japanese in
U.S. financial firms.
   Last year, Nippon Life Insurance Co. invested $500 million in
Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc, and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. completed a
similarly sized investment in Goldman Sachs & Co. Also last year, a
group of Japanese banks and insurance companies purchased $350
million in BankAmerica Corp. securities.

<HEAD>Board Of Trade Votes For New Limits On Some Index Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade voted
Tuesday to reduce daily price limits for Major Market Index futures
to 20 points and Institutional Index futures to 12 points.
   The changes will become effective only if approved by the
federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   A 20-point move in the Major Market Index or a 12-point move in
the Institutional Index represents roughly 5 percent of the
indexes' present levels.
   In recommending the move, CBOT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said
the new limits would be more consistent with those in effect on
stock index futures traded at other exchanges.
   Last month, the CBOT set permanent daily price limits on its
stock index futures in an attempt to curb trading volatility that
some critics say worsened the October stock market crash.

   A Toronto-based real estate company launched a
$245 million offer Tuesday for up to 14 million shares of Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp., adding another chapter to the complicated
fight for control of Santa Fe.
   The offer by Olympia & York Developments Ltd., which works out
to $17.50 a share, would boost Olympia & York's stake in Santa Fe
to 19.9 percent.
   Olympia & York, which had control of 10.5 percent of the
railroad and natural resources company, is challenging a plan by
Henley Group Inc. of La Jolla, Calif., to wage a proxy fight for
control of Santa Fe.
   ``I think Olympia & York are trying to make sure they have a
controlling position in the company,'' said Isabel Benham, an
analyst at Printon, Kane In New York.
   Henley Group is Santa Fe's largest shareholder with 15.7
percent. It plans to wage a proxy fight in opposition to Santa Fe's
proposed $4.7 billion restructuring plan, which was seen as an
effort to stop Henley's advances.
   Olympia & York supported the restructuring, and its
representatives have been nominated to two seats on the Santa Fe
board.
   Santa Fe, which has about 156.2 million shares outstanding, said
it has been informed of Olympia & York's tender offer but had no
comment, spokesman Richard Hall said.
   Norm Ritter, a spokesman for Henley Group, said company Chairman
Michael Dingman was ``pleased with the move,'' but he would not
elaborate.
   Under the restructuring plan, Santa Fe shareholders would
receive $25 in cash and $5 in subordinated debentures per share.
   Henley has said the debentures are another effort by Santa Fe to
prevent a takeover, and is challenging them in court. Ritter said a
Delaware Chancery Court has set Feb. 26 as the date for a
preliminary hearing on the issue.
   A debenture is a debt repayable within a specified time and
bearing a fixed rate of interest which must be paid whether or not
the company issuing it makes a profit.
   The Olympia & York offer, which expires at midnight March 13,
hinges on payment by Santa Fe of a special dividend, the cash part
of which the company said it paid Tuesday, with the debenture
payment set for March 1.
   Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing the effects of
the restructuring plan, said it downgraded the securities ratings
of Santa Fe and its subsidiaries, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway, and Southern Pacific Co.
   Moody's said the downgrade was based on the ``substantial
weakening in the parent's debt-protection measurements because of a
recent corporate restructuring.''
   About $1.4 billion of securities are affected.
   ``The dividend, which will result in an outlay of approximately
$3.9 billion, will be funded primarily through proceeds from asset
sales, the senior subordinated debentures and bank debt,'' Moodys
said.
   ``This outlay will substantially reduce the firms' equity, and
the additional $4.6 billion of debt will radically increase
leverage.''
   The New York-based rating agency said Santa Fe's ability to
generate cash flow to meet maturing obligations depends primarily
on an aggressive real estate divestiture program.
