   Three years ago, it was hard to turn on the
radio without hearing Joan Jett pound it out, or Madonna whine or
Cyndi Lauper tell us that girls just like to have fun. Women had a
dominant role in the rock scene.
   However, at this year's Grammy Awards, to be presented on March
2 at Radio City Music Hall, female rockers are an extinct breed:
There's no category, as there has been in the past, for ``best rock
vocal performance, female.''
   The Grammys have separate categories for men and women singers
in pop and rhythm 'n' blues. The rock category combines them this
year. Tina Turner, the grandmother of rock who was named best
female rock vocalist last year, is nominated along with Richard
Marx, Bob Seger, Bruce Springsteen and Joe Cocker.
   Al Schlesinger, president of the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences, said NARAS has a rule that the 6,000 industry
professionals who are members must nominate 10 different people in
a category for that category to exist.
   The screening committee listens to each nomination and decides
whether it has been nominated in the right place. If it isn't, it's
moved to where the committee decides it belongs.
   ``Record company executives will always try and enter things in
smaller categories where there's less competition,'' Schlesinger
said. ``We don't accept that.
   ``If we don't end up with 10 nominations in a category, rather
than having insufficient competition, we fold that category into
another one. It doesn't happen often.''
   Another rule, which RCA executive Dennis Fine unsuccessfully
fought this year, is that the rock vocal performance nominations
must be from solo albums; lead singers of groups aren't eligible.
   ``Grace Slick's `Babylon' is a rock 'n' roll track and a great
solo on a Starship album. Unless she does her own solo album, it's
not considered a solo,'' Fine said. ``It all depends on how a
record is billed. It's not fair. Sade is considered to be a group.
The screening committee eliminated Patty Smythe and Cyndi Lauper
from rock in the past. They determined they were pop.''
   During the decade, performers such as Tina Turner, Madonna,
Cyndi Lauper, Sheena Easton, Laura Branigan, Joan Jett, Pat
Benatar, Annie Lennox, Chaka Khan, Donna Summer, Debbie Harry and
Grace Jones took rock in new directions with their strong images
and hot music.
   Are these same female rockers _ and others _ suddenly in short
supply? The answer to that depends on who you ask. Bob Guccione Jr.
thinks there are lots; Bill Graham thinks there are few.
   Guccione, publisher of Spin magazine, is incensed that the
female rock vocalist category was eliminated.
   ``This is literally a disservice to both males and females,'' he
said. ``I think, if anything, the last year to two years has
represented the emergence of the female rock superstar. It started
with Madonna and it's really just blossoming.
   ``My favorite is Maria McKee on `Wheels.' There were a lot of
great performances last year _ Grace Jones' `I May Not Be Perfect
But I'm Perfect for You,' Debbie Harry's `French Kissing in the
U.S.A.' Madonna is always to be considered. My perspective is that
this past year of all years, females performed better on the whole
than the males.''
   Graham, rock's best-known impresario, disagrees. ``It is an
irony and phenomenon of rock 'n' roll that there have been so few
women accepted commercially,'' he said. ``I really don't understand
why, other than the fact that the terminology of rock 'n' roll
sounds more masculine than feminine. The music has got a harder
edge sometimes.
   ``We have to generalize but a young rock 'n' roll male listener
may have a problem admitting that he's a fan of a female rock 'n'
roller, if his friends are into all-male groups. A woman rocker is
going to have to have that extra edge, so that he can't get that
song out of his head. Otherwise she'll lose.''
   However, in the '60s and early '70s, rock fans _ male and female
_ had no trouble following Janis Joplin and Grace Slick. Later,
male fans were just as enthusiastic as female fans at Joan Jett and
Pat Benatar concerts.
   But singer-songwriter Suzanne Vega, nominated for three Grammys
this year, including ``best pop vocal, female,'' agrees with Graham.
   ``When Rolling Stone ran its list of the Top 100 rock albums, I
noticed there were only about six women on this list,'' she said.
``Laura Nyro and Kate Bush have made brilliant albums but they
can't be considered rock 'n' roll.
   ``Rock 'n' roll is an aggressive, very male style of singing.
Some women fit into it naturally _ like Chrissie Hynde and Patty
Smythe. There are not many women, I think, who naturally take to
rock 'n' roll, but they do great music. I may have closet
tendencies in that direction, but I don't think of myself as a rock
'n' roller.''

   On Jan. 24, when the Allied Jewish Appeal of
Philadelphia mobilized for the year's biggest fund-raising event,
there was little reason to believe that ``Super Sunday'' would live
up to its name.
   The telephone solicitation campaign came at a disturbing moment
for many Jews in this country. They have watched with increasing
distress and horror as Palestinians rioted in Israel's occupied
territories, and Israeli soldiers retaliated with beatings and
bullets.
   Half of the money collected on ``Super Sunday'' would go to
Israel. Are American Jews so pained by Israel's actions that they
have become disaffected with the Jewish state, and unwilling to
make their customary donations?
   The answer is no. After the last pledge was counted, fund
raisers found they had collected $2.5 million, up $400,000 over the
1986 total.
   ``Israel is the Jewish homeland, the Jewish heart. No one can
live without a heart. They are rallying around the flag,'' said
Leonard Barrack, general chairman of the Philadelphia AJA.
   In city after city, fund raisers have reached the same
conclusion. In Miami, the total collected Jan. 24 was $2.6 million,
up $1 million from last year's figures; in Cincinnati it was
$360,000, up about $50,000; in Rhode Island it was $187,167, up
about $25,000.
   ``Wanting to see your kids work on a kibbutz, wanting to plant
trees in Israel, wanting a Jewish state _ these things are not
affected by political events,'' said Steven M. Cohen, a professor
of sociology at Queens College and leading Jewish demographer.
   But there is no question that many American Jews are anguished
by reports of Israeli soldiers beating Palestinians, burying them
alive, shooting them in street warfare reminiscent of Beirut. And
some have spoken out.
   ``As a supporter of Israel ... I am appalled beyond measure by
the treatment of the rioting Palestinians by the Jews,'' wrote
filmmaker Woody Allen, in a recent op-ed piece in The New York
Times.
   ``I mean, fellas, are you kidding? Beatings of people by
soldiers to make examples of them? Breaking the hands of men and
women so they can't throw stones? Dragging civilians out of their
houses at random to smash them with sticks in an effort to
terrorize a population into quiet?''
   Since early December, stone-throwing Palestinian protesters have
challenged Israel's army, demanding an end to its occupation of the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan River, territories
seized by Israel in its wars with the Arabs. More than 50 Arabs
have been killed by Israelis in the rioting.
   Time magazine polled American Jews last month and found that 57
percent opposed the use of force and beatings on Arabs. A
Palestinian homeland was opposed only by a small margin _ 39
percent in favor, 42 percent opposed.
   Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun magazine, a self-styled leftist
alternative to Commentary that is based in Oakland, Calif.,
describes the Israeli occupation as ``immoral and stupid.''
   ``We did not survive the gas chambers of Europe in order to
become the oppressors of Gaza,'' Lerner writes in an upcoming
editorial.
   Tikkun has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by calls and letters
from American Jews who are outraged by what is happening in the
Middle East, Lerner said. ``There has been unbelievable change,''
he says.
   ``It used to be that the rule was, `There is no room for
criticism.' Now, the only issue is where do you say it. Do you say
it to the press, or do you say it to your friends?'' the editor
says.
   That has been a major issue. Jewish leadership has been divided;
some leaders denounce others who have gone public with their
criticism _ those like Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the leader of the
Reform movement who described the beatings as an ``offense to the
Jewish spirit.''
   ``The criticism by American Jews of Israel _ I've termed it
despicable,'' said Rabbi Avi Weiss, a leader of Americans for a
Safe Israel. He deplores those who criticize from ``plush living
rooms in Manhattan.''
   ``These are not protesters. These are rioters who are out there
with the intent to maim, to wound and to murder,'' Weiss says.
   A Newsday poll of New York Jews found that 47 percent thought
American Jews should speak out to influence Israel _ and 47 percent
felt they should keep their views to themselves.
   Congregants say Rabbi Jehiel Orenstein of Congregation Beth El
of South Orange and Maplewood, N.J., recently took the pulpit to
discuss the creation of a Palestinian state. But when a reporter
asked Orenstein to confirm his remarks, the rabbi was evasive.
   ``American Jews should not be the critics of Israel because
they're standing on the front lines and we're at a distance,''
Orenstein said.
   But Orenstein indicated that he was uneasy with the growing
influence of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the American-born member of the
Knesset who proposes expelling the Arabs from Israel and its
occupied territories.
   And he recounted that when news of the beatings spread, he told
his congregation, ``It cannot be the policy of Israel to break arms
and legs and pull people from their beds and terrorize them.''
   Some say Israel does not deserve the infamy that is coming its
way.
   ``We cannot give the impression that we're satisfied to have
hands broken,'' says Arnold Lasker, a retired rabbi living in
Margate, Fla. ``But the breaking of bone, which is a horrible
thing, has to be seen in context'' _ as a tiny aspect of a decent,
democratic Israel.
   Many agree that the context is missing _ that the news media
have distorted events in Israel, either by exaggerating the force
applied by the Israelis or by neglecting to focus on Arab
provocations.
   And there is the question of whether Israel should be held to a
higher standard than other nations. Even Orenstein asks, ``Is
anybody asking the United States to give back Texas?''
   Elaine W. Charny, a 52-year-old former teacher who lives in the
Philadelphia suburb of Jenkintown, Pa., feels that a higher
standard is justified. ``Israel represents a certain bright hope
and ideal,'' she says.
   She says it is the ``moral responsibility'' of Jews around the
world to speak out on Israeli issues; she cringes when she reads
the headlines these days. ``We're all hoping and praying that they
can find a better way of solving this problem,'' she says.
   Mrs. Charny and her husband buy Israeli Bonds; they have visited
Israel three times. However saddened by recent events, Mrs. Charny
does not envision a day when Israel will lose its appeal.
   ``It's an idea,'' she says. ``The idea that it's there for all
of us, kind of like a little utopia. It's just a vision.''

   The South Korean press is enjoying a
broad degree of freedom after years of tough official control, but
opposition quarters maintain it still is manipulated by the
government's ``hidden hands.''
   Nevertheless, the nation's newspapers are reporting and
commenting more vigorously on politics and other subjects that for
years had been limited or banned by the government.
   President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who takes office Feb. 25, promises
to ensure full press freedom and made it a key point in his
election campaign. The government began easing press restrictions
last summer under pressure from Roh.
   ``We have done much and there should be nothing to complain
about,'' said Lee Jung-bai, the assistant culture-information
minister.
   Journalists agree the government has abandoned most controls on
the domestic press, such as regular visits to newspapers by
security agents and the issuance of ``press guidelines'' that
dictated what could be reported and in what way.
   Government reguirements on registration of journalists have been
dropped and new legislation will end limits on newspapers having
news bureaus outside their headquarters locations. There also will
be no limits on the number of pages a newspaper can publish.
   ``The ball is in the court of the news media. It's up to them,''
said Rep. Lee Min-sup, a ranking member of Roh's Democratic Justice
Party.
   Opposition politicians and dissidents contend, however, that
much of the press still remains under government control through
``hidden hands.''
   Rep. Kim Tae-ryong, spokesman for the main opposition
Reunification Democratic Party, said, ``No basic changes have been
made and the press still is no more than a public relations tool of
the government.''
   The opposition claims the government exerts behind-the-scenes
influence and control, ranging from intimidation to patronage and
bribery. They also contend the media is packed with government
supporters.
   Rep. Ahn Dong-sun, spokesman for the opposition Party for Peace
and Democracy, claimed journalists are practicing self-censorship.
   Kim Tae-hong, secretary-general of the dissident Council for
Democratic Press Movement, said, ``Essentially, Roh is the same as
his dictatorial predecessor. He would not give in easily. We must
continue to fight for press freedom.''
   Several editors and reporters rejected the opposition charges of
self-censorship, but said they want to help ensure ``sound
political development'' without endangering social stability.
   One senior editor, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
many journalists are cautious because ``they suspect the true
intention of the government.''
   The opposition claims the country's two networks, which are
state-owned, project only a government viewpoint and that opposing
points of view receive little attention or are distorted.
   A Korea Broadcasting System (KBS) spokesman, Lim Ung-shik,
rejected the opposition's charges.
   ``Our news and other programs are fair by any standard,'' he
said.
   Lim said KBS has recently started some new programs, including
talk shows to which opposition figures are regularly invited.
   Government officials say the criticism the networks may end
after a neutral broadcasting committee is set up in June, as
required by a new law, to nominate the heads of the two networks.
Some opposition lawmakers will be appointed to serve on the
committee to ensure fairness.
   The government is also preparing to inaugurate in March a new
press law that would drop a requirement for government approval to
start new newspapers or periodicals.
   Seven newspapers have so far applied to start publishing under
the new law. South Korea now has 20 national daily newspapers with
an estimated combined circulation of 12 million.
   The first beneficiary of the new law would be a newspaper that
some 200 dissident journalists plan to publish this spring with
support from 3,300 sponsors, including 1,000 college professors,
100 lawyers, 200 religious leaders and 200 literary figures.
   Song Kun-ho, president of the newspaper, The Hankyoreh Shinmun,
said the project will be started with 5 billion won ($6.8 million)
to be raised through public shares. Song said 15,000 people have so
far responded, contributing about half of the needed money.
   Song and the other journalists, dismissed from their previous
jobs on grounds of anti-government activity, said their newspaper
would emphasize human rights and spearhead press freedom.
   The influential Roman Catholic Church also has announced it will
start a newspaper in April and set up a nationwide radio network in
September.
   Critics of the government contend the new press law is
restrictive because it stipulates that new newspapers must use
certain kinds of presses that cost millions of dollars. They
contend this would keep control of the press in the hands of
establishment groups.

   Cafe owner Yosef Weizman said when
Israeli police beat up his Arab workers three days ago, he
understood the depth of distrust between Jews and Arabs after
months of clashes in the occupied territories.
   Eli Ben-Simon, 38, had learned the lesson a few days earlier.
Ben-Simon, a Jew, was beaten up in an industrial area near Tel Aviv
because, he said, his Israeli attackers thought he was an Arab.
   Growing numbers of Palestinians who work in and around this
coastal city of 1.5 million people are subject to harassment,
primarily by Israelis made suspicious by the unprecedented fury and
violence of Arabs opposing Israel's 20-year occupation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arab harassment is leading to a climate of fear among
Palestinians and concern among many Israelis.
   City officials estimate about 40,000 Arabs work in the Tel Aviv
metropolitan area. There are also about 10,000 Arabs with Israeli
citizenship who live in the area.
   ``This incident ... is, of course, linked to the unrest in the
territories,'' Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev said in a statement of
the beating of Weizman's workers.
   ``I am afraid the situation in the territories is having a bad
influence on the morals and values of the rest of Israeli
society,'' he added.
   One of the four beaten Arabs, 20-year-old Maysara Al-Ijela of
Gaza, told The Jerusalem Post that police entered an apartment
shared by nine Arab workers Friday and ``did not say anything at
first. They just started to hit us with their hands and
walkie-talkies, and also kick us.''
   ``One policeman said `You are smelly Arabs. You go home, throw
stones at Jews and afterward return here to work,''' Al-Ijela told
the daily Hadashot.
   Weizman, owner of the Shelly Cafe in Dizengoff Center, said
after his workers were beaten, he moved them out of their apartment
into a hotel and promised to find them a new, safe place to live.
   ``Three of them ... said no thanks and quit,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``The police said they went into the apartment
because they thought the Arabs were organizing something, but that
is ridiculous. It's just Israeli suspicion of Arabs.''
   ``I guess the police had a right to go into that apartment. But
the way they handled it was very bad. I need those workers.''
   One Israeli, Dalit Laub, witnessed the beatings when she walked
past the Arabs' first-floor apartment and glanced in the window.
   ``It was really violent. But I was afraid to get involved ... I
thought of calling the police _ but they were the police,'' she
told Hadashot.
   City Hall was reluctant to get involved.
   ``The problem of beating Arabs has to be taken care of by the
police because it is a criminal issue,'' city spokesman Shabtai
Sheval told the AP.
   He refused to say how many incidents involving Arabs were
reported in Tel Aviv over the last month.
   Police said they were investigating and legal action would be
taken if the allegations were found to be correct, police
spokeswoman Shlomit Herzberg told the AP.
   Police also were investigating the incident involving Ben-Simon,
who was beaten senseless and left on a street.
   He was driving to work on Feb. 12 when two Israelis flagged him
down.
   ``I thought they needed help, but when I stopped, one of them
shouted, `Here's an Arab maniac!,''' Ben-Simon told the Post. ``I
said, `Hey guys, what's going on? I'm not an Arab.'''
   His protestations did no good. Ben-Simon saw the license plate
number of the car as the two sped away, but he couldn't pick
himself up.
   An Arab worker helped Ben-Simon off the street and he was taken
to a hospital, where his head was stitched.
   Israeli newspapers reported the first case of harassment about a
month ago. An Arab youth said he was picked up on a Tel Aviv street
by two men who identified themselves as police, taken to a garbage
dump and beaten.
   Some harassment has come from Arab militants. City Hall
spokesman Benny Cohen said more than 100 Arab workers left their
jobs in Tel Aviv's Yermiyahu restaurant district last week after
their lives and families were threatened if they disobeyed calls
from Palestinian activists to stay home.
   There have been cases of alleged discrimination, as well. One
Palestinian said he was turned away from a popular Tel Aviv
discotheque. Another complained in an Israel TV interview he was
barred ``for security reasons'' from taking a small craft flight
with his two children.
   One Gazan working in a Tel Aviv restaurant gave a statement to
The Jerusalem Post last week on condition that his name not be
used. He said he was saving money to get married.
   ``But now, I get this message saying `Stop working for the Jews,
stop working for the oppressors,' and I have to make up my mind,''
he told the Post. ``Most of the others have gone. They don't want
anything to happen to them or their families. For me, it is also
dangerous.''

   The turban of Darshan Singh, a
12-year-old Sikh, was half burned from the heat of the mud oven
where he hid to escape death.
   But the killers _ Sikhs themselves _ yanked him out, and he died
in a burst of gunfire. The boy, his elder brother and their father
all died in the courtyard of the village of Fattu Bheela, home of
2,000 Sikhs.
   It was one more case of Sikhs killing Sikhs. Never before in the
radicals' six-year campaign for an independent homeland have the
killers turned their guns so relentlessly on people of their own
minority faith.
   Of the 283 deaths blamed on Sikh militants this year in the
Sikh-dominated northern state of Punjab, at least 169 victims were
Sikhs. On Friday and Saturday, 31 people died in attacks, at least
20 of them Sikhs.
   ``The militants want the message to go deep _ that they will not
only kill those who oppose them, but even those who refuse to
support them,'' said the Amritsar district police superintendent,
Mohammed Izhar Alam.
   Harbhajan Kaur, Darshan's mother, told of the attack last week
in the village 18 miles north of Amritsar, the Sikh holy city and
heart of the radical campaign.
   She said she was wounded but because of fear, no neighbor came
to help.
   ``I was laying in my courtyard the whole night, bleeding,'' she
said from her hospital bed.
   The Sikh campaign began with attacks on Hindus, India's
religious majority but a minority in Punjab. Last year, most of the
1,000 victims of Sikh radicals were Hindus.
   The radicals allege economic and cultural domination by Hindus
and want an independent homeland for their 16 million people. But
theories vary considerably on Sikh guns are now aiming at Sikhs.
   ``Most of the men killed are either former terrorists or
harborers and their families who now refuse to give shelter to the
militants,'' said S.S. Virk, deputy director general of the
paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force.
   The killers themselves claim all Sikh victims are police
informers or enemies of the 500-year-old faith, founded as an
alternative to the beliefs of warring Moslems and Hindus.
   ``We shed the blood of only enemies, not of innocents or passive
people,'' said Giani Jagir Singh, spokesman for the Panthic
Committee, an umbrella group that controls the Sikh movement.
   ``Write it down,'' he commanded during an interview in a bare,
windowless room in the Sikhs' Golden Temple. ``I have led half a
dozen attacks myself and in every case, we killed only police
informers.''
   Why are Sikh women and children also killed?
   ``Have you heard of an old Punjabi saying _ when you grind wheat
to get flour, some millets also get crushed?'' said Singh, 45, a
large man with flowing beard.
   Dewan Singh, a police detective in Amritsar, said in most cases
the killers wipe out all witnesses because they are recognized by
the victims' families. In 19 of the 25 cases he analyzed, the
victims knew the killers.
   In each of the 19 cases, police found half-emptied glasses of
milk or sarbat, sweetened water with lemon, which were believed
served to the assailants.
   Rarely did the killers have to force their entry, Dewan Singh
said.
   Such was the case with the family of Darbar Kaur, 50, in the
village of Khera Bala-Chak near Kathunangal.
   ``Five Sikh boys came and asked for my younger son, Surjeet. He
opened the door and asked his wife to heat up some milk for the
visitors,'' Mrs. Kaur said.
   ``After a few minutes they fired at Surjeet,'' She said.
Surjeet, her husband, another son, and a 4-year-old granddaughter
were killed, while Mrs. Kaur and her daughter-in-law hid behind a
bolted kitchen door.
   Surjeet had been arrested in July for illegally possessing a
firearm and was believed to be a member of the radical group Babbar
Khalsa. He was freed on bail Jan. 1.
   ``He was not a police informer, but he was required under bail
provision to report to the police station once a week,'' said
Kathunangal police officer Subba Singh. ``So his former associates
drew the conclusion that Surjeet had turned informer.''
   Singh, responsible for maintaining order in 70 villages with a
population of 200,000, said Surjeet was afraid he might be killed.
But he said the police don't have the resources to protect everyone.
   The killers often leave behind a note written on the stationery
of Khalistan, the name of their unborn Sikh nation. The letters
sometimes even carry reference numbers, such as the A-159 on one
left where 12-year-old Darshan Singh died.
   ``They are our death warrants. `A' Stands for Akal (the immortal
throne of the Sikh faith) and the police informer to be killed was
159 on our list,'' explained Giani Jagir Singh, the militant
spokesman.
   He left no doubt that more death warrants could be expected.
   ``If any of the men on the hit list die a natural death, we will
consider it as a great insult to our faith,'' he said.

   Outspoken former Gov. Dick Lamm is back in the

   ``You can make fun of television. I sometimes do,'' Lamm said in
a recent interview. But he quickly added that polls show more than
70 percent of the public's political information comes from TV.
   ``It's sad but true, we've gone from town hall America to
airwaves America,'' he said. ``How many senators are more powerful
than John Chancellor?''
   Denver's KMGH-TV, which is running Lamm's commentaries during
its news programs on Tuesdays and Thursdays, says that if Lamm gets
too controversial, it will add a ``counterpoint'' speaker for
balance.
   ``All they told me is there are seven words you can't use on
television. I didn't even ask what they are,'' Lamm said.
   Lamm, a Democrat, has made a cause of pointing out the
pessimistic aspects of the high cost of medical care, earning
himself the nickname ``Governor Gloom.''
   Lamm also is a professor at the University of Denver, and says
he may run for the U.S. Senate in two years.

   Roger J. Williams, recognized as one of the
world's foremost authorities on nutrition, died Saturday at age 94.
   Williams was a professor emeritus at the University of Texas.
His work in nutrition at the UT Clayton Foundation Biochemical
Institute, which he founded, led to the discovery of more vitamins
and their variants than at any other research facility in the world.
   One of Williams' most significant accomplishments was the
discovery and isolation of pantothenic acid, one of the ``universal
vitamins'' required by all living cells and essential to life.
Later he discovered and named folic acid, a substance used by every
cell in the body.
   Williams wrote a book on ``biochemical individuality,'' a
concept that no two people are exactly alike physiologically and
therefore everyone has different nutritional requirements. He
retired in 1985.

<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms have
been formulated and explained sufficiently to the Soviet people,
and now it's time to ``start taking action,'' Moscow's top
economist says.
   Abel G. Aganbegyan also said there are ``painful and difficult''
days ahead for the Soviet Union under ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's
wholesale restructuring of the stagnant economy, and that
bureaucratic opposition to the reforms remains.
   Aganbegyan, the chief economic adviser to the Soviet leader and
an architect of perestroika, also said the average Soviet family
has yet to reap its benefits.
   ``A little bit more than two years have elapsed since we started
the process, the initial stage, where we are developing our
concepts, making our programs, trying to understand what's going
on, what has to be done, and a period during which we have to try
to convince people of the necessity undertaking these new
changes,'' he said.
   ``This period is now coming to an end. We are getting to a much
more critical stage, which is a stage where we have to start taking
action.''
   He and several of his colleagues on Monday outlined the history
and pitfalls of perestroika to a conference of economics students
and faculty at the New School for Social Research as part of an
U.S.-Soviet academic exchange program.
   Aganbegyan said the Soviet Union has ``only made the first
steps'' toward loosening the top-heavy central controls that have
driven the economy since the Stalin era and emphasized heavy
industry over consumer goods.
   ``In fact, most families have not really benefited from what's
been done so far,'' he said through a translator. ``We have to
accelerate the whole process so as to achieve a breakthrough in the
next two or three years so that everyone in the country will feel
he has a stake in the process.''
   In addition to consumer goods, the biggest Soviet economic
failures during the past 15 years were in housing, health care,
education and agriculture, he said.
   To remedy the problems, he cited modest increases in
construction of new apartments and budget increases for education
and medicine, including 30 percent salary increases for teachers,
doctors and some other health care workers. He did not say how the
military budget would be affected.
   He also singled out the planned overhaul the machine tool
industry, which will be ``the basis for the reconstruction of the
whole manufacturing sector.''
   ``In 1985, we were able to replace 3.1 percent of all our
machine tools. In 1987, 9 percent were replaced, and by 1990 we
hope to replace 13 percent of the machine tools yearly,''
Aganbegyan said. ``This is a painful and difficult process, but we
have to go through it. We haven't any other alternative.''
   Aganbegyan also cited the policies of ``khozrachyot,'' or
self-accounting, that went into effect Jan. 1. The law gives
state-run factories and firms more autonomy, with more emphasis on
profits and job performance.
   He said factories must go ``on a completely cost-accounting
basis, self-financing basis and self-administrating basis.''
   Gorbachev's policies of perestroika have come under ``a good
deal of opposition, however, from the people in the economic
administrative bureaucracies,'' in Moscow and in the Soviet Union's
15 republics, he said.
   ``We have reduced the staff and fired or eliminated 110,000 jobs
in the central and republican administrative apparatus,''
Aganbegyan said.
   The opposition has not been confined to the bureaucracy, said
another conference participant, Timur T. Timofeev.
   ``We cannot say that the whole working class 100 percent is for
Gorbachev,'' said Timofeev, director of the Institute of the
International Labor Movement of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   ``The new working class _ the younger generation, the
much-more-educated generation _ is really the leading force, the
dynamic force of perestroika,'' he said.
   Some Soviets ``are accustomed to the old ways of work,''
preferring less pay and less work.
   Aganbegyan acknowledged that the restructuring at many factories
and companies in the next 15 to 20 years will throw 16 million of
people out of work _ in a nation where the constitution provides
that everyone shall have a job.
   These people ``will therefore have to be retrained and given
additional jobs,'' he said. Special employment offices will be set
up to retrain them and find them work, he said.

   ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and two other Disney
Studios pictures remained in the box office Top 5 while the offbeat
romantic film ``Moonstruck'' capitalized on its Oscar nominations
to secure the No. 3 spot.
   ``Moonstruck'' seemed to lure moviegoers with its nominations,
but weekend receipts don't reflect an interest surge in other Oscar
contenders, including No. 9 ``The Last Emperor'' and No. 10
``Broadcast News.''
   ``The Last Emperor'' got the most Academy Award nominations last
week with nine, ``Broadcast News'' got seven and ``Moonstruck'' got
six.
   Disney-Touchstone awoke to a sixth week atop the box office heap
with ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' featuring best actor Academy Award
nominee Robin Williams as a raucous Saigon disc jockey, ringing in
nearly $7 million.
   Second in the studio's one-two turnstile punch was ``Shoot to
Kill,'' featuring Sidney Poitier in his first movie in nine years,
taking in $4.8 million in its second week of release.
   ``Moonstruck'' was a close third with $4.7 million last weekend
and ``Action Jackson'' took in $3.6 million in its second week to
place fourth.
   Meanwhile, the No. 5 spot was occupied by Disney-Touchstone's
``Three Men And A Baby'' which kept turnstiles spinning in its 12th
week of release with a $3.5 million take. The movie has made $136
million so far.
   The three Disney-Touchstone films have raked in $220 million for
the studio and its Buena Vista Pictures distribution arm, whose
senior vice president Dick Cook said simply: ``We are delighted
with these latest box office figures.''
   Universal's creepy ``The Serpent and the Rainbow'' brought in
$2.3 million for a drop to sixth in its second week of release. The
Kevin Bacon film ``She's Having a Baby'' was seventh with $2.1
million and Justine Bateman's ``Satisfaction'' was eighth with $1.7
million.
   ``The Last Emperor'' was ninth with $1.71 million in receipts
and ``Broadcast News,'' which got William Hurt, Holly Hunter and
Albert Brooks acting Oscar nominations, was 10th with $1.63 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release and estimated production costs.
   1. ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Disney-Touchstone, $6.88 million,
1,598 screens, $4,308 per screen, $71.4 million, eight weeks, $21

<HEAD>ITC Reverses Judge, Says Canon Innocent Of Monopoly Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge was wrong when he
ruled last year that Canon USA Inc. illegally monopolized the
domestic market for dry ink used in some office copying machines,
the U.S. International Trade Commission says.
   The commission, in a 6-0 ruling Monday, overturned Judge John J.
Mathias and terminated the investigation.
   Mathias had ruled in November that Canon, a copy machine giant,
had violated U.S. trade laws by unfairly disparaging independent
toner distributors. Aunyx Corp., a small toner producer based in
Hingham, Mass., had charged that Canon representatives were telling
customers that toner from competitors was ``pirate'' merchandise.
   ITC attorney Edwin J. Madaj Jr. said an opinion detailing why
the commission overturned the judge's decision will not be
available for at least several days. He declined to outline the
commission's reasoning.
   ``Naturally we're very disappointed,'' said Lorraine Hanley,
vice president for dealer sales at Aunyx. ``We don't know why the
commission voted this way.''
   Canon lawyers argued that corporate representatives did not make
disparaging remarks about independent competitors, and if they did,
``it was very minor stuff, the kind of competitive talk that is
normal in any industry where there are competitors,'' said
Washington attorney Harvey M. Applebaum.
   ``We have always said that we would be completely vindicated as
this case evolved,'' Canon USA President Fujio Mitarai said in a
statement from corporate headquarters in Lake Success, N.Y. ``This
decision makes clear that we were right on the law, on the facts
and in the way we market our products.''
   Aunyx has estimated that the toner market for copiers in
question is worth about $250 million annually, but Applebaum said
``that sounds to me very exaggerated.''
   The companies competed for sale of toner for certain types of
Canon copiers, mostly low- and medium-volume office machines.
   Aunyx President Robert Langone said last year that Canon had
about 99 percent of that market while Aunyx and other independent
toner dealers take between 20 percent and 50 percent of the toner
markets of other copying giants like Xerox and IBM.
   The Massachusetts company, which once had 85 employees, is down
to fewer than 30, Ms. Hanley said.
   Bart S. Fisher, an attorney representing Aunyx, said he would
appeal the ITC ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   A separate $300 million antitrust suit filed by Aunyx against
Canon is pending in U.S. District Court in Boston.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers hear a lot about the European Economic
Community's barriers to U.S. agricultural exports, but there is a
brighter side too.
   The Europeans, particularly French consumers, are developing as
an even larger market for U.S. food products.
   Overall, the 12-nation bloc took $6.8 billion of the $27.9
billion in U.S. farm exports in the 1987 fiscal year that ended
last Sept. 30, up 5 percent from 1986. A further gain to around $7
billion is expected this year.
   Despite the increase and prospects for further growth, U.S. farm
exports are still far below the record levels of the early 1980s.
Thus, every possibility is examined eagerly by USDA trade experts.
   The EEC ranks second only to Asia as a regional market for
American farmers. Japan, with U.S. farm imports of $5.55 billion
last year, is the largest single-country foreign market.
   A recent USDA report says, ``The time is right for U.S.
exporters to consider the French food market.''
   Last year France imported $495 million worth of agricultural
products from the United States, up from $435 million in 1986 and
$403 million in 1985. In the heyday of the early '80s, France
bought a peak of $625 million worth of U.S. food and raw
commodities.
   France is the largest country in Western Europe, with a
population of 55 million and an area of 213,000 square miles _
about four-fifths the size of Texas, says the report by the
department's Economic Research Service.
   ``Changing lifestyles _ more working women, urban rather than
rural life, eating lunch at work, and a greater standard of living
_ have led to changes in the food habits of the French people,''
the report said. ``They are consuming more processed products, like
canned food and precooked dishes.''
   For example, the report said, France's per capita consumption of
fresh vegetables held steady from 1967 to 1982 but the average use
of frozen vegetables rose from 0.5 pounds per capita to 6.6 pounds.
The consumption of canned vegetables jumped to 44 pounds per person
in 1982 from 24.9 pounds in 1967.
   ``According to the French Food Industry Association ANIA, there
have been dramatic changes in consumer spending patterns since
1960,'' the report said. ``The association's data show that the
French buy more pastries, cooked and preserved meats, cheese, ice
cream, cooked dishes, confectionery products and non-alcoholic
beverages as a percentage of their total budget.''
   Meanwhile, the report added, the share of family spending on
wine, bread, fruits and vegetables, and butter, has decreased.
   The analysis, prepared by Mark D. Newman and Victor H. Miesel
Jr., was included in the current National Food Review, a quarterly
magazine issued by the USDA agency.
   American goods compete with agricultural products from other EEC
member countries, which are generally admitted freely into France.
   ``However, specific products of high quality with unique
characteristics can find a place on the French market regardless of
barriers, exchange rates and competitive pressures,'' the report
said.

   China has bought an addition 405,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery in the 1987-88
marketing year, according to the Agriculture Department.
   The sales, equal to almost 14.9 million bushels, were handled by
five companies: Cargill Inc., 135,000 tons; Nichimen America Inc.,
35,000; Bunge Corp., 35,000; Continental Grain Co., 100,000; and
Artfer Inc., 100,000.
   William L. Davis, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said Monday the sales
were part of an authorized 1.2 million tons of wheat announced Feb.
5 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $2.76
per bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $41 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   China bought more than 4 million tons of wheat under previous
EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Davis said the bonuses due the five companies averaged $40.38
per ton, or about $1.10 per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be
paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   China has 495,000 tons remaining for use under the EEP
initiative announced on Feb. 5, he said.

<HEAD>Social Security Mailouts Affected January Surplus, December
Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government enjoyed a rare budget surplus
last month because Social Security checks for January were mailed
before the new year began.
   The Treasury Department said Monday that the surplus between
government spending and revenues jumped to $16.09 billion in
January, a sharp turnaround following a December deficit of $24.22
billion.
   Both months were influenced by Social Security, the government's
biggest benefits program. The government ended up making two
payments in December, the regular one and the January payment,
which was mailed on Dec. 31 because of the New Year's holiday.
   In January, government revenue totaled $81.79 billion, down 4.3
percent from December. Government spending was almost half the
December total, dropping to $65.71 billion in January, compared
with $109.74 billion the month before.
   The surplus was the first since September and only the second in
the past 16 months.
   For the first four months of the fiscal year, which began Oct.
1, the deficit totals $65.81 billion, down 0.7 percent from the
same period in the 1987 fiscal year.
   For the first four months of this fiscal year, government
revenues have totaled $286.66 billion, 5.5 percent higher than a
year ago. Government spending totaled $352.46 billion, an increase
of 4.2 percent over the same period a year ago.
   For all of 1988, the Reagan administration is projecting the
budget deficit will fall to $146.74 billion, down 2.5 percent from
last year's deficit of $150.4 billion.
   The Congressional Budget Office, using less optimistic
assumptions about economic growth this year, projects a 1988 budget
deficit of $157 billion, substantially above the target of $144
billion set in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   President Reagan sent Congress his budget recommendations for
1989 last Thursday, predicting a 1989 deficit of $129.5 billion.
   The largest spending categories in January were, as usual, the
military, followed by Social Security, other programs in the
Department of Health and Human Services and interest on the
national debt.
   Military spending totaled $19.23 billion last month and $93.52
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 6.5 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled just $652 million last
month and $70.14 billion for the past four months, up 4.6 percent
from a year ago.
   The other Health and Human Services programs, including Medicare
and Medicaid, spent $50.51 billion in January and $49.93 billion so
far this budget year, a 1.1 percent increase over 1987.
   Interest on the $2.2 trillion national debt totaled $14.67
billion last month and $75.77 billion so far this fiscal year, an
increase of 9.8 percent over the same period last year.
   For the 1988 fiscal year, interest payments on the debt are
expected to total $210.06 billion, accounting for 20 percent of
total federal spending.

<HEAD>Pentagon Disputes, Dirty Linen Aired in Navy Resignation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy Secretary James Webb's abrupt resignation
blew the lid off his split with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
and revealed bitter infighting at the Pentagon as it grapples with
budget cuts after years of Reagan-era increases.
   Webb resigned Monday and decided to air some dirty linen on the
way out, accusing Carlucci of needlessly sinking the
administration's dream of building a 600-ship fleet.
   He further accused Carlucci of ordering him to lie about
internal budget fighting, saying the defense chief had written him
a note saying he should deny news stories reporting it was the
Defense Department _ and not the Navy _ proposing to mothball ships.
   ``Now, I'm not going to deny the truth,'' Webb said.
   ``This building needs to be led. ... It needs some vision,'' he
continued. ``If I had a piece of advice to give to Secretary
Carlucci, it would be to spend a lot more time with the top leaders
in this building.
   ``He's been spending a lot of time with the State Department and
a lot of time on the (Capitol) Hill. I think they (Pentagon
leaders) need to feel his vision and to understand what he believes
in.''
   Carlucci declined to respond Monday, issuing a written statement
saying only that he learned of Webb's resignation ``with regret.''
   The Pentagon added in a separate statement, though, that if Webb
decided he could not ``defend the department's decisions'' on the
budget, then ``under the circumstances, he has done the honorable
thing.''
   An administration official who asked not to be identified said
Carlucci was recommending that William L. Ball III, the assistant
to the president for legislative affairs, be nominated to replace
Webb.
   The White House might announce Ball's nomination today at the
same time it formally accepts Webb's resignation, the source said.
   The 42-year-old Webb, a highly decorated Vietnam combat veteran
who earlier worked as an assistant defense secretary, said he had
been contemplating resignation for some time but didn't make up his
mind until Sunday.
   The final impetus, he said, was the submission to Congress last
week of the fiscal 1989 Pentagon budget. Carlucci shaped it without
regard to the advice of the Navy's top civilian and military
leadership, Webb said.
   ``I cannot support the reductions that are in this budget,'' he
said.
   The massive military buildup under President Reagan, which has
seen the Pentagon's budget more than double, is coming to a halt
because of concerns about the huge federal deficits run up during
the Reagan years.
   Carlucci, following up on a deficit-reduction agreement reached
by the White House and Congress in December, submitted a fiscal
1989 budget proposal totaling $299.5 billion, slightly more than
for fiscal 1988 but unlikely to cover inflation. It cuts the Navy's
original 1989 spending plan by $12.3 billion and calls for, among
other things, mothballing 16 older frigates.
   Those ships are at the heart of the dispute that erupted Monday.
Webb said they didn't have to be retired and that if they were, the
Navy could never reach its goal of deploying a 600-ship fleet. The
Pentagon maintains the Navy will end fiscal 1989 with 580 ships and
can still reach 600 by fiscal 1992.
   Reagan, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, and Webb's
predecessor, John F. Lehman, all have insisted that the Navy needs
a minimum of 600 warships to satisfy U.S. commitments around the
world without requiring overly long deployments.
   Webb, in his letter of resignation and in a meeting with
reporters, said he had provided Carlucci with three different plans
for cutting the necessary dollars without mothballing the ships. At
the very least, he said, the 16 frigates could be transferred to
the Naval Reserve at a cost of less than $100 million and stay on
standby.
   ``In each case, the advice of this senior (Navy) leadership,
concurred in by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was ignored,'' Webb
wrote.
   ``I can only conclude that the decision to reduce the level of
our fleet ... was motivated by other than military and strategic
reasoning.''
   Webb declined to say why he thought Carlucci had ignored his
advice.
   A ranking Pentagon official who asked not to be named, however,
said Defense Department executives for a time eyed the 16 frigates
as ships that could be offered for sale to Portugal at a cut rate.
Portugal wasn't interested, the source added.
   The administration is trying to find ways of increasing military
assistance to Portugal to preserve access to an air base on the
Azores Islands.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``Secretary
Carlucci is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the
Pentagon to accommodate budgetary reductions. Secretary Webb
indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints, but I
know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the
country.''
   Webb, who became Navy secretary 10 months ago after serving as
an assistant defense secretary under Weinberger, is an attorney and
the author of the best-selling Vietnam War novel ``Fields of
Fire.'' He said he probably would return to writing.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Covering the South, Airport to Satellite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They call it Super Tuesday. A better name might be
Tarmac Tuesday. Or maybe Satellite Tuesday.
   The Tuesday comes in two weeks, on March 8. What's super about
it is that the day will be the closest America has ever come to
holding a national primary election to select presidential nominees.
   Democratic and Republican nominees may not be decided then, but
the presidential landscape will be altered.
   Twenty of the 50 states hold primaries or caucuses, and they are
scattered from Massachusetts to Florida to Idaho. Yet Tuesday has a
distinctly Southern flavor. Fourteen of those 20 states are in the
South or border regions. Every state of the South save South
Carolina holds delegate contests that day _ and the Republicans in
South Carolina hold theirs three days earlier.
   To campaign across that vast expanse of country, the
presidential candidates have found agreement. The only way really
is for the candidate to wing his way to as many cities as possible
each day in an effort to get his face, and maybe even a few of his
words, on the local television news.
   No candidate, they reason, can buy enough television commercials
to carry 20 states in a two- to three-week campaign, although some
will try. So they aim for the ``free'' TV time.
   Hence Tarmac Tuesday. Many of the candidates are seeing no more
of the states or cities where they campaign than can be viewed from
the airports where they hold news conferences, or more often the
case, from the single event they hold not far from the airport.
   Then it's quickly off to the next event in the next ``media
market.'' They are ``press hits'' in the jargon of this campaign.
   ``Look for a lot of hits that are close to the airports,'' said
Ed Reilly, a polltaker and strategist for one of the Democrats,
Richard Gephardt. ``You look for your opportunities within 20
minutes from the airports, so you can get back and on to the next
one.''
   Quick campaign stops are nothing new to presidential campaigns.
But it's hardly what the architects of the Southern regional
primary had in mind.
   They wanted to take some of the thunder away from Iowa and New
Hampshire. For all the criticism of those two early states,
candidates do spend a lot of time there and really do meet with
real voters.
   The way it worked out, those states may have gotten even more
attention this time, while the South is still waiting to hear about
its concerns of, say, rural poverty and development.
   But still a better name for this mega-primary, Reilly says, may
be Satellite Tuesday.
   Developments in television technology have played directly to
the candidates' slavish need to get television airtime. Local TV
stations now have _ and use _ the technology to get live reports
from from virtually anywhere.
   The candidates are trying to exploit that by accommodating
television stations in the Super Tuesday states, not just by
tailoring local events but by making far-flung campaign appearances
available via satellite to stations elsewhere.
   Campaigns may pay to have video pictures of their candidate at
an apperance beamed up to a satellite where it is available for
stations that want it, even if they didn't have crews on the scene.
   ``We have found in these small markets, particularly with
agriculture stories, we've had enormous success'' getting the
candidate on the air, Reilly said.
   Hence Gephardt makes three stops as he flies across three time
zones one day last week. And he walks through a nearly idle
electronics factory, to underscore his attack on unfair trade
practices, with only a half-dozen people to hear him talk.
   It was the handful of television cameras there that he had in
mind.
   Never mind that the factory was in Rapid City, S.D. It's one of
the five states with primaries or caucuses in the three weeks
before Super Tuesday, but it is a state where the primary is
meaningless in the allocation of delegates. That will come later at
the state caucus.
   What counted was that the Gephardt story that day appeared not
only on South Dakota television, but on some Southern stations too.
It is the old story of television creating a ``global village.''
   And it means that the campaigns pick events and locations that
meld with the point a candidate is trying to make. His message for
the day will be summed up in a 30 second bite on television that
evening, if he's lucky. So look for Gephardt to go to a Texas
automobile factory and a Birmingham, Ala., steel mill to make his
point about foreign competition and lost jobs.
   ``It's Super-Satellite Tuesday,'' Reilly said. ``Pretty soon the
Secret Service will have to start attaching those (satellite)
dishes to the limos so these guys can do link-ups from the road.''

<HEAD>SRP, DOE Officials Deny Acrimony Before Power Reduction Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were technical disagreements but no
acrimony during meetings of scientists that led to the decision to
reduce power levels at the Savannah River Plant's nuclear reactors,
plant officials said Monday.
   The Washington Post reported Monday that the power levels were
reduced by federal officials following a stormy meeting during
which scientists warned that the reactor was operating beyond the
demonstrated capacity of its emergency cooling system.
   The Department of Energy officials initially were reluctant to
order the reduction because they didn't want to admit they had made
a mistake and risk triggering public pressure to close the South
Carolina facility, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified
sources.
   The decision was made during a meeting Feb. 12 to reduce power
levels at two of the three government reactors at the Savannah
River Plant _ the last Energy Department facility that produces
plutonium, said Roger Rollins, the department's chief of reactors
at SRP.
   Rollins described the 10 percent reduction in power _ the third
reduction in 14 months _ as a routine action reflecting a change in
the way reactor temperatures are measured. The reduction dropped
the operating level from 1,100 megawatts thermal to 960 megawatts.
Power had been reduced previously from 2,200 megawatts.
   But the Post said its sources said the reduction was ordered
only at the insistence of scientists working for Du Pont, DOE's
contractor at Savannah River. The scientists had discovered a
fundamental error in the calculations that have been used for
decades to justify reactor operating levels, the newspaper said.
   Savannah River manager Robert L. Morgan decided to reduce the
levels following a confrontation with the scientists at a Feb. 8
meeting during which a top Du Pont scientist threw his security
badge on the table in front of Morgan and threatened to ``go
public'' unless the power levels were lowered, the sources said.
   An unidentified DOE official told the Post that the department
did not want to ``raise the specter of continuing problems at
Savannah River.''
   Rollins denied Monday there was a fundamental error in the DOE
calculations and denied there were any heated disagreements during
either of the meetings Feb. 8 and Feb. 12.
   ``There were lots of technical discussion, which helped the
decision-making process,'' Rollins said. ``There was no dissention.
Utilmately, everyone agreed with the decision to make the minor
adjustment.''

<HEAD>Independent Prosecutor Law To Be Ruled On This Summer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court will be the setting for a
crucial constitutional fight this spring when it studies a
post-Watergate law creating special prosecutors to investigate
high-ranking government officials.
   The justices announced Monday they will hear arguments in the
dispute in April with a decision expected by July.
   The eventual ruling will determine the future of court-appointed
independent counsels. It also will affect the criminal conviction
of former White House aide Michael K. Deaver and the investigation
of ex-Justice Department official Theodore B. Olson.
   Deaver, prosecuted by an independent counsel, was convicted of
lying to a grand jury and to a House subcommittee that investigated
his lobbying activities. Olson is under investigation by an
independent counsel on charges he lied to Congress.
   An independent counsel's probe of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North for his role in the Iran-Contra affair is expected to survive
any adverse high court decision on the law.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals here ruled Jan. 22 that the law
improperly grants presidential appointment powers to the federal
courts and encroaches on the president's exclusive authority to
enforce criminal laws.
   The law authorizes a special court, acting at the attorney
general's request, to appoint the independent counsels.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh received a parallel
appointment from Attorney General Edwin Meese III to conduct the
Iran-Contra investigation. That power insulates his office from the
constitutional attack on the special prosecutor law.
   Similarly, independent counsel James C. McKay, who successfully
prosecuted former presidential aide Lyn C. Nofziger on illegal
lobbying charges, also accepted a backup appointment.
   But the investigations of Deaver and Olson were not buttressed
by such parallel grants of authority from the attorney general.
   The case before the Supreme Court was brought by independent
counsel Alexia Morrison. She is investigating charges that Olson, a
former assistant attorney general, lied to Congress in 1983 during
a dispute over the Environmental Protection Agency's cleanup
program for toxic waste.
   The court on Monday allowed Morrison to resume her investigation
of Olson, raising the possibility that grand jury indictments could
be returned before the high court's ruling.
   The appeals court ruling temporarily derailed Morrison's
investigation.
   Meanwhile, the court returned to full strength Monday with the
addition of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to fill a vacancy that had
lasted eight months.
   With Kennedy available as a tie-breaking vote if necessary, the
court took the highly unusual step of agreeing to hear a second
round of arguments in two cases already under study.
   In one case, involving the death of a Marine helicopter
co-pilot, the justices will decide whether defense contractors may
be forced to pay damages for on-duty accidents involving members of
the military.
   The second case, involving the convicted killer of an Oklahoma
policeman, deals with the the disqualification of a potential juror
who said he would vote to impose the death penalty if the accused
were convicted.
   But the court refused to reconsider its 4-4 decision last
December striking down an Illinois law that could have made
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.
   The justices rejected a request by Illinois officials to restudy
the law now that Kennedy has taken his seat.
   In other action, the court:
   _Dealt a blow to religious fundamentalists by killing a lawsuit
challenging the required use of ``godless'' textbooks in Tennessee
public schools. The justices, without a recorded dissenting vote,
left intact a federal appeals court ruling that said it was
constitutional to require fundamentalist Christian children to read
the objected-to books.
   Beverly LaHaye, president of the conservative Concerned Women
for America, said: ``A dark cloud of religious oppression looms
over America's schoolhouses today. Religious tolerance in our
nation's classrooms has been dealt a devastating blow.''
   _Agreed to decide whether local governments may impose
affirmative-action programs requiring minority participation in
public works projects. The justices will study an invalidated
Richmond, Va., program that set aside 30 percent of the value of
public works projects for firms at least one-half owned by
minorities.
   _Refused to let a Fort Worth, Texas, hospital withhold the names
of its blood donors from a woman suing on charges her baby daughter
contracted AIDS after receiving transfusions.
   _Said it will hear arguments by coal mining companies and the
Reagan administration aimed at blocking the possible awards of
billions of dollars in ``black lung'' benefits to thousands of
miners.
   _Agreed to decide whether the National Collegiate Athletic
Association should be barred from suspending Jerry Tarkanian as
basketball coach at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas for alleged
recruiting violations.
   _Voted to decide when police need court warrants before
searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in fenced-in yards.

<HEAD>Robertson Borrows $5.5 Million, Bush in Good Shape</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former TV evangelist Pat Robertson is
borrowing heavily going into the critical Super Tuesday primaries,
taking out a massive $5.5 million loan for his presidential
campaign, financial reports show.
   Robertson ended January with $5.5 million in the bank, but his
campaign had $6 million in debts as he far outspent any other
candidate on the Super Tuesday contests involving 20 states on
March 8.
   Rival GOP contenders George Bush and Bob Dole, on the other
hand, remained in good shape.
   Bush, the overall fund-raising leader, ended January with $9.2
million in cash on hand and $811,029 in obligations, while Dole had
$4.2 million and $654,269 in bills to pay, their latest financial
statements show.
   Neither had any loans outstanding, but the other GOP contender,
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, took out $750,000 in loans to get
through the Iowa and New Hampshire contests this month.
   Among Democratic candidates, money leader Michael Dukakis had
the most cash available, $4 million.
   Besides his loan, Robertson reported contributions of $1.3
million during January. His report also listed as receipts the $6.5
million in federal matching funds that he applied for but had said
he might not use.
   Robertson had said he was philosophically opposed to the public
financing system and his staff said he would only use matching
funds if he needed to stay competitive.
   Robertson's campaign did not return calls Monday night to answer
questions about the loan, by far the biggest borrowing of any
campaign for the 1988 election.
   Robertson paid off a short-term loan of $1.5 million that his
attorney has said was secured with his matching funds, his report
showed.
   The latest financial reports were due at the Federal Election
Commission on Saturday, but Robertson had not filed his by Monday.
Aides said it was still being worked on Monday, and released
summary pages Monday evening. However, details of the loan were not
included.
   The sizable expenditures on this month's Iowa and New Hampshire
contests and subsequent spending toward Super Tuesday are not
reflected in the new reports, which cover the period through Jan.
31.
   Robertson has spent more than any other candidate against the
overall spending ceiling which is set by election law at $27
million for the primary season. He reported spending $17.6 million
against the cap.
   Bush, conversely, while raising more money than any other
candidate, has been watching his budget and has spent the least of
any Republican contender against the cap.
   He reported spending $10.7 million against the ceiling, compared
with Kemp's $12.8 million and Dole's $13.5 million.
   Robertson also spent the most of any campaign in a single state
_ $1 million in Texas, compared with Bush's $335,743 and Dole's
$81,645.
   Wealthy campaigns must keep from spending too much early in the
campaign, because they could leave themselves unable to spend money
on later contests without going over the limit.
   On the Democratic side, none of the candidates approached the
cap, with Dukakis spending the most at $7.8 million.
   The Massachusetts governor also had the biggest Democratic bank
account at the beginning of this month, $4 million with $511,789 in
bills to pay, while the next nearest Democrat, Sen. Al Gore Jr. of
Tennessee, had $2 million with $84,248 in obligations.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., borrowed $523,674 in January and ended
the month with a $691,069 debt and only $401,176 in the bank. He
raised $534,259 in contributions for the month, $1.9 million in
matching funds, and $523,674 in loans.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., entered February with $820,260 in
debts and $172,477 in cash on hand. He collected $212,702 in
contributions and $1.9 million in matching funds during January.
   Aides for both Gephardt and Simon have said that fund-raising
picked up this month and that they have whittled down their debts.
   Gore had ignored Iowa to concentrate on the Super Tuesday
states, but he raised very little money during the time the other
candidates were campaigning hard in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   He collected only $180,746 in contributions during January, in
addition to the $1.8 million in matching funds he got, his report
showed.
   Dukakis raised $804,839 in contributions and got $3.5 million
matching funds.
   Democratic contender Jesse Jackson reported raising $610,036 in
donations, plus $598,021 in matching funds during January, ending
the month with $509,978 in cash on hand and $354,881 in obligations.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart ended the month with $615,547 in
cash on hand and $24,484 in debts after collecting $70,303 in
contributions and $937,325 in matching funds.
   Kemp continued a hand-to-mouth campaign, ending January with a
debt of $1.3 million after raising $1 million for the month.
However, his political director, Charlie Black, said the debt would
be wiped out when Kemp's federal mathching funds come in this month.
   He insisted the campaign is not in financial trouble, saying a
heavy mail solicitation program and fund-raising events are reaping
about $400,000 a week.
   Dole raised $1.2 million in contributions for January and got
$5.6 in matching funds, while Bush collected $767,892 privately and
got $6.4 million in matching funds.
   Most candidates got very large matching fund payments in January
because that was the first months the money was released, and the
sums were based on the candidates' fund raising for all preceding
months.
   Candidates can get matching funds from the federal Treasury for
each contribution of $250 or less that they raise in private funds.
The matching fund is supported by the $1 checkoff on individual
income tax returns.

Nationwide</HEAD>

   Jesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore were the
Democratic leaders in the Southern and border states that vote on
Super Tuesday, according to a poll published today, with
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis very close behind.
   But Dukakis was the favorite among Democratic voters nationwide,
according to the CBS-New York Times poll. The survey found 21
percent of registered Democratic primary voters queried nationwide
said Dukakis was their choice for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   In the Southern and border states, which hold primaries or
caucuses March 8, Jackson had 19 percent, Gore had 16 percent and
Dukakis 13 percent. With a 4 percentage-point margin of error, that
pointed to a close race. Rep. Richard Gephardt had 11 percent and
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, 10 percent. The survey also
included South Carolina, which holds its primary March 5.
   In the nationwide sampling, Jackson, with 13 percent, was second
behind Dukakis, the poll found. Gephardt had 12 percent and Hart 10
percent, with a margin of error of 3 points. Twenty-three percent
of both samplings didn't answer or said they didn't know.
   On the Republican side, the CBS-Times poll found Vice President
George Bush leading strongly both in the South and nationwide.
   Bush garnered the backing of 51 percent of the registered
Republicans in Super Tuesday states to 20 percent for Sen. Bob
Dole. In the nationwide sampling, the poll found 42 percent opting
for Bush and 27 percent for Dole.
   The telephone poll of 933 Democrats and 684 Republicans
nationwide taken Feb. 17-21 had a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points on the Democratic side and four percent for
the GOP race, the Times said.
   The newspaper said 575 Democrats and 375 Republicans were
surveyed in the Super Tuesday states and South Carolina. The
CBS-Times Super Tuesday figures have a margin of error of four
percentage points for the Democrats and five points for the
Republicans.
   Another survey, this one in the 14 Southern or border states
that hold primries or caucuses on Super Tuesday, suggested Bush
holds a 2-1 lead over Dole. On the Democratic side, Jesse Jackson
and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis were running roughly even,
the Scripps Howard News Service survey suggested.
   Bush led Dole by a 51-26 margin, with former television
evangelist Pat Robertson was third with 11 percent. Rep. Jack Kemp
of New York trailed with 3 percent and 9 percent were undecided,
the poll indicated.
   The pollsters contacted 423 likely Republican voters Feb. 17-19,
and the margin of error was 5 percentage points, the news service
said.
   Among Democrats, Jackson had 22 percent and Dukakis 19 percent _
within the poll's 4 percentage-point margin of error. Gore and
Gephardt each had 14 percent, with 21 percent undecided.
   Hart had 6 percent, the Scripps Howard poll indicated, and Simon
had 5 percent. On the Democratic side, 597 voters were surveyed.
   The survey involved voters in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, all of
which hold primaries or caucuses on March 8.
   Six other states will also vote on Super Tuesday.
   The survey was done in conjunction with the Birmingham (Ala.)
Post-Herald, The Commercial Appeal of Memphis and The Knoxville
(Tenn.) News Sentinel.

<HEAD>Bahamian Official Blames US For Failed Interdiction Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior official of the Bahamas is angered by
a State Department charge that ``systemic corruption'' in his
government is undermining a combined campaign against illicit drug
trafficking there.
   Paul L. Adderley, attorney general of the Bahamas, also disputed
recent testimony of an admitted marijuana smuggler that he paid
Prime Minister Lynden Pindling millions of dollars to protect
operations in the Caribbean country.
   ``What offends us the most is the judgment that if it were not
for corruption and indifference in this country, the Bahamas would
not and could not be used as a transit route for the smuggling of
Colombia cocaine and marijuana to South Florida,'' Adderley told a
Senate hearing Monday.
   ``If the corruption and indifference that is perceived were to
magically disappear, the rate of smuggling might not diminish at
all simply because I regret to say the United States has not put
the personnel, equipment and operating funds into doing what needs
to be done in the Bahamas,'' he said.
   He said it was ``untrue, unfair and distorts the real facts'' to
suggest that the Bahamas is not doing enough to halt the flow of 60
percent of the cocaine and marijuana that enters the United States
through his country.
   But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said he still might vote to
deny further U.S. assistance to the Bahamas when the Senate deals
with the question of drug interdiction efforts by foreign countries
in the next few weeks.
   ``We already have too much rhetoric and empty promises,''
D'Amato said.
   Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, combined criticism with praise for the Bahamas'
impressive narcotics seizures and cooperation with U.S. authorities.
   She said the joint interdiction of 24,860 pounds of cocaine and
146.5 tons of marijuana in the Bahamas last year was ``not equaled
in any other country in the Caribbean.''
   Nonetheless, she said: ``Narcotics-related corruption remains a
serious problem in the Bahamas. The Bahamian government has not
dealt effectively with systemic corruption, which continues to make
the Bahamas attractive to drug traffickers.''
   D'Amato and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., questioned Adderley
closely about American marijuana smuggler George Baron's testimony
last week at the drug trial of Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos
Lehder in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Baron said he paid Pindling $3 million to $5 million from 1979
to 1981 in exchange for Bahamian protection for his activities.
Baron also quoted Lehder as saying he himself had paid Pindling
$200,000 a month in bribes.
   Baron said he once paid Pindling $400,000 at a gambling casino
on Paradise Island in the Bahamas in the fall of 1980, which
Adderley said was ``a totally incredible story, an unbelievable
story.''
   Adderley said he intended to investigate Baron's allegations.
But he also said that for Pindling to accept a bribe in a crowded
casino ``would be like the president of the United States taking a
bribe in Atlantic City.''

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A World War II bomber pilot whose
promised medal and promotion were forgotten when he was shot down
43 years ago has finally received the honors.
   ``I'm not angry about anything,'' said Federico Gonzales, 66,
associate professor emeritus of cell biology and anatomy at
Northwestern University. ``I couldn't be more happy because I
didn't know anything at all about it, that I was supposed to get
it.''
   Lt. Gen. John A. Shaud, commander of the Air Training Command
here, awarded the Evanston, Ill., resident the Distinguished Flying
Cross and his captain's bars during ceremonies Monday at Randolph
Air Force Base.
   ``As it is with bureaucracy, eventually we get it right,'' Shaud
said.
   In January 1945, Gonzales was a 23-year-old first lieutenant who
already had flown 24 missions and was slated for the medal and
promotion when his B-17 bomber was shot down near Neuss, Germany.
   Gonzales, the only survivor of nine crew members, was taken
prisoner and held until Germany's surrender three months later. He
then returned to San Antonio, his hometown.
   At the time of the crash, however, he was presumed dead by the
military and his awards were forgotten, military officials said.
   At a reunion in 1986, Gonzales met retired Air Force Col. Jean
Miller of Newport Beach, Calif., who led Gonzales' squadron, the
603rd of the 398th bomb group.
   Miller told Gonzales about the medal and promotion, which the
colonel had recommended at the time, and encouraged him to apply
for them.
   ``The honor that has been bestowed on me today is a high point
in my life,'' Gonzales told about 80 relatives, friends and
military personnel in a 15-minute speech.
   Gonzales and the widow of the American commander who died in the
crash will travel with others in the 398th to tour the bomber
group's old base in Nuthamstead, England, later this year.
   He said they will visit a cemetery in Holland where the remains
of the dead crew members are buried, then Neuss.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore says Democratic presidential
rival Rep. Richard Gephardt has made ``wholesale changes in dozens
and dozens of key positions,'' but Gephardt claims it is Gore who
has reversed himself on a dozen issues of prime importance.
   The bickering between the two Democratic hopefuls turned up a
notch on Monday with Gephardt's campaign laying down a list of what
it said were 12 major Gore position changes.
   ``It's hypocrisy,'' said Gephardt spokesman Mark Johnson of
Gore's attacks. But Gore kept up his volleys, saying the Missouri
congressman votes one way in Congress and is telling the voters
something different.
   The Tennessee senator said Gephardt's ``whole approach to the
electorate is in contrast to the approach during his career in the
Congress.''
   And Gore spokeswoman Arlie Schardt took aim at the Gephardt
campaign's depiction of Gore position changes.
   ``It's misleading and an almost laughable list,'' Schardt said.
``It reveals their anxiety about being so deeply in debt and about
seeing Gore surging past them'' in recent polls.
   On the politically explosive issue of abortion, Gephardt's aides
said Gore voted in 1984 for legislation that would have defined a
fetus as a ``person'' from the moment of conception _ a change in
the law that has been key goal of the anti-abortion movement.
   On Sunday, Gore denied voting for such an amendment.
   ``No, no, I did not,'' Gore said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
``I have never supported restrictions on the ability of the woman
to make a choice in having an abortion.''
   Gore's staff said the Gephardt campaign is describing the vote
incorrectly. They say it was a vote designed to deny the use of
federal funds for abortion _ a longtime Gore position _ and not an
attempt to write the definition of a fetus into the law in such a
way that would deny women the right to choose abortions.
   The Gephardt campaign also listed four other times it said Gore
had voted on both sides of the abortion issue in the House and
Senate.
   ``I have not changed my position at all,'' Gore said Monday.
``There is no inconsistency at all.''
   Gephardt has been severely criticized for backing down from his
strong opposition to abortion, a change that came as he was
planning his bid for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.
   The Gephardt sheet also said Gore voted for the Harkin amendment
to the agriculture bill in 1985, which Gephardt aides said
contained production controls almost identical to the
Harkin-Gephardt farm bill. Gore now attacks the Harkin-Gephardt
bill.
   Gore said Monday that the 1985 amendment was ``the only
alternative'' to the Reagan-sponsored farm bill and he said the
measures are different. On Sunday, Gore termed the latest bill
``the worst single idea of campaign '88.''
   There are ten other issues on which the Gephardt campaign said
Gore had flip-flopped. Gore aides said the list misconstrued vote
after vote.
   Here are the ten:
   _ Balanced budget amendment: Gephardt statement says Gore voted
against it in the House in 1982 and for it in 1986 in the Senate.
   _ Non-lethal Contra aid: Gephardt release says Gore voted
against such aid in 1985, but now says he favors it.
   _ MX missile: Gephardt statement says Gore voted for the MX in
1983, but now says he is against further MX funding.
   _ Defense policy: Gephardt release says Gore voted for the
nuclear freeze in 1983 and was ``a respected advocate for the
liberal peace agenda.'' Now Gephardt campaign says Gore
``positioned himself as a defense hawk.''
   _ Grain embargo against the Soviet Union: Gephardt release says
Gore voted against ending the embargo in 1980, but not criticizes
embargo.
   _ Oil import fee: Gephardt statement says Gore voted against it
in 1980, 1985 and 1986, but told Texas voters in 1987 he would
consider one.
   _ Gramm-Rudman: Gephardt release says Gore voted for it in the
Senate and then against legislation that would have rewritten the
law to solve constitutional questions raised by the Supreme Court.
   _ Trade: Gephardt statement says Gore declared himself a
``free-trade purist'' in 1987, but had previously voted for a
textile protection bill.
   _ Litmus tests: Gephardt release says Gore denounced litmus
tests of special interest groups, but that he pledged to the
National Women's Political Caucus in August 1987 he would name
women to 50 percent of his presidential slots.
   _ Supreme Court: Gephardt statement says Gore quickly came out
against the appointment of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice, but
that Gore was the last senator to announce he would vote against
the by-then-doomed nomination of Robert Bork to the high court.

   Two independent television stations say Jerry
Falwell owes them thousands of dollars from his TV ministry, but a
spokesman for the evangelist says checks are in the mail.
   Mike Liff, general manager of WPGH-TV, said he was pulling
Falwell's weekly ``Old Time Gospel Hour'' from the station's
schedule because of unpaid bills ``in the neighborhood of $50,000.''
   ``He's flying around in his private plane and he hasn't paid us
since October,'' Liff said Monday.
   Falwell also owes an undisclosed amount of money to WPTT-TV,
according to general manager Chuck Hobbs. The station, which
carries Falwell's daily program, temporarily dropped the show four
years ago for nonpayment, Hobbs said.
   Oma Bradner, who handles Falwell's television accounts for the
Sam K. Pate advertising agency, said late Monday a check was mailed
to both stations on Friday. He said he didn't know the amount of
either check but said ``it was a pretty good bit.''
   Falwell's spokesman, Mark DeMoss, said the checks were delayed
because ``audience support for the program in the Pittsburgh area
has been slow for the last few months.''
   ``I can understand they're upset but I would also hope they
would continue to carry the program,'' DeMoss said. ``I know they
made some strong remarks. But they'll be glad to know we're flying
around in the private jet a whole lot less this year than last.''
   Liff said he's also bothered by the fact that such shows can be
an important source of revenue to television evangelists, who must
pay stations to carry their programs because they do not sell
advertising on them.
   ``We are the vehicle that broadcasts these shows to people who
send in a whole lot of money, possibly at the expense of their own
well-being. That's my problem,'' he said.
   WPGH continued to run Falwell's show without being paid
``because we didn't have a viable alternative,'' Liff said.
   ``There's very little this station could run at 11 p.m. on
Sunday night that's going to make us money.''

   Republican presidential contender Bob Dole and
Democrat Michael Dukakis have invested the most cash in efforts to
get a boost from the so-called gateway states leading into the
Super Tuesday series of primaries, financial records show.
   These states have been somewhat overshadowed by the 20-state
showdown that will occur on Super Tuesday, but the campaigns
generally agree that whoever does well in the gateway states will
have the look of a winner going into the critical March 8 contests.
   The gateway contests, occurring between now and Super Tuesday's
mega-primary on March 8, are in South Dakota, Minnesota, Maine,
South Carolina and Wyoming.
   Dole, the senator from Kansas, spent more than twice as much as
Bush and their Republican rival Pat Robertson in the gateway
states, according to campaign financial statements filed over the
weekend with the Federal Election Commission.
   Dukakis leads the Democrats in spending for both Super Tuesday
and the gateway contests, the records show. He also had the biggest
bank account at the beginning of this month, $4 million, while the
next nearest Democrat, Sen. Al Gore Jr. of Tennessee, had $2
million.
   The new reports reflect spending through the end of January,
while not reflecting the sizeable expenditures this month on the
Iowa and New Hampshire contests or the subsequent spending toward
Super Tuesday and the gateways.
   By the end of January, the reports show, Dole spent a total of
$786,529 in the gateway contests, compared to Bush's $389,150,
Robertson's $373,105 and Rep. Jack Kemp's $183,831.
   Dole's biggest spending was in Minnesota, $367,097, compared to
Bush's $20,927, Robertson's $75,391, and Kemp's $67,994. The state
holds its caucuses Tuesday.
   Robertson has selected South Carolina as his must-win state, and
had spent $224,234 there by the end of January, compared to Bush's
$126,151, Dole's $110,775 and Kemp's $35,681.
   Kemp's political director, Charlie Black, said Monday that his
candidate will make a big push in South Carolina to come in ahead
of Robertson. Kemp plans a TV campaign there of $250,000 to
$300,000, Black said.
   Bush, the overall fund-raising leader took a conservative
approach to spending in January, spending the least among GOP
contenders during the month, $3.7 million. Robertson spent the most
at $7.9 million.
   Among the Democrats, Dukakis had spent $423,606 on the gateway
states. His nearest competitors were Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois,
$89,202, and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, $75,462.
   They were followed by Sen. Al Gore Jr. of Tennessee, whose
gateway total through January was $40,681. Gore has focused
virtually all of his attention on the Super Tuesday states,
particularly the 14 in the South.
   Simon had said last week that he needed to win either South
Dakota or Minnesota to continue his campaign. He has since backed
off of that statement, citing an infusion of campaign contributions
that can keep him alive beyond those contests.
   Simon spent $66,313 in Minnesota through January, compared to
Dukakis, who spent the most there among Democrats, $266,418. Simon
had spent only $13,705 in South Dakota, while Dukakis again led the
field in that state, with $80,989.

<HEAD>House Members Raise Money at Record Clip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campaign money is being raised at a record
pace by incumbent House members, and more of it than ever is coming
from special interest groups, according to an analysis by a
congressional watchdog group.
   The study by Common Cause, released Monday, found that the 412
House members expected to seek re-election in November collected
nearly $55 million last year, 28 percent more than incumbents had
amassed at the same time in the last two-year House election cycle.
   Of that total, $24.2 million came from political action
committees, the fund-raising arms of special interest groups which
seek to influence Congress. That figure was up 44 percent over the
comparable figure two years ago, Common Cause said, and also
amounted to 44 percent of the total raised by the incumbents.
   ``Early returns for the 1988 election are in, and they reveal a
landslide victory in the House for special-interest PACs,'' said
Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer, who is leading a fight in
the Senate for campaign-finance legislation to curb the influence
of PACs.
   The largest House beneficiary of PAC giving in 1987 was House
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who received $223,058 from the
groups. That represented 51 percent of Coelho's total receipts in
1987 of $436,616.
   Three other House members topped the $200,000 mark in PAC
receipts for the year: Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., with $207,846; Beryl
Anthony, D-Ark., $207,187; and Martin Frost, D-Texas, $200,924.
   Of the House members expected to run again, 34 raised more than
$250,000 last year. Topping the list of total fund-raising was Rep.
Mel Levine, D-Calif., with $729,720, and three others topped the
half-million dollar level: Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., $670,570;
Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., $656,894; and Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, $634,445.
   McEwen was also the top spender in 1987, with his campaign
committee spending $629,325. House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was
second on the spending list, at $426,121, and Kennedy was third at
404,512.
   For incumbents, total cash on hand in campaign chests at the end
of last year averaged $155,528, a 45 percent increase from the
level of two years earlier. Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., had the
richest campaign fund, with more than $1.1 million on hand.
   Others near the top of the list were House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., $904,149; Rep. Steven
Solarz, D-N.Y., $880,998; and Levine, with $847,138.

   The state hierarchy of the Assemblies of
God church Monday ordered television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart to
immediately begin a two-year rehabilitation period that will limit
his preaching and place him in counseling, an official said.
   Louisiana District supervisor Cecil Janway announced the action,
which could be modified by the national organization, after more
than nine hours of meetings with Swaggart, who was accused of
sexual miscounduct and admitted Sunday to unspecified sins.
   ``The following action has been taken by the board of the
Louisiana District of the Assemblies of God concerning evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart: We accept his confession of specific incidents of a
moral failure,'' Janway said.
   ``Based on his detailed confession and the evidence we observed
of true humility and repentance, we have offered him
rehabilitation, in accordance with the bylaws of the general
council and Louisiana District of the Assemblies of God,'' he said.
   ``Brother Swaggart has submitted to the terms of
rehabilitation,'' he said.
   Swaggart made no comment as he left the meeting. He was whisked
away by guards and left in a van, later flying home to Baton Rouge.
   Janway told reporters that Swaggart will be prohibited from
preaching a minimum of three months, ``except in fulfillment of
present commitments involving foreign governments during that
period.'' He did not elaborate.
   Earlier, Janway had said the regional board would report its
findings privately to the general council of the country's largest
Pentecostal denomination, based in Springfield, Mo.
   He declined to answer questions after reading his statement,
saying ``No comment'' when asked if the action announced Monday
would require further action from church officials in Missouri.
   Everett Stenhouse, assistant general superintendent of the
denomination, said the action will now be referred to the executive
presbytery in Springfield to ``be approved or sent down for
modification.'' A March 29 meeting is scheduled, but ``it's
possible for us to meet sooner,'' he said.
   National Assemblies of God officials had met with Swaggart last
week.
   Janway said Swaggart would be relieved of his duties as
co-pastor of the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, but he would
be allowed to return to preaching after three months. Jim Rentz,
co-pastor with Swaggart at the worship center, earlier had said he
would assume duties as chief pastor of the church.
   Swaggart did not describe his misconduct Sunday in his
confession, which drew gasps and tears from his congregation.
   An overflow crowd packed his 7,500-seat family worship center
after reports that church officials had been given photographs
purporting to show Swaggart and a known prostitute going into and
out of a motel room.
   The evangelist flew here from his headquarters in Baton Rouge on
Monday for the meeting with the district presbytery of the
Assemblies of God.
   In his announcement after that meeting, Janway said Swaggart
would be counseled and supervised weekly by three members of the
Louisiana District Presbytery during the rehabilitation period. He
will be required to submit quarterly and monthly reports to church
officials, Janway said.
   ``Again no doubt, much speculation and rumor will find its way
into the secular media, but for the church, the body of Christ,
such speculation and rumor has no place,'' he said.
   ``We urge Brother Swaggart and his associates to resist the
request of those outside the church to respond to questions.
Brother Swaggart has been in complete cooperation with the
Assemblies of God and has pledged with work within the structure of
the church,'' Janway said.
   The photographs allegedly showing Swaggart with a prostitute
reportedly were given to church officials by New Orleans evangelist
Marvin Gorman, who had once filed a $90 million suit against
Swaggart, claiming Swaggart had unjustly accused him of numerous
affairs. ``I know they exist and they're relevant,'' Gorman's
attorney Hunter Lundy said of the photographs.
   The Washington Post reported Monday, quoting a source who spoke
to a Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries board member, that Swaggart
said he did not engage in sexual intercourse with the woman but
``paid her to perform pornographic acts.''
   One church official said Swaggart had confessed that his sexual
misconduct had continued for years.
   ``He tried and tried and tried through prayer and fasting and
everything he could do to lick it and it beat him,'' the Rev. Glen
Cole, pastor of the Capital Christian Center in Sacramento, Calif.,
told a Sacramento television station on Sunday. Cole is one of 13
denomination officials that examined Swaggart's case last week.
   ``He confessed to specific incidents of moral failure,'' Forest
H. Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies' Louisiana District,
told Swaggart's congregation. ``In the opinion of the officers of
the Louisiana District, he has shown true humility and repentance
and has not tried to blame anyone else for his failure.''
   The denomination's role is limited to disciplining Swaggart, but
as in the case of PTL, it has no control over the television
ministry.
   Eleven months ago, Swaggart scathingly denounced fellow
Assemblies of God evangelist Jim Bakker for committing adultery,
comparing him to a cancer that had to be excised.
   Bakker, who resigned from his PTL ministry in March after
admitting to an extramarital sexual encounter with church secretary
Jessica Hahn and being defrocked by the denomination, had blamed
Swaggart for bringing his misconduct to light.
   Swaggart had worked last summer to develop an ethics code for
broadcast ministries to stem a drop-off in donations caused by the
sex and money scandal at the PTL ministry under Bakker's reign.
   With tears streaming down his face, Swaggart said Sunday he was
stepping down from the pulpit ``for an undetermined, indeterminate
period of time. We will leave that in the hands of the Lord.''
   He said he was cooperating with the Assemblies' investigation.
   ``I do not plan in any way to whitewash my sin or call it a
mistake,'' he said. ``I call it sin.''
   Ministry officials had refused to comment on the future of
Swaggart's television program, which is videotaped at his regular
Sunday service and distributed in more than 100 countries.
   Swaggart, a cousin of rock 'n' roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis and
country singer Mickey Gilley, combined his singing and piano
playing with old-fashioned, fire-and-brimstone preaching to build a
ministry with an income estimated at $142 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Gephardt Keeps Up Trade Talk Despite His Amendment's Likely
Scrapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Rep.
Richard Gephardt is still talking tough on trade, despite the
fading prospects of the trade amendment that bears his name.
   ``I want to turn it in the other direction,'' the Missouri
congressman said as he opened a two-day campaign swing here.
``First, we've got to change our trade policies so other countries
treat us like we treat them.''
   As an example, Gephardt pointed to the fact a car manufactured
in South Korea can be sold in the United States at a low price,
while tariffs and taxes in South Korea would push the cost of a
mid-sized American car in South Korea to $48,000.
   Gephardt recently made commercials suggesting that South
Korean-made Hyundais sell for $48,000 here unless South Korea mends
its ways. The commercials, coupled with a populist push, were
credited with helping him win the Iowa caucuses two weeks ago.
   ``If they bring their products here and sell them with ease, I
want to be able to take our products there and sell them with
ease,'' he said. ``I will demand equal trade.''
   He added the United States should not back away from such a
policy.
   ``Why are we selling ourselves short?'' he asked. ``Why don't we
stand up for what's right? When we stand up, (foreign markets) open
up.''
   Gephardt is the author of an amendment to a massive trade bill
that would call for mandatory sanctions against countries with big
trade surpluses with the United States if six months of talks fail
to resolve differences.
   But House conferees working on the measure, which has been
languishing, have said they will soon scrap the Gephardt amendment
in order to get the measure through. One conferee, a fellow
Democrat, called the provision ``bad policy.''
   As a courtesy to their colleague Gephardt, the trade bill
negotiators were expected to wait until after the Super Tuesday
primaries to give his provision the heave-ho.
   Gephardt also repeated his calls for a national energy policy
including a fee on imported oil.
   ``We import as much oil today as we did in 1973,'' he said. ``We
don't have a courageous leadership or energy policy. Why don't we
stand up for America for once and have an energy policy that is
good for the United States?''
   On the issue of defense, Gephardt called for a central
procurement system for defense purchases and said he favored the
Midgetman over the MX missile.

<HEAD>Two Years Later Key Players In Marcos Ouster Are In Disgrace</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago they were heroes _
idealistic young officers whose mutiny helped spark the revolt
against Ferdinand Marcos. Now they are in disgrace, victims of the
revolution they helped inspire.
   On Feb. 22, 1986, the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, or RAM,
a clique of young officers angry over corruption in the Marcos
military, mutinied.
   Their action tapped a groundswell of opposition that began after
the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, and it
led to a popular revolt backed by clergy and joined by hundreds of
thousands of civilians.
   President Marcos fled the country on Feb. 26, and President
Corazon Aquino took office. RAM leaders such as Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan were hailed as heroes in the finest tradition of
service to the nation.
   But on the second anniversary of what is known as the ``EDSA
revolution,'' Honasan is in detention aboard a navy ship for his
role in the Aug. 28 coup attempt that left at least 53 people dead
and hundreds wounded.
   Two other RAM members, Navy Capt. Rex Robles and Air Force Lt.
Col. Eduardo ``Red'' Kapunan, have been detained in connection with
the Nov. 13, 1986, murder of leftist leader Rolando Olalia.
Officials say three other RAM officers are being sought in the
killing.
   Late Monday, on the anniversary of the mutiny, military police
prevented Robles from attending a mass organized by Honasan's wife
Jane to commemorate the RAM contribution to Marcos' downfall. He
was hustled away into a jeep by military police as he headed for
the church with his wife.
   ``In a broad historical sense, the crackdown on this group
illustrates the continuing cannibalism of the `revolution' which
has already gobbled up several of its leading actors,'' wrote
commentator Amando Doronila in The Manila Chronicle.
   ``The political landscape has changed favorably in favor of
giving a little more stable base for democratic government,'' he
added. ``But it is not yet time to be confident that stability will
endure. The revolution has not yet run its course _ it can turn on
its other leaders.''
   The series of military coup plots and the strong desire among
most Filipinos for civilian leadership cost the RAM faction
whatever favorable image it once enjoyed among the general
population.
   But other key figures in the anti-Marcos struggle have also been
eased out of positions of leadership in the political turmoil of
the past two years.
   Chief among them were former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile,
the RAM patron and leader of the military mutiny, former Executive
Secretary Joker Arroyo, and former Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin.
   Enrile, now a senator, was fired Nov. 23, 1986, after the
government said it foiled a coup plot by officers close to the
longtime defense chief.
   Arroyo, once Mrs. Aquino's closest adviser, was fired last
September amid charges by the military that he was a communist
sympathizer, a charge the former human rights lawyer vigorously
denied.
   Ongpin, an industrialist who helped rally the business community
behind Mrs. Aquino, was fired along with Arroyo in a Cabinet
shakeup in the wake of the August coup attempt.
   He committed suicide three months later, and his family said he
was despondent over the rancor and bitterness within the Aquino
Cabinet.
   Filipino commentators believe the turmoil was due in large part
to the lack of political consensus within a disparate coalition
which shared the goal of ousting Marcos but differed widely on a
vision for the country's future once the longtime strongman was
gone.
   Monday, Enrile released a letter which he said he received from
Honasan to mark the second anniversary of the revolt against Marcos.
   ``Although there is no real cause for celebration now because
our aspirations in 1986 have not yet been realized, it is well
worth the time to pray and remember,'' Honasan wrote.
   ``I also pray that all of us still share in the elusive dream of
true reconciliation, peace and a better life for our people.''

<HEAD>US Investigating Shipment To USSR Of Militarily Useful Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says it is ``concerned by
the apparent diversion'' to the Soviet Union of a U.S. computer
system which could help determine the best targets for nuclear
missiles.
   Officials of the Reagan administration confirmed Monday that the
Commerce Department and Customs Service were investigating the
possibility that the computer supposedly destined for Yugoslavia
wound up in Soviet Union.
   ``We're concerned by this apparent diversion and are working
with Yugoslav authorities to determine exactly what happened in the
specific case,'' said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   According to a report in Monday's editions of the Washington
Times, a Los Angeles Company, Essex Marketing Co., is under
investigation for an alleged shipment last December 21 of a
computer capable of simulating nuclear explosions to an engineering
college in Zagreb, Yugoslovia.
   The newspaper said the computer was shipped to Moscow by way of
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and East Berlin.
   Donald Creed, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said
government investigators had uncovered ``an elaborate scheme to
divert a high-technology computer.'' He said it was the first
``diversion that we are aware of concerning Yugoslavia.''
   He declined to discuss details of the case.
   U.S. law prohibits export of items with possible military
application to Soviet bloc nations. Other high-technology goods may
only be shipped to those nations with approval of the Paris-based
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or COCOM.
   Disclosures last year that Toshiba Machine company of Japan had
exported high-technology submarine technology to the Soviets in
violation of COCOM regulations led to the filing of criminal
charges against some company officials in Tokyo and strong
denunciations of the sale from U.S. lawmakers.
   Though communist, Yugoslavia is not officially aligned with the
Soviet Union. High-technology shipments there do not require COCOM
approval.
   Another Commerce Department official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said that the complete computer system was not
shipped to the Soviet Union. ``There were some things that were
ready to go in warehouses that were stopped,'' the official said.
   The Washington Times said the computer, made by Floating Point
Systems of Beaverton, Ore., can be used by military planners to
gauge the impact of nuclear explosions and to help determine
optimal targets for nuclear missiles.
   The newspaper said that Floating Point was not a target of the
investigation.
   Ana Marija Besker, press counselor for the Yugoslav Embassy,
said ``we have asked for a clarification from Belgrade on this
report.''
   ``But in any case, we are responsible partners in technology
deals,'' she said. ``Our laws on these matters are very strict.''
   In 1986, the administration investigated an alleged attempt to
divert large shipments of computers and other sensitive equipment
to the Soviet bloc through Austria.

   The United States and Soviet Union told their
negotiators Monday to draft anti-cheating and other key provisions
of a new arms agreement within a month so the treaty can be signed
this spring.
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said the Soviets will begin
withdrawing shorter-range SS-12 missiles from East Germany and
Czechoslovakia late this month as a ``display of goodwill.'' The
missiles must be eliminated under the intermediate-range arms pact
signed in December.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz reported progress on human
rights and emigration, and professed not ``the slightest doubt''
that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will make good on his
pledge to pull Soviet military forces out of Afghanistan.
   A joint statement said progress was made toward banning chemical
weapons and verifying nuclear test limits set by unratified 1974
and 1976 treaties. A report by the official news agency Tass,
however, quoted Gorbachev as telling Shultz the U.S. stand on a
chemical weapons ban ``hampers the working out of an international
convention.''
   Addressing a news conference about arms negotiations, Shultz
said it was ``extremely important'' to accelerate work in Geneva if
President Reagan and Gorbachev are to sign the treaty at their
fourth summit, planned for May or June in Moscow.
   He spoke after two days of talks with Gorbachev and Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Shultz said anti-cheating measures especially were ``an
extremely important thing to get nailed down'' in a pact on
strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons.
   Shevardnadze told his own news conference later the meetings
produced headway toward agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons,
which he said ``can be accomplished'' before the summit.
   Both men said their Geneva negotiators were instructed to work
out the key elements in time for their next meeting, March 22-23 in
Washington.
   Shultz left on Tuesday for Brussels, Belgium, the Soviet news
agency Tass said, where he was to brief NATO allies on his visit.
   American officials said they hoped the new instructions would
speed the negotiations.
   ``It's not a breakthrough; it's not dramatic; it may not make a
headline,'' a senior U.S. official said privately, but the sides
now have established that ``verification is the name of the game.''
   Shultz said U.S. and Soviet negotiators were ordered to prepare
three documents dealing with:
   _Inspection of the projected 30-50 percent reduction in overall
numbers of long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear-armed
submarines.
   _How the banned weapons can be eliminated or converted into
other nuclear arms that would remain legal.
   _Agreement, in a memorandum of understanding, to exchange
information about strategic weapons as another way to prevent
cheating.
   According to the secretary, negotiators will try to resolve
``some misunderstandings'' about the U.S. program to develop a
defense system in space. The Soviets contend some tests
contemplated in the ``Star Wars'' program would violate the 1972
anti-ballistic missile treaty.
   Yazov said at an anniversary ceremony for the Soviet army and
navy: ``The Soviet missiles and launchers that are going to be
withdrawn will be sent immediately to the sites where it is planned
to liquidate them after the ratification of the treaty.'' Gorbachev
and Shevardnadze were in the audience.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN reported last week that
Soviet SS-12s in Waren northwest of Berlin had been dismantled, put
in crates and were ready for transport back to the Soviet Union.
   Shultz told his news conference a series of human rights
meetings was agreed upon, the first to set for March 16. Jurists,
psychiatrists and other experts will attend, Shultz said, but he
did not announce where it would be held.
   The secretary, who gave human rights ``the pride of place'' on
his agenda here, said Shevardnadze promised``flexibility'' in rules
that require applicants for emigration to have close relatives
abroad.
   ``That has been straightened out, at least for the balance of
this year,'' he told reporters, adding that Shevardnadze told him
``categorically'' the only barrier to emigration is past work
involving state secrets.
   Kremlin officials have given such assurances before. Shultz said
the sides still were ``exploring'' the point at which involvement
in classified work would cease to count against an applicant.
   After asserting belief in Gorbachev's intentions about
Afghanistan, Shultz said of withdrawal: ``The question is how, and
that is what the negotiations are about.''
   His reference was to U.N.-sponsored talks between Afghanistan
and Pakistan that resume next week in Geneva. Key issues remaining
are a timetable for the pullout and whether an interim government
should be in place while it occurs.
   Gorbachev offered to begin the the withdrawal May 15 and
complete it within 10 months if agreement is reached in Geneva by
March 15. Shultz said he wants the estimated 115,000 troops out by
the end of the year, and ``I think there is a very good chance of
that happening.''
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
remained to help the Communist government fight Moslem insurgents.

   A century-old windmill once saved from
demolition by donations burned to the ground in a suspicious blaze,
authorities said.
   The structure erupted in a fireball and collapsed Monday night,
fire officials said.
   The blaze was ``definitely suspicious,'' said Firefighter Nick
Ventrella.
   The 26-foot windmill, believed built between 1860 and 1870, was
set for demolition when the private property it was on was bought
about a year ago, said Pat Juviler, director of the Alley Pond
Environmental Center and chairwoman of the Committee to Save the
Windmill.
   It was moved to the center in a park in Queens, and about to be
restored, she said.
   She said nearly $60,000 had already been raised for the move and
the restoration, and that the state had pledged $40,000 more for
the project.
   She said the project will go on with a scheduled fund-raising
dinner in April.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the most recent auction, with the rates on
six-month bills dropping to their lowest point since last July.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.64 percent in Monday's auction,
down from 5.73 percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.83 percent, down

   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 5.63
percent on Feb. 8 and six-month bills averaged 5.54 percent last
July 13.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 5.82 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,857.40 and 6.11 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,705.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 6.70 percent
last week after averaging 6.59 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Report: NSA Chief Odom Plans To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Security Agency Director Lt. Gen.
William E. Odom says he had decided to leave the
intelligence-gathering agency even before there were questions
about whether he would be allowed to extend his tenure.
   ``I've served my tour,'' Odom said Monday in a telephone
interview with The Washington Post. ``I've extended four months
beyond what the normal (three-year) turnover is. I have 34 years of
active (military) duty. It's time to move on to another career.''
   The Post reported today that Odom, 55, asked for the resignation
to be effective Aug. 1. A Soviet scholar, Odom told the newspaper
he wanted to write ``a couple of books fairly quickly, and some
articles.''
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the Joint
Chiefs of Staff earlier had unanimously recommended against
extending Odom's tenure beyond the typical three years accorded his
predecessors.
   Odom said he initially had hoped to stay at the NSA another
year, but had made his decision to leave late last year, before the
question of his future reached Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci,
the Times said.
   ``I've really kicked this agency into line,'' Odom told the
Times.
   The resignation request was submitted to the secretary of the
Army about 10 days ago and must be approved by the Army chief,
Carlucci and the White House, the newspapers said.
   The NSA, based at Fort Meade in suburban Maryland, assists the
Defense Department in gathering national security information, and
operates facilities designed to collect intelligence and protect
communications and computer security within the government.
   Before assuming his current position in 1985, Odom had been the
Army's assistant chief of staff for intelligence since 1981.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Capt. Mary Laluntas had no information late
Monday on the reported resignation request. Odom's home telephone
listing is unpublished and he could not be reached for comment late
Monday.

   Here is the text of a memo from lawyer E.
Robert Wallach to Attorney General Edwin Meese III on a proposed
Iraqi pipeline:
   MEMO TO: EMIII
   FROM: erw
   DATE: 25 SEPTEMBER 1985
   PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL _ FOR YOUR EYES, ONLY
   I hesitate to provide the following information to you in
memorandum form. I'm constantly torn between my own feelings of
privacy and the need to provide you with information in a form
which will expedite communication. The following are specific items
of information which B.R. (Bruce Rappaport) provided to me.
   1. When Edgar Bronfmann met with Gorbachev in Moscow, he was
advised to transmit a message to Peres to the effect that they
would be willing to allow the flow of Soviet Jews to Israel only.
(You may recall my memo quite awhile ago, in which I expressed to
you my own frustration at the conflict between U.S. American Jews
and the State of Israel which occurred in Vienna. At that juncture
point, there was a competition and most of the Soviet Jews,
especially the best trained and younger, were coming to the U.S. I
said at that time that this provided an excellent rationale for the
Soviets to restrict the immigration.) In addition, apparently
Mitterand has offered the services of Air France to the Soviets for
the purpose of emigration.
   2. B.R. has been financing private polls for quite a long time
in Israel on behalf of labor-Peres. They demonstrate an increasing
strength for labor and the high probability of elections, no later
than March 1986.
   3. He confirmed the arrangement with Peres to the effect that
Israel will receive somewhere between $65-$70 million a year for
ten years out of the conclusion of the project. What was also
indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a
portion of those funds will go directly to Labor.
   For both this information, and the emigration above, the obvious
rationale needs to be kept well in mind. There is a need to provide
Israel with an increasing flow of Ashkenazy Jews (from the Soviet
Union) to help balance the influx of Sephardic-Oriental Jews who
have a natural affinity and affiliation with Likud. From the
standpoint of American interests, the advantage is evident.
   4. B.R. indicates that Peres emphatically indicated that the
release of Weir was as a result of the efforts of the State of
Israel, and no one else. He indicated that they would also arrange
for the release of the remaining six. There is a feeling that the
U.S. ``owes'' and that the accomplishment of this project, as
outlined in my memo, is appropriate. It should be emphasized that
things are seen in a totality of the relationship but that in this
istance, they are uncertain and a bit frustrated as to why the
U.S.G. has not more directly facilitated the accomplishment of this
project when it is so obviously in the interest of everyone
involved.
   5. There is to be a OPIC meeting in Vienna October 6. B.R.
intends to send his representative (former Minister of Energy
Calderon of Venezuela _ who is now a member of his Board of
Directors and an employee) to Vienna to meet with Minister Taki,
the Iraqi who is in charge of their oil entity (see my previous
memo). Apparently these men know each other very well. At that
time, Bruce intends to comunicate to Iraq, through Calderon, the
private banking proposal which he is prepared to put together which
would provide funds to Iraq as indicated in my previous memorandum.
   6. The prime minister is very sensitive to the letter which he
sent. He wants it returned if there's not going to be some kind of
appropriate response when he comes to Washington. That appropriate
response would clearly be a meeting with the President and with Bud
McFarlane which would include this project. As you saw from the
letter, he also includes Secretary of State Schultz and I have
expressed myself as to whether or not that is appropriate. In any
event, they apparently find it hard to understand why McFarlane is
not able to comunicate to Iraq, and to S.H. the importance of this
project.
   N.B. I have explained to them the reluctance to become involved
in the promotion of a private venture. Of course, they don't see it
in that light, but rather in the total context of the geo-politics
of the Middle East.
   7. There was a suggestion that I call the P.M. of the middle
country to see what is happening and see if I could prod him along.
I indicated I did not think that was appropriate at this moment. I
also told him that I had had a brief and private conversation with
Bill Casey and had invited me to meet with him in a non-discussion.
The trip to Geneva intervened.

   Here is the text of the letter submitted to
President Reagan on Monday by Navy Secretary James H. Webb
disclosing his decision to resign.
   Dear Mr. President:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Over the past three months the Department of Defense has been
struggling to implement a mandated $33 billion reduction of the
fiscal year 1989 budget approved by you last year. The Navy
Department was directed to absorb a significant share of this
reduction, which eventually became approximately $12 billion.
   Like many others, I have serious concerns regarding the entire
budget reduction process. First, the Department of Defense has been
required to absorb cuts at a ratio almost twice as great as
non-defense programs. Second, many defense reductions themselves
have been made in the wrong areas, and without clear strategic
thought. I am particularly upset with the nature of the cuts as
they affect the department under my authority.
   ``On three separate occasions, the uniformed and civilian
leadership of the Navy Department provided the secretary of defense
with proposed cuts totaling the amount required to meet the budget
reduction, but which also would preserve the cherished goal of your
administration to rebuild our Navy to a minimum level of 600 ships.
   In each case, the advice of this senior leadership, concurred in
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was ignored. I can only conclude that
the decision to reduce the level of our fleet to a point that it
may never reach the 600-ship goal was motivated by other than
military and strategic reasoning.
   During the four years I have served in your administration, I
have repeatedly expressed my gratitude at your decision to rebuild
the greatest Navy in the world. Since I became secretary of the
Navy last year, I have stated just as frequently my belief that the
force levels of our sea services remain minimal and must not be
reduced.
   Even in the current budget environment, such force levels could
have been maintained. Since recommendations to that effect were
rejected by your secretary of defense, I am unable to support him
personally, or to defend this amended budget during budget
deliberations. Consequently, I find it necessary to resign from my
position as secretary of the Navy.
   Thank you for the opportunity to have served our country during
four of our nation's most critical and productive years.
   Respectfully yours,
   James H. Webb Jr.

<TEXT>
   In James H. Webb's best-selling novel ``Fields
of Fire,'' a Vietnam War lieutenant ponders the dignity of men
engaged in battle, and remarks ``it was the fight, not the cause
that mattered.''
   For Webb, who resigned Monday after only 10 months as secretary
of the Navy, there was always a fight or controversy, from his
criticism of the service academies' admission of women in 1979 to
his lashing out at Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, as he did
on his final day on the job.
   ``This building (the Pentagon) needs to be led,'' the
42-year-old Webb told reporters as he announced his departure. ``It
needs leadership. It needs some vision. I'm saying that if I had a
piece of advice to give to Secretary Carlucci, it would be to spend
a lot more time with the top leaders in this building.''
   Furor has dogged Webb almost from the day he was sworn in as
Navy secretary on April 9, 1987.
   Five days after the ceremony, Webb reversed a decision of his
predecessor, John F. Lehman, and ruled that the Navy would no
longer make special accomodations for officers who wanted to play
professional sports.
   Ensign Napoleon McCallum's weekend career with the National
Football League's Los Angeles Raiders thus ended and 7-foot-1
Midshipman David Robinson's eventual start in the National
Basketball Association was delayed.
   In the same month, Webb reversed a Lehman decision. to dismiss a
board of admirals and rejected its promotion recommendations.
L:ehman charged the board had improperly tried to promote nuclear
submariners at the expense of aviation and surface warfare.
   Webb took over the post of overseeing about 584,000 Navy
personnel and approximately 199,000 Marines amid a sea of problems,
including sex scandals that had rocked the Marine Corps, debate
over the size of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and the role of
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair.
   North was all too familiar to Webb. During their student days at
the U.S. Naval Academy, they fought for the brigade boxing
championship. North won.
   A native of St. Joseph, Mo., Webb served in the Pentagon as the
assistant secretary for reserve affairs on May 3, 1984. He was
about to quit that job when then Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger made an offer he couldn't resist _ the job as secretary
of the navy.
   Webb had served previsously on the Republican staff of the the
Committee on Veterans Affairs of the House of Representatives.
   A 1968 graduate of the Naval Academy, Webb served with the 5th
Marine Regiment in Vietnam as rifle platoon leader and company
commander, earning the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Star
medals for valor and two Purple Hearts.
   After the war, he left the Marine Corps and earned a law degree
from the Georgetown University Law Center, where he won the Horan
competition for excellence in legal writing.
   Webb once said, ``In my mind, I am a writer. In my heart, I am a
soldier, and I always will be.''
   Webb wrote three novels, including ``Fields of Fire,'' ``A Sense
of Honor,'' and ``A Country Such As This,'' and a non-fiction book
on military strategy, ``Micronesia and U.S. Pacific Strategy: A
Blueprint for the 1980s.''
   But an article for Washingtonian Magazine, ``Women Can't
Fight,'' was his most controversial piece of writing, haunting him
during his Senate confirmation hearings for the Navy's top job. In
the article, Webb wrote that women are ruining the military
academies by poisoning their ability to train men for combat.
   Webb reiterated his opposition to committing women to combat
during the hearings, but said he had accepted the change in the
academies.
   In fact last June, Webb ordered the Navy to allow female
technicians aboard submarines for sea trials to test new equipment.
In announcing the decision, Webb said the policy ``will reinforce
the Department of Navy's equal employment opportunity objectives of
full integration of women into the civilian work force.''

   Here is a text of a portion of the two-page
handwritten letter on Sept. 19, 1985, from then-Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres to Attorney General Edwin Meese III dealing
with the proposed $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project:
   Dear Mr. Meese:
   ... I am following with great interest the projected pipeline
from Iraq to Jordan as a possible additive to introduce economic
consideration to this troubled land. Apparently a Israeli guarantee
may help to pave the way to the construction of this P@L.
   I would go a long way to help it out. But then discretion is
demanded on our part.
   I shall be in the USA in the middle of October, and I intend to
talk it over with George Shultz, for whom I have the highest regard.
   Considering the short while of my staying in Washington, I
believe it may be of great help, if George will be informed ahead
of time.
   I shall appreciate your good office in this respect. I have
asked my friend Bruce and Bob to let you know the whole story, and
I shall depend on your judgment about the best way to handle this
matter.
   With many thanks
   Shimon Peres

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply, Stock Prices Continue Advance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped in Tokyo trading today and stock
prices advanced for the ninth straight day.
   After opening at 129.27 yen, the dollar fell by midday to 128.65
and closed the day at 128.50, down 1.45 yen from Monday`s close of
129.95.
   The dollar's fall was attributed to overnight setbacks in New
York and London and strong selling pressure from foreign banks,
dealers said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices closed higher at the
end of Tuesday's session, led by large-capital issues such as
steels and heavy industrials.
   The Nikkei Stock Average closed at 24,949.45 points, up 102.74
points, or 0.04 percent. Volume in the first section was a
moderately heavy 850 million shares, up from 830 million shares
Monday.
   ``There's nothing really big out there to push prices up or
down, but it`s got to run out of steam sometime,'' said Ron Napier,
vice president of Salomon Brothers, referring to the longest
consecutive advance in stock prices since August.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a news conference today
that the higher prices on the stock exchange are the result of
Japan's sound economic fundamentals and optimism about a bright
economic future.

   Nine organizations, including the American
Academy of Pediatrics and the National Education Association, are
forming a coalition to lobby on behalf of children with AIDS.
   Edward Conner, a member of the pediatrics academy, noted in
Monday's announcement that about 80 percent of the known 839 cases
of children with AIDS in the United States were born to mothers who
are drug abusers themselves or sexual partners of drug abusers.
   ``If we could reach these prospective parents today, we could
stop this expanding problem in nine months,'' he said at a press
conference.
   Rather than focus on a particular goal, representatives of the
nine organizations said they would engage in a ``generic'' effort
to make sure children are not forgotten as programs to combat AIDS
are formulated and implemented.
   Other members of the coalition: Children's Defense Fund,
American Psychological Association, National Association of
Community Health Centers, Child Welfare League of America, American
Nurses Association, National Association of Children's Hospitals
and Related Institutions and the Western Association of Children's
Hospitals.

<HEAD>State, Local Government Workers Got Raises Averaging 4.9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local government workers received
annual pay raises last year averaging 4.9 percent under collective
bargaining contracts with public employee unions, according to the
Labor Department.
   The pay increases were below the average 5.7 percent raises
received by he same employees in 1986. But the workers still fared
better last year than federal employees who got a 3 percent pay
increase and private sector workers whose wages rose an average 3.3
percent, the department said Monday.
   However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that union
contracts in the public and private sectors differ significantly.
   State and local governments, for example, tend to have a higher
proportion of professional and white-collar workers. Union
contracts in the private sector, on the other hand, often include
lump-sum bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments excluded from the
wage calculations and usually absent in the public sector.
   The figures showed that local government workers with wage
increases averaging 5.3 percent outpaced state employees workers
with an average 4.3 percent raise.

Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's long and sometimes
bumpy road to filling a vacant seat on the Supreme Court has came
to an anti-climactic end as Justice Anthony M. Kennedy spent his
first day on the bench.
   Four hours of subdued technical arguments in the hushed,
crimson-draped courtroom Monday were a sharp contrast to the noisy
and partisan battles that preceded Kennedy's Feb. 3 confirmation by
the Senate.
   Kennedy looked solemn as he entered the chamber, strode past the
American flag, stood before the pale marble columns and took his
seat at the end of the row of nine justices. That seat, on the far
right as spectators face the court, is the traditional place for
the high court's newest member.
   The former appellate judge from Sacramento, Calif., a man with a
reputation for being deliberative and well prepared, didn't say a
word until nearly an hour had elapsed. And then he asked only one
question.
   Kennedy's presence brought the court to full strength for the
first time since Justice Lewis F. Powell resigned in June.

   The producer of ``Jeopardy'' has

City, Mo.
   But producer George Vosburgh stopped short of conceding an error.

last week.
   ``We are not necessarily incorrect. ... We just will not refer

   The show intends to clear up the matter and other recent

   After hearing about the reference to his city on a December

Kansas City, Kan., was a city in its own right.
   Steineger said he was satisfied, though still somewhat miffed.
   ``I guess when the mayor said they were wrong, they were
wrong,'' he said. ``We certainly like to be recognized as our own

   Slum dwellers gathered possessions
from condemned homes and rescue workers searched mud and rubble for
victims of four days of floods and mudslides in Rio that have
killed at least 75 people.
   Civil defense spokewoman Sonia Hadid said Monday that many poor
people, who perch homes on the steep hillsides that jut up through
this city of 5.6 million, were refusing to obey orders to abandon
their shacks.
   ``They prefer to risk their lives than abandon their worldly
goods,'' she said. Officials warned that torrential rains that let
up Monday had loosened boulders and earth and said they expected
more mudslides.
   ``Get out while there's still time,'' Mayor Roberto Saturnino
Braga told slum dwellers as civil defense officials condemned whole
hillside communities.
   Flash floods and mudslides have punished Rio de Janeiro state
since Feb. 2, killing at least 268 people and leaving more than
13,000 homeless.
   Rains devastated the nearby mountain resort of Petropolis during
the first 10 days, briefly let up for Carnival, then returned late
Friday to plague Rio.
   The Weather Bureau said an Antarctic cold front over Rio dumped
5.1 inches of rain on Saturday alone. Normal rainfall for the month
is 5.5 inches.
   Roads turned into raging rivers that tossed cars and carried
away shanties, rubbish and stones. The rains washed out city
streets, power lines, knocked down large trees and filled homes
with mud.
   In the wealthy Santa Teresa hillside district, a massive
mudslide tumbled onto a three-story hospital wing, killing at least
11 elderly patients and staff. More victims were expected to be
pulled from the thick mud.
   In the working-class Abolicao district, firefighters continued
their search for at least one more resident of a three-story
building of six apartments built on a hillside that fell face
forward late Sunday.
   Officials said 12 bodies were pulled from the concrete and
twisted metal, while 16 dwellers were pulled out alive.
   Three television networks broadcast appeals for donations of
food, clothes, medicines and mattresses to aid the nearly 9,500
city residents rendered homeless by the inundation.
   The homeless were being housed in schools, churches and public
buildings that have been converted into shelters.
   Ms. Hadid, the civil defense spokeswoman, said the death toll of
75 included only bodies that had reached the morgue.
   ``The final total certainly will be higher,'' she said.

   After months of preparation, pop star
Michael Jackson was ``raring to go'' for tonight's first concert of
his 13-city U.S. tour, his spokesman said.
   Jackson spent Monday night at Kemper Arena rehearsing and
checking sound for the two Kansas City shows, which are expected to
draw about 33,000 people.
   Jackson is confident about his tour, press manager Lee Solters
said.
   ``He's a hard worker, a perfectionist,'' Solters said.
``Everybody is in tune with him. They all keep up with him and they
all respect him for his professionalism.''
   The 29-year-old Jackson will perform here tonight and Wednesday,
before moving on to Madison Square Garden in New York for concerts
March 3-6.
   Tickets for the shows here were virtually sold out, Solters
said, although some limited-view seats were still available. The
Kansas City Star reported Monday that some tickets were being sold
for $200.
   The show requires 35 tons of equipment, which are carried in 11
48-foot-long trucks.
   Jackson's 15-member troupe has seven musicians, four backup
singers and four dancers. A 60-member crew works behind the scenes.
About 70 local people have been hired as stagehands and security
staff, said John Friedmann, director of Kemper Arena.
   The show will include four video screens suspended from the
ceiling, 72 speakers, nearly 3,000 lights and special effects.

   The chairman of Rep. Jack Kemp's Texas campaign is
asking supporters of Sen. Bob Dole and Pat Robertson to abandon
their candidates and join the Kemp campaign because of the refusal
of Dole and Robertson to appear in a debate last week in Dallas.
   Bob Holland, the Kemp official, call the action by Robertson and
Dole a snub of Texas.
   ``By their failure to face George Bush in one of his home states
Friday night, Bob Dole made clear that he has written off Texas and
Pat Robertson committed another serious blunder casting further
doubts on his electability,'' Holland said.
   The withdrawals left only Kemp and Bush to debate.
   ``We have had many disappointed former Dole and Robertson and
for that matter (Pete) du Pont supporters calling us looking for a
new home and we want them to know they are welcome to join us,''
Holland said.

   Agriculture Commissioner Ward ``Butch''
Burnette said 32 calls from his department's phones to supporters
of the presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. were made
to discuss official business, not the Democrat's race.
   Burnette, Gore's Kentucky campaign chairman, and two of his

   Burnette said six calls to Gore headquarters in Arlington, Va.,
were made to clarify news reports published locally Jan. 19 about

however, Jan. 12-14, according to The Courier-Journal.
   The newspaper reported in today's editions that more than 70
calls were made in December and January from state-government
telephones to offices and supporters of Gore.
   The total cost of the 73 calls was $58.97, not including tax.
   The day he was named Gore's state chairman, Burnette said, he
issued a memo to employees telling them not to use state facilities
on Gore's behalf.

   First Lt. Issam Rahmeh, who was visiting a patient, died
instantly and four other visitors were injured, said the spokesman,
who cannot be named in line with standing regulations.
   He said it had not been determined how the grenade slipped from
Rahmeh's belt. The army was investigating the incident.

   The American Medical Association, stressing that
it opposes euthanasia, says First Amendment rights should outweigh
an order that it identify the author of a mercy-killing essay.
   Citing the U.S. Constitution and a state free-press law, the AMA
filed a motion Monday in Cook County Circuit Court to quash a
subpoena from the state's attorney's office seeking the author's
name.
   The essay, titled ``It's Over, Debbie,'' was written by a
resident physician who described injecting a fatal dose of morphine
into a 20-year-old woman dying of ovarian cancer. It was published
in the Journal of the American Medical Association's Jan. 8 edition.
   ``JAMA's confidential sources are protected by the First
Amendment and by the Illinois Reporters Privilege Act,'' AMA
general counsel Kirk Johnson wrote in a statement accompanying the
motion.
   ``As described in our motion, the debate and controversy which
the publication has generated is exactly what the First Amendment
is all about.
   ``The AMA supports the privilege asserted by Dr. George
Lundberg,'' the journal's editor-in-chief, ``to protect JAMA's
confidential sources, not withstanding that the AMA opposes the
practice of euthanasia and that AMA believes the action described
in the essay in unethical,'' Johnson wrote.
   ``Physicians and their organizations also have an ethical duty,
however, embodied in the Hippocratic oath, to teach education and
inform their fellow physicians,'' he wrote. ``It is to fulfill this
latter obligation that the AMA publishes JAMA and gives it
editorial independence.''
   Attorney Newton Minow, a former chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission who is helping Johnson represent the AMA,
said he did not know whether the essay's author was aware of the
controversy.
   Lundberg has said he published the essay to spark debate over
the issue of mercy killing.
   ``I expected a major reaction, but I didn't realize the extent
to which the country was ready for an extraordinary response,''
Lundberg said.
   ``We have clearly touched many raw nerves, and many people have
been thinking about many of the diverse issues involved.''
   He has said he believes the essay describes an actual event. But
on Monday, he said ``the account does have enough vagueness to
welcome critical analysis as to whether it happened, or happened in
this way.''
   Officials in the state's attorney's office have repeatedly
declined to discuss the matter, as is routine during a continuing
investigation.
   ``We're not confirming or denying that we're even looking into
this,'' spokesman Terry Levin said Monday.
   Johnson said a subpoena was served a week ago today.

   The creators of a ``minicow'' produced
near this northern town through cross-breeding and genetic
engineering claim the smaller species can revolutionize cattle and
milk production in the Third World.
   The 27 animals grazing on a ranch at nearby Tanleon are the
product of 18 years and six generations of genetic manipulation.
The smaller versions of the ox-like Brazilian zebu or Brahma
species stand 3 feet and weigh 300 pounds.
   The experimenters began with a small pair of zebu that weighed
more than a ton each and stood nearly 5 feet tall.
   ``Each generation has become about eight inches shorter than the
one before it,'' says Angel Castrillon, the local rancher who has
conducted the minicow experiment since its start. ``We have created
a genetic work that produces almost the same quantity of milk as a
normal cow, occupies much less space and uses fewer resources,'' he
told a visitor.
   People working on the project believe the mincows will enable
many densely populated, land-poor countries to start or upgrade
their cattle industries.
   Ten minicows can graze on less than three acres of land, the
area one normal cow generally requires. Those 10 minicows produce
2,970 pounds of meat, about 330 pounds more than the one big cow
would.
   Horses and other animals have been reduced in size in other
parts of the world, Castrillon said. But, he said, ``what surprised
us was that the minicows are producing three of four liters (about
one gallon) of milk a day, compared to the six liters (about 1.5
gallons) that a normal cow produces.''
   Castrillon, whose ranch is in the fertile ``Huasteca'' region of
north central Mexico, first proposed the idea to Manuel Berruecos,
a geneticist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, at a
Mexico City conference.
   The rancher said he suggested doing the opposite of what animal
breeders traditionally do: instead of producing bigger and heavier
specimens, why not make them smaller, on the model of the bonsai
trees in Japanese gardens?
   ``Unfortunately we have the theory and the prejudice that the
bigger things are the better,'' Berruecos said in an interview in
Mexico City. ``We want to make everything bigger, but the world
isn't growing. Our project may seem like science fiction, but we
are close to a world that perhaps will have to adopt these (types
of) measures.''
   To achieve the smaller species, experimenters selected
prospective breeding candidates with small heads and cross-bred to
achieve smaller offspring.
   In the laboratory, Berruecos works to weaken and eventually
eliminate altogether large-growth genes in the herd's semen.
   Berruecos, who holds a doctorate from the University of North
Carolina, claims that ``in terms of quality, our experience shows
no difference in the milk or the meat.''
   Field specialists from West Germany, Japan and the United States
are watching the experiments with interest. In fact, Castrillon
said one American offered $1 million to take over the research, an
offer he said he rejected.
   Castrillon's ranch is home to 15 adult minicows and a dozen
offspring. Another three are under care of the veterinary faculty
at the national university.
   ``The minicows are gentle, but also very strong. They come close
to you and strongly nudge your legs,'' said Anabella Castrillon,
the rancher's wife.
   The researchers' next step?
   ``We're planning to cross the tiny zebus with the Jersey type,
which is small and the best milk producer,'' Castrillon said.
   He said he will continue cross-breeding until he produces the
tiniest possible species with maximum productive efficiency.
   ``We're thinking that this species would be about 2 feet tall.''

<HEAD>Religious Broadcasters Fear Another Blow From Swaggart's Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious broadcasters who lost financial support following last
year's scandals and controversy face another potentially hard blow
from the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart's confession of sexual misconduct.
   ``My feeling is that there will be more damage, and the
credibility of those of us in Christian broadcasting will be hurt a
little bit more,'' Jerry Rose, president of National Religious
Broadcasters, said Monday.
   ``This is not what we are about, and we have spent an inordinate
amount of time dealing with these issues,'' said Rose, who operates
religious station WCFC-TV in Chicago.
   Swaggart, among the nation's most widely watched television
preachers, stepped down from his pulpit Sunday after confessing he
had sinned against God and his family.
   Officials with his church, the Assemblies of God, said he had
admitted to a long history of sexual problems and would be
prohibited from preaching for a minimum of three months while he
undergoes rehabilitation.
   Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for the Rev. Jerry Falwell, judged the
damage to television ministries to be survivable.
   ``I look at the example of a Gary Hart moral failure _ that did
not ruin the Democratic party or other Democratic candidates, but
it did ruin Gary Hart,'' DeMoss said.
   It didn't work that way a year ago. Some of the big ministries,
including Swaggart's, bled from the wounds inflicted by Jim
Bakker's adultery and high living in the PTL ministry, and Oral
Roberts' do-or-die appeal for $8 million.
   In the aftermath, no one sounded more cynical and disillusioned
than Swaggart. ``You can stay more holy a lot of times watching
`Miami Vice' than watching so-called Christian television,'' he
said in one of his rousing sermons a year ago.
   ``A lot of people saw Jimmy as a pacesetter for doing what
needed to be done in the church, so in this case it is shocking,''
Rose said.
   The Rev. James Robison, a TV evangelist who is seen on about 150
stations around the country, said the fear of criticism from
Swaggart and other preachers may have led Bakker to hide his own
problem, rather than address it.
   ``Jim Bakker told me himself, he said, `I wanted help, but I was
so afraid of what would be said,''' Robison said early today on
ABC's ``Nightline.''
   At CBN, whose operations include the Christian Broadcasting
Network and CBN University, spokesman Benton Miller declined to
speculate on the impact from Swaggart's problems.
   Last year, however, he said contributions to CBN dropped 32.5
percent from April to October, and have remained flat. When CBN cut
nearly 500 employees last summer, founder Pat Robertson blamed the
controversies surrounding Bakker and Roberts.
   Roberts, based in Tulsa, Okla., had said that God might ``call
me home'' if he didn't raise $8 million by the end of March, the
month of Bakker's confession and resignation from PTL. CBN's fiscal
year started April 1.
   ``We had to take the whole hit of that, plus the change in the
talent mix for the 700 Club, plus the drop in oil prices ... plus
the recent October stock market plunge,'' Miller said Monday. ``All
four of those factors hit us all at once.''
   The change in the talent mix involved Robertson's departure from
the broadcast to seek the Republican presidential nomination, and
the resignation of co-host Ben Kinchlow. CBN cut 145 more employees
in November, leaving a workforce of 1,174, though it has also
managed to expand its television programming and launch a radio
service, Miller said.
   DeMoss said contributions to Falwell's ministry had rebounded,
but on Monday, WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh announced it was dropping
Falwell's program because he was $50,000 in arrears.
   Oma Bradner, who handles Falwell's television accounts, said
late Monday a check was mailed on Friday.
   Swaggart had a larger audience _ 1,720,000 households per week
last November _ than any other video evangelist, according to the
Arbitron rating service. The A.C. Nielsen Co. put Swaggart's
audience at 860,000 households, second to Robert Schuller's
audience of 1,189,000 for the ``Hour of Power,'' but Nielsen said
Swaggart was seen on the most stations, 286.
   Arbitron reported that Swaggart's audience had been 2,161,000
households last February, before the PTL and Roberts controversies.
Between February and November, Arbitron said, Schuller's audience
dropped from 1.7 million households to 1.4 million, Roberts' from
1.15 million to 900,000, and Falwell's ``Old Time Gospel Hour''
from 616,000 to 495,000.
   Those figures are for broadcast audience only; most programs
reach additional viewers on cable television.
   Rose said Swaggart's weekly broadcast would remain on his
station at least until he sees what Assemblies of God leaders
decide to do.

   A fire slightly damaged the office of
Interior Minister Jose Barrionuevo today, the ministry said. No
injuries were reported.
   A ministry spokesman said the fire apparently was caused by an
electrical short circuit in the second-floor office of the
minister's personal secretary and spread to three adjacent offices.
   Firefighters put out the fire in 15 minutes, the spokesman said.
   The Interior Ministry building is located near the central
Colombus Square on the city's main north-south thoroughfare.
   Barrionuevo was not in his office at the time the fire began,
although members of his press office, security guards and cleaning
help were.

   House prosecutors for Gov. Evan Mecham's
impeachment trial have submitted a list of 41 potential witnesses,
including the governor and his brother, Willard.
   But Mecham's attorney Murray Miller wrote a letter Monday saying
he does not want to provide a witness list or to turn over any
documentation yet.
   In a letter to Chief Justice Frank Gordon, who will preside over
the trial that's scheduled to begin Monday, Miller said Mecham
believes that holding the Senate trial before his criminal trial
would violate his constitutional rights.
   ``He therefore does not wish to turn over any documentation or
witnesses that he may call in his defense at this time,'' Miller
said.
   The governor's lawyer has indicated that he may go to court in
an effort to get the Senate trial delayed until after the criminal
trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan. That trial
was delayed on Monday until March 22.
   The House impeached Mecham on Feb. 5 and accused him of hiding
the $350,000 loan, misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol
fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an
investigation of an alleged death threat.
   The witness list submitted Monday by the prosecution included
many people who appeared before the House select committee on
impeachment, including state Department of Public Safety Director
Ralph Milstead and Mecham campaign fundraiser Bill Long.
   Also in the new list were people who did not testify before the
House panel, including Tempe developer Barry Wolfson, who provided
the governor's $350,000 campaign loan. Wolfson was subpoenaed on
Monday to provide documents and testify before the Senate.
   Mecham also was subpoenaed on Monday to provide documents,
according to House attorney Paul Eckstein.
   Also on the list were Donna Carlson, the former Mecham aide who
was the subject of the alleged death threat, and former state
official Lee Watkins, who is accused of making the threat.
   The list included an unidentified polygrapher who performed a
lie-detector test on Watkins to determine if he actually made the
threat.
   All sides are scheduled to meet in a pretrial conference Friday.

   Smoke-free workplaces are becoming more
common as employers listen to their workers' health concerns,
according to a survey.
   ``The injurious effects of passive smoking have been
well-publicized, and people object to working in that kind of
environment,'' said Victor Lindquist, author of the 42nd annual
Northwestern University Lindquist-Endicott Report.
   ``It seems to me that organizations are really trying to bend
over to be accomodating to the non-smoker. There also were more
firms spending money to help their employees stop smoking,''
Lindquist said Monday.
   His survey of 226 large and mid-sized companies found 70 percent
restrict or are preparing to limit smoking in the workplace.
   On-the-job restrictions included permitting smoking only in
designated areas, segregating workers into smoking and non-smoking
areas, and equipping smokers with smokeless ashtrays.
   ``I was really surprised at the extent to which this had
surfaced as a personnel issue,'' said Lindquist said. ``Today,
smoking is pretty passe.''
   Lindquist said it was the first year he had asked companies
about smoking policies in the survey, which began in 1945 and is
used by thousands of corporations to establish starting salaries
for college graduates and review personnel trends.
   The 1988 questionnaire drew responses from a cross-section of
major industrial and geographic sectors. Lindquist declined to
identify any of the companies.
   In addition to the smoking regulations, the survey found:
   _ 38 percent of companies conduct pre-employment testing for
drug use and 8 percent said they would begin such testing in the
next year.
   _ 2.2 percent plan to begin pre-employment testing for exposure
to the AIDS virus by the end of the year.
   _ 1 percent said they will begin pre-employment genetic testing
to screen for possible diseases.
   _ 66 percent said they provide guaranteed reinstatement to
employees who take parental leave after having a child, and 20
percent provide payroll services that allow employees to have money
deducted from paychecks that is designated to pay for day care and
is tax-free.
   USG Corp., a Chicago-based maker of acoustical ceiling tile and
thermal insulation, drew national headlines a year ago when it
warned its 1,300 workers to quit smoking _ at work and at home _ or
face possible firing.
   The survey found only one company that had completely banned
on-the-job smoking, but several prohibited smoking in the private
offices of corporate executives, said Lindquist, Northwestern's
director of placement.
   Although 70 percent restricted smoking or were planning to do
so, just 34 percent said they discussed that policy with job
applicants during interviews, he said.
   Walker Merryman, vice president of The Tobacco Institute, a
Washington-based lobbying group for the industry, said he couldn't
comment on the survey's findings without details about the types,
locations and identities of the companies surveyed.
   But he said the 70 percent finding ``is substantially higher
than anything I've seen recently.''
   For example, Merryman said, he had seen a recent scientific,
random-sample survey of businesses nationwide that found 36 percent
with policies on smoking.

   The sex scandals surrounding two
prominent Assemblies of God ministers should not taint the more
than 30,000 others in the church, of whom only a tiny number are
ever disciplined, an official says.
   The evangelical church, which counts more than 16 million
adherents worldwide and operates four colleges, is investigating
the misconduct of its most popular television preacher, Louisiana
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   On Monday, a day after Swaggart temporarily stepped down from
his pulpit, church officials said he had admitted to a long history
of sexual misconduct and would be prohibited from preaching for a
minimum of three months while he undergoes rehabilitation.
   Another prominent television evangelist, the PTL's Jim Bakker,
lost his Assemblies of God credentials last year amid charges of
sexual misconduct. Swaggart was said to have been active in
uncovering that scandal and Bakker accused him of plotting to take
over PTL.
   ``Those are the only two in our whole denomination that have
that kind of recognition,'' church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said
Monday. ``So people may feel that this is indicative of the
Assemblies of God denomination, and that is not true.
   ``We have over 30,000 credentialed ministers in the Assemblies
of God in the United States. At any given time, any given year,
fewer than one-half of 1 percent are ever called into discipline.''
   Mrs. Turnage said 12 areas of misconduct, ranging from doctrinal
aberrations to moral failure, call for disciplinary action.
   Swaggart's suspension and two-year rehabilitation program must
be approved by the church's Executive Presbytery in Springfield,
according to the church's by-laws, she said.
   Swaggart appeared before his congregation in Baton Rouge, La.,
on Sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an act
he did not describe publicly. He said he would not return to his
pulpit until the church investigation was completed.

   Here is the text of a statement Monday
night by Cecil Janway, district superintendent of the Assemblies of
God, about the discipline recommended for evangelist Jimmy Swaggart:
   We accept his confession of specific incidents of a moral
failure. Based on this detailed confession and the evidence we
observed of true humility and repentance, we have offered him
rehabilitation in accordance with the bylaws of the General Council
and Louisiana District of the Assemblies of God.
   Brother Swaggart has submitted to the terms of rehabilitation as
follows:
   1. Brother Swaggart will begin a two-year rehabilitation period
effective immediately.
   2. Brother Swaggart will be required to refrain from preaching
for a minimum of three months, except in fulfillment of present
commitments involving foreign governments during that period.
   3. During the time of rehabilitation, Brother Swaggart will be
relieved of his duties as co-pastor of Family Worship Center,
retaining the right to preach in the Family Worship Center after
the period described in paragraph 2.
   4. Brother Swaggart will receive counsel and supervision in
weekly conferences with three members of the Louisiana District
Presbytery during the period of rehabilitation.
   5. Brother Swaggart will submit quarterly written reports to the
district superintendent and monthly written reports to his
sectional presbyter.
   Again, no doubt much speculation and rumor will find its way
into the secular media. But, for the church, the body of Christ,
such speculation and rumor has no place.
   We urge Brother Swaggart and his associates to resist the
request of those outside the church to respond to questions.
Brother Swaggart has been in complete cooperation with the
Assemblies of God and has pledged to work within the structure of
the church.

   The U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of a
suit challenging what a Tennessee fundamentalist group calls
godless textbooks will enable schools to get on with teaching
children, an education official says.
   ``We've been relieved of a lot of pressure, pressure that's been
on our shoulders since 1983,'' Robert Cooper, Hawkins County school
superintendent, said Monday.
   The lawsuit was filed that year by seven born-again Christian
families, who objected on religious grounds to the list of required
reading textbooks for grades 1-8. The books included passages in
``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Cinderella,'' works by science fiction
writer Isaac Asimov, Hans Christian Andersen and anthropologist
Margaret Mead.
   After a trial, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hull ruled in 1986
that the families' religious freedom had been violated, awarded
them $50,000 in damages and allowed their children to avoid the
reading classes.
   But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling
and threw out the families' lawsuit.
   On Monday, the high court dismissed the families' appeal of that
decision.
   ``At this time we have no alternative other than to accept the
Supreme Court ruling,'' said Vicki Frost, one of the plaintiffs.
   Her husband, Roger, said the high court's action left
fundamentalists across the country persecuted.
   Farley Meade, another plaintiff, said: ``There are a lot of poor
Christian parents who can't send their children to religious
schools. To me that's a sad day for religious freedom in America.''
   The president of the organization that financed the lawsuit
called the Supreme Court action ``the most coercive ruling in the
history of religious liberty litigation.''
   ``We are confident that this dreadful ruling will eventually be
overturned,'' said Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women of
America, in a statement issued in Washington, D.C.
   State Attorney General W.J. Michael Cody praised the court
action, saying, ``Any alternative disposition would have been the
cause of chaos in the school system.''
   Cooper said the protracted case did not particularly disturb the
county's 6,800 public school students ``but as far as
administrative personnel, school board members and even some
teachers, it was very disruptive.'' He said making copies of
records and testifying in court took time that could have been
better used in teaching.
   The seven children involved in the lawsuit have long since
transferred from to private schools, he said, adding that about
4,700 children in grades 1-8 were affected by the lawsuit.
   Robert Sharp, legal counsel for the state Education Department,
said the case never interfered with the state's selection of
approved textbooks or otherwise changed operation of the department.
   ``The one issue that could have caused turmoil was ... whether
there would be other parents who would seek to `opt out' of reading
programs in other schools,'' he said. ``None did.''

<HEAD>U.N. Command Charges North Korea With Plane Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. military commander today charged
North Korea with destroying a civilian airliner to wreck the 1988
Olympic Games and accused communist officials of being
``criminals.''
   Rear Admiral William T. Pendley of the United Nations Command
traded accusations and taunts with North Korean military
representatives over the destruction of the plane. The two sides
also accused each other of fomenting tension and preparing for war.
   ``I want you to tell those who are responsible for killing 115
innocent civilians that their objective, to discourage the
community of nations from coming to the Seoul Olympics, will not be
met,'' Pendley said.
   Maj. Gen. Li Tae Ho, the chief North Korean delegate, said the
communist country had nothing to do with the attack. He charged
that South Korean military authorities destroyed the plane as part
of a scheme to retain power and to discredit the north. ``You are
stirring up confrontation and leading the situation on the
peninsula to the brink of war,'' Li warned.
   The United States, South Korea and other nations have charged
that North Korea was behind the Nov. 29 bombing of a Korean Air
Boeing 707 over the Andaman Sea with the loss of all 115 people on
board. North Korea has denied it had anything to do with the
attack. The wreckage of the plane was never found.
   The charges were made at the first meeting of the Military
Armistice Commission since the loss of the plane. The panel polices
the cease-fire that ended the Korean War between north and south in
1953.
   The United Nations Command delegation presented a videotape of a
televised confession made last month in Seoul by Kim Hyon Hui who
said she was a North Korean agent and that she destroyed the plane
with a bomb as part of attempts to disrupt the Olympic Games that
start in Seoul in September.
   Ms. Kim rode on an early leg of the KAL flight and she and a
male companion took poison when they were detained in Bahrain. The
man later died.
   Li and other North Korean and Chinese officials did not watch
the tape and studiously stared at the ceiling or out of windows.
   Pendley said the confession was damning evidence that the north
could not refute. ``You thought you had committed the perfect
crime, but, like all criminals, you made a mistake,'' he said.
   North Korea has been demanding to co-host the Olympic Games. The
International Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the
demand.
   The North Korean delegation replied with a rambling accusation
charging that the South Korean government bombed the plane to
frighten people into voting for the government in the Dec. 16
elections.
   Pendley rejected the North Korean accusations and repeated a
demand that those responsible for the attack be punished and North
Korea apologize for the incident. ``You should honestly admit this
terrible act,'' he said.
   North Korea called the Military Armistice Commission meeting to
demand the United States and South Korea abandon plans for annual
``Team Spirit'' military exercises involving 200,000 men next month.
   It was the first Military Armistice Commission meeting since
October.
   The North Korean delegates charged the exercises were
preparations for an American nuclear attack and warned that the
divided peninsula was being pushed toward war. ``You have nuclear
war plans worked out,'' Li charged.
   Pendley dismissed the North Korean accusations and said the
exercises were lawful military activities intended to guarantee the
safety of South Korea. He said the United Nations Command had no
intention of starting a war and posed no threat to North Korea or
peace in the region.
   ``Team Spirit exercises will continue as long as the threat of
aggression exists,'' he said.
   The United States maintains 40,000 troops in South Korea and
heads the United Nations Command, which represents the 16 nations
that fought under UN auspices against North Korea and China during
the Korean War.

   A man who fought City Hall to keep
his seven-tiered tree house in his back yard can continue to use
the structure as long as he makes some safety improvements, city
officials say.
   ``I feel just fine with all of this,'' Mark Tucker said after
officials announced the outcome Monday. ``My kids feel fine that
they can play in their tree house.''
   St. Louis Park officials had objected to the tree house last
May, saying it was unsafe and exposed the city to possible lawsuits.
   The dispute was taken to Hennepin County District Court, where
an agreement was reached during a hearing in Minneapolis on Feb. 5.
Judge Daniel Hart approved the compromise on Feb. 8, ruling that
Tucker can continue to use the structure for his children and a few
friends as long as the safety improvements are made.
   Tucker, 38, gained national publicity during his fight over the
tree house and for a pair of 10-day jail sentences he served in
November 1987 and in January for housing code violations at
Minneapolis apartment buildings he owns.
   The city said the agreement states that only the five Tucker
children, who range from age 4 to 18, and up to four other people
can use the tree house at any one time.
   Tucker may not use the tree house as a business office anymore
or hold any more open houses, such as one last year to solicit
support in his fight with the city, the agreement said.
   The agreement requires Tucker by June to provide the tree house
ladder with safety cages and hand grips approved by a structural
engineer. The structure must be inspected for safety every year and
after unusually severe weather, such as winds in excess of 40 mph,
heavy snowstorms and ice storms, the city said.

   Gary Kasparov leaned on the table, staring at
the chess board. He scratched his head, studied some more and
accepted a draw.
   Eleven-year-old Josh Waitzkin smiled and shook the world
champion's hand. This memory would last.
   ``Well done,'' wrote Kasparov as he autographed the boy's score
sheet, which Josh will frame.
   It was a heady day for all concerned Monday as Kasparov, the
24-year-old Soviet hero, spent his first full day in the United
States. And 59 even younger chess buffs got a chance to face the
champ in a simultaneous exhibition in a Bronx elementary school
gymnasium.
   ``I was surprised at how long I stayed in _ 42 moves is a lot
against the world champion,'' said Benjamin Shuldiner, a freckled
10-year-old who was checkmated two hours.
   Kasparov, dapper in a gray-and-tan sweater, tan slacks and green
scarf, arrived at the inner-city school smiling and joking, taking
time to embrace curious students and pose for pictures.
   Asked how he expected to do against the children _ a routine
exhibition for any grandmaster _ he laughed.
   ``It is not a serious competition, it is a joke,'' he said in
accented English. ``It's a special exhibition for children. ...
   ``I will be happy if I am upset. If I am upset, they will be
every happy, this is the main goal of the `simul,' to make people
happy.''
   His opponents managed two draws.
   When Kasparov left, he resembled an American sports hero,
working his way through a knot of admirers, signing autographs,
posing for more pictures, shaking hands and ducking into a
limousine.
   ``It's a great day for chess,'' said the champion. ``This is the
beginning of the promotion of chess in the U.S.A.''
   Kasparov said such exhibitions to spark children's interest in
the game are ``a very important tradition'' in chess.
   ``I think it is the duty of the world champion,'' he said. ``If
we get a lot of boys and girls into chess, we can hope that in the
nearest future we will find a new wave of talent.''
   He'll spend five days in New York, playing two more exhibitions
and meeting Mayor Edward Koch on Thursday.
   ``I have just seen the city from the window,'' he said. ``I'll
try to find some time to see something amazing.''
   He spent Sunday evening at the Manhattan Chess Club, where he
played 24 games of speed chess, winning all but one, which he drew.
   ``He played blitz chess,'' said club president Doug Bellizzi.
``Offhand, not serious games, with some very strong players. I saw
two brilliant combinations. This is Mozart, this is Beethoven.''
   Or, as 14-year-old K.K. Karanja said, ``it's like playing Larry
Bird or Michael Jordan one-on-one.''
   Karanja, however, a former national elementary school champion,
managed one of the two draws allowed by Kasparov on Monday. In most
of the games, Kasparov moved instantly, working his way around the
large square of tables. At times _ against Waitzkin, for instance _
he had to stop and think.
   ``I was pretty confident the whole way. I played a few
inaccuracies,'' said Waitzkin, a student at Manhattan's exclusive
Dalton School.
   Classes of students were led through the gym for a glimpse of
Kasparov.
   Kasparov's opponents ranged in age from 7 to 15, and came from
such disadvantaged neighborhoods as the south Bronx, Harlem, East
New York and Brownsville, as well as more affluent areas of
Manhattan.

   The Ventura Freeway's dubious claim to fame
as the world's busiest piece of road is not only dubious _ it's
false, say transportation officials. And some smog-choked motorists
are unhappy about it.
   ``How did this happen? I appreciated its reputation even as I
was caught in its snarls,'' said Steve Gediman, 26. ``It was
worthwhile just sitting there because I was sort of participating
in a global event.''
    The stretch of freeway, also known as Route 101, through the
San Fernando Valley may never have been the busiest, despite a
listing that says so in the Guinness Book of World Records,
California Department of Transportation officials admitted Monday.
   That's because counting monitors on two other freeway stretches
were out of commission for nearly five years and human guesses
calculating traffic flow there were much too low, said Nick Jones,
an associate transportation engineer.
   Aficionados of Los Angeles' fabled congestion should not
despair, however. The busiest portion of freeway in the world has
been determined to be the Santa Monica Freeway not far away, Jones
said. Coming in second is the San Diego Freeway.
   With the monitors fixed, new calculations show an average of
315,000 cars traveled on one stretch of the Santa Monica Freeway
every day during 1987, while 300,000 cars a day were logged on a
portion of the San Diego Freeway, compared with only 277,000 on the
Ventura.
   ``Any time you get over 250,000 cars per day, what's the
difference?'' Jones asked.

   Ron Sexton's reward for winning a school
contest was nothing to snort at.
   Sexton, a history teacher and wrestling coach at Wilmington High
School, came in first in a school project to raise money for
Children's Hospital in Columbus. His payoff _ he had to kiss a pig.
   He put his mouth where his money was in what was dubbed the
``Squeal of Fortune'' contest, laying a kiss on the snout of a sow
during a pep rally last Friday while the students and faculty of
the high school watched.
   Sexton won a contest in which students and teachers put money in
gallon milk jugs as their way of choosing someone for the porcine
pucker. There were 45 teachers up for votes, which cost 25 cents to
cast, according to home economics teacher Bonnie Hansen.
   The contest raised $246.40.

   The nation's mainstream Shiite Moslem
militia captured the three gunmen who kidnapped a U.S. Marine
officer in southern Lebanon last week, security sources said today.
   The sources said the three gunmen are among dozens of suspects
the Amal militia rounded up while searching for Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins but that the man who masterminded the U.N observer's
abduction remained at large.
   The gunmen, who were not identified, could not give their
leader's whereabouts or say where Higgins was being held, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of not being further identified.
   Reporters in southern Lebanon last week reported that the Amal
militia had detained more than 40 suspects, but this was the first
indication that the three gunmen were among those held.
   The same sources said today that at least two Israeli soldiers
were killed and several wounded when their armored patrol was
ambushed by Arab guerrillas in the southern Lebanese village of
Braachit at sundown Monday.
   It was not clear whether the ambush and kidnapping were related.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was kidnapped south of the
ancient port of Tyre on Wednesday. The security sources said the
three gunmen were captured in a dragnet in the two days following
the abduction.
   ``Among the detainees are the three gunmen who seized Col.
Higgins and forced him into the first getaway car,'' one source
said.
   Another three suspects who were being held monitored Higgins'
his movements before the abduction, the same source said.
   The source provided the information when asked for confirmation
of an NBC News report that the three kidnappers had been captured.
   The gunmen were being held by Amal in Tyre and had been
interrogated, but they were unable to provide useful information
because their leader had kept them in the dark, the source said.
   The security source played down the significance of the gunmen's
detention, saying the unidentified person who masterminded the
kidnapping already had slipped out of south Lebanon.
   ``The operation was a masterpiece from a professional
standpoint,'' the source said. ``The mastermind used five identical
brown Volvo cars plus two additional getaway cars, a white Peugeot
and a red Mercedes, in the abduction. The squad in each car did not
know who was in the other car.''
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, a pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem group, released a videotape Monday in which Higgins recited
its demands for his release, including an Israeli pullout from a
border zone in south Lebanon.
   The organization charged that Higgins was a CIA spy. U.S. and
U.N. officials denied the claim.
   Higgins heads a 76-man U.N. observer group drawn from 16 nations
that monitors border violations of a 1949 armistice signed by
Lebanon and Israel.
   The group was attached to the 5,800-strong United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon in 1978, when the nine-nation force was
deployed to keep peace on the Lebanon-Israel border.
   Timur Goksel, the force spokesman, said the search continued for
Higgins today in the Tyre region, 50 miles south of Beirut.
   Goksel said 20 officers of Higgins' observer group have been
withdrawn to U.N. posts along the Israeli border.
   The kidnapping increased friction between Shiite forces vying
for dominance in southern Lebanon.
   It pitted the moderate Amal, which is backed by Syria and is
trying to rescue Higgins, against the extremist Hezbollah, or Party
of God, which is loyal to Iran and has declared support for the
kidnappers, calling Higgins a ``filthy American.'' Hezbollah is
believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of the 25
foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   Amal's spokesmen say a total of 42 fundamentalists have been
rounded up in the Tyre region since Higgins' abduction. Hezbollah
claims more than 150 fundamentalists were arrested by the Amal
militia.
   Higgins is the ninth American missing after being kidnapped in
Lebanon since March 1985. The other foreign hostages are four
Frenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans, a Swede, a Norwegian,
an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Gale warnings continued today over parts of the Great Lakes and
New England, after high winds in the Midwest and Rockies cracked
windows, knocked down electrical poles and fanned wildfires.
   Advisories for blowing and drifting snow were posted over upper
Michigan, where snowshowers were scattered early today.
   Light snow also fell over western Minnesota, the eastern
Dakotas, and from eastern Montana across eastern Wyoming into
north-central Colorado.
   Rain fell from north-central Kentucky across Ohio and northern
New York state.
   Gale warnings were posted today over lakes Huron and Erie, and
in much of New England.
   Ninety windows cracked or shattered in Chicago's Sears Tower
early Monday when winds gusting to 56 mph flung gravel and debris
against the world's tallest building, a Sears spokesman said. No
injuries were reported.
   Broken glass forced authorities to block traffic during the
morning rush hour on the four streets surrounding the 110-story
building, police said.
   Gusts up to 120 mph were clocked at Mines Peak, Colo., early
Monday. Power outages were reported in southwestern Missouri and at
Fort Smith, Ark., where gusts reached 52 mph.
   A 64-year-old man died Monday when the truck he was driving went
off a road to avoid a fallen tree near Garwood, Mo., police said.
   Firefighters in Missouri responded to about a dozen wind-fanned
grass fires Monday, including one that destroyed a farm building
just east of Springfield, authorities said.
   Elsewhere, damage was estimated at more than $1 million Monday
from a wildfire whipped by winds of up to 70 mph, that blackened
2,400 acres of southwestern Montana on Sunday, destroying 39
buildings, including four homes, before being brought under
control. No one was injured, officials said.
   A snowstorm Monday helped douse a 200-acre blaze near Boulder,
Colo., and 90 mph gusts that fanned the fire Sunday subsided.
   Today's forecast called for scattered snow showers in upper
Michigan and northern New England; rain across central and southern
New England, eastern New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the upper
Ohio and Tennessee valleys; strong, winds over the northern Plains,
the upper Mississippi Valley, along the Great Lakes and across
northern New England.
   Highs should reach the single digits and teens from the eastern
Dakotas across Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan;
20s and 30s across northern New England, much of the Great Lakes
region, the lower Ohio and central Mississippi valleys, the
remainder of the northern Plains, and the northern Rockies; 40s and
50s from central New England across northern Virginia, the upper
Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, Arkansas, Oklahoma, the southern
Rockies, and the Pacific Northwest; near 80 over the desert
Southwest; 60s and 70s over the remainder of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 6

<HEAD>Soviets Promise `Flexibility' on 1988 Emigration, Shultz Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Shultz, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has promised to be more flexible
in granting emigration visas to its citizens, Secretary of State
George P. Shultz said after conducting two days of talks with
Kremlin officials.
   However, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the matter
of emigration was not open to negotiation.
   Soviet officials traditionally define emigration policy as an
internal matter. To improve relations with Washington, however,
they may have agreed privately to a more lenient look at
applications.
   Shultz said at a news conference Monday that his meetings with
Shevardnadze and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev produced
``helpful clarifications'' on human rights. Shultz described
humanitarian concerns _ divided families, Jews refused permission
to emigrate, and free expression and practice of religion _ as the
most important subject on his agenda.
   Shevardnadze, in contrast, said the meetings focused on ``the
pivot of Soviet-U.S. relations'': prospects for concluding a treaty
by late spring that would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of
both nations by 50 percent.
   He said human rights questions ``are being resolved by us more
forcefully than before,'' and characterized discussion of
emigration and personal freedoms as a Kremlin initiative the
American delegation welcomed.
   Last year 8,011 Soviet Jews were allowed to emigrate _ eight
times the number granted exit visas the previous year.
   Jewish emigration activists in the West claim fewer visas have
been issued since the December summit in Washington between
Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   Jewish emigration reached a peak of about 51,000 in 1979, but
dropped off as U.S.-Soviet relations worsened.
   Shultz told reporters, ``We got some helpful clarifications,
particularly on emigration policy, where we were assured there
would be flexibility on applications requiring potential immigrants
to have first-degree relatives abroad.'' Emigration regulations
that took effect in January 1987 allow Soviets to seek
reunification only with spouses, siblings and parents.
   Refuseniks, those denied permission to leave, complain that the
new laws make it more difficult for those seeking to join
grandparents, cousins and other relatives.
   The secretary said: ``There had been some misunderstanding about
this and that has been straightened out, at least for the balance
of this year.
   ``I'm glad that Foreign Minister Shevardnadze confirmed quite
categorically that the only barrier to emigration is past work
involving state secrets.''
   Soviets who have performed work considered of vital national
importance, or that makes the worker privy to classified
information, are routinely denied exit visas.
   According to Shultz, his assistant secretary of state for
humanitarian affairs, Richard Schifter, had encouraging meetings
with Soviet counterparts, including representatives of the
Communist Party Central Committee Secretariat and the Interior
Ministry, which oversees the visa-issuing office.
   Shevardnadze held a news conference later and was asked whether
the promised ``flexibility'' meant the year-old regulations would
be revised, or the understanding was an informal one between the
two governments.
   He responded: ``As far as the internal legislation of our
country is concerned, we are not discussing these matters with the
secretary of state.''
   Shevardnadze acknowledged ``reassessments'' were in progress on
emigration and other policies Western officials define as
humanitarian concerns, but declined further comment.

   Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is
recovering from surgery to repair an aneurysm in a blood vessel in
his brain, will be discharged from Walter Reed Army Medical Center
around the middle of the week, a hospital spokesman says.
   Biden left the hospital for a few hours over the weekend to have
dinner with his brother, Jim, in Washington, hospital officials
told the News Journal of Wilmington, Del.
   ``He had an excellent weekend. He's doing really well,''
hospital spokesman Peter Esker said Monday. He said Biden continues
to be listed in good condition.
   The 45-year-old Democrat had surgery Feb. 12 to correct an
aneurysm in an artery.
   The senator has been undergoing a series of neurological tests.
He is not expected to have any lasting effects from the surgery,
officials said.
   ``He's sitting up, eating regular meals, but his visits are
still limited to his family because he needs rest,'' Esker said.
``And he'll continue to need rest after he leaves.''
   Biden, had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination
for president last June but dropped out of the race in September
after he admitted committing plagiarism in law school, acknowledged
that he exxagerated his academic record, and was criticized for
lifting sections of other politicians' speeches without attribution.
   Biden plans to recuperate at his home near Wilmington.
   Well-wishers continue to send flowers, which Biden has asked be
passed along to the children's ward.

   A pit bull terrier unhappy with the smell coming
from shipping crates full of Oriental statues led U.S. Customs
officials to up to $1.8 billion worth of heroin at O'Hare
International Airport, authorities said.
   ``It was the largest inland port seizure of heroin in United
States history,'' U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said Monday after
authorities announced the arrest of six people on drug charges.
   Spike, a pit bull terrier trained to locate drugs by the U.S.
Customs Service, sniffed suspiciously at the seven shipping crates
destined for New York from Bangkok, Thailand, on British Airways on
Feb. 5, said his handler, customs officer Jeff Gabel.
   Gabel alerted superiors, and the statues were uncrated and put
through X-ray machines and other scans. Inside, authorities found
165 pounds of high-quality Asian heroin worth up to $1.8 billion.
   Agents opened the crates, cracked the statues and removed most
of the heroin. Then they repaired the figures, put them back into
the crates and followed the shipping orders that said the crates
should be sent to a house in Norridge, near O'Hare, said Barry
Elden of the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago.
   Agents watched as four people rented a truck and drove the
statues to New York, Elden said.
   Six suspects were arrested in New York on Sunday and charged
with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin, Elden
said.
   The suspects, who were held without bond, were identified as
Prasit Maneerat of Bangkok; Chang Zhu-Yu and Kaw Ting-Ti, both of
Ocean, N.Y.; Chen Woi-Kong of New York; Eng Chuck Jor of Yonkers,
N.Y.; and Tang Chi-Lap of Brooklyn, N.Y.
   The latest seizure and recent record seizures of cocaine and
hashish indicate that Chicago has become a major shipment point for
drugs, Valukas said.

<HEAD>Congress to Look Into Haiti Drug Smuggling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress plans to hold hearings regarding
allegations that Haiti's top military officers have been smuggling
cocaine into the United States, according to a published report.
   The San Francisco Examiner reported in today's editions that
Alfred Cumming, a legislative aide to Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said
the hearings are scheduled to start in mid-March.
   Cumming said the hearings, to be headed by Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., or Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass, will be in response to concern
``about the allegations of Haitian cocaine trafficking.''
   The hearings will investigate reports that Haiti, with the
participation of top military officials, has become a major
shipment and refueling point for drugs and guns since February
1986, when former Haitian president Jean-Claude Duvalier was
replaced by a military junta.
   A federal source, familiar with a current probe by the U.S.
attorney's office in Miami, said that Haiti was ``probably another
example of a military that is up to its earlobes in drug
operations,'' the newspaper said.
   For the last year, a federal grand jury has been focusing on
police chief Col. Jean-Claude Paul, whose ranch and airstrip 90
miles from Port-au-Prince has been used by cocaine smugglers, said
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency investigators.
   The Examiner reported that a congressional source who has been
briefed on the federal probe said an indictment against Paul and
several relatives and associates is imminent.

   The dollar fell in light European trading early
today as markets waited for clearer signals of how the U.S. economy
was performing.
   Gold prices also declined.
   The dollar was trading at lower levels against all major foreign
currencies at midmorning, but was fluctuating within a narrow range.
   Many traders stayed on the sidelines ahead of Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's scheduled testimony later in the day
before the U.S. House Banking Committee, traders said.
   They said the testimony might provide a better insight into U.S.
monetary policy, which could give the dollar some direction.
   Also, the markets were awaiting a new batch of U.S. economic
reports due later this week, including the government's latest
revised estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Monday:
   _ 1.6922 West German marks, down from 1.6955
   _ 1.3882 Swiss francs, down from 1.3930
   _ 5.7255 French francs, down from 5.7500
   _ 1.8983 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9040
   _ 1,246.50 Italian lire, down from 1,252.25
   _ 1.2713 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2738
   The British pound rose to $1.7665 from $1.7630.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 128.50 Japanese yen, down from
Monday's close of 129.95 yen. In London trading later today, the
U.S. currency traded at 128.70 yen.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $443.95 a troy ounce, down from $446 late Monday. A
trader said the market was extremely thin.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $443.50, down from $446.50.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $446.80, down
from $447.12.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.38, down from

   An unemployed handyman visiting his old
neighborhood was chased by a furious, crack-crazed mob and fatally
shot after he was accused of being an undercover narcotics agent,
police said.
   Daniel T. Foster, 30, was shot as he fled from the jeering
crowd, according to a published report Monday.
   ``These people were so afraid that he was there to take their
dope away that they killed him on the spot,'' police Inspector Earl
Sanders told the San Francisco Examiner.
   ``They killed him because he was a stranger. It wasn't his
neighborhood anymore,'' Sanders said.
   Foster once lived in the Hunters Point district but left the
city in 1978 to move to Virginia, authorities said. He returned to
San Francisco only a few weeks before his death.
   Just after midnight Jan. 22, Foster got off a bus in his old
neighborhood, where he was going to visit his sister, and found
himself in the crowd of about 20 men and women. Some of them,
police said, were high on crack cocaine, a potent and dangerous
form of the drug.
   The same crowd had just fought police and forced officers to
retreat under a barrage of rocks and bottles, investigators said.
   ``They were full of crack, and at least one of them had a gun,''
said Sanders' partner, Inspector Napoleon Hendrix. ``Foster stepped
right into it.''
   When Foster began walking toward his sister's apartment, people
in the crowd ``asked him if he was a cop,'' said Sanders.
   ``He told them `no' and kept walking. Then they asked him if he
was from Sunnydale (the turf of a rival gang), but when he said
`no,' someone in the crowd said he was lying. Then, they began to
chase him,'' he said.
   Foster ran down the block and had nearly reached the corner when
someone in the crowd fired a pistol at least four times, police
said. Foster was hit once in the back and was pronounced dead at
San Francisco General Hospital.
   His killer has not been found, authorities said.
   ``The home he came back to was not the same one he left,''
Sanders said. ``Crack cocaine had claimed his friends. As near as
we can tell, he never touched the stuff, but in the end, it got
him, too.''

<TEXT>
   The government's plan to have President
Kurt Waldheim address a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of
Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany is becoming a major point of
dispute.
   German troops marched into the country nearly 50 years ago,
officially linking this Alpine nation with Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich. Austria did not become independent again until 1955.
   Austrians are marking the annexation _ called the Anschluss in
German _ as a time of reflection on a troubled period when throngs
cheered Hitler, Jews were harassed and resistance fighters executed.
   Austrian television and radio, along with many of the country's
newspapers, are giving much attention to the March 11
commemoration. The issue is especially sensitive because of the
widely held opinion in Austria that the country was a ``victim'' of
the Third Reich.
   Now, with Waldheim under fire for his role as a first lieutenant
in the German army in the Balkans during World War II, it is
increasingly uncertain what the bickering coalition government will
do on the March 11 anniversary.
   Many Austrian Socialists have made it clear they are against the
ceremony during which the 69-year-old Waldheim is scheduled to
deliver a speech.
   ``I have misgivings about this event,'' Fred Sinowatz, the
Socialist Party chief and former chancellor, told reporters at a
news conference Monday after a meeting of the party's leadership
suggested that Waldheim should step down.
   The Socialists, senior partner in the government, adopted a
resolution saying a report on Waldheim's wartime record released
earlier this month has ``badly shaken the president's moral
authority at home and abroad.''
   ``It has become obvious that ... Waldheim ... cannot realize the
most important aims he has set for himself, that is to promote
domestic peace in Austria and to increase Austria's prestige in the
world,'' the resolution said.
   The leadership at the meeting, which included Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky, stopped short of asking for Waldheim's resignation.
   The report on Waldheim's wartime record presented no evidence
that would clearly back allegations that he committed wartime
atrocities, but it left open the question of whether he was guilty
of any crime.
   The report, written by an international panel of historians,
said he was ``in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the
Balkans, knew they were going on and made no attempt ot prevent
them.
   It also said Waldheim concealed his wartime past and tried to
make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it.
   Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing.
   Instead of a commemoration ceremony, Sinowatz called for
reflection of ``what happened on March 11, 1938, and what must be
done so that such a thing never happens again.''
   But Deputy Chancellor Alois Mock, a leader of the conservative
People's Party, the junior member in the coalition government,
rejected the idea of scrapping the ceremony and the Waldheim speech
in Vienna's Hofburg Palace.
   ``That's a suggestion that will never be accepted by the
People's Party,'' said Mock, Waldheim's most vigilant public
defender, at a separate news conference Monday where he spoke on
behalf of the party.
   Fritz Koenig, another People's Party leader, urged a suspension
of the political debate until after the nation commemorates the
anniversary.
   ``I think that after the ceremonies on March 11, there must be a
discussion on how to achieve greater cooperation ... among the
federal president, the government and the Parliament,'' Koenig said
on behalf of the party.
   Newspapers are giving the dispute prominent play:
   ``With increasing frequency, there are suggestions that the
government should simply call off the planned commemoration
ceremonies for March 11,'' the conservative Die Presse said in its
lead story Monday.
   A day earlier, Economics Minister Robert Graf, a People's Party
member, became the latest of several politicians to make such a
suggestion.
   He told a roundtable TV discussion that he had made the
suggestion ``out of concern about further polarization.''
   ``On Account of Waldheim, the 1938 Commemorations are on Shaky
Ground,'' the socialist AZ tabloid of Vienna said in a front-page
headling on Monday.
   The Socialists and the People's Party made plans for the Hofburg
ceremony before the historians' report on Waldheim's wartime past
was issued.
   Waldheim was the conservative candidate in the presidential
election. He became president with 53.6 percent of the votes in a
June 8, 1986 runoff. His term is scheduled to end in 1992.
   In Austria the president is head of state, a largerly ceremonial
position. Vranitzky runs the government.

   Guerrillas using rocket-propelled
grenades ambushed an Israeli armored patrol in south Lebanon,
killing two soldiers and wounding several others, security sources
said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified
further, said the patrol of one tank and an armored personnel
carrier was ambushed near the village of Braachit at sundown Monday.
   ``Both vehicles were raked with rocket-propelled grenades that
set off a chain of ammunition explosions in the tank,'' said one
source. ``No one could have escaped alive from the burning tank.''
   The source said there were several other serious casualties in
addition to the two fatalities in the ambush, but no specific
figures were available.
   The source said the guerrillas were either Shiite Moslem
fundamentalists or pro-Syrian leftists. Both groups operate in that
area. The source said there was not yet enough information
available to be more specific.
   The Israeli army had no immediate comment on the reported attack.
   Braachit is five miles west of Israel's border in an area where
an Israeli ``security zone'' overlaps with the area of operations
of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL.
   The scene is about seven miles east of the area where UNIFIL
troops and Shiite Moslem Amal militiamen have been searching for
U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. Higgins, 43, of Danville,
Ky., was kidnapped south of the port of Tyre last Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Kim Young-sam and rival opposition
leader Kim Dae-jung met today to discuss merging their two parties
in time for the parliamentary elections, but they only agreed to
discuss the issue again.
   The surprise, two-hour private meeting was proposed by Kim
Young-sam after he emerged today from two weeks of near seclusion
and told reporters a merger would ensure an opposition victory in
the balloting expected be held in April.
   Kim Dae-jung, president of the Party for Peace and Democracy,
immediately agreed to the meeting, which was held at a Seoul hotel.
   ``We will do our best to make the opposition merger successful
at any cost,'' Kim Young-sam said afterward. Kim Dae-jung said he
was not as optimistic. No specific date was set for another meeting.
   Repeated efforts to reunite the two parties have failed and
several rounds of talks in recent weeks have not produced any
progress. Neither party indicated today that the situation had
changed.
   On Feb. 8, Kim Young-sam resigned as president of the
Reunification Democratic Party, purportedly to help reunite the
opposition before the National Assembly elections.
   The meeting was the two Kims' first since Oct. 29, when they
split in disagreement over which of them should run as the
opposition candidate in the Dec. 16 presidential elections. Each
insisted on running, giving government party candidate Roh Tae-woo
victory despite Roh's failure to win a plurality.
   After the defeat, the two Kims came under strong pressure to
retire from politics. Many people accused them of putting personal
ambition ahead of their avowed campaign goals of ending military
rule.
   When he quit as president of his party, Kim Young-sam said he
had expected the rival opposition groups could agree on a merger.
   Kim Young-sam today said he believed that ``the merger of the
opposition bloc is the only way to crush the ruling Democratic
Justice Party's plot to perpetuate its rule and revive democracy in
this country. So, it must be achieved with the people's power.''
   He said the new Cabinet formed by Roh, who is to take office
Thursday, is merely an extension of that of outgoing President Chun
Doo-hwan. The new Cabinet includes several key holdovers from
Chun's administration.
   Kim Young-sam said he had a ``great deal of doubt about Roh's
implementing democratic reforms.'' Roh, a former general like Chun,
has pledged to an end to the long tradition of authoritarianism in
South Korea.
   The governing and opposition parties, which have been squabbling
over the number of lawmakers to be elected from each district, have
failed to rewrite the election law and to set an exact date for the
National Assembly election.

<TEXT>
   A former police officer convicted of
torturing a 17-year-old boy with a 50,000-volt stun gun was
sentenced to two years in prison by a judge who called his action
``a gross betrayal of public trust.''
   Former Huntington Park Police Officer William Lustig Jr., 32,
was convicted in December of one count of felony assault under
color of authority because of the methods used during questioning
of Jaime Ramirez. Another former officer, Robert Rodriguez, 27, was
found guilty of aiding and abetting in the crime.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Berg on Monday sentenced Lustig to
two years in state prison and Rodriguez to six months in county
jail as a condition of three years' probation.
   ``In our society, a suspect in police custody has the right to
be free from torture,'' Berg said. ``These acts constituted a gross
betrayal of the public trust.''
   ``It's an embarrassment to everyone in the community, this type
of behavior,'' said Deputy District Attorney James Koller.
   Ramirez, who attended the hearing with his parents, said of the
sentencing: ``I think it's fair. It's the law.'' He has filed a $10
million federal lawsuit claiming his civil rights were violated
during the Nov. 30, 1986, incident.
   In December, jurors convicted the two former officers of using a
50,000-volt electric stun gun similar to a cattle prod to torture
Ramirez, who had been arrested for questioning about stereo
components he was carrying as he walked along a street in
Huntington Park, a Los Angeles suburb.
   Ramirez testified during the trial that Lustig used the stun gun
to burn his thighs through his clothing several times during
interrogation.
   Lustig's attorney, Richard Levine, said his client's actions
``were not criminally motivated'' and he has endured enough
punishment through the public humiliation he has had to withstand.
   Lustig had a ``misplaced belief that the ends justify the means
in a criminal investigation,'' Levine said.The attorney said he did
not know whether he would file an appeal.
   Rodriguez's lawyer, William Hadden, said he would appeal, and
the judge agreed to stay Rodriguez's sentence pending the outcome,
setting bail at $3,000.

   Conspiracy charges against a woman whose
boyfriend parachuted to his death with 77 pounds of cocaine
strapped to his body were dropped at the request of the prosecution.
   The motion to dismiss the charges against Rebecca Sharp, 32, of
Lexington, Ky., was filed Friday by Assistant U.S. Attorney James
R. Dedrick and approved without comment Monday by U.S. District
Judge James H. Jarvis.
   Dedrick declined to meet with a reporter or return telephone

he lost a battle to use against Ms. Sharp statements she made to a
government undercover agent.
   The trial of Ms. Sharp, a paralegal, on charges of conspiring
with former Lexington narcotics officer Andrew Thornton II to
import cocaine and to distribute the drug had been set to begin
March 1.
   Dedrick's motion asked that the charges be dismissed without
prejudice, which allows him to seek another indictment.
   ``Rebecca was very happy over that, as you might imagine,'' her
attorney, W. Thomas Dillard III, said of the dismissal of charges.
``Hopefully, that will be the end of it.''
   Dedrick's motion did not specify why he wanted the charges
dismissed, and Dillard said he would not care to speculate, but it
seemed likely that the ruling disallowing Ms. Sharp's statements
was a direct cause.
   Those statements were suppressed, meaning they could not be used
as evidence against her, on Feb. 12 by U.S. Magistrate Robert P.
Murrian.
   Murrian ruled the statements ``were made in a situation so
inherently coercive that they must be considered as involuntary and
compelled'' because the undercover agent posed as a representative
of violent Colombian drug dealers who wanted either their cocaine
or their $12 million.
   Thornton's body was found on a Knoxville driveway the morning of
Sept. 11, 1985. He carried bags with 77 pounds of cocaine in them,
and federal authorities have linked him to some 200 pounds of the
drug found in duffel bags scattered across northern Georgia.
   A few days after Thornton's death, Kieran Kobell, a special
agent with the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, visited Ms. Sharp
in Lexington.
   Kobell, using an alias, and a government informant now listed as
a fugitive took Ms. Sharp on a car ride during which, Kobell said,
she revealed an intimate knowledge of the cocaine-smuggling
operation and promised the deal would go through even if she had to
kill somebody.
   During testimony in the suppression hearing, Kobell said he did
not force Ms. Sharp to say anything during the car ride. However,
Murrian also noted that Kobell threatened both Ms. Sharp and her
attorney in Kentucky, Fred Partin, in a telephone call to the
lawyer the next day, according to Partin's testimony at the
suppression hearing.

   Nine police officers taken hostage
during a violent clash with separatist rebels were freed today, and
members of the dominant conservative party demanded that the
separatist faction be outlawed on this French-ruled island.
   About 100 protesters battled French gendarmes at a hospital
construction site on the east coast city of Poindimie, holding nine
officers for about 13 hours before releasing them. Officials said
17 officers were injured during the fracas.
   Authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity said all the
protesters involved escaped arrest.
   The Gendarmerie, a police force under the French military, said
in a statement that at least 20 people were injured by sticks or
stones in the battle and four police cars set on fire.
   The Rally for Caledonia in the Republic, a local party with
close links to French Premier Jacques Chirac's Rally for the
Republic party, adopted a resolution today calling on Overseas
Territories Minister Bernard Pons to dissolve the separatist Kanak
Socialist National Liberation Front.
   Dissolution would make the party illegal. The resolution also
called for party leaders responsible for the clash to be expelled
from the island.
   Yewene Yewene, a separatist leader, said the resolution showed
``a logic of intolerance, a policy of contempt and a desire to
humiliate the Kanak people.''
   Yewene said the protesters did not object to the building of a
hospital, but not at the site chosen, which he said was vital to
the local Tieti tribe.
   The Kanak group supports independence for New Caledonia, a
territory of 145,000 people about 1,100 miles east of Australia.
   In a referendum last September, a majority voted against
independence. The Kanak front boycotted the election, saying
immigrants who arrived in New Caledonia in the past three years
should not have been eligible to vote.
   Kanaks make up 42.6 percent of the population and Europeans 37.1
percent. Other nationalities make up the rest.
   Regional elections, which the separatists say they will boycott,
are scheduled for March.

   Sen. Jesse Helms is asking the CIA to
investigate charges that the agency provided personal data to
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega about Helms and Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy.
   In a letter to CIA Director William Webster, Helms said he had
received reports that the CIA had provided similar information on
other senators to officials in other foreign countries.
   The North Carolina Republican said maintenance of files on
members of Congress would be ``illegal and improper.'' The transfer
of such information to another government would ``call into
question the integrity'' of U.S. intelligence institutions, Helms
wrote.
   The letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated
Press on Monday, was sent to Webster following testimony by Jose
Blandon, a former Noriega associate turned critic of Panama's
defense chief.
   Blandon, testifying before a Senate subcommittee on Feb. 9, said
the CIA passed to Noriega data about Helms, Kennedy, D-Mass., and
two of their aides. The senators have been among Noriega's
strongest critics on Capitol Hill, citing allegations of Noriega's
involvement in drug trafficking.
   At the time of Blandon's testimony, the CIA said it
``categorically denies'' his allegations.
   A CIA spokeswoman, Sharon Foster, had no comment Monday on
Helms' letter except to say that communications from members of
Congress are confidential but are taken seriously and responded to.
   Blandon's testimony reinforced the notion that the CIA had
maintained close ties with Noriega despite strong evidence dating
back several years that he was involved in drug trafficking
activities.
   Two federal grand juries have indicted Noriega on drug related
charges.
   Kennedy has said it was ``unconscionable that the CIA knew about
Noriega's drug trafficking activities and continued to work with
him for such a long time, but it is even worse to think that the
CIA would provide information about Noriega's leading American
critics to the general himself.''
   Blandon spent Monday at U.S. District Court with prosecutors
investigating the Iran-Contra affair. Although no details were
provided, Blandon presumably was questioned about his testimony
that Noriega agreed to provide training for Nicaraguan Contras
after receiving a request from former White House aide Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North in 1985.
   Helms, in a separate letter to FBI Director William Sessions,
asked if the agency had ever passed on data about members of
Congress or their staffs to the CIA and whether it had engaged in
wiretaps or surveillance on him or members of his staff.
   In his letter to the CIA's Webster, Helms asked whether the CIA
had maintained information on members of Congress or their staffs
and whether such information was ever passed on to any official of
a foreign government, specifically the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Helms indicated he was skeptical about the CIA's denial,
contending that it made an inquiry afterward to CIA field offices
and to the heads of U.S. agencies involved in national security
issues as to whether the denial was accurate.
   Ms. Foster of the CIA said she was unable to comment on that
allegation.
   Helms asked Webster not to rely on CIA files because the
information alleged to have been passed on may have gone through a
``back channel'' without files being maintained.
   ``It is imperative that an internal investigation be conducted
and all employees in contact with Panamanian government or military
officials be questioned,'' Helms wrote.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
left Moscow today without a firm timetable for a Soviet pullout
from Afghanistan, but U.S. intelligence sources said the Red Army
is taking initial steps to leave.
   Soviet troops are retreating to defensive positions and
dependents are being withdrawn, a solid sign the soldiers will not
be far behind, a senior U.S. official said.
   In addition, soldiers in the 115,000-man Soviet force are not
being replaced when they complete their tours of duty, said the
official, who briefed reporters on Shultz's flight to Brussels on
condition of anonymity.
   Shultz said Monday at the end of two days of talks in Moscow
that he did not have ``the slightest doubt'' the Red Army would
depart. And after briefing NATO officials in Brussels today, he
reaffirmed his expectation the Soviets would quit Afghanistan.
   But he evidently did not get a specific timetable from Soviet
Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev or Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The garrisoning of Soviet troops and departure of dependents is
``solid evidence'' the eight-year military intervention in
Afghanistan will soon end, the U.S. official said.
   On Feb. 8, Gorbachev offered to begin the pullout May 15 if
Pakistan and Afghanistan reach a settlement by March 15 in
negotiations due to resume in Geneva next week. He said the
withdrawal could be achieved within 10 months.
   The Soviets have, however, accused Pakistan of obstructing a
settlement by insisting an interim coalition government be created
in Kabul to prevent the protracted civil strife Islamabad says
would otherwise ensue.
   Shultz has said such a government could facilitate the troop
withdrawal and return of about 3 million refugees from Pakistan.
But another senior U.S. official said Washington does not endorse
Pakistan's position. Referring to the anticipated withdrawal, the
official told reporters: ``We wouldn't want to miss the bus. We've
been trying to get the Soviets out for years.''
   Gorbachev has said Moscow would not make the composition of the
government it leaves behind a condition of withdrawal.
   Shultz stopped at NATO headquarters in Brussels today to brief
the Western allies, who were especially interested in the steps
taken on arms control.
   From Brusssels, Shultz was flying back to Washington for a
26-hour respite before heading for the Middle East try to push
Arabs and Israelis into negotiations.
   ``I don't think many people give me much chance,'' Shultz said
with a smile. But, he added, ``Even if the chances are small, it's
worthwhile trying.''
   Also today, Shevardnadze left Moscow for Prague, Czechoslovakia,
to brief Warsaw Pact foreign ministers, the Soviet news agency Tass
said.
   On Monday, U.S. and Soviet negotiators were directed to prepare
within a month three draft agreements for a treaty to reduce
long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50
percent. Such missiles have a range of more than 3,400 miles.
   The drafts will deal with verifying compliance with the
cutbacks, disposing the weapons, and exchange of information. They
are to be ready for the next Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting, in
Washington on March 22-23.
   Shultz told reporters in Brussels that the two sides were still
far apart on the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative. ``I think we
moved it a little bit in Moscow, maybe imperceptibly,'' he said of
the disagreement over the U.S. program to develop a space-based
defense against ballistic missiles.
   On human rights, Shultz persuaded the Soviets to drop for the
rest of the year, at least, a requirement that Jews who want to
emigrate have a close relative living abroad.
   A senior U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said about 90
percent of Jews who have applied for exit visas do not have close
relatives in Israel.
   In the past several months, the official said, the Soviets for
the first time provided the United States with figures on
applications waiting to be processed. On Feb. 1, he said, there
were 1,042 on file.
   Soviets who have performed work considered by the government to
be of vital national importance or that involved classified
information are routinely denied exit visas.
   Shultz told a news conference in Moscow on Monday that he gave a
``good mark'' to the two-day talks with Shevardnadze, that they had
moved the two sides closer to a strategic arms agreement and a
spring summit in Moscow.
   No specific date for a fourth summit between President Reagan
and Gorbachev was agreed to, but Shevardnadze told reporters Monday
that both sides want the summit in late May or early June.
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said Monday the Soviets will
begin withdrawing shorter-range SS-12 missiles from East Germany
and Czechoslovakia late this month as a ``display of good will.''
   The missiles must be eliminated under the intermediate-range
arms pact signed in December. Such missiles have a range of about
300 to 3,000 miles.

   A Dutch tourist who was believed to have
died in a hotel fire that killed five other people has been found
alive, the official Bulgarian news agency said today.
   The news agency BTA said 37 people from Britain, the Soviet
Union, West Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and Denmark were
injured in the blaze in the ski resort of Borovets, 22 miles
southeast of Sofia.
   On Monday, BTA reported six people were killed in the fire, but
today the agency said one man, from the Netherlands, ``has since
been discovered in good condition.'' It did not elaborate.
   According to BTA and the SAS insurance organization in the Dutch
city of Arnhem, the dead tourists included two Dutch women,
identified only as Ms. Ever Van den Berg and Mrs. Stekelenburg. Two
other victims have not been identified and the fifth was identified
as a Bulgarian tourist, Roumen Roussev.
   Of the 37 injured, BTA said 17 were British, four Soviet, five
West German, seven Greek, two Danish and two Dutch.
   BTA said preliminary reports suggest the fire started on the
ground floor and then quickly spread to the first and second floors
of the hotel, which was made of wood.
   Nineteen people were undergoing treatment at the Pirogov
emergency aid institute in Sofia, BTA repoted, adding two of them
were in ``severe'' condition.
   The other injured tourists are at another hospital in the
Bulgarian capital and in a hospital in the town of Samokov, the
agency said.

   The cost of living the high life in New York
rose last year at more than twice the rate of the Consumer Price
Index, with Beluga caviar showing the most increase, according to a
champagne producer's survey.
   Whereas the CPI rose 4.4 percent last year, the life of luxury
in the nation's most expensive big city went up 9 percent,
according to the ``Moet Index.''
   The survey has been compiled since 1983 by Moet and Chandon
Champagne.
   Largest increases included: 14.7 percent for 30 grams of Beluga
caviar, up from $29 in 1986 to $33.25 last year; 11.7 percent for a
wash, cut and blow dry at a top hair salon, from $60 to $67; and 10
percent for a day's maid service, from $80 to $88.
   Luxuries with lower price hikes included: 3 percent for a round
trip New York-Paris flight on the Concorde, up from $4,296 to
$4,424; 4.8 percent for a full-length mink coat, from $15,750 to
$16,500; and 5.3 percent for a limousine rental, from $38 an hour
to $40 an hour.
   It was the fourth consecutive year the Moet index exceeded the
CPI. In 1986, the index rose 6.1 percent, while the CPI rose only
1.9 percent.

<HEAD>CBS to Launch Pat Sajak Talk Show, Cancel Late-Night Series</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS plans to launch a late-night talk show
with ``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak next season that would
compete with NBC's ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
   Meanwhile in New York, NBC announced Monday it is launching
``Later with Bob Costas'' in August, a half-hour talk show that
will follow ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
   The Sajak show means cancellation of the network's late-night
lineup of action shows and music, said a source at CBS. The shows
are expected to remain on the air until at least September, said
the source, who is close to the productions and spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   They include the original series ``Adderly,'' ``Night Heat,''
``Diamonds'' and ``Top of the Pops'' and reruns of ``Hunter.''
   ``At least 20 percent of the CBS affiliates are not carrying the
late-night shows,'' the source said. ``CBS is turning to Sajak in
hopes of finding a format all its affiliates will stay with.''
   Sajak is host of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' the most successful
syndicated show ever.
   CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said recently he
wanted the network to increase its late-night visibility with a
talk show and confirmed that the network was talking with Sajak.
Sajak also discussed the possibility of a CBS talk show recently
when he was a guest on NBC's ``Late Night.''
   The Costas show would be a half-hour addition to NBC's schedule,
following ``Late Night.'' Costas is a sportscaster with NBC, but
his show would feature interviews with people ``from all walks of
life,'' NBC said.
   The show will originate from New York, except in the summer when
it will be based in Costas' hometown of St. Louis.
   Sajak, host of both the NBC daytime version and syndicated
nighttime version of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' is expected to leave the
daytime show sometime this year, though he will stay with the
nighttime show, said Betsy Vorce, a spokeswoman for King World,
which distributes ``Wheel'' for syndication.

   A 16-year-old boy has been arrested in
the deaths of his parents, whose bodies were found buried in a
shallow grave in the family's back yard, authorities said.
   A neighbor told police that the boy's father had recently shown
him a drawing by his son depicting a man with an ax in his head.
The boy reportedly told his father, ``That's what I feel like doing
to you.''
   The bodies of Peter and Karen Overhand were discovered about
midnight Sunday by police who went to the residence to check out
confidential information they had received.
   Mitchell Overhand, 16, the couple's only child, was being held
at the Juvenile Detention Center, the Bernalillo County Sheriff's
Department said. A second 16-year-old youth, whose name was
withheld, also was taken into custody. No charges have been brought
against the two.
   The Overhands, who were believed to be in their mid-30s to 40s,
were killed between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. Thursday, probably while they
slept, said Sheriff's Capt. Dan Houston.
   An autopsy indicated Peter Overhand was shot with a .38-caliber
handgun, Houston said. An autopsy had not been completed on Mrs.
Overhand Monday night, but Houston said she also appeared to have
been shot.
   Four handguns were seized as evidence, but authorities would not
say where they were found or to whom they belonged.
   James Bradley, a neighbor, said Mitchell Overhand told friends
his parents were in California for the weekend attending his
grandfather's funeral.
   Sheriff's department spokeswoman Ronni Crago said police
received information that ``something of a suspicious nature'' had
happened at the Overhand home in a subdivision on Albuquerque's
West Mesa.
   Police obtained a search warrant and found the bodies, she said.
   C.D. Youngblood, who lives next door to the Overhands, said
Peter Overhand spoke to him often about problems he was having with
Mitchell.
   Overhand, Youngblood said, recently told him of finding a
drawing in the garbage depicting a man with an ax in his head. When
Peter Overhand confronted his son with the drawing, the younger
Overhand said, ``That's what I feel like doing to you,'' Youngblood
recalled.
   Mitchell Overhand, Bradley said, spent the weekend with friends
and had attended a party Friday night at an Albuquerque hotel. He
said the boy also had invited a number of friends to his home over
the weekend.
   Youngblood also said Peter Overhand told him his son hated him
so much, ``he wouldn't be surprised if he tried to kill him.''

   A member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee said today that the resignation of Navy Secretary James
H. Webb will force Congress to take a closer look at the Pentagon
budget and the future size of the Navy.
   ``I think what his resignation will do will cause us to look at
our commitments,'' Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said on ``CBS This
Morning.'' ``Can we, in fact, afford to keep the commitment that
we've made without spending the money necessary to put out a fleet
to do it?''
   The senator later added that Webb's decision ``may spur very
critical analysis of exactly where we're going with the defense
budget.''
   Webb, in announcing his resignation Monday, said he quit because
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci made budget decisions that mean
the target of a 600-ship Navy will never be met.
   ``The resignation ... may be right for him but a bit premature
for us,'' Cohen said. ``After all, Secretary Carlucci has to come
before Capitol Hill, present the budget.
   ``We might disagree. We might agree with Secretary Webb that
perhaps the allocation of the cuts should not have come out of
shipbuilding, perhaps they should come out of some other service or
some other way of achieving those cuts,'' Cohen said.
   In 1981, President Reagan promised to build the Navy to a total
of 600 deployable ships from the 450 the service had at that time.
   The Navy was given large increases for shipbuilding as part of
the record military spending buildup in Reagan's first term.
Although overall defense spending has slowed sharply during the
last three years, Navy shipbuilding continued to grow, although
more slowly.
   Navy officials had said they would meet the target by next fall,
but Carlucci ordered the service to mothball 16 aging frigates,
leaving it with 580 ships.
   The defense secretary ordered the cuts as part of a package of
$33 billion worth of reductions Carlucci had to find under an
agreement reached by Reagan and the Democratic-controlled Congress
to cut federal spending.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Monday that Webb's
decision ``has obviously launched an important new stage of the
debate about Pentagon priorities and the size and type of Navy we
need.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said, ``I never believed that there
was anything magic about the number 600.''
   While Carlucci ordered 16 older ships cut, the Navy's budget
includes money for 17 new ships. Among them are one missile-firing
submarine, two more 688-class attack subs, the first of a new class
of ``Seawolf'' attack subs, and three destroyers.
   Carlucci declined to respond Monday to Webb's criticism, but he
noted last week that he had to make ``tough choices'' in cutting
the budget.

   Speed skater Bonnie Blair set a world
record while becoming America's second gold medal winner at the
Winter Olympics.
   Blair's time of 39.10 seconds in Monday night's 500-meter race
nipped the record set minutes earlier by her East German archrival
Christa Rothenburger.
   ``I think I just got it on guts,'' Blair said.
   On Saturday, Brian Boitano of California won a gold medal in
figure skating. U.S. athletes also have won one silver and one
bronze medal.
   Rothenburger lowered her own world record by 0.27 second,
skating in the second pair in the women's 500 meters and finishing
in 39.12. Two pairs later, Blair, of Champaign, Ill., trimmed an
additional 0.02 second off the mark, winning the gold in 39.10.
Karin Kania of East Germany won the bronze.
   The Soviet Union leads with seven golds, and East Germany has
six.

   China's economy grew by a robust 9.4 percent in
1987, but rising prices caused by high consumer demand lowered
living standards for one out of five city dwellers, the State
Statistics Bureau said today.
   China's gross national product for the year was $295 billion,
ranking it seventh in the world. The report said industrial output
was up 16.5 percent, while agriculture output increased 4.7 percent.
   The bureau, in an annual report, said China's 200 million urban
dwellers made an average of $248 last year, up 10.6 percent before
inflation. Its 800 million peasants averaged $125 each, up 5.3
percent.
   But Zhang Zhongqi, director of the bureau's comprehensive
statistics department, also said at a news conference that a
nationwide survey showed 21 percent of urban households had less to
spend last year because of an 8.8 percent rise in the cost of
living index.
   He said retail prices rose 7.3 percent nationwide, compared to
about 6 percent rise in 1986. In the cities, however, inflation hit
9.1 percent.
   He said the main factor was the inability of the nation's
producers, particularly of food and consumer goods, to meet the
growing demands of a more affluent society.
   Meat, poultry and egg prices climbed 16.5 percent, and fresh
vegetables and aquatic products rose about 17 percent. Pork and
sugar were rationed for the first time in decades in many cities
because farmers, discouraged by rising prices for raw materials,
cut back production.
   Wage earners who received no salary raises and retirees on fixed
incomes suffered the most from the price spiral, he said.
   Zhang said the government was trying to overcome supply-demand
imbalances by promoting production of non-staple commodities,
controlling excessive investment that has led to an overheated
economy and subsidizing some prices where consumers and producers
are particularly hard hit.
   He said 10 percent of China's urban residents were economically
distressed, defined as having an annual income of less than $108.
   In rural areas, 8.2 percent, or about 60 million people, were
under the poverty line of $54 a year. Zhang said poor people in the
countryside fell from 80 million in 1986, but he gave no
comparative figures for the urban poor.
   Zhang said unemployment hovered around 3 percent in 1987. He
said underemployment _ millions of workers in factories and offices
with little or nothing to do _ was an even more serious problem.
   The Chinese government has acknowledged that inflation,
unemployment and income disparities are all problems that China
will have to live with as it adjusts from a rigid central planning
system to a state-controlled but increasingly decentralized market
economy.
   Among the strong points were the nation's foreign trade, with
exports rising 27.8 percent to $39.5 billion. The trade deficit
fell from $12 billion in 1986 to $3.7 billion last year.
   It said new foreign investment in 1987 totalled $7.57 billion,
up 4.3 percent, of which $5.33 billion was from borrowing and $2.4
billion from direct investment.

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Vampire,'' a painting by Norwegian
artist Edvard Munch that was insured for $2.3 million, was stolen
today, the Munch Museum reported.
   Curator Arne Eggum said thieves broke through a ground floor
window of the museum and fled with the picture, which depicts a
woman with her mouth on a man's neck.
   ``After the museum alarm sounded, the theft was quickly
discovered and reported to the police by a caretaker who lives in
the museum building,'' he said.
   Wheel tracks outside the building indicated the culprits fled in
a small car, he told NTB news agency. Police said border
checkpoints were alerted.
   ``The Vampire'' was one of three paintings with the same theme
rendered by Munch in 1893 and 1894. A second painting also is in
the museum and a third is in Goteborg, Sweden.
   Munch, who died in 1944, bequeathed his private collection of
his art to the city of Oslo, including 1,100 paintings, 4,500
drawings and 18,000 prints.
   The Munch Museum has had several unresolved thefts since it
opened in 1963, and experts have called for improved security.

<TEXT>
   Florida citrus growers have filed suit in
federal court to prevent Texas from enforcing its emergency
quarantine of the fruit.
   The suit called the Feb. 11 quarantine unconstitutional and
invalid.
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower said he had ordered
the 30-day quarantine on fruits and plants to protect Texas' $65
million-a-year citrus industry from the canker which had infected
some Florida citrus groves.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hightower charged, had bowed
to pressure from Florida growers earlier this month when it lifted
a ban on shipments of Florida citrus to other citrus-producing
states. The ban was imposed in 1984 following an outbreak of citrus
canker in Florida.
   The suit by non-profit Florida Citrus Mutual and Tuxedo Fruit
Co., a citrus grower and shipper, alleged that Texas' quarantine
would cost the Florida citrus industry millions of dollars.
   The Florida petition, which seeks a preliminary injunction, said
an amended quarantine in Florida permits interstate movement of
fruit from Florida under certain rigorous federal standards.
   Max Woodfin, spokesman for the Texas department of agriculture,
said Texas agriculture officials were prepared to defend the
quarantine in ``any peaceful forum available.''
   Woodfin noted that a public hearing has been scheduled for
Thursday in McAllen. Testimony is expected from Florida,
California, Arizona, Louisiana and U.S. Department of Agriculture
officials, as well as Texas producers and experts on citrus disease.

   Caspar Weinberger received an honorary knighthood
from Queen Elizabeth II today, the highest royal honor Britain has
bestowed on an American.
   The brief, private ceremony at Buckingham Palace didn't mean the
former U.S. defense secretary would become Sir Caspar. That
accolade is reserved for the queen's own subjects. But it was
Britain's way of saying thanks to an exceptionally good friend.
   Asked why he got the knighthood, Weinberger modestly replied:
``I haven't the faintest idea.''
   But the announcement Feb. 1 cited his ``outstanding and
invaluable contribution'' to Anglo-American defense cooperation,
and his ``unfailing support and assistance'' during the 1982
Falkland Islands War between Britain and Argentina.
   The 70-year-old Weinberger, who counts Winston Churchill among
his heroes, did not have to kneel before the queen as a commoner
and be tapped on both shoulders with a sword, as is the custom for
British subjects.
   ``Her Majesty was nice enough just to present it to me.'' he
said, adding: ``I'm very honored, very pleased, and still very
astonished.''
   He received a red ribbon with the badge of the Order of the
British Empire, and a separate silver star signifying the title
Knight Grand Cross _ the highest order of chivalry for a foreigner.
   It means he can now call himself Caspar Weinberger GBE.
   Weinberger, wearing a gray suit, was accompanied by his wife,
Jane, and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, who had recommended
him for the honor.
   The 25-minute ceremony was held without reporters or
photographers present in the small, blue-walled Queen's Audience
Room where the 61-year-old monarch often receives official visitors.
   ``She was very gracious as always, and very generous in her
remarks,'' Weinberger told reporters afterward. He politely avoided
mentioning what they discussed.
   He carried his new insignia in a blue presentation box which he
opened for photographers just before driving away to a luncheon
hosted by U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II.
   When Weinberger's award was announced, reporters asked him
whether he was ready to be called ``Sir Cap.'' He replied: ``Good
God, no. Our constitution has some harsh words about titles. But I
really am flattered.''
   Asked after the ceremony whether he was now more of an
Anglophile, he replied: ``well, it's hard to be not.''
   Weinberger retired Nov. 5 after nearly seven years as President
Reagan's defense chief.
   The United States provided critical intelligence and logistical
support to Britain during its 74-day campaign to oust Argentina's
invasion force from the British-ruled South Atlantic islands.
Weinberger insisted Monday that his role was ``a comparatively
modest, small one.''
   Buckingham Palace said only a very few of the 55 other Americans
who have received honorary knighthoods were made GBEs. The most
famous Americans who have received honorary knighthoods were made
Knights of the British Empire or KBEs, a lower order of chivalry.
   They include former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, industrialist
Henry Ford III, philanthropists Paul Mellon and John Paul Getty II,
actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Sidney Poitier, former Sen. J.
William Fulbright, D-Ark., and food magnate Henry J. Heinz II.
   American-born violinist Yehudi Menuhin also received an honorary
KBE, but his award was changed to a full knighthood after he gained
dual British-U.S. citizenship in 1985, and he is now known as ``Sir
Yehudi.''
   Weinberger has longstanding links with Britain and has visited
often, finding strong support from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
for Reagan's military buildup at home and his drive to modernize
NATO and keep it unified.
   The Anglo-American relationship, he said, is ``critically
important'' to the Western alliance.
   Weinberger gave up an invitation to the White House last
November to make his debut as a British television commentator on
the treaty eliminating medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles,
which he helped secure _ and had some candid assessments of the
Soviet leadership.
   Last month, he was appointed a distinguished visiting professor
at Edinburgh University, where he will spend four weeks this summer
participating in a special project investigating the interplay
among technology, communications and the humanities.
   Weinberger often cites Churchill, especially the late prime
minister's early warnings in the 1930s that Europe must rearm in
response to the growing military threat from Germany.
   Weinberger says he sees ``some rather deadly parallels'' today,
and warned Monday that NATO must remain strong ``to deal with
increasing Soviet threats.''

<HEAD>Cuba To Release More Political Prisoners, U.S. Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cuban government plans to
release a significant number of political prisoners in an effort to
block a formal United Nations investigation of human rights in
Cuba, U.S. officials say.
   Fidel Castro will ``release thousands of political prisoners
mixed in with common prisoners'' to persuade member nations to vote
down the American proposal for the U.N. investigation, said Armando
Valladares, chief of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission in Geneva.
   A spokesman for a Cuban delegation in Geneva was quoted today by
the Fort Lauderdale News-Sun Sentinel as saying a major
announcement would be made in Cuba on Wednesday, but he would not
elaborate.
   A State Department official who closely follows Cuban affairs
said the ``thousands'' suggested by Valladares, who spent 22 years
in Cuban prisons, may be overly optimistic, but a good chance
exists the Cubans will free enough prisoners to make the action
appear significant.
   ``Even if it is for cosmetic purposes, we love it,'' said the
official, who asked not to be identified. ``We're talking about
human lives here. Even if a release is done cynically, people are
still out of prison.''
   The United States placed a similar resolution before the U.N.
Human Rights Commission's annual session last year. It failed by
one vote on a procedural motion 19 to 18, with five nations
abstaining. The State Department again expects a close vote.
   Although the resolution does not condemn Cuba's human rights
record, a U.N. investigation of human rights practices on the
communist island would be politically embarrassing to Castro.
   Estimates of Cuban political prisoners range from as few as 500
to as many as 10,000. The State Department official said Castro
himself has acknowledged holding 1,000 to 2,000 such prisoners.

   Republican presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson said today that charges of Jimmy Swaggart's sexual
misconduct had been known for a few months, but somebody planned
the scandal to embarrass him before the Super Tuesday elections.
   Swaggart, a television evangelist accused of sexual misconduct,
was ordered Monday by the hierarchy of his church in Baton Rouge,
La., to limit his preaching and enter counseling.
   Robertson, who bristles at the label of former television
evangelist, said today that evidence showing that Swaggart had been
involved with prostitutes had ``lied dormant since last October.''
   It ``stretches the imagination and stretches credulity'' that it
came two weeks ``before the most important primary in the nation,''
the Republican candidate said during a news conference in Columbia.
A round of primaries and caucuses will be held Super Tuesday, March
8, in 20 states.
   ``Nothing happens to people by accident,'' Robertson said in an
interview Monday with the Anderson, S.C., Independent-Mail. ``It is
kind of funny this came up two weeks before the most important
primaries in the nation. People probably wonder what went on.
   ``I think somebody had something to do with it,'' said
Robertson. ``Somebody else planned all these things, I am afraid.''
   Asked again today whether he had any evidence to show that the
scandal broke just before Super Tuesday, Robertson replied: ``I
have no knowledge. It's certainly a coincidence.''
   On Monday, Robertson offered no proof of his contention, and
declined to say to whom he was referring. However, in the same
interview he accused the campaign of Vice President George Bush of
``dirty politics'' and ``trickery'' directed at him.
   A Bush campaign official, asked about the remarks, said
Robertson had apparently adopted a new campaign strategy of
``making bizarre statements in order to make news.''
   ``To suggest that we had something to do with (the Swaggart
affair) borders on the outlandish,'' said Jay Morgan, Bush's deputy
Southern political director, in a telephone interview from his home
in Atlanta.
   Robertson repeated his charge today that the Bush campaign plans
``dirty tricks'' in South Carolina, saying he was told that the
vice president's campaign plans to run some television ads
``dealing with religious bigotry in the few days before the (South
Carolina primary) elections.''
   Bush campaign ad director Sid Rogich said today the only ad
running in South Carolina is a biographical commercial.
   Two weeks ago, Robertson scolded NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, who
interviewed him live on the night of the Iowa caucuses, for
referring to him as a former television evangelist.
   Robertson, who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network and
for years hosted its flagship program ``The 700 Club,'' says he
wants to be described as a former religious broadcaster, or a
television businessman.
   Earlier Monday, Robertson had said Swaggart's troubles were
``unfortunate,'' but had nothing to do with him.
   He said the Swaggart case will have ``no more effect on me than
Gary Hart'' had on other candidates, referring to Hart's problems
following reports of his relationship with a Miami model. Hart
dropped out of the presidential race in May but rejoined it in
December.
   ``It (the Swaggart controversy) will not affect me because it
has nothing whatsoever to do with me,'' Robertson told the Anderson
newspaper. ``But I want to tell people to ask George Bush what he
thinks about all this.
   ``I have been told of Bush's dirty tricks and I expect to see
them in South Carolina,'' he said. ``His campaign will use every
kind of dirty trick against me because this state is important and
I have a lot of support and George Bush knows that.''
   South Carolina holds its primary March 5, three days before 20
states, mainly in the South, hold primaries and caucuses.

   The FBI today denied it had conducted a
political investigation of anti-Reagan activists, saying it had
information that members of the targeted group planned or discussed
disrupting the 1984 Republican convention and shutting down a
public utility.
   The FBI's executive assistant director, Oliver B. Revell, came
before a Senate panel to defend the probe of the Committee In
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador. The probe was ended
without any charges being filed.
   The group has said it was investigated because it opposes
President Reagan's Central America policies.
   Documents previously released in the March 1985-June 1985 probe
show that FBI agents and informants sent to spy on CISPES collected
so much information on peaceful protest activities that bureau
headquarters was worried that the investigation had gone too far.
   The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act,
have shown that while the investigation was targeted at CISPES, the
files eventually included information on hundreds of other
individuals and groups, ranging from Roman Catholic nuns to union
leaders who opposed Reagan policies.
   In defending the probe, Revell told the Senate Intelligence
Committee that in addition to possible violence, CISPES was
involved in circulating forged U.S. documents and had strong ties
to the U.S. communist party.
   ``Some have insinuated that this investigation was politically
motivated as many individuals associated with CISPES were opposed
to Reagan administration policies in Central America,'' Revell
said. ``Nothing could be further from the truth.
   ``We did find indications that some CISPES members were at least
discussing and planning violence. Our investigtions uncovered one
CISPES member who was tasked to determine response times of
emergency services in a major American city; another CISPES member
stated he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in a
major midwestern city; as well as plans to violently disrupt the
1984 Republican convention.''
   The bureau initiated the investigation under foreign
intelligence and counter-intelligence guidelines, designed to
protect the United States against crimes such as espionage and
terrorism, in which foreign powers or groups are involved.
   These guidelines allow the FBI to focus more on politically
oriented groups and their missions than on specific crimes that are
planned or carried out. Because of this wider latitude, some
lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that it is
easy to cross the line and investigate free speech and peaceful
assembly.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the investigation in this
case ``was predicated on information received from several sources
that certain leaders and key members of CISPES were involved in
covertly furnishing funds and materials to a foreign terrorist
organization.'' The group was identified as the FMLN, the group
fighting a war against the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador.
   Jerry Berman, chief legislative counsel for the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the investigation should have started under
the most strict guidelines, those for general criminal
investigations.
   These investigations can only begin ``when facts or
circumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been, is
being, or will be committed.'' If the crime has already been
committed, the probe focuses on who committed the act and on
securing evidence.
   The FBI is given greater leeway for a domestic ``intelligence''
investigation, which can focus on groups in the United States
trying ``to further political or social goals through activities
that involve criminal violence.''
   The bureau did not place the CISPES investigation under either
the intelligence or general guidelines, but under the foreign
intelligence and counter-intelligence rules that involve
participation by foreign entities.
   These rules remain largely classified, but officials familiar
with them say they provide the widest latitude among the different
sets of guidelines.
   On July 26, 1984 _ some 16 months after the investigation began
_ FBI headquarters sent 32 field offices a message that suggested
some of them were going beyond the guidelines.
   ``Some offices have reported information recently regarding
political statements and political lobbying by CISPES or CISPES
affiliates,'' it said. ``Supervisors in recipient offices must
carefully monitor this and related investigations and asset
operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate
direction, targeting and reporting.''
   But messages from the field showed that bureaus were still
confused.
   In August 1984 the Denver office told headquarters, ``the field
is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political
activity can be monitored.''
   And prior to the July directive, FBI headquarters received
messages like this one from Cincinnati: ``The bureau is requested
to furnish Cincinnati with guidelines regarding investigation of
captioned matter, vis-a-vis religious organizations _ specifically
the Roman Catholic Church.''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
civil rights subcommittee, said he does not fault the FBI for
starting the investigation under foreign intelligence guidelines,
but for ``a management problem'' in not shutting it down much
sooner.
   ``We want it narrow, and stopped when criminal conduct is not
found,'' he said in an interview. ``The CISPES investigation went
on for years and there was no criminal conduct. Somebody should
have blown the whistle.''
   Berman, of the ACLU, said the field offices became ``a vacuum
cleaner for collection of First Amendment activity.''
   ``They never began to narrow it,'' he said. ``They ended up
sweeping up the First Amendment activity and broadly targeting
CISPES all over the country.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze briefed Warsaw Pact colleagues today on his talks in
Moscow with U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the state
news agency CTK said.
   Shevardnadze arrived in Prague this morning to a welcome from
Foreign Minister Bohuslav Chnoupek, then went to the Foreign
Ministry in the Cernin Palace to inform colleagues of the latest
superpower talks on arms reduction and Afghanistan.
   CTK quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Dusan Rovensky as saying
Shevardnadze briefed Warsaw Pact colleagues ``in a profound and all
round manner'' about his talks with Shultz.
   The Foreign Ministry reported two hours after the session began
that the Warsaw Pact ministers had ended their talks.
   Shultz and Sheverardnadze concluded two days of talks in Moscow
earlier today, when the secretary of state departed for Brussels to
brief NATO foreign ministers. The superpower ministers said their
negotiating session moved the superpowers closer to a strategic
arms agreement and a spring summit in Moscow.
   Besides Chnoupek, foreign ministers attending today's session in
Prague included Romania's Ioan Totu and Bulgaria's Peter Mladenov.
   Poland sent Deputy Foreign Minister Henryk Jaroszek. East
Germany and Hungary were represented by their state secretaries,
Herbert Krolikowski and Gyula Horn.

   Panamanian officials detained 25 U.S.
military personnel here for two hours and then released them
without filing charges, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said today.
   But a top Panamanian military official denied the personnel were
detained, and said police officers only briefly stopped them to
check for drivers' licenses.
   The U.S. Embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Asociated Press that Panamanian officials detained the 25
troops as they were driving Monday to U.S. military installations
located in the former Panama Canal Zone.
   Most of the troops were driving motorcycles but two were in cars
and one was walking, the spokesman said. Panamanian officials
released all 25 after two hours without charges, the embassy
official said.
   Col. Leonidas Macias, chief of police for the Defense Forces of
Panama, denied police had detained the U.S. personnel. Macias said
local police momentarily stopped them to ask for drivers' licenses
and to remind them that U.S. troops are prohibited from wearing
their uniforms outside the former Canal Zone.
   Relations between Panama and the United States have been
strained since last June, when protests started here against the
leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, chief of the Defense
Forces and the power behind the civilian government.

<TEXT>
   The Afghan guerrilla alliance today
announced a plan to form a coalition Cabinet that would replace the
communist government of President Najib and ensure the withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Western diplomats in Kabul, meanwhile, reported a bomb went off
in the Soviet Embassy compound, indicating the guerrillas are
intensifying their attacks in the capital.
   The seven-party Islamic Unity of Afghan Mujahedeen announced the
plan in a statement telexed from the Pakistani border city of
Peshawar. It stipulates that Afghanistan would have a 28-member
Cabinet to replace Najib's Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   The statement said the government would be made up of 14
ministers from among the guerrilla leadership, seven
representatives from among the 3 million Afghan refugees in
Pakistan and ``seven Moslems presently living in Kabul.''
   Earlier, guerrilla leaders said these ``Moslems'' would include
non-communists in the Kabul administration who have not committed
serious offenses ``against the people'' during the eight-year war.
   The proposal, which would allow the guerrillas to control the
Afghan government, was not expected to be accepted by the Soviets
or the current administration in Kabul.
   Diplomatic sources said today that Moslem guerrillas have
stepped up attacks in Kabul, where Communist officials and Soviet
advisers reportedly are preparing to leave.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at
least 18 explosions were heard during the past week in the Afghan
capital, including one in the Soviet Embassy compound and one near
Radio Afghanistan.
   One source said a bomb inside the Soviet compound Feb. 19 caused
some injuries, but there were no further details.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced early this month
that the Red Army could begin pulling its 115,000 troops out of
Afghanistan by May 15 if Kabul and Islamabad sign a U.N.-sponsored
accord by mid-March.
   A new round of indirect talks between Islamabad and Kabul is
scheduled for March 2 at Geneva. Pakistan insists an accord should
be linked to an agreed plan on formation of a transitional
government.
   Islamabad and the guerrillas are pushing this point because they
fear an outbreak of fighting between various Afghan groups and the
communists if no government is in power.
   The Soviets, however, disagree, charging that such an insistance
on setting up an interim government is obstructing Soviet plans to
withdraw.
   Guerrilla leaders have rejected any power-sharing with the
current Kabul officials and today's statement from Peshawar backed
up that position.
   The statement said a Shoora-ali or supreme council would also be
formed to oversee the Cabinet. It would consist of the leaders of
the seven-party alliance and would provide ``joint leadership
during the interim period.''
   The insurgents said the ``broad-based transitional government
will represent all sections of the Afghan nation.''
   The alliance said there would be a consultative council of 75
members consisting of two members from each of Afghanistan's 28
provinces and 19 members from among Moslem religious scholars,
intellectuals and technocrats. The council would frame the interim
laws to administer the country until an elected constituent
assembly writes a constitution.
   The country would adopt the name, the Islamic State of
Afghanistan, ``wherein the Koran ... will be supreme,'' the
statement added.

   A police crackdown on street gangs has been
applauded by some black leaders tired of the violence that claimed
300 lives last year, but the arrest of an off-duty black officer
also raises the question of harassment.
   Black and Hispanic leaders accused police of largely ignoring
the gang violence until a woman bystander was killed Jan. 30 in
street-gang crossfire in an upscale neighborhood.
   But two weeks after the shooting, an off-duty black policeman
from a blue-collar suburb was arrested by Los Angeles police as he
stood on a street corner in the same neighborhood, accompanied by
six black youths. The officer said his group was conducting an
informal ``sting'' operation to investigate alleged harassment by
city police.
   Both the arrest and the killing of 27-year-old Karen Toshima
occurred in Westwood Village, a theater and restaurant district
that soaring housing prices have turned into a relatively wealthy
neighborhood.
   Authorities say there were more than 300 gang-related murders in
Los Angeles County in 1987 and the rate is increasing. But gang
violence usually is confined to the predominantly black and
Hispanic southside neighborhoods of the nation's second-largest
city where turf battles between drug dealers have led to drive-by
shootings.
   Five people were killed and five others were injured in gang
shootings last weekend even as police staged a crackdown. Deputy
Chief Glenn Levant, newly appointed as the city's anti-gang czar,
said the more than 50 arrests were part of a strategy to prevent
murders by taking gang members out of circulation.
   Children playing in parks and a 67-year-old woman sitting in a
wheelchair have been killed when gang hitmen missed their targets.
   ``And that's not the way it should be. We should be able to live
normally,'' said Barbara Thomas, spokeswoman for the South Central
Organizing Committee, which says it represents thousands of black
families.
   City Councilman Nate Holden, who is black and represents a
largely black district, said the yearning for more police
protection crosses racial lines.
   ``I've had white people complain about the gangs. They all just
want to feel secure in their community and their homes,'' he said.
   At the same time, the sting by Sgt. Don Jackson of the Hawthorne
Police Department called into question the racial sensitivity of
the Los Angeles police.
   ``None of those kids did anything except stand on that corner
and be black _ and that was enough,'' said Jackson, who was
released on his recognizance after being arrested on a misdemeanor
charge of resisting an officer.
   The police department defended the arrest of Jackson and
frisking of the others, saying the group, dressed like gang
members, was blocking the sidewalk and refused to move.
   The question of police harassment is among the issues being
considered as the city moves ahead with a plan to hire 150 more
officers, increasing the force to its largest strength ever, 7,500
officers.
   Police Chief Darryl Gates on Monday declined to say anything
about how he will deploy his forces until after a March 8 hearing
of the city's advisory Police Commission.
   Mayor Tom Bradley, as he approved the new hiring last week, said
the additional forces would help ``return this city to a drug-free,
gang-free atmosphere.''
   John P. Kenney, a criminologist and former Police Commission
member, said more police officers is not the answer. ``It wouldn't
solve the problem. It would for a few days or for a few weeks. Then
you get complaints of overpolicing and harassing,'' he said.
   ``Historically, there's a resentment to an excessive show of
force,'' said Garrett Capune, professor of criminology at the
University of Southern California. ``It has a racist overtone, you
know, there seems to be more crime because there's more officers.
It becomes a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.''
   But Holden replied: ``These guys can sit in some classroom and
think what it's supposed to be like. But they haven't seen the real
world. I resent them. Let them come into the black community and
see what it's like.''
   Hundreds of southside residents demonstrated at police
headquarters after extra officers were deployed in Westwood this
month, primarily at the request of merchants who were afraid their
business would be hurt by news of the gang shooting.
   Minority activists later publicized a study by the independent
Public Administration Service in Virginia that appeared to show
police responded more slowly to crimes in poor areas.
   The police department on Friday released a letter from the
principal author of the report stating that it had been widely
misinterpreted. The letter said the study concluded the department
takes too long to respond to emergencies, but that geographical
differences are not significant.

<HEAD>Ireland Probes Ulster Shooting; Soldier in 1983 Shooting Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British soldier ordered
jailed for life for killing a Belfast Roman Catholic has been freed
and returned to his regiment after serving only three years in
prison, the army said today.
   The disclosure came amid Anglo-Irish tensions following the
killing of a Catholic man on Sunday by a British soldier and the
Irish government's decision to conduct its own investigation of the
slaying, which occurred in Northern Ireland.
   The announcement that the convicted killer, Pvt. Ian Richard
Thain, was back in uniform, although not in Northern Ireland,
provoked sharp reactions from leaders of the province's Catholic
minority. At the same time, leaders of Northern Ireland's
Protestant majority were angered by Dublin's announcement that it
will probe Sunday's killing.
   Thain was jailed for the fatal shooting of Thomas Reilly, road
manager of the pop group Bananarama, on Aug. 9, 1983. Thain claimed
in court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed
Reilly was about to pull a gun on him.
   But the judge found him ``deliberately untruthful'' and said he
did not believe Thain truly feared Reilly was about to shoot at
him. Thain was the first soldier sentenced to life imprisonment for
actions in Northern Ireland.
   An army statement said Thain was then 18 and ``while the army in
no way condones his action, we consider the incident to have been a
tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very difficult
circumstances.''
   The Home Office said Thain was released on a life license, a
form of parole whereby he can be reimprisoned ``should his behavior
give rise to concern.'' It said he was freed after a review by the
state parole board.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, said Thain's release showed there was no justice
in Northern Ireland. The victim's father, Jim Reilly, said: ``I'm
very, very shocked and distressed. I can't believe this has
happened.''
   Meanwhile, the Irish government sent Deputy Police Commissioner
Eugene Crowley to Monaghan, on the border with Northern Ireland, to
launch an investigation into Sunday's shooting of 23-year-old Aidan
McAnespie.
   McAnespie was killed by a bullet from an army observation tower
at a checkpoint near Aughnacloy, half a mile from the frontier in
County Tyrone.
   Relatives said he was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game
and had passed through the checkpoint when he was shot.
   McAnespie was a Sinn Fein supporter, and his former parish
priest said he was harassed whenever he passed through the
checkpoint. Press Association, the British news agency, said the
soldier who fired at McAnespie told his interrogators it was an
accident. The soldier is in military custody.
   The Irish move was seen as a calculated slight to Britain, since
its police force in the province was conducting an inquiry. British
authorities stressed that the Irish investigation would be confined
to Ireland's side of the border.

<TEXT>
   The European Court of Justice today voided a
1985 European Economic Community law banning the marketing of
hormone-treated meat in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   The EEC high court said the Common Market states had not
followed correct procedures when they enacted the ban, which was
passed by a written procedure that required unanimity.
   Denmark and Britain had opposed the ban and the British took the
issue to court.
   The ban on the use of cattle-fattening hormones took effect Jan.
1 for meat produced in the EEC. It was to take effect in January
1989 for imported beef.
   The United States has called the ban an unfair trade practice
and threatened retaliation. It also disputed the contention of EEC
consumer groups that there was enough scientific evidence to show
that the hormones posed a human health threat.
   Proponents ontended the ban did not discriminate against the
United States because it applied to all nations, including those of
the EEC.
   U.S. beef exports to the EEC total about $130 million a year.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a quick trial of a lawsuit
that could affect whether an 11-year-old boy with leukemia lives or
dies.
   The suit was filed by the boy's father, Jim Lacina of Geneva, to
regain health insurance coverage he contends was mistakenly
canceled.
   Doctors say the boy, Jamie, needs a bone marrow transplant by
March 15 to survive more than a few months. But the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center, the Seattle hospital that could treat the
boy, requires patients to have insurance coverage or $100,000 in
hand before it will perform the procedure, said hospital
spokeswoman Susan Edmonds.
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Carl J. Character declined
Monday to decide the case without a jury, but set a jury trial date
for Monday so a verdict could be issued in time for Jamie to get
the treatment.
   ``We've definitely advanced this case more than a year,''
Character said. ``They (the Lacinas) came in and indicated the
condition of the young man had become more critical. ... Hopefully
it can be resolved in a timely fashion.''
   Lacina says chemotherapy no longer is an effective treatment for
his son.
   In the lawsuit, filed in 1986, Lacina said Nationwide Life
Insurance Co. of Columbus terminated his health insurance without
notifying him.
   A nine-year agent for Nationwide, Lacina lost his job in 1983
because of company cutbacks. Attorneys for both sides agree that he
paid to continue his policy after he lost his job.
   Lacina's attorney, Gerald Jeppe, told Character that Lacina
didn't receive a copy of his policy, a notice that his premium was
due, or a termination notice in late 1983. He asked the judge to
rule in Lacina's favor without a jury trial.
   Jeppe said Lacina is applying for Medicaid while he awaits a
decision on the case. Meanwhile, a fund for the boy has been
established at a bank, he said.
   Nationwide's attorney, Edward E. Duncan, told Character that the
company mailed Lacina the documents in question. A jury should
decide whether Lacina received them, he said.
   ``The facts of this case are indeed tragic. A little boy through
no fault of his own may be denied care,'' Duncan said. ``The long
and the short of it is whether Mr. Lacina is telling the truth when
he says he didn't receive either of those letters or that policy.''
   Duncan said Nationwide will prove at the trial that Lacina's
behavior was inconsistent for a man who thought he had health
insurance coverage. Lacina ran up large hospital bills for his son
and filed for bankruptcy, Duncan said.
   ``The lawsuit wasn't filed until the summer of 1986,'' Duncan
said. ``What was Mr. Lacina doing between 1983 and 1986 with these
hospital bills if he had coverage?''
   Jeppe declined to discuss the case aside from the comments he
made in court.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn has written to city
councilors seeking approval of an experimental sterile needle
exchange for drug addicts in hopes of curbing the spread of AIDS.
   Flynn said addicts, their sex partners and their babies ``are
the fastest growing group of AIDS victims,'' and that conventional
anti-drug measures ``do not go far enough in the short term'' to
curb the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Dr. George A. Lamb, the city's director of clinical and
community health services, was prepared to outline the proposed
program at a closed meeting this morning at City Hall, according to
The Boston Globe. He recently toured several European cities to
examine needle distribution programs.
   Addicts could enter the program on their own or by referral,
Lamb said.
   Flynn is seeking approval by the City Council of a home rule
petition to the Legislature, the newspaper said. The move would
bypass any applicable state laws against possession of hypodermic
syringes by drug addicts or against dispensing such equipment to
drug addicts.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has opposed any needle exchange program,
as had state Public Health Commissioner Deborah Prothrow-Stith.
   The Globe quoted Prothrow-Stith as suggesting Monday night that
if the state wanted to consider ``something really radical,'' it
could supply addicts not only with sterile needles but also with
heroin.
   But Department of Public Health spokesman John Stobierski said
today the comment ``was in no way a policy recommendation or
proposal,'' but was made by the commissioner in explaining why she
believed the needle exchange proposal was ``very, very wrong.''
   In a statement today, Prothrow-Stith said the department remains
opposed to a needle exchange for IV drug users'' and that the state
should continue to concentrate on drug treatment and rehabilitation
programs.
   A proposal by New York City to supply a small number of addicts
with clean needles on an experimental basis awaits formal approval
from the state health commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, who had
opposed the idea but said last month that he would approve it.
   New York wants to supply 200 to 400 addicts with syringes. The
recipients would have to turn in used needles to get fresh ones.
The needles would be tested for AIDS and to ensure that they
weren't shared.
   Although the test period would last a year, the city's health
commissioner, Dr. Stephen Joseph, has said he expected solid
indications of success or failure within six months.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring.

   A dog named Tootsie awakened her master
with a whine and led him outside to a snowdrift, where he found his
90-year-old mother curled up in her nightgown.
   Ethelyn Preston, who has Alzheimer's disease, was listed in
stable condition today at Swedish Medical Center in suburban
Englewood, where she is being treated for a broken right arm and
cuts.
   ``If Tootsie hadn't notified me, she would have died,'' said Roy
Preston, Mrs. Preston's 58-year-old son, who lives with her.
   Preston said his 3{-year-old boxer woke him up Friday morning,
``whining, like she wanted to tell me something,'' he said. ``Then
she ran right out to the back yard.''
   He followed the dog and found his mother lying on her right
side, slightly curled up in a snowdrift near the back door. She was
wearing a nightgown and was barefoot.
   ``When I saw her there, I was frantic,'' her son said. ``I
couldn't lift her. Her body was stiff. She was all dead weight from
lying out in the cold.''
   She had been outside about 15 minutes, he said.
   Preston got help from a neighbor and an ambulance.
   When the ambulance arrived, Tootsie pitched in again.
   ``She was running back and forth from where she (Ethelyn
Preston) was and the ambulance,'' her son said. ``It seemed like
she (Tootsie) wanted to tell them where my mother was.''
   Preston said his mother probably was trying to get to the
bathroom, next to her bedroom, when she lost her way and ended up
in the yard.
   He said he will hire round-the-clock supervision for her when
she gets home from the hospital.

   The United States will be able to provide
military help to NATO allies despite the new U.S.-Soviet treaty
banning medium-range nuclear weapons from Europe, the chief U.S.
negotiator for the pact told a Senate committee today.
   ``If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' Maynard
Glitman told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Glitman was testifying about the effect of article 14, a
provision which says that neither side shall do anything, now or in
the future, to undercut the pact.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told Glitman that ``I'm concerned about
article 14'' because it might limit future U.S. aid to NATO nations.
   The provision is a standard clause added to other treaties which
simply restates the intention of both nations to abide by the pact,
Glitman said.
   The treaty spells out in great detail what each side cannot do
and anything is permitted if it is not prohibited, said Glitman.
   For example, said Glitman, the treaty doesn't ban the transfer
of U.S. technology to NATO nations such as Great Britain to develop
ground-launched cruise missiles. Those U.S. missiles will be banned
by the treaty but the British could go ahead and build their own,
he said.
   Glitman said U.S. negotiators resisted Soviet efforts to block
U.S. help for NATO. ``We knew their goal was to find a way to put a
brake on NATO activities,'' he said.
   President Reagan pledged today that the United States will do
its part to ensure that the NATO alliance remains strong, saying in
an address broadcast to Europe that ``our destiny is coupled with
yours.''
   In the address, which came a week before a NATO summit meeting,
Reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any
member nation is an attack against all of them. ``Simply put, an
attack on Munich is the same as an attack on Chicago,'' he said.
   Glitman's testimony was part of a detailed examination of the
pact, a line-by-line scrutiny which legislators said was necessary
to avoid possible conflicts with future administrations over the
treaty's meaning.
   ``It is very regrettable that we have to go through this,''
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Monday to
Glitman.
   Nunn and other Democrats noted that the scrutiny arises from
congressional distrust of the executive branch, a skepticism born
of the fight over the meaning of an earlier treaty.
   Nunn noted the State Department had delivered 31 volumes of
records about how U.S.-Soviet negotiators reached the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact signed by President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Committee staffers spent 300 hours reviewing only three volumes
of records that preceded the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty,
Nunn said.
   The Armed Services panel is one of three Senate committees
examining the INF treaty. Ratification by the full Senate is
expected but the votes will be delayed until after Nunn's committee
finishes it close examination, Nunn told his colleagues Monday.
   Ratification would require a two-thirds vote.
   The distrust arose from a dispute between the
Democratic-controlled Congress and the Reagan administration over
the meaning of the ABM pact, particularly how it would affect
Reagan's Star Wars missile-defense research program.
   The existing ``narrow'' interpretation of the ABM pact would ban
some tests of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is
formally known. But Reagan has asserted that his administration has
the right to unilaterally move to a ``broad'' view of the pact that
would permit SDI tests.
   Nunn led a congressional fight to block the move to a ``broad''
view of the ABM pact and promised to delay the INF ratification
until the administration promised that current testimony on the INF
pact was ``authoritative.''
   Administration officials had argued that the 1973 executive
branch testimony on the ABM pact wasn't ``authoritative.''
   Nunn told Glitman that committee staff members had drawn up 135
questions, many of them technical, about possible ambiguities in
the treaty.
   Two other Democrats on the committee supported Nunn's decision
to scrutinize the INF pact.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said, ``I'm sorry there was a
reinterpretation of the ABM treaty that made this necessary.'' Sen.
James Exon, D-Neb., said, ``It's sad we have to go through the
exercise we're going through here.''
   Meantime, Dr. Edward Teller, the physicist who is considered the
father of both SDI and the hydrogen bomb, supported the treaty in
testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee.
   Teller noted that he deeply distrusts the Soviets and said, ``my
personal approach (to the treaty) is careful, doubtful, yet
positive.''
   Teller termed the fights over the meaning of the treaty
``senseless debates.''

   NEW YORK _ A 70-year-old man reputed to be the underboss of the
Gambino crime family has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and
fined $820,000 for a racketeering conviction.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein said Monday he sentenced
Joseph Armone to prison despite his age because he was convinced
the defendant was a high-ranking member of the crime family.
   Weinstein also cited Armone's lengthy criminal record, which he
said began when the defendant was 15 years old.
   Armone, of Brooklyn, was convicted Dec. 22 of racketeering
conspiracy involving extortion, bribery and illegal interstate
travel to commit bribery.
   He was jailed after his conviction when he refused to renounce
any organized crime ties, a condition for his release from
detention.
   He had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for the most serious
charge, racketeering.
   One of the bribery charges accused Armone and a co-defendant,
Joseph N. Gallo, of plotting to give a $20,000 bribe so that
Gallo's son would be transferred from a state prison to a federal
prison, where presumably he would receive better treatment. The
plot was unsuccessful.
   Gallo, 76, the reputed former consigliere of the Gambino family,
was sentenced earlier this month to 10 years in prison and fined
$300,000 for his racketeering conviction. Weinstein stayed the
sentence pending appeal.
   Two other co-defendants were also sentenced Monday. Anthony
Vitta, 49, of Queens, a reputed Gambino soldier, was given a
10-year prison sentence and fined $250,000. Vitta was convicted of
racketeering conspiracy, loansharking and other charges.
   Salvatore Migliorisi, 49, of Brooklyn, was sentenced to three
years in jail and fined $25,000 for his extortion and obstruction
of justice conviction.
   The four defendants were among 16 people with alleged ties to
the Gambino family who were indicted in June 1986.
   Of the 16 defendants, 11 have now been convicted or have pleaded
guilty, two were acquitted, charges against one defendant were
dismissed, another defendant is missing and believed dead, and one
is awaiting trial.
   Armone faces additional federal charges of extortion and
racketeering in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he and 12 other people
with alleged ties to the Gambino family were named last month in a
22-count indictment.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Criminal Suspect's Rights in California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A criminal suspect's rights are not violated
when a witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court
testifies about an earlier identification of the accused, the
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The justices, voting 6-2, ordered the reinstatement of the
conviction of a California prison inmate in the beating of a prison
guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in his opinion for the court, said a
defendant's right to cross-examine his accusers is not violated by
admission of a prior, out-of-court identification statement from a
witness who is unable to explain in court the basis for the
identification.
   Scalia said defense lawyers have ample power to attack the
credibility of such witnesses when they take the stand.
   ``The weapons available to impugn the witness's statement when
memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve
success,'' Scalia said. ``But successful cross-examination is not
the constitutional guarantee.''
   The decision is a victory for the Reagan administration, which
urged the court to reinstate the federal conviction of James Joseph
Owens for assault with intent to murder John Foster, a guard at a
federal prison in Lompoc, Calif.
   Owens, a prisoner there at the time of the attack, was sentenced
to an additional 20 years for the assault.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Owens' assault
conviction on grounds he was denied the right to cross-examine
Foster effectively.
   Foster was attacked on April 12, 1982, with a metal pipe. He
suffered numerous injuries to his head, face, arms and hands.
   On May 5, 1982, shortly before he was released from a hospital,
Foster told an FBI agent that Owens had attacked him. Foster also
picked Owens' photograph from several mug shots.
   But at the trial, Foster said he was unable to recall who
assaulted him or whether he actually saw his assailant. He did
testify that he remembered identifying Owens when questioned in the
hospital by the FBI agent but said he no longer remembered why he
said Owens was the assailant.
   The 9th Circuit court said Foster may have been influenced by
visitors who spoke with him during his hospital stay.
   Three inmates testified that Owens was the attacker. There also
was evidence that Owens attended a meeting the day before the
assault of the Moorish Science Temple of America, a prison
religious group that discussed attacking Foster.
   In a dissenting opinion today, Justice William J. Brennan said
the high court ruling ``reduces the right of confrontation to a
purely procedural protection, and a markedly hollow one at that.''
   He was joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who became a member of the court
Thursday, did not take part in the decision.
   The case is U.S. vs. Owens, 86-877.

<HEAD>Man `Cures' Mental Illness By Shooting Self in Brain</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `The man,...' to CORRECT that Physician's
Weekly and the British Journal of Psychiatry are two different
publications.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young mentally ill man egged into a suicide
attempt by his mother apparently cured his phobia of germs and
obsession for handwashing by shooting himself in the head, doctors
said.
   The .22-caliber slug destroyed the section of the brain
responsible for his disabling obsessive-compulsive behavior without
causing any other brain damage to the man, a straight-A student,
his doctor said.
   The afflicted man tried to kill himself five years ago, when he
was 19, said psychiatrist Leslie Solyom of Shaughnessy Hospital in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Victims of the disorder typically have an inexplicable
compulsion to repeat activities over and over.
   The man, identified only as George in a report in Physician's
Weekly and the British Journal of Psychiatry, washed his hands
hundreds of times a day and took frequent showers, Solyom said. The
behavior forced him to drop out of school and quit his job.
   Solyom treated George for more than a year before he attempted
suicide.
   ``George was also very depressed and told his mother that his
life was so wretched that he would rather die,'' Solyom said.
``Parents of obsessive-compulsives, particularly mothers, often
have cruel streaks,'' he said.
   ``She said, `So look George, if your life is so wretched, just
go and shoot yourself.' So George went to the basement, stuck a
.22-caliber rifle in his mouth and pulled the trigger.''
   The bullet lodged in the left front lobe of the brain. Surgeons
removed it, but could not get out all the fragments.
   ``When he was transferred to our hospital three weeks later, he
had hardly any compulsions left,'' Solyom said.
   After brain surgery to remove the bullet he showed no signs of
his former obsession, the doctor said. He returned to school, got a
new job and is now in his second year of college, having retained
the same IQ as he had before the illness struck, Solyom said.
   Monday's edition of Physician's Weekly wryly described the
failed suicide attempt as ``successful radical surgery.''
   The story was also reported in today's editions of the Los
Angeles Times.
   ``The idea that a man could blow out part of his frontal lobe
and have his pathological symptoms cured is quite remarkable, but
it is not beyond belief,'' said psychiatrist Thomas Ballantine of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   ``What made the case so very interesting was that we had
measured IQ and done a lot of other tests before the suicide
attempt,'' Solyom said. ``Afterward, we compared results and he had
not lost anything. We used very sensitive tests to measure brain
damage and could find none.''
   New research indicates that as much as 3 percent of the U.S.
population displays some obsessive-compulsive behavior, according
to psychiatrist Michael Jenike of Harvard University.
   Conventional psychotherapy is useless in such victims, Jenike
said. The disorder is most effectively treated with a combination
of antidepressant drugs and behavioral therapy.
   As a last resort, neurosurgeons will occasionally remove part of
the left front lobe of the brain, where the obsessive behavior is
thought to originate. The operation is probably performed between
10 and 30 times per year in the United States, Ballantine said,
with mixed results.

<HEAD>Meese: Amnesty Extension Unlikely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time is running out for long-term illegal
aliens to apply for amnesty under a yearlong program, U.S. Attorney
General Edwin Meese warned.
   The deadline for applications under the legalization program is
May 4, and Meese said Monday there probably won't be an extension.
   ``We have 73 days, and that's plenty of time for anybody who is
eligible to get their application in,'' Meese said at a news
conference at a San Diego neighborhood INS office. He refused to
discuss topics other than immigration.
   The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 allows aliens who
have lived continuously in the United States since 1981 or before
to apply for residency with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   ``My hope in being here today is to dramatize both the
importance of the process, the desire of the U.S. government to
confer legalization on everybody who is eligible, and to urge
everyone in the category to apply as soon as possible,'' Meese said.
   Meese, who oversees the INS as the nation's top domestic law
enforcement official, refused to comment on Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres' recent assertion that he wrote the attorney
general in 1985 about a controversial Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   ``I'm here to talk about immigration today, and that's the only
topic that's appropriate,'' Meese said.
   Immigration officials have made ``tremendous strides'' in
handling amnesty applications from nearly 1.3 million people
nationwide, said Meese, who called the program one of the Justice
Department's key activities.
   The attorney general handed temporary residency cards to eight
aliens who now must wait 18 months before completing the
legalization process.

<HEAD>Court Limits Job Protection for Some Government Workers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 15-19, In other action, with other cases.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited the job
protection for government workers fired for lacking security
clearances.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices agreed with the Reagan
administration that the Merit Systems Protection Board lacks
authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is
justified.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said, ``It
should be obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance.''
   He said judgments about who should receive clearance ``must be
made by those with the necessary expertise in protecting classified
information'' and he said the board lacks that expertise.
   The court ruled against Thomas E. Egan, who was hired in 1981 as
a laborer at the Trident Naval Refit Facility in Bremerton, Wash.,
on the condition he subsequently receive a security clearance.
   The facility is used to test and repair Trident submarines. All
jobs at the facility require security clerance.
   When he was denied the clearance because of two past criminal
convictions, Egan was fired in 1983.
   Egan challenged the firing in an appeal to the Merit Systems
Protection Board, which was created by the Civil Service Reform Act
of 1978 to protect federal civilian employees from unfair
disciplinary treatement.
   The board concluded that it lacked the authority to review
Egan's case. But a federal appeals court here overturned the
board's decision and sent Egan's case back to the board for further
study.
   The Reagan administration argued that the appeals court ruling
threatened the government's ability to protect national security.
   Dissenting today were Justices Byron R. White, William J.
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall.
   White, writing for the three, said the government's interest in
protecting its secrets would not be jeopardized by granting Egan a
hearing before the review board.
   ``The majority's decision frustrated ... congressional intent by
denying any meaningful hearing to employees such as (Egan) who are
discharged on national security grounds,'' he said.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the high court Thursday,
did not take part in today's decision.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that a criminal suspect's rights are not violated when a
witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court testifies
about an earlier identification of the accused.
   The justices, voting 6-2, ordered the reinstatement of the
conviction of a California prison inmate in the beating of a prison
guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack.
   _ Ruled unanimously that businesses may not be sued in federal
court for refusing to contribute to multi-employer union pension
funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires.
   In an 8-0 ruling, the court rejected Reagan administration
arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases could undermine the
solvency of the multi-employer pension plans.
   The security case is Navy vs. Egan, 86-1552.

<HEAD>Marine Corps Charges Two Women with `Indecent Acts'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARRIS ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps has charged two
women officers with ``fraternization and indecent acts'' with other
female troops at the training base here, a spokesman said.
   Maj. Robert W. McLean, public affairs officer at the Marine
Corps Recruit Depot at Parris Island, said a sergeant and a captain
in the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion were charged Friday with
violations of several articles under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice.
   He said charges against other women are being considered.
   ``An Article 32 hearing, which is similar to a grand jury
hearing, has been scheduled for next week,'' McLean said. ``The
purpose of this hearing is to inquire into the allegations and
charges and recommend disposition.''
   The spokesman said the hearing could result in a recommendation
for court-martial, administrative action or a recommendation that
the charges be dropped.
   Charged were Capt. Judy A. Gretch, administrative officer for
the battalion, who has been in the Marines since 1981, and Sgt.
Mary P. Kile, a former drill instructor who has been in the Marines
since 1983, McLean said.
   Earlier this month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
the Army's ban on homosexual soldiers unconstitutional.
   But McLean said the charges are not affected by the ruling.
   ``They are not being charged with lesbianism, but with indecent
acts,'' he said.
   Capt. Joanne Schilling, a public information officer for Marine
Corps headquarters in Washington, said Monday the Corps' policy on
homosexuality is the same as that of the Department of Defense.
   The uniform code states that homosexuality is ``incompatible
with military service,'' and that certain overt acts are prohibited.
   The Marines do not knowingly enlist people who are homosexual,
and the type of action they take against Marines who are found to
be homosexual is left up to the commanding officer, said Lt. Col.
John Shotwell. It can range from an administrative discharge, under
honorable conditions, to court-martial, which can include a
military prison sentence.
   Three women who said they were being investigated told The State
newspaper of Columbia that the Marine Corps had planned to
court-martial or discharge as many as 10 women who train female
recruits. None of the women interviewed by The State were charged
Friday.
   The women, who spoke to the newspaper on the condition they not
be identified, said they and others have been accused of
homosexuality, sodomy and fraternization but have not yet been
formally charged. They said they are not homosexual.
   Parris Island is one of two boot camps in the country where
recruits are sent for an 11-week basic training program, and the
only one to which women are sent.
   Of the 200,000 Marines, roughly 10,000 are women, officials said.

   A New York City law aimed at forcing some
large private clubs to admit women and racial minorities as members
violates ``the fundamental right of our citizens ... to choose who
their friends will be,'' the Supreme Court was told today.
   Alan Mansfield, a lawyer for the New York State Clubs
Association, said the city's method _ not its objective _ was based
on ``a fundamentally incorrect analysis of the freedom to
associate.''
   The court's decision, expected by July, could carry an impact
well beyond New York's borders. At least five other major cities
have similar ordinances.
   Peter L. Zimroth, chief lawyer for New York City, argued that
Mansfield's clients have fabricated a constitutional case.
   ``It's their burden to show there are real clubs out there that
would get hurt, and they haven't,'' Zimroth said.
   Both Mansfield and Zimroth had their arguments repeatedly
interrupted with questions from the justices, including Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Thursday and only
recently resigned from a men-only club.
   Kennedy appeared particularly interested in the fact that the
city law exempts some clubs, such as the American Legion and the
Protective Order of Elks.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who also recently resigned from a
male-only club, did not ask a question during the 60-minute session.
   At one point, Justice Thurgood Marshall suggested that the city
law may be a valid attempt to battle bias, pointedly telling
Mansfield, ``You want to torpedo it.''
   The city law exempts ``distinctly private organizations'' from
its anti-bias requirements.
   But it deprives non-religious groups of that designation if they
have more than 400 members, provide regular meal service and
regularly receive payment of member dues from non-members such as
employers.
   Similar ordinances were enacted recently in Buffalo, Chicago,
Detroit, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   New York's highest court upheld the law, rejecting arguments
that it unconstitutionally creates an irrefutable presumption that
such organizations are not truly private.
   In previous rulings, the Supreme Court has ruled that states,
through their public accommodations laws, may force the U.S.
Jaycees and Rotary International to admit women as members.
   In ruling unanimously in the Rotary case last May, the justices
suggested that numerous other male-only or female-only private
organizations may have to comply with laws requiring equal access
to public accommodations.
   After assessing May's ruling, Kiwanis International voted to end
its men-only tradition and allow its 8,200 clubs worldwide to admit
women.
   The New York State Club Association is composed of about 125
private clubs and associations. Many of its groups are male-only or
are organized along national origin or other ethnic lines.
   Its challenge of the New York City law has been supported in the
Supreme Court by, among others, the Benevolent and Protective Order
of Elks, the Loyal Order of Moose, the Improved Order of Red Men
and the Club Managers Association of America.
   The city law was defended by, among others, the U.S. Conference
of Mayors, the Council of State Governments, the National
Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the
American Civil Liberties Union and the American Bar Association.
   Kennedy, the court's newest justice, was criticized during his
recent Senate confirmation hearings for his past membership in
exclusive private clubs.
   Kennedy quit San Francisco's all-male, all-white Olympic Club,
after he was mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee. He had
been a member since 1962.
   He quit the all-male Sutter Club in his hometown of Sacramento,
Calif., eight years ago.
   Blackmun recently quit the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C.,
where he had held a longtime membership. The club bars women from
becoming members.
   The case is New York State Club Association vs. New York City,
86-1836.

   A 32-year-old woman was reported missing today from
a Bahamas-bound cruise ship, and the Coast Guard sent a jet and a
cutter to search for the woman.
   The husband of Cheryl Wainscott of Woodstock, Ga., told the
captain of the Carnivale that he last saw his wife at 12:30 a.m.
today when she went for a walk, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Joe
Dye.
   The husband said his wife had been depressed, Dye said.
   The cruise ship radioed the Coast Guard at about 9 a.m. today. A
falcon jet and the 95-foot cutter Cape Current were immediately
dispatched to search an area 70 miles northeast of Miami, near
Great Isaac Light, Dye said.
   The 640-foot, Miami-based Carnivale is owned by Carnival Cruise
Lines. It routinely makes three- to four-day trips to the Bahamas.
It set sail for Nassau at 4 p.m. Monday on one of those voyages,
said company spokesman Tim Gallagher.

<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old pipe fitter was arrested in
connection with a series of 19 sexual attacks in the San Diego area
blamed on a ``bolder-than-most'' rapist, police said.
   Alvin Ray Quarles was arrested Monday at a motel staked out by
police, said Officer Brian Monahan of the suburban National City
Police Department.
   Quarles was questioned by investigators at San Diego police
headquarters for several hours and booked into the county jail,
said San Diego police spokeswoman Linda Zweig.
   The series of rapes and burglaries began 14 months ago. The
attacker was dubbed ``bolder-than-most'' because of the audacity of
his demands and because he frequently attacked women when they were
with a boyfriend or husband.
   Quarles was charged in the investigation of two rapes and six
robberies and burglaries, Zweig said. The investigation is
continuing and more charges may be filed, she said.
   Quarles was arrested about 5 a.m. Monday after a police
detective spotted him peeking in windows and checking doors of the
motel, police said, adding that a 13-inch kitchen knife was found
hidden under his shirt.
   The arrest came an hour after a man forced his way into a room
at a motel in east San Diego where two elderly women were sleeping
and robbed the women but did not assault them.
   At least 16 of the sexual assaults occurred in San Diego, half
of them at small motels.

<HEAD>Site Selection For Atom Smasher Delayed Until Late This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Selection of the site to house the planned
$4.4 billion ``super collider'' atom smasher has been delayed from
July until late in the year, Energy Secretary John Herrington told
Congress today.
   ``I would guess a preferred site would be selected in November
or December,'' Herrington told the interior subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Committee.
   He was answering a question on whether the site would be chosen
before or after the committee acts on the department's request for
$363 million in construction funds for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.
   ``I don't see us making the decision'' before the committee must
act, Herrington said.
   But he said there was little risk in appropriating the money
before site selection since ``there is nothing new in the
technology.''
   Outside the hearing room, spokesman Phil Keif said ``they need
more time,'' but the department still hoped to hold to its original
schedule of confirming the selection in January 1989.
   The eagerly sought scientific installation would probe the
secrets of matter by whirling beams of protons into each other at
an energy 20 times what is available with current machines.
   The most powerful current machine is the accelerator at Batavia,
Ill. not far from the Chicago district of subcommittee chairman
Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill.
   Yates asked Herrington to comment on a newspaper report of a
study from a local group claiming that locating the new machine
next to the Batavia installation would save the government $3.3
billion over the years through savings on components, buildings,
computer programs and other facilities. But Herrington said he was
unfamiliar with the study.
   Illinois, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Tennessee and
North Carolina remain in the competition to house the collider.

   Federal agents have given city police officials the
names of 18 Miami officers, including that of a former assistant
police chief, in the latest move in an ongoing investigation of
corruption in the department.
   Since 1985, about 75 Miami officers have been arrested,
suspended or fired for a variety of misdeeds, from homicide to
cocaine possession to prostitution and drunken driving.
   Police Chief Clarence Dickson has predicted that as many as 100
officers, nearly 10 percent of the force, could be involved in some
level of corruption.
   Alfredo Bared, whose name was on the list FBI agents gave to
Miami police internal security detectives Monday, is the
highest-ranking person whose conduct is under scrutiny.
   ``In 26 years in the Miami Police Department, I never did
anything illegal,'' he said Monday night. ``I can tell you that _
100 percent. Al Bared did not do anything wrong, be it civilly,
criminally, ethically or whatever.''
   None of the 18 has been relieved of duty, police said Monday.
Bared, 49, resigned in 1986.
   Although police and the FBI have refused to discuss specific
allegations, The Miami Herald reported that unidentified sources
said they all involve drugs.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with details of Robertson loan, subbing 2 grafs for

<TEXT>
   Former TV evangelist Pat Robertson is
borrowing heavily going into the critical Super Tuesday primaries,
taking out a massive $5.5 million loan for his presidential
campaign, financial reports show.
   Robertson ended January with $5.5 million in the bank, but his
campaign had $6 million in debts as he far outspent any other
candidate on the Super Tuesday contests involving 20 states on
March 8.
   Rival GOP contenders George Bush and Bob Dole, on the other
hand, remained in good shape.
   Bush, the overall fund-raising leader, ended January with $9.2
million in cash on hand and $811,029 in obligations, while Dole had
$4.2 million and $654,269 in bills to pay, their latest financial
statements show.
   Neither had any loans outstanding, but the other GOP contender,
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, took out $750,000 in loans to get
through the Iowa and New Hampshire contests this month.
   Among Democratic candidates, money leader Michael Dukakis had
the most cash available, $4 million.
   Besides his loan, Robertson reported contributions of $1.3
million during January. His report also listed as receipts the $6.5
million in federal matching funds that he applied for but had said
he might not use.
   Robertson had said he was philosophically opposed to the public
financing system and his staff said he would only use matching
funds if he needed to stay competitive.
   Robertson's campaign did not return calls Monday night to answer
questions about the loan, by far the biggest borrowing of any
campaign for the 1988 election.
   Robertson paid off a short-term loan of $1.5 million that his
attorney has said was secured with his matching funds, hisreport
showed.
   The latest financial reports were due at the Federal Election
Commission on Saturday, but Robertson's was not filed until late
Monday.
   It showed that the new loan was taken out in January from Sovran
Bank in Chesapeake, Va., at an interest rate of prime plus 1
percent and was due to be repaid on Feb. 28.
   The sizable expenditures on this month's Iowa and New Hampshire
contests and subsequent spending toward Super Tuesday are not
reflected in the new reports, which cover the period through Jan.
31.
   Robertson has spent more than any other candidate against the
overall spending ceiling which is set by election law at $27
million for the primary season. He reported spending $17.6 million
against the cap.
   Bush, conversely, while raising more money than any other
candidate, has been watching his budget and has spent the least of
any Republican contender against the cap.
   He reported spending $10.7 million against the ceiling, compared
with Kemp's $12.8 million and Dole's $13.5 million.
   Robertson also spent the most of any campaign in a single state
_ $1 million in Texas, compared with Bush's $335,743 and Dole's
$81,645.
   Wealthy campaigns must keep from spending too much early in the
campaign, because they could leave themselves unable to spend money
on later contests without going over the limit.
   On the Democratic side, none of the candidates approached the
cap, with Dukakis spending the most at $7.8 million.
   The Massachusetts governor also had the biggest Democratic bank
account at the beginning of this month, $4 million with $511,789 in
bills to pay, while the next nearest Democrat, Sen. Al Gore Jr. of
Tennessee, had $2 million with $84,248 in obligations.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., borrowed $523,674 in January and ended
the month with a $691,069 debt and only $401,176 in the bank. He
raised $534,259 in contributions for the month, $1.9 million in
matching funds, and $523,674 in loans.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., entered February with $820,260 in
debts and $172,477 in cash on hand. He collected $212,702 in
contributions and $1.9 million in matching funds during January.
   Aides for both Gephardt and Simon have said that fund-raising
picked up this month and that they have whittled down their debts.
   Gore had ignored Iowa to concentrate on the Super Tuesday
states, but he raised very little money during the time the other
candidates were campaigning hard in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   He collected only $180,746 in contributions during January, in
addition to the $1.8 million in matching funds he got, his report
showed.
   Dukakis raised $804,839 in contributions and got $3.5 million
matching funds.
   Democratic contender Jesse Jackson reported raising $610,036 in
donations, plus $598,021 in matching funds during January, ending
the month with $509,978 in cash on hand and $354,881 in obligations.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart ended the month with $615,547 in
cash on hand and $24,484 in debts after collecting $70,303 in
contributions and $937,325 in matching funds.
   Kemp continued a hand-to-mouth campaign, ending January with a
debt of $1.3 million after raising $1 million for the month.
However, his political director, Charlie Black, said the debt would
be wiped out when Kemp's federal mathching funds come in this month.
   He insisted the campaign is not in financial trouble, saying a
heavy mail solicitation program and fund-raising events are reaping
about $400,000 a week.
   Dole raised $1.2 million in contributions for January and got
$5.6 in matching funds, while Bush collected $767,892 privately and
got $6.4 million in matching funds.
   Most candidates got very large matching fund payments in January
because that was the first months the money was released, and the
sums were based on the candidates' fund raising for all preceding
months.
   Candidates can get matching funds from the federal Treasury for
each contribution of $250 or less that they raise in private funds.
The matching fund is supported by the $1 checkoff on individual
income tax returns.

<HEAD>Court Rules Mississippi Owns Thousands of Acres of Land Near Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, rejecting claims by private
landowners, ruled today that the state of Mississippi owns
thousands of acres of oil- and gas-rich land near the state's Gulf
Coast.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices said states may claim title to land
beneath waters subject to the tie's influence _ and not only land
under navigable waters.
   The ebb and flow of the tide, not navigability, determines the
state's ownership, said Justice Byron R. White for the court.
   ``States have interests in lands beneath tidal waters which have
nothing to do with navigation,'' White said. Those interests range
from protecting fishing to setting aside submerged land for
reclamation for urban expansion, he said.
   ``It would be odd to acknowledge such diverse uses of public
trust tidelands and then suggest that the sole measure of the
expanse of such lands is the navigability of the waters over
them,'' White said.
   The court rejected an appeal by private landowners and companies
that included Phillips Petroleum and a partnership called Cinque
Bambini.
   They challenged the state's claim to some 2,400 acres of
undeveloped property in Hancock County, Miss.
   The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that the state has
control over the land based on a grant from the federal government
when Mississippi became a state in 1817.
   The private landowners and companies based their claims on
Spanish land grants of 1813.
   The state leased 600 acres of the land to Saga Petroleum U.S.
Inc. in 1977 for oil and gas exploration.
   The Mississippi court said the state's title extends to all land
subject to tidal influence, inland to the mean high water mark.
   The lands in question underly non-navigable bayous and streams
several miles north of the Gulf Coast. They are influenced by the
tide since they are affected by the ebb and flow of an adjacent
navigable river that flows into the gulf.
   Dissenting today were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul
Stevens and Antonin Scalia.
   O'Connor, writing for the three, said today's ruling will break
``a chain of title that reaches back more than 150 years'' and
``will disrupt the settled expectations of landowners not only in
Mississippi but every coastal state.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court on Thursday,
did not take part in the decision.
   The case is Phillips Petroleum vs. Mississippi, 86-870.

<HEAD>Exner Told Story About Alleged JFK Mob Link for $50,000</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd-8th grafs, `Parts of ...,' with 7 grafs to add quote
from New York Post interview with Ms. Giancana.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People magazine paid Judith Campbell Exner
$50,000 for interviews in which she claimed to have served as a
courier and contact for President Kennedy and a Chicago mobster,
the author of the article says.
   Kitty Kelley said Monday that she and Exner, who claims to have
arranged at least 10 meetings between Kennedy and Mafia boss Sam
Giancana in the early 1960s, split a fee of ``about $100,000.''
   Parts of Exner's story were questioned today by Giancana's
daughter Antoinette, the author of ``Mafia Princess.''
   Ms. Giancana said on ``CBS This Morning'' that she never met
Exner but knew that she was her father's girlfriend. And she said
that her father wanted to help in the alleged assassination plot
against Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   But she said that as far as she knew, her father never spoke to
Kennedy during his time in the White House.
   ``He always told us about people he'd been with and met,'' she
told the New York Post in an interview. ``But not once did he say
anything about meeeting Kennedy. I'm sure Dad would have said
something.''
   Moreover, ``my father had an utter contempt for the Kennedys.
Why would he ever want to meet with JFK in the White House or
anywhere else?'' she said on the CBS program.
   Ms. Giancana said her father did not need Kennedy's help, but
that Kennedy needed Giancana's help in Chicago while he was running
for president.
   She told CBS it was possible that Kennedy asked Exner to go to
Giancana and ask for help, ``but how, probably, I really don't
know.''
   Questioning Exner's account that Giancana gave her a note to
deliver to Kennedy, Ms. Giancana said her father did not put things
in writing. ``The man had at least a little class. He never put
anything in writing where they could bring it up or show it from
the day he had written it.''
   Kelley said she first arranged to talk to Exner about Kennedy
and Giancana in 1983, but plans fell through after Exner demanded
at the last minute to be paid.
   ``I told her, `I don't pay for interviews. Don't you just want
to be honest and tell the truth?''' Kelley recalled. ``But I didn't
get the story because I wouldn't pay. This time, People did it.''
   Kelley said payment was justified now because Exner has terminal
cancer and ``the story is a little piece of history.''
   Elizabeth Wagner, publicity manager at People, said the magazine
had no comment on the fee.
   Columnist Liz Smith reported in her column in today's New York
Daily News that she put Kelley and Exner together. Smith said she
did not pursue Exner's story herself because ``for Exner's sake, I
couldn't afford to.
   ``She is suffering from terminal cancer, she needs the money to
live out her days and pay medical bills, and only a magazine like
People can pay the big bucks needed to offer up such a story.''
   In a 1975 appearance before the Senate intelligence committee,
Exner said she had an 18-month affair with Kennedy before and after
he entered the White House, and that she later had an affair with
Giancana. But she said she knew of no ties between the two, and
that Kennedy never knew of her friendship with Giancana, which
predated her affair with Kennedy.
   In an interview Monday on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Exner
said she changed her story because ``things have changed
dramatically for me. I've had two bouts with cancer and I've just
had my lung removed and I've been given a fairly short length of
time (to live.) And I was being very uncomfortable with not being
able to tell the truth.''
   In 1975, ``I was afraid for my life so I was afraid to tell the
truth,'' she said. ``My husband and I made a very coscious decision
not to tell the story.''
   Exner said she witnessed one of the Giancana-Kennedy meetings,
and that she carried envelopes on many occasions between Kennedy
and Giancana and Johnny Roselli, Giancana's lieutenant in Las
Vegas, Nev., and Southern California. She said Giancana once told
her he had met Kennedy in the White House.
   Kelley said Kennedy apparently wanted mob assistance to win the
presidency in 1960, and later to eliminate Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
   Giancana was murdered in 1975, Roselli a year later.
   Kelley said Exner produced airplane tickets, hotel bills and
appointment books from 1960 through 1962 to support her story.
White House telephone logs show she had more than 70 conversations
with Kennedy.
   Jeff Smith, spokesman for Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said,
``There has been no comment and there probably will not be a
comment'' from the Kennedy family.
   G. Robert Blakey, a professor of law at the University of Notre
Dame and an expert on organized crime, said he found Exner's story
``incredible.''
   ``The president of the United States dealing directly with a
mobster and no one knowing around him knowing about it?'' he asked.
   Blakey, a former Justice Department lawyer who worked for the
House committee that investigated Kennedy's assassination, said
congressional investigators in the 1970s verified Exner's reports
of her affair with Kennedy.
   But, he said, ``my judgment was that she gave all the
information she had at that time.''

   President Reagan stands behind Attorney
General Edwin Meese III in the face of disclosure of a memo to
Meese about payments to Israeli officials ``which would be denied
everywhere,'' the White House said today.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was questioned by
reporters about the memo, which was disclosed on Monday. Lawyers
for Meese said the memo gave no reason to conclude that the
attorney general knew of any plans to bribe Israeli officials.
   ``Ed Meese has been a friend and adviser (of the president) for
years and years going back to California,'' Fitzwater said. ````He
knows him to be a man of integrity and he stands behind him.''
   The memo from longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach described
a plan to funnel a portion of some $650 million-$700 million from
an Iraqi pipeline project to the Israeli Labor Party of then-Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
   The Wallach-Meese memo is the focal point of a criminal
investigation of the attorney general. At issue is whether Meese
knew of a possibly improper payment plan involving the Israeli
political party and, if so, why he did nothing about it.
   Fitzwater turned aside most questions about the case, saying it
was inappropriate to comment while it was under investigation by
the independent counsel.
   Asked whether Reagan wanted Meese to remain as attorney general,
Fitzwater said, ``Absolutely. He's a good man who does good work.''
   ``The president has full confidence in the attorney general and
we don't have any comment on the documents or the case,'' the
spokesman said.
   Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport was a partner in the proposed
pipeline and Wallach was his lawyer. Backers of the project were
seeking assurances that Israel would not bomb the $1 billion
pipeline, which was to run through Iraq and Jordan.
   Wallach's Sept. 25, 1985, memo to Meese said that Rappaport had
confirmed with Peres that ``Israel will receive somewhere between
$65-$70 million a year for ten years out of the conclusion of this
project.''
   ``What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied
everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to
Labor,'' said the two-page memo which Wallach marked ``personal &
confidential _ for your eyes, only.''
   Meese's lawyers released the memo Monday, along with a
handwritten note from Peres to Meese in which the Israeli leader
said of the pipeline project: ``I would go a long way to help it
out. But then discretion is demanded on our part.''
   Peres said today that Israel never opposed laying an Iraqi
pipeline through Jordan, ``So why would anyone need to use bribes?''
   The foreign minister told reporters as he toured a West Bank
city that ``no new documents were published that cause me concern
and I have nothing to say.''
   But he added, ``We all agree that we favor the laying of the
pipeline. So why would anyone need to use bribes? Nobody said he
(Meese) gave the Labor Party anything or proposed anything to the
Labor Party.''
   Peres, who had initially denied that he had written a letter to
the U.S. attorney general, said Sunday that he used the highly
unusual diplomatic channel of going through Meese ``because I was
approached by people who told me that the attorney general will
deal with it.''
   In his letter to Meese, Peres said ``I have asked my friend
Bruce (Rappaport) and Bob (Wallach) to let you know the whole story
and I shall depend on your judgment about the best way to handle
this matter.''
   Peres denies he was offered a bribe or anything of value in
connection with the pipeline project.
   Independent counsel James McKay, who has been investigating the
attorney general since last May 11, is trying to determine whether
Meese violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law
prohibits U.S. citizens from bribing foreign officials and gives
the attorney general responsibility for enforcing the ban.
   In releasing the memo, one of Meese's lawyers, Nathan Lewin,
said in a lengthy statement that ``no one can fairly infer that Mr.
Meese or anyone else reading the document should have understood
that there was a `bribe' or `payoff' scheme to obtain the Israeli
Labor Party's support for the pipeline project.''
   ``The words `which would be denied everywhere' did not imply
illegality of any kind,'' Lewin added.
   ``The fact that Rappaport intended to provide large amounts of
financial support to the Labor Party, or that through some other
governmental arrangement the Labor Party would be receiving
indirectly some of the project's proceeds, could cause political
embarrassment in Israel and was obviously not a matter to be
publicized,'' the statement said.
   ``Mr. Wallach frequently used colorful phrases suggesting
intrigue and secrecy in his memoranda, even on subjects that were
patently innocuous.''
   Lewin said ``the most reasonable inference'' is that ``Bruce
Rappaport, who had been a substantial financial supporter of the
Labor Party, would be sharing the large amounts of money he would
receive as a result of the `oil lifter rights' he held with the
government of Israel and with the Labor Party.''
   The oil lifter rights placed Rappaport in control of the actual
production and sale of the oil. In return, Rappaport was to make
available to Israel substantial amounts of the oil generated from
the pipeline.
   Iraq eventually backed out of the pipeline project and it was
not built.
   Meese has said he doesn't recall reading the reference in the
Wallach memo to payments to Peres' political party. Meese declined
to comment on the newly released documents at a news conference
Monday in San Diego, Calif., where he was attending a meeting of
U.S. attorneys.
   Meese's lawyers said they decided to release the material
because ``speculation in the media ... has so greatly exceeded
reasonable bounds that the usual policy of confidentiality gives
the public a misleading impression.''
   The documents reveal that Wallach was urging Meese to take an
active role in the project.
   In a second Wallach-Meese memo released Monday, Wallach hinted
that Meese might speak to Secretary of State George Shultz about
the project and that the involvement of then-National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane was needed.
   ``I know it goes without saying that a discussion of this
subject with the President would be most desired, and I would think
most effective,'' said Wallach.
   Meese's lawyers said the attorney general ``took none of the
initiatives suggested by Mr. Wallach.'' In a note to Peres dated
Oct. 7, 1985, Meese referred Peres to McFarlane, saying Shultz had
removed himself from the matter because he had worked for Bechtel
Group Inc., which was planning to build the project.

<HEAD>Court Limits Interior Authority to Allocate Water in Missouri
River Reservoirs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a victory for three
midwestern states, today limited the secretary of the interior's
authority to allocate water stored in Missouri River Basin
reservoirs.
   The justices ruled unanimously that the interior secretary
exceeded his authority when in 1982 he approved a contract
authorizing Energy Transportation Systems Inc. (ETSI) to take water
from Lake Oahe in South Dakota for a coal slurry pipeline project.
   The court, in an opinion written by Justice Byron R. White, said
the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was correct when in 1986 it
ruled that the secretary lacks the power to allocate for industrial
use water stored in the river basin reservoirs.
   The reservoirs are not reclamation projects as defined by a 1944
federal flood control law giving the Interior Department power to
regulate reclamation and irrigation projects, White said.
   Agreeing with the 8th Circuit court, White said the Army Corps
of Engineers was given primary authority over flood control and
navigation under the 1944 act. Federal officials had to get
permission from the Corps of Engineers before removing water from
Lake Oahe in 1982, White said.
   The decision is a victory for officials in Missouri, Iowa and
Nebraska, three states in the lower Missouri River Basin. Those
states had blocked the now-scraped pipeline project.
   As envisioned by the Interior Department, ETSI would have moved
Lake Oahe water to Wyoming, where it would have been mixed with
locally mined coal. The slurry then would have been piped for use
in coal-fired steam generating power plants in the Southeast.
   Three states in the Upper Missouri River Basin _ North and South
Dakota and Wyoming _ opposed the 8th Circuit court's ruling and had
supported the Reagan administration and ETSI. The upper basin
states said the appeals court ruling deprived them of using water
within their boundaries.
   When the case was aired before the justices last November, one
lawyer portrayed it as a dispute ``between upper and lower basin
states.''
   The case is ETSI Pipeline Project vs. Missouri, 86-939 and
86-941.

<HEAD>Spring Car-Selling Push Starting: How to Cope</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts new penultimate graf to explain that sticker named

   Spring is right around the corner and that can
only mean one thing: car dealers putting on an extra push for sales.
   Well, OK, there are other signs of spring, among them the
arrival of the first seed catalog, followed by robins and other
birds to munch the seeds. But sales by auto dealerships are right
up there.
   The average new car costs more than $12,000 and is generally the
second most costly purchase made by Americans. And when that much
money is involved, some time and effort is called for to get the
most for the money.
   As with most things, be prepared. Car salesmen have a lot more
practice at selling than most people do at buying, and allowing
them to push you into a hasty decision can be a costly error.
   Think in advance about what kind of car you want and how much
you can afford to pay, and make a trip to a library to check books
and magazines on new car features and prices.
   Shopping around is important to get prices from various dealers,
and make notes of the base cost they cite and the extra costs for
options plus any dealer charges and other costs.
   If the car you want isn't available consider ordering one. It
may take longer, but you can avoid paying for a lot of options you
don't want.
   And insist on negotiating on the price. Check with Consumers
Union, publisher of Consumer Reports Magazine, for car prices. For
a charge, CU will provide a printout on any type of auto, citing
the dealer's actual cost for the car and options. Knowing this
information can give you a real negotiating edge.
   The Federal Trade Commission has put together a new car buying
guide for shoppers, which includes a handy worksheet for shoppers
to compare prices and options they want. Copies of the ``New Car
Buying Guide'' are available at no charge from the Public Reference
Branch, Federal Trade Commission, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Ave.,
Washington, D.C., 20580.
   A variety of auto-related booklets are also available from the
Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colo., 81009. These include
``Buying a Used Car,' item 440T, 50 cents; ``A Consumer's Guide to
Vehicle Leasing,'' item 441T, 50 cents, and ``Cost of Owning and
Operating Autos and Vans,'' item 442T, 50 cents.
   The FTC's new car guide includes a helpful list of price terms
that you should know when negotiating. These include:
   Invoice Price: The manufacturer's initial charge to the dealer.
This is usually higher than the dealer's final cost because dealers
often receive rebates, allowances, discounts and incentive awards.
The invoice price always includes freight (also known as
destination and delivery). If you are buying a car based on the
invoice price, be sure freight is not added to the sales contract.
   Base Price: The cost of the car without options, but including
the standard equipment, factory warranty and freight.
   Monroney Sticker Price: This is the price on the label attached
to the car window and is required by law. It shows the base price,
the manufacturers installed options with the manufacturer suggested
retail price, the manufacturer's transportation charge and the fuel
economy. This label may not be removed by anyone other than the
buyer.
   The Monroney Sticker Price was named for the late Sen. Mike
Monroney, D-Okla., who sponsored the legislation requiring it.
   Dealer Sticker Price: Usually on a supplemental sticker, this is
the Monroney Sticker Price plus the suggested retail price of
dealer-installed options, additional dealer markup, additional
dealer profit, dealer preparation and undercoating.

<HEAD>39 Percent of IRS Answers In Error: GAO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional auditors said today a very
preliminary survey indicates taxpayers are getting correct
responses only 61 percent of the time when they telephone tax
questions to the Internal Revenue Service.
   However, the General Accounting Office, which conducted the
survey, acknowledged that it is so incomplete that the results may
not be valid.
   IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs told a House Ways and Means
subcommittee that a much more thorough check, by the IRS itself,
has found telephone ``assistors'' are giving the correct answer
74.8 percent of the time.
   ``We are obviously not satisfied with answering three out of
four questions correctly at this time,'' Gibbs said. ``We are not,
however, totally surprised by our figures . ... The large number of
tax law changes this year was bound to challenge our assistors
despite our training and planning efforts.''
   The commissioner noted that it is not just IRS employees who are
having trouble finding all the correct answers. He cited a survey
of 50 tax professionals who came up with 50 different answers when
asked by Money magazine to calculate the taxes owed by a
hypothetical family.
   Gibbs noted that the 74.8-percent accuracy rate by IRS telephone
answerers this year compares with a 79-percent mark in a GAO survey
last year, before most provisions of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul
had taken effect.
   Jennie S. Stathis, associate director of the GAO, an
investigative arm of Congress, told the subcommittee that ``under
the circumstances, we believe IRS did a good job in trying to
prepare its employees and the taxpaying public for the 1988 filing
season.''
   She said auditors found that 84 percent of taxpayers who visited
IRS walk-in facilities for help with their tax returns were
satisfied with the assistance and that 74 percent received help
within 15 minutes.
   However, Ms. Stathis said, the GAO found ``the need for IRS to
improve the accuracy of telephone assistor responses to assure that
returns are completed accurately and processed timely.
   She ackowledged that the GAO, in checking the accuracy of IRS
telephone assistors, had made only 224 calls over six days, and
said the results were so preliminary that they could not be
projected as an accurate sampling. Those calls produced correct
responses 61 percent of the time, although 4 percent were not
complete.
   The GAO survey is continuing, as is the IRS' own effort to check
how its employees are doing. In contrast, the IRS finding of 74.8
percent accuracy is based on more than 5,000 calls.

   A drifter shot two plainclothes
policemen with one of their guns in a struggle on a downtown
street, then took refuge in an office building where he held six
hostages before surrendering, police said.
   Police Officer Ed Gorrell, 33, was shot in the head and was in
serious condition today after surgery at Brooke Army Medical
Center, hospital spokesman staff Sgt. King Lance said.
   Officer Onofre Serna, 26, suffered a graze to the chest area and
was in stable condition at Medical Center Hospital, hospital
spokeswoman Ruby Salazar said.
   The suspect, identified as David Johnson, 28, was charged with
two counts of attempted capital murder and was in Bexar County Jail
in lieu of $1 million bond, said police spokesman Sgt. Paul Buske.
   After the scuffle Monday night with the policemen, the gunman
ran into a nearby office building and took the hostages, Buske said.
   ``The officers stopped the individual ... and a struggle ensued.
One of the officers lost his weapon. (The suspect) picked up the
weapon and several shots were fired,'' Buske said.
   Police Chief William Gibson said the man made no demands when he
took the hostages. Gibson said he didn't know immediately why the
officers stopped him.
   The gunman fled into the Travis Park Plaza building, took two
people hostage on one floor, released them, and then took three
other people hostage on the third floor. The three escaped when the
gunman walked into another area to take a sixth hostage, Buske said.
   The gunman surrendered to police shortly before 10 p.m., about
an hour after he released the last hostage, following talks with
police negotiators, said Buske.
   ``He seemed disoriented at first, despondent, that he had gotten
framed,'' hostage Jerry Renaud said today. ``He said he wasn't
there to hurt us. He said he just needed a place to hide out for
the night.''
   The man was described as a street person by City Manager Lou Fox.
   ``My understanding is he (the gunman) had some mental problems
and it's your typical downtown problem that we've been faced
with,'' Fox said.
   Gorrell and Serna were part of a downtown foot patrol aimed at
deterring street crime; Buske described the patrol as effective in
combating downtown muggings.
   Last month, a mentally ill homeless man shot and killed a Dallas
police officer in a downtown parking lot. The killing touched off a
wave of public support for police when Dallas Police Chief Billy
Prince blamed some City Council members for creating an atmosphere
that led to the shooting by criticizing police.

   A group of legislators has nominated the overseas
radio service of the British Broadcasting Corp. for this year's
Nobel Peace Prize.
   BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey announced the nomination of the
corporation's External Services on Tuesday. The BBC said there are
at least 100 other nominations from around the world for this
year's prize.
   The Nobel peace prize normally is awarded to individuals, but
the London-based human rights group Amnesty International received
it in 1977.
   The BBC's overseas radio services are headed by the flagship
English-language BBC World Service and broadcast in 37 languages to
an estimated world audience of 120 million.
   The 22 House of Commons legislators, who come from different
parties, said in their letter to the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize
committee the nomination was in recognition of the BBC's 55 years
of international broadcasting.

   Police arrested 75 people suspected of

Tuesday.
   Police Chief Umberto Lucchese said the sweep was made at dawn
Sunday. He said warrants had also been issued to 27 people already
in jail, while police were unable to track down seven others to
serve the warrants.
   Police said those arrested were suspected of involvement in
small or medium-size drug operations.
   They said Sunday's operation had no connection with the seizure
last week of 187 pounds of nearly pure heroin found in two garages
in a village just outside Verona. Police arrested three men in that
case.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Resolution Supporting March 20 Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee today
approved a resolution of support for El Salvador's upcoming
elections, but only after lawmakers expressed reservations about
the country's human rights record.
   On a voice vote, the panel approved a resolution noting El
Salvador's efforts since 1979 to establish a constitutional system
that institutionalizes an electoral process, and recognizing the
large turnout in 1984 for the election of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, despite threats of violence.
   The resolution, sent to the full House for a vote, ``expresses
confidence that the people of El Salvador will reject efforts to
disrupt the election'' scheduled for March 20 to select national
legislators and local officials.
   Past elections have been plagued by threats of disruption and
warnings to voters not to participate made by the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, which is waging a guerrilla war
against the Duarte government.
   The bill was watered down slightly after Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.,
objected to phrasing flatly stating that El Salvador has achieved a
system ``which respects human liberties.'' The bill was changed to
say only that the country has ``sought to'' establish such a system.
   ``Give them a little credit for trying, Ted,'' said committee
Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.
   Weiss referred to reports that rightist death squads have
resumed their activities in recent months, and noted that the
country's judicial system has failed to live up to U.S. hopes.

   A West German living in Denmark
applied for political asylum after Bonn requested his extradition
for neo-Nazi activity, a Justice Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
   Thies Christophersen, 70, applied for asylum on the grounds of
``political persecution'' in West Germany, said spokesman Clas
Nilas. ``We are presently considering the case according to normal
procedures.''
   West German authorities submitted an extradition request two
weeks ago for Christophersen, who has lived in Denmark for two
years.
   Christophersen has published works saying there were no gas
chambers in the Nazi concentration camps, no mass murders and no
medical experiments on humans.
   Such material is outlawed in West Germany, but not in Denmark.
The Justice Ministry, however, has expressed willingness to meet
the extradition request.
   Christophersen owns a publishing company in the town of Kollund
just north of the West German border that produces Nazi literature.
His residence and work permit was extended for five years in
September.

   A federal judge ruled today that a confession
by a suspected Lebanese Shiite terrorist that he had led the 1985
hijacking of a Jordanian airliner was illegally obtained by the FBI.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker, who sharply criticized
the FBI's interrogation, suppressed the oral and written
confessions that Fawaz Younis made to federal agents following his
Sept. 13, 1987, arrest in the Mediterranean after he was lured
aboard an FBI-chartered yacht off Cyprus.
   Younis, a former member of the Shiite Amal militia, is scheduled
to stand trial March 22 on charges he had led the June 11, 1985,
hijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner from Beirut International
Airport.
   The plane was flown to several points in the Mediterranean and
destroyed by explosives the next day after passengers and crew were
taken off the jetliner.
   Parker ruled that fractures Younis suffered on both wrists when
he was slammed to the deck of the yacht by FBI agents, plus
seasickness, made it impossible for him to waive rationally his
rights against self-incrimination.
   The judge also noted that the FBI deliberately kept Younis
aboard a Navy ammunition ship for four days during which he
underwent ``relentless interrogation.''
   ``The defendant's will was overborne by the interrogation and
his capacity for self-determination was critically impaired,'' the
judge said.
   The judge sharply criticized the FBI for taking four days to
transport Younis from the yacht where he was seized to an aircraft
carrier from which he was flown to Washington for arraignment
before a federal magistrate.
   ``The slow voyage across the Mediterranean appeared to serve
only the government's purposes _ ample time to educe a confession.
This was a clear abuse of the obligation to bring the defendant
before a judiciali officer immediately following his arrest,''
Parker said.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said the agency had
no immediate comment on Parker's decision.
   Federal prosecutors have other evidence against Younis,
including a videotape of him reading a statement to reporters
before the plane was blown up at the Beirut airport.
   Two Americans who were aboard the plane when it was stormed by
five gunmen carrying AK-47 assault rifles have identified Younis as
leader of the hijackers.
   In addition, the prosecutors will be able to use the testimony
of Jamal Hamdan, a friend of Younis who lured him to the
FBI-chartered yacht off Cyprus on the pretext of completing a drug
deal.
   Parker found that Younis ``was in an extremely weakened physical
condition at the very time when he was explained his rights. In an
uncertain physical condition, in an oppressive environment, and
subject to relentless interrogation, Younis lacked the will
necessary to voluntarily waive his rights.''
   The judge noted that ``the government had deliberately scheduled
four days for the voyage across the Mediterranean; four days which
Younis would be subjected to constant questioning by agents.''
   While ruling the confession was illegally obtained, Parker
dismissed a defense motion that Younis's arrest was illegal.

   Here, at a glance, are the methods for picking
delegates from South Dakota to attend the 1988 Democratic and
Republican national conventions this summer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEMOCRATS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Method: Caucus
   Date: Saturday, March 12
   Presidential filing deadline: Tuesday, December 29, 1987
   Non-binding presidential primary: Tuesday, February 23
   Candidates filed: Bruce Babbitt, Michael Dukakis, Richard
Gephardt, Albert Gore, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, Paul Simon
   Pledged delegates: 15
   Super delegates: 4
   Total delegates: 19
   Delegates allocated: Saturday, March 12
   Selection of delegates: Saturday, March 12 and Saturday, April 23
   South Dakota Democrats choose pledged national convention
delegates through a one-tiered caucus system put in place after the
national party determined the state's presidential primary was
being held in violation of the rules.
   The primary on Feb. 23 will be a non-binding ``beauty contest,''
although state party officials said they would feel bound by honor
_ if not by rules _ to honor the wishes of the voters in awarding
national convention delegates to presidential candidates.
   South Dakota, which has just one congressional district, will
choose 10 congressional-district delegates at a statewide caucus to
be held in Mitchell on March 12. The party has been compelled to
provide bus transportation to any Democrat needing a ride to the
caucus.
   The state's remaining five pledged national convention delegates
will be picked by the state committee on April 23 and will be
allocated among presidential candidates in proportion to the
results of March 12 caucus.

   Delegates: 18
   Delegates allocated: Tuesday, February 23
   Selection of delegates: Tuesday, February 23
   All of South Dakota's 18 delegates to the Republican National
Convention will be elected directly from the primary ballot. Since
the state has one congressional district, all delegates will be
elected at-large.
   Delegates will be awarded to presidential candidates in
proportion to the results of the primary. A candidate must receive
at least 20 percent of the vote to qualify for any delegates.

   A white supremacist group considered
dumping enough cyanide to kill 440,000 people into the water
supplies of New York or Washington, D.C., to create civil unrest,
the group's former leader testified.
   James B. Ellison, a key prosecution witnesses in the trial of 10
men accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the government,
said one of the defendants, Robert Miles, gave him a 30-gallon
barrel of cyanide and declared:
   ``The ones who would be killed would not really matter. It would
be a good cleansing.''
   Ellison also testified that in 1983, members of a white
supremacist group he led had participated in a murder, robberies
and attempts to blow up utility facilities.
   Ellison is serving 20 years for racketeering and weapons
violations committed when he led the Arkansas-based
religious-military group, called the Covenant, the Sword and the
Arm of the Lord. He was arrested in 1985 after a four-day standoff.
   Ellison, 47, said Monday he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors
after the government agreed to relocate and give new identities to
the two women he considers to be his wives and to his nine children.
   Miles and nine others are charged with conspiracy to overthrow
the government by force. The government alleges that they and four
others on trial, including Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler,
espouse white supremacist goals or belong to white supremacist
groups.
   Those four, and one of the accused conspirators, are charged
with plotting to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent. Two are
also accused of interstate transportation of stolen money. All the
defendants face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison and $20,000
fines on each charge if convicted.
   Returning to the witness stand today, Ellison said that Richard
Wayne Snell, a member of his group, murdered William Stumpp on Nov.
11, 1983, in the robbery of a pawn shop that Stumpp operated in
Texarkana, Ark.
   ``This is what they were doing at that time,'' Ellison said,
referring to occasional forays involving robberies and attempts to
disrupt utilities.
   Ellison said he asked Snell later why Snell had killed Stumpp.
   ``He said that he was an evil man, he was a Jew, and that he
just needed to die,'' Ellison testified.
   Snell, one of the defendants in the case, is on death row in
Arkansas for the murder of Stumpp, and is serving a sentence of
life without parole for the 1984 slaying of state Trooper Louis
Bryant.
   Ellison said the robberies were undertaken because of an
agreement made in 1983 at Hayden Lake, Idaho, by himself and
leaders of other white-supremacist groups to take action designed
to bring down the government so that an all-white state could be
established in the nation's Northwest.
   In his testimony Monday, Ellison described how defendants
William Wade and his son Ray Wade solicited the group's help to
find and kill U.S. District Judge H. Franklin Waters and FBI
Special Agent Jack Knox, both of Fayetteville.
   He said the Wades wanted to avenge the slaying of a fugitive tax
protester, Gordon Kahl, who was killed along with an Arkansas
sheriff in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities at a house on
land owned by William Wade.
   Knox helped prosecute people who harbored Kahl, and Waters
presided over the trial.
   Ellison said Ray Wade urged that local officials involved in
Kahl's death ``be hanged publicly from the lamp post there in
Smithville.''
   The idea, Ellison said, was to make an example of them so that
other officials would not take similar actions.
   Ellison testified that Miles, 63, of Cohoctah, Mich., gave him
the barrel of cyanide after Ellison participated in a survivalist
conference in Dearborn, Mich., in 1981. Ellison said he also
received some chemicals to make explosives and rocket propellant.
   He said he was wary of transporting it, but Miles told him,
``You might need it sometime. It will kill a lot of people.'' The
government says the cyanide was enough to kill 440,000 people.
   Ellison testified that he, Miles and defendants Louis Ray Beam
Jr., 41, of Houston and Butler, 69, of Hayden Lake, Idaho,
discussed in 1983 using the cyanide to poison the water supplies of
New York or Washington, D.C., in an attempt to create public unrest
and show the government was powerless.

   Eli Wallach has deemed Barbra Streisand nuts.
   Not exactly. But as Dr. Herbert A. Morrison in the movie,
``Nuts,'' Wallach portrays a psychiatrist who is truly convinced
that Claudia Draper, a former call girl accused of murder, is
insane and therefore must be locked away. Streisand, as Draper,
believes otherwise.
   ``As a heavy I am not well liked in the movie,'' Wallach said.
``But I approached the character with the conviction that he is a
professional and he made this diagnosis based on years of
experience. The more this girl rants and raves, the more I am
convinced of my diagnosis.''
   The consummate professional, Wallach has brought to the screen
more than 40 years of acting experience.
   ``You know, originally I prepared for a teaching career, but due
to several circumstances I missed the exam,'' he said. ``So I
decided to do what I most wanted to do and that was to act.''
   He began his career with a scholarship to the Neighborhood
Playhouse in New York and made his first appearance in the Equity
Library production of Tennessee Williams' ``This Property Is
Condemned.''
   This became an important turning point in Wallach's life, for
the only other performer in the show happened to be the actress,
Anne Jackson, who later became his wife.
   Wallach made his Broadway debut in 1945 in ``Skydrift'' a
short-lived production. But soon thereafter, he was cast in the
Broadway production of ``Mister Roberts,'' which starred Henry
Fonda and ran for two years.
   He then went on to receive a Tony award for Tennesse Williams'
``The Rose Tattoo.''
   ``It's a shame that shows have become so expensive here in New
York, because we would have less problems if everybody were able to
go to the theater _ rich, poor, black, white, minorities _
everbody,'' he said.
   ``Theater is not a luxury but a necessity, for theater helps
people understand the human condition.''
   This belief in the power of theater to reach out to people has
led Wallach through many plays in his long career, including
``Camino Real,'' ``Henry VIII,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' ``Waltz
of the Toreadors,'' ``Luv'' and ``The Teahouse of the August Moon.''
   Wallach's movie career began with Elia Kazan's debut as a
director in ``Baby Doll'' in 1956, for which he won Britain's
highest film acting honor.
   ``I used to sneer at the screen,'' Wallach said, ``then I
realized how hard it is.
   ``A movie has many layers _ the director wields the baton and I
play the instrument. Although it's a lot of hard work, I have fun
and that's important.
   ``Let me tell you this,'' he continued. ``The most important
things in life are the right partner and your work. If you find a
lifelong partner and you love your work, you are a most fortunate
person.''
   The 72-year-old Wallach has indeed been fortunate. He and
Jackson have raised two daughters and a son. He has also appeared
in aproximately 50 motion pictures since ``Baby Doll.'' He is most
recognized for his role in the spaghetti Western, ``The Good, the
Bad and the Ugly.''
   ``People all over the world still come up to me on the streets
and mention that movie with Clint Eastwood,'' he said.
   His other films include ``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The
Misfits,'' ``How the West Was Won,'' ``Cinderella Liberty,'' ``The
Deep'' and ``Tough Guys.''
   His most recent TV appearances include ``The Executioner's
Song'' and an HBO movie, ``The Impossible Spy.''
   Even though he's busy with films and television _ he's also a
spokesman for Toyota Trucks _ he still manages to keep one foot in
the theater.
   ``I am like a farmer who rotates his crops, I always allocate a
certain period of my time to go back to my roots _ the theater.''

   President Yoweri Museveni reshuffled his
Cabinet for the second time since coming to power in 1986 and
created three new posts for deputy prime ministers, Radio Uganda
reported Tuesday.
   The state-owned radio gave no reason for the shake-up, in which
Museveni kept on all 44 ministers, but transferred 32 of them to
new posts.
   Among those receiving new portfolios was Stanislas Okurut, the
former minister of culture, sports and youth, who has not been
heard from since his kidnapping two months ago by rebels in eastern
Uganda. Okurut was named minister of labor.
   The new deputy prime ministers are former Minister of State
Eriya Kategaya, former Foreign Affairs Minister Paul Ssemogerere,
and former Minister of Internal Affairs Abubakar Mayanja. Samson
Kisekka retained his post as prime minister.
   Museveni seized power in this East African nation in January
1986 after leading a five-year bush war. His first Cabinet
reshuffle was in November 1986.

   The week's campaign marked something of a break between New
Hampshire's intensive leadoff primary a week ago and the highly
visible Southern contests ahead.
   But for Dole, it marked an opportunity to demonstrate strength
on the heels of his New Hampshire loss, and he taunted the vice
president for not competing.
   ``I don't know where George Bush is,'' he said in Duluth.
``We're going to send him a map of Minnesota so at least he gets a
little idea where it is.''
   But Bush's aides wanted no part of two states so close to Iowa,
where the vice president finished a humbling third in caucuses two
weeks ago. Instead the vice president spent his time in South
Carolina, which votes on March 5, and in several Super Tuesday
states.
   Dole enjoyed the support of Sen. Larry Pressler and Gov. George
Mickelson and was a prohibitive favorite in South Dakota.
   He looked for a boost from Minnesota, as well, but sounded less
confident of a victory there.
   Party officials said Minnesota was tailor-made for a Robertson
surprise, noting his earlier success in organizational contests
such as Iowa, where he finished a surprising second, and in Hawaii,
which he won. Robertson also was well known in the state because
his one-time television program was viewed widely.
   Kemp, his candidacy on the ropes after a weak third place finish
in New Hampshire, purchased television advertising at the last
minute in South Dakota. His aides conceded in advance that
Minnesota looked like a lost cause because of Robertson's presumed
strength.
   Among the Democrats, New Hampshire primary winner Dukakis
dreamed of a two-state sweep Midwestern sweep that would clearly
establish him as a candidate with national appeal.
   His rivals said he spent a fortune organizing Minnesota, leaving
Gephardt, Jackson and Simon in his wake.
   South Dakota was another story _ and a heated one.
   Gephardt, anxious for a victory, aired television commercials
attacking the governor. The Missouri congressman also won the
endorsement of Sen. Tom Daschle, and rushed a commercial onto the
air trumpeting the news.
   Dukakis responded with a late radio advertisement responding to
the attacks and pointing out that Gephardt accepts political action
committee campaign funds.
   Gore also invested in television advertising in South Dakota to
redeem his earlier declaration that he needed to demonstrate
strength outside the South.
   Despite his initial statement that he needed a win this week to
stay in the race, Simon changed course and vowed to fight for the
``heart and soul'' of the Democratic Party until the convention.
His aides conceded no victories were likely in either Minnesota or
South Dakota.
   Jackson made little effort in South Dakota, but worked hard in
Minnesota in hopes of matching his double-digit showing in the Iowa
caucuses next door.
   Hart said in advance he would stay in the race no matter where
he finished.

   British travelers will no longer need a visa to
visit the United States next year, officials of both countries said
Tuesday.
   The decision soothes a long-standing British irritation, since
Britain does not require U.S. visitors to have similar visas.
   Officials said the change is part of a pilot program to drop
visa requirements for eight countries, beginning with Britain and
Japan. They would not identify the other six.
   ``There are a number of technical issues to be settled but we
hope the new arrangement can come into force at the turn of the
year,'' said a spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   A U.S. Embassy official said less than 2 percent of British and
Japanese visitors cause problems on U.S. visits, such as abusing
the length of stay.
   When the program is implemented, British travelers will be
required to have only a valid passport and a return ticket and can
stay in the United States for a maximum of 90 days. They will still
be required to apply for a visa to work or live in the United
States.
   The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, that
last year the embassy issued 690,000 non-immigrant visas to
Britons. He said the number of British visitors was even higher
because some traveled on multiple-entry visas.
   This year, the embassy expects to process 900,000 such visas, he
said.

   A four-day sickout by 110 Providence
firefighters ended today when the firefighters returned to work
after being threatened with contempt of court.
   But 35 of the firefighters were cited with contempt anyway by
Superior Court Judge Americo Campanella because they did not show
up in court Monday to explain why they were absent over the weekend.
   Campanella said there was no evidence that the firefighters had
not acted in concert to stay off the job in violation of a
back-to-work order issued Saturday by another judge. He said he
would decide on penalties at a later time.
   The city had asked for the contempt citations even though the
sickout was over in order to prevent something similar from
happening in the future, said city labor attorney Vincent Ragosta
Jr. State law prohibits public safety employees from striking.
   ``Everything's back to normal,'' Fire Chief Michael F. Moise
said today.
   Eighty-seven firefighters who reported for duty Friday evening
were kept on the job during the sickout over a contract dispute. No
major fires occurred in the city during the four-day period.
   On Monday, Campanella postponed a hearing after Ragosta and Leo
J. Miller, president of the Providence Firefighters Union,
indicated that relatively few members of the union had been
notified of the temporary restraining order issued by another
Superior Court judge at the city's request Saturday.
   Miller testified he was only able to reach about half the 50
firefighters scheduled to work Sunday.
   Ragosta said the city served notices of the restraining order on
129 firefighters. Another 36 were notified of Monday's contempt
hearing.
   The union represents 450 of the city's total uniformed force of
479.
   The dispute apparently concerns language in a contract ratified
by firefighters in December that the city has yet to sign.
   Miller asserts the city is trying to renege on a provision that
calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit.
Union members also complain that promises to replace worn-out or
damaged equipment like boots, helmets and firecoats have not been
fulfilled.
   All but one of the 51 firefighters scheduled to report for work
at 8 a.m. Saturday called in sick, Moise testified Monday. Sixty
others called in sick for the shift that was supposed to begin at 6
a.m. Sunday, Moise said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham is as stubborn as a mule
and can't govern the state, former Sen. Barry Goldwater said today
as he became honorary chairman man of John Rhodes' Republican
gubernatorial bid.
   Goldwater, who backed Mecham, a fellow Republican, during the
1986 campaign, said at a news conference today that the endorsement
was a mistake.
   ``He screwed up too much ... He turned out wrong,'' Goldwater
told reporters.
   ``You look back over all the governors that we've had in this
state,'' said the senator, who has been considered the patriarch of
the Arizona GOP. ``We''ve had some darn good ones and we've had
some mediocre ones, but it took us a long time to get a really bad
one.''
   Nonetheless, Goldwater said Mecham will be difficult to beat in
the May 17 recall election because he still has a strong core of
support despite the governor's indictment on criminal charges and
upcoming impeachment trial.
   Rhodes, a former 30-year congressman, will face Mecham and
Democrat Carolyn Warner in the recall vote.
   Goldwater contended Mecham was too wrapped up in defending
himself against the impeachment and criminal charges during recent
months to spend much time governing the state.
   Mecham gave up the acting governorship to Democrat Rose Mofford
when he was impeached on Feb. 5. His Senate trial is scheduled to
begin Monday on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan,
misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to
his auto dealership, and trying to thwart an investigation of an
alleged death threat by a state official.
   Even if he could solve his legal problems, however, Goldwater
said he does not believe Mecham can govern the state.
   ``He is a very obstinate man,'' Goldwater said. ``I used to
drive mules and he's a lot like a mule.''
   Goldwater said he doesn't see much difference between Rhodes and
Mrs. Warner, except that he believes Rhodes has more experience.

   Hank Williams Jr., country music's rowdy
outlaw, and gentle ex-frycook and Grammy nominee Randy Travis swept
today's Academy of Country Music nominations.
   Williams, last year's ACM Entertainer of the Year, and Travis,
who swept the awards show in 1987 with four trophies, will face
each other in Entertainer of the Year, top male vocalist, single
song, album and video categories.
   The surprise was the poor showing of the multiple Grammy nominee
``Trio'' album, which got the Academy's best album nomination but
no other mention for singers Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and
Emmylou Harris.
   Williams led with six nominations. Travis had five and gentleman
cowboy George Strait had four, including top male vocalist, single,
song and album nominations.
   Other multiple nominees included perennial favorite Alabama and
newcomers K.T. Oslin and Ricky Van Shelton with three each, and the
Bellamy Brothers, Crystal Gayle, The Judds, Reba McEntire and
Restless Heart with two apiece.
   The nominees were announced during a news conference at the
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Ballots go into the mail to about 2,500
Academy members this week, and finalists will be announced during a
nationally televised two-hour NBC-TV special March 21 from Knott's
Berry Farm in Buena Park.
   The show will be hosted by Williams and Miss McEntire.
   In addition to Williams and Travis in the Entertainer of the
Year category are Alabama, Miss McEntire and Willie Nelson.
   In the male vocalist category, Williams, Travis and Strait are
joined by Ronnie Milsap and Steve Wariner.
   Female vocalist contenders include Rosanne Cash, Miss Gayle,
Miss McEntire, Tanya Tucker and Kathy Mattea.
   Miss Gayle is also in the top vocal duet category with Gary
Morris. Other contenders are Foster & Lloyd, Sweethearts of the
Rodeo, the Bellamy Brothers and The Judds.
   The top vocal group category includes Alabama, Exile, Highway
101, Restless Heart and The Oakridge Boys.
   Williams' ``Born To Boogie'' LP got him nominations for best
single, song and album of the year. Travis' ``Forever and Ever,
Amen'' got nods for best single and song and his LP ``Always and
Forever'' got him an album of the year nomination.
   Also in the top album category is ``Heart Land'' by The Judds
and ``Oceanfront Property'' by Strait.
   Other top single contenders are Strait's ``All My Ex's Live in
Texas,'' Restless Heart's ``I'll Still Be Loving You,'' and Van
Shelton's ``Somebody Lied.''
   Other best song nominees are Miss Oslin's ``80's Ladies'' and
Van Shelton's ``Somebody Lied.''
   In the best new artist category, female contenders include Miss
Oslin, Nanci Griffith, Libby Hurley, K.D. Lang and Dana McVicker.
Male nominees are Van Shelton, Larry Boone, Marty Haggard, Lyle
Lovett, and Jo-El Sonnier.
   In the video category, which is voted by the Academy's board of
directors, contenders include Miss Oslin's ``80's Ladies,'' Travis'
``Forever and Ever, Amen,'' Williams' ``My Name Is Bo Cephus,'' the
Bellamy Brothers' ``Santa Fe,'' Dwight Yoakam's ``Little Sister''
and Alabama's ``Tartop.''

<HEAD>Indian Troops Kill 20 Tamils After Four Troops Killed in Ambush</HEAD>

   Indian troops shot and killed 20 Tamil
civilians Tuesday after four soldiers died in a ambush by Tamil
rebels, Sri Lankan military officials said.
   The civilians were killed after an Indian army officer and three
soldiers died in the ambush in Kuthukudiuppu, a northeastern
village in the Mullaitivu district about 173 miles northeast of
Colombo, the officials said.
   The Sri Lankan officials could not be identified in accordance
with briefing rules.
   A spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, denied
any Tamil civilians were killed. She said the body of one Tamil
rebel was recovered and at least 10 more rebels were believed
killed.
   Authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on the district after
the violence broke out, the Sri Lankan officials said. They said
there were reports of heavy air activity by Indian troops.
   More than 45,000 Indian troops are stationed in Sri Lanka to
disarm Tamil militants opposed to a peace accord signed last July,
which grants some autonomy to minority Tamils. The Tamils
constitute 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   Tamils say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who control the government and the army.
   The most powerful Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, has been battling Indian troops since last October in
the northern and eastern provinces, where most of the Tamils live.
   Also on Tuesday, Sinhalese extremists stabbed a police constable
and a security officer guarding an injured Sinhalese militant
inside the Colombo General Hospital, a police spokesman said. He
said both victims were in serious condition.
   The attackers are believed to be members of the People's
Liberation Front, an ultra-nationalist organization of the majority
Sinhalese people that also opposes the peace accord. They escaped
with their injured comrade.
   On Monday, Liberation Front members raided a Sri Lankan army
camp northeast of Colombo, killing two soldiers. The attackers
escaped with two Chinese-made T-56 automatic rifles and 120 rounds
of ammunition.
   The group has vowed to kill anyone who supports the Indian-Sri
Lankan accord, claiming it grants too many concessions to the
Tamils. Sinhalese extremists already have killed more than 150
people since the accord was signed.
   Last year, attackers believed to be members of the Liberation
Front killed a popular Sri Lankan film stars and politician, Vijaya
Kumaranatunga, who supported the peace pact.

   Here, at a glance, are the methods for picking
delegates from Minnesota to attend the 1988 Democratic and
Republican national conventions this summer.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEMOCRATS</HEAD>

   Method: Caucus
   Date: Tuesday, February 23
   Presidential filing deadline: None.

   Total delegates: 87
   Delegates allocated: Tuesday, February 23
   Selection of delegates: Sunday, May 1 and Sunday, June 12
   Minnesota Democrats plan to pick national convention delegates
through a four-tier caucus-convention system, beginning with
precinct caucuses on Feb 23. The precinct caucuses will elect
delegates to the county conventions, which elect delegates to the
congressional district and state conventions.
   Under an agreement reached with the national party, the results
of the presidential preference vote at the precinct caucuses will
not be tabulated until March 8. This was to end a confrontation
over the state's insistence on holding its leadoff event on Feb.
23, two weeks earlier than allowed by national party rules.
   The two sides remained at odds until a few weeks ago over a plan
by Minnesota's secretary of state to compile a poll of the
presidential preferences of delegates elected to the county
conventions. The state Democratic Party has agreed it would lend no
help to conducting the poll on precinct caucus night. Those
figures, which technically have no binding effect, were to be
gathered by thousands of volunteers recruited by the secretary of
state.
   The state's 51 pledged national convention delegates from
congressional districts will be chosen and allocated at the
congressional district conventions scheduled for April 29-May 1.
   The rest of the state's 27 pledged delegates will be chosen and
allocated among presidential candidates at the state party
convention June 10-12.
   Former Vice President Walter Mondale, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1984, automatically will be seated as a
delegate because of his position as a former party leader.

   Selection of delegates: Friday, April 15 and Thursday, June 16
   Minnesota Republicans begin the four-step process of picking
national convention delegates with precinct caucuses on Feb. 23.
   Participants in the caucuses elect delegates to county
conventions to be held between March 5-26. These conventions pick
delegates to the congressional district conventions to be held
between April 15-May 7; and to the state convention to be held June
16-18.
   The eight congressional district conventions each will choose
three delegates to the national convention. The state convention
will choose Minnesota's remaining seven delegates at-large.
   Minnesota GOP rules do not require that participants in the
state caucuses or conventions bind themselves to any presidential
candidate.

<HEAD>Residents Not Sure About New Homes Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TCHULA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials have a big selling job to do in
this improverished town if 30 families are to get new homes, the
mayor says.
   The families living in old shacks, rusting trailers and leaning
houses on Tchula's north side are to get new homes in about a year,
but Mayor David Cotten says it is going to be hard to convince some
that officials are trying to improve their quality of life and not
swindle them.
   ``They're scared and you can't blame them,'' Cotten said. ``The
most devastating thing to fight is ignorance.''
   Cotten and U.S. Rep. Mike Espy were on hand Monday for a
ground-breaking ceremony on the site of a burned-out house in the
middle of a four-block strip targeted for revitalization.
   ``We're going to be tearing these down,'' Cotten said of the
stretch of homes. ``But this a drop in the bucket. We want to
change the face of Tchula. We want everyone to be a homeowner.''
   When farmworkers are idle, unemployment in the central
Mississippi town of 2,000 can reach 85 percent, Cotten said. Poor
housing conditions are easily visible from the road.
   With a $695,832 community development block grant _ federal
money allocated by the state _ city and state officials are to
begin razing some homes in March and refurbishing others. In place
of the homes to be torn down, 30 new single-family dwellings will
be built.
   Residents who already own their land and homes will get the new
homes free, and renters will have a chance to buy homes through
low-interest programs, Cotten said.
   The city also will use the money to pay half the rent of
displaced homeowners during the renovations.
   Lillie May Brooks, 67, who lives alone in a home just a few feet
from where ground was broken for the first new house, was
suspicious of the plans.
   ``This house belongs to me and I don't want my house torn
down,'' said Brooks as she sat on her porch. ``This house suits me
all right.''
   Another resident, Jesse Riley, watched curiously from the road
while officials spoke.
   ``Can they really take someone's home?'' he asked a bystander.
``It's nice but I don't see why they should take people's
property.''
   The mayor said many will change their minds as they understand
the program.
   ``We have a lot of people here with no education,'' Cotten said.
``There are many who think you're going to steal their land.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary John Herrington told a House
subcommittee Tuesday he had been dealt a low blow by Interior
Secretary Donald P. Hodel through Hodel's interpretation of why
Herrington opposes one of Hodel's ideas.
   Herrington recommended that the panel not consider Hodel's
request for funds for what he called the ``frivolous'' idea of
removing the O'Shaughnessy Dam in Hetch Hetchy Valley in
California's Yosemite National Park and draining the reservoir
behind the dam.
   The dam provides three-quarters of San Francisco's water. The
city earns about $38 million a year selling water and electricity
from the reservoir.
   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations
interior subcommittee, said he found Hodel's idea ``strange,'' and
he had been ``shocked if not surprised'' that Hodel proposed it
last year.
   Yates read the opening paragraph of a news article about the
feud between the two Cabinet secretaries describing Hodel's belief
that Herrington was opposing removal of the dam because Herrington
was concerned about what it would do to his job prospects in
California.
   ``That's a low blow, isn't it?'' Yates said.
   ``It really is,'' Herrington replied.
   ``What about this job you're going to get?'' Yates asked.
   ``I don't know who fabricated that,'' Herrington said.
   Hodel has said the Hetch Hetchy Valley, filled by the reservoir
from 1913 to 1923, could relieve some of the visitor pressure on
Yosemite Valley, which attracts more than 2 million people a year.
He has said the project could not be begun for years, but is asking
for $600,000 in his budget for further studies.
   Yates asked Herrington, ``Your recommendation to this committee
would be not to consider an appropriation which would result in a
change in the status of Hetch Hetchy?''
   Herrington replied, ``That's my recommendation.''
   ``As energy secretary, I am concerned about destroying an
infrastructure that produces a substantial amount of electricity,''
he added.
   The generating capacity _ about 150 megawatts _ eventually will
have to be replaced, ``and I just don't think enough thought has
been given to the economic consequences,'' Herrington said.
   Herrington said his department estimated that removal of the dam
and restoration of the valley could cost $5 billion to $6 billion,
``a lot of money for a frivolous idea.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   SECURITY CLEARANCES
   
   The court limited the job protection for government workers
fired for lacking security clearances.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices agreed with the Reagan
administration that the Merit Systems Protection Board lacks
authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is
justified.
   The case is Navy vs. Egan, 86-1552.
   
   CRIMINAL IDENTIFICATION
   
   The court ruled that a criminal suspect's rights are not
violated when a witness who is unable to identify the suspect in
court testifies about an earlier identification of the accused.
   The justices, voting 6-2, ordered the reinstatement of the
conviction of a California prison inmate in the beating of a prison
guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack.
   The case is U.S. vs. Owens, 86-877.
   
   PENSION FUNDS
   
   The court ruled that businesses may not be sued in federal court
for refusing to contribute to multi-employer union pension funds
after a collective bargaining agreement expires.
   In an 8-0 ruling, the court rejected Reagan administration
arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases could undermine the
solvency of the multi-employer pension plans.
   The case is Welfare Trust Fund vs. Advanced Lightweight
Concrete, 85-2079.
   
   GULF COAST
   
   The court, rejecting claims by private landowners, ruled that
the state of Mississippi owns thousands of acres of oil- and
gas-rich land near the state's Gulf Coast.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices said states may claim title to land
beneath waters subject to the tie's influence _ and not only land
under navigable waters.
   The case is Phillips Petroleum vs. Mississippi, 86-870.
   
   MISSOURI RIVER BASIN
   
   The court, in a victory for three midwestern states, today
limited the secretary of the interior's authority to allocate water
stored in Missouri River Basin reservoirs.
   The justices ruled unanimously that the interior secretary
exceeded his authority when in 1982 he approved a contract
authorizing Energy Transportation Systems Inc. (ETSI) to take water
from Lake Oahe in South Dakota for a coal slurry pipeline project.
   The case is ETSI Pipeline Project vs. Missouri, 86-939 and
86-941.

   Afghan insurgents announced plans
Tuesday to replace the Communist regime with an Islamic government,
which they said would promote peace and ensure the safe withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   The guerrilla alliance said the civil war would not end until
such a government was established to guide the way to a nation
called ``The Islamic State of Afghanistan.''
   President Najib responded that a new government should be formed
after the Soviets withdraw, and is a matter for ``Afghans alone.''
   Kabul radio quoted Najib as saying: ``No one can direct the
Afghans on this ... or give their views.''
   His comments appeared to reflect the government's position that
the issue of a coalition government should be settled within
Afghanistan, not by guerrilla leaders in neighboring Pakistan.
   Afghan guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979. An
estimated 115,000 now are in the country helping fight the
insurgents.
   On Feb. 8, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered to begin
withdrawing troops May 15 if Pakistan and Afghanistan reach
agreement by March 15 in U.N.-sponsored negotiations that resume in
Geneva next week. He said the pullout could be accompalished in 10
months.
   Islamic Unity, an alliance of seven guerrilla groups, announced
its plans for a government in a statement telexed from the border
city of Peshawar, Pakistan, calling for a 28-member cabinet to
replace Najib's government.
   It said the government would consist of 14 ministers from the
guerrilla leadership, seven representatives of Afghan refugees and
``seven Moslems presently living in Kabul.''
   Insurgent leaders have said the Moslems in Kabul would include
non-Communists in the current administration who have not been
closely involved in the war.
   In a separate statement, alliance leader Yunis Khalis said: ``As
long as a single Communist remains in power in Kabul, the regime
will have to face the Mujahedeen resistance. Until we have
established an Islamic government, we will never lay down our
arms.''
   About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan. Most are in
border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply points for
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
   The alliance statement said a ``supreme council'' would be the
government's highest body and oversee the cabinet. Its members
would be leaders of the seven-party alliance based in Pakistan, who
would provide ``joint leadership during the interim period'' after
moving to Kabul.
   ``This government is proposed to replace the present regime in
Kabul before the signing of the Geneva accords under the auspices
of the United Nations,'' and would ``represent all sections of the
Afghan nation,'' the announcement said.
   It said the chief cabinet minister also would be the head of
state, but it did not say who would hold the post or name proposed
cabinet members.
   Another organ of government would be a consultative council of
75 members _ two from each of the 28 provinces and 19 Moslem
religious scholars, intellectuals and technocrats, the statement
said. It said the council would make interim laws to apply until a
new constitution was written.
   Provincial councils would be in charge of regional affairs.
   The statement said an independent election commission would
supervise the election of a constituent assembly immediately after
the Soviet withdrawal.
   In ``The Islamic State of Afghanistan,'' the statement said,
``the Koran and Sunnah (teachings and practices of the Prophet
Mohammed) will be supreme.'' It said the country would be governed
by an elected head of state and legislative assembly.

   A federal judge has ordered an investigation
into why a doctor waited two months to disclose that one of three
hemophiliac brothers exposed to the AIDS virus had been diagnosed
with AIDS-related complex.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich said in a court order
Monday that she has ``grave concerns'' with Dr. Jerry Barbosa's
statements to the press that he withheld the diagnosis out of
respect for the privacy of the family of Clifford and Louise Ray.
   In a medical report filed Feb. 12, Barbosa said Ricky, 11 and
the oldest of the brothers, was diagnosed with ARC, AIDS-related
complex.
   Barbosa, a physician at All Children's Hospital in St.
Petersburg, told the St. Petersburg Times that he knew of the
diagnosis in December but didn't report it out of concern for the
Rays' privacy, the Times said Tuesday.
   ``I left out a number of things on purpose,'' the Times quoted
the doctor as saying.
   In her order, Ms. Kovachevich asked a magistrate to find out
what the doctor told a Times reporter and who was aware of
Barbosa's ``intentional omissions from the medical reports and when
they were aware of the omissions.''
   In addition, she said she wanted to know whether attorneys told
the court any contradictory medical information and whether an
independent doctor should be appointed.
   Last August, the judge ordered the DeSoto County School Board to
reinstate the three Ray boys _ Ricky, Robert and Randy. The
brothers, all hemophiliacs, were barred from class after they
tested positive for antibodies associated with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   During a hearing last summer, doctors said the boys probably
were contaminated through plasma products used to clot their blood
and showed no symptoms of having the disease.
   The AIDS virus can remain dormant for years. ARC is found when
the virus causes a set of symptoms that usually are considered a
precursor to AIDS.
   Barbosa said in his Feb. 12 report that Ricky's condition
appeared to be stable. The boy has been treated with AZT, an
anti-AIDS drug.
   The Ray boys' medical records are supposed to be on public file
as a condition of the August injunction that returned them to
school. The family, however, fled DeSoto County a week after
classes began because of a parental boycott, bomb threats that
emptied the school and a deliberate blaze that destoyed their home.
   They now live in Sarasota, where the boys enrolled in school
without objection from school officials, although some parents
objected.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring.

   U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Margaret
Heckler prayed at the churchyard where her grandparents are buried
and visited the cottage where her father lived before he emigrated
to the United States.
   The visit by Mrs. Heckler was supposed to be a secret, but
people in Ballysteen, a village of 200 people near the River
Shannon 14 miles west of Limerick, found out in time to spruce up
the ancestral cottage.
   In the tiny two-bedroom house, Mrs. Heckler, who has been
ambassador to Ireland for two years, found a loaf of home-baked
bread, scones and tea laid out on the table by the villagers.
   Limerick County Council chairman Paddy Sheehy, who happens to be
Mrs. Heckler's cousin, greeted her when she arrived, and the local
folk music band regaled her with songs of welcome.
   ``It's a moment I've long waited to cherish,'' said Mrs.
Heckler, 56. ``It's fascinating to see the country roads where my
family once walked and to see the hills where they probably once
roamed.''
   Mrs. Heckler, a former congresswoman from Massachusetts, served
as the federal secretary for health and human services before being

   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger became
an honorary knight Tuesday, joining the illustrious ranks of the
defenders of Queen Elizabeth II's realm.
   The queen herself bestowed the medals on Weinberger in a simple
ceremony at Buckingham Palace, but it doesn't mean he can call
himself ``Sir Caspar.'' ``Caspar Weinberger GBE'' will have to do.
   In recommending him for the highest royal honor Britain gives to
foreigners, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government was
thanking Weinberger for his defense of British interests,
especially during the 1982 Falkland Islands War with Argentina,
when Washington provided Britain with crucial intelligence and
logistics support.
   But the unassuming Weinberger professed amazement at the
accolade. When a reporter asked why he thought he had received it,
he replied: ``I haven't the faintest idea.''
   Weinberger skipped the pomp and pageantry of a public
investiture at Buckingham Palace, in which the queen would have
placed a ribbon of medals over his head before an audience of
hundreds.
   Instead, he chose a 25-minute private audience with the queen
attended only by his wife, Jane, and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe, who had recommended him for the honorary knighthood.
   As a foreigner, Weinberger didn't have to bow or scrape before
the queen.
   ``Her Majesty was nice enough just to present it to me,'' he
said, pointing to the blue box he was holding.
   Weinberger opened it for photographers, showing them the gold
cross of the Order of the British Empire and the silver star of a
Knight Grand Cross, the highest order of chivalry for a foreigner.
He did not put them on.
   ``I'm very honored, very pleased and still very astonished,''
said Weinberger, who retired Nov. 5 after nearly seven years as
President Reagan's defense chief.
   When the award was announced on Feb. 1, reporters asked
70-year-old Weinberger whether he was ready to be called ``Sir
Cap.'' He replied: ``Good God, no! Our Constitution has some harsh
words about titles. But I really am flattered.''
   Actually, the title of ``sir'' is reserved for British subjects.
   Weinberger was the 56th American to receive an honorary
knighthood but only the second to receive a GBE. The other Knight
Grand Cross was awarded in 1976 to Hugh Bullock, president and
chairman of Pilgrims of the USA, an Anglo-American friendship
society.
   Other Americans who have been made Knights of the British
Empire, a lower rank of chivalry, include President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, industrialist
Henry Ford II, philanthropists Paul Mellon and John Paul Getty II,
actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Sidney Poitier and former Sen. J.
William Fulbright, D-Ark., who headed the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   The Foreign Office said Weinberger was being knighted for his
``outstanding and invaluable contribution'' to Anglo-American
defense cooperation, especially his ``unfailing support and
assistance'' during Britain's 74-day campaign to oust Argentina's
invasion force from the Falklands.
   Weinberger refused to say whether the queen had spoken about the
Falklands or defense. ``She was very gracious as always and very
generous in her remarks,'' he said, without elaborating.
   The private meeting took place in The Queen's Audience Room,
where the 61-year-old monarch has weekly talks with Mrs. Thatcher
and occasionally meets other officials. It contains a piano and the
blue walls are filled with paintings including two Canalettos and
two Gainsboroughs.
   Weinberger, who counts Winston Churchill among his heroes, has
longstanding ties to Britain.
   He made his debut as a British television commentator in
December, when the treaty which he helped secure eliminating
shorter- and medium-range missiles was signed, and he will be
spending four weeks this summer as a distinguished visiting
professor at Edinburgh University.
   Asked whether the honorary knighthood had made him more of an
Anglophile, Weinberger replied: ``Well, it's hard to be not.''
   He then drove off with his wife to celebrate at a luncheon given
by U.S. Ambassador Charles Price II.

   A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement in
New York State of a federal regulation denying funds to family

   U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Stanton granted Attorney General
Robert Abrams a temporary injunction Friday in its attempt to block
the government from cutting funds to agencies that tell clients
where they can obtain abortions.
   The regulation, issued earlier this year to cover Title X of the
Public Health Services Act of 1970, also is being challenged in
other states. It was supposed to take effect March 3.
   City Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen Joseph has called the
regulation ``the worst set of federal guidelines I've seen in 25
years'' and said it would ``spread the AIDS virus in our
community'' by barring women with AIDS from having abortions.

<HEAD>Treaty Won't Hurt US Efforts To Aid NATO, Negotiator Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating
medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe won't hurt U.S. efforts
to provide high-tech military help to NATO, the chief U.S.
negotiator said Tuesday.
   ``This treaty does not prohibit the transfer of technology,''
Maynard Glitman testified before the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   Glitman's detailed analysis was part of a thorough examination
of the pact signed 10 weeks ago by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The treaty will eliminate all
nuclear-tipped missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,000 miles.
   Committee members say the detailed scrutiny is needed because of
disputes about the meaning of past treaties, particularly the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   The current treaty is being considered by the Senate amid a
fight between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the Reagan
administration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact and
whether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developed
under the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Article 14 of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty
says neither side shall do anything, now or in the future, to
undercut the pact.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told Glitman that ``I'm concerned about
article 14'' because it might limit future U.S. help to other NATO
nations.
   ``If we don't spell out what the future obligations are,'' said
Quayle, ``down the road I can foresee some problems ... now is the
time to give us as much running room as possible in the future for
our technology.''
   But Glitman took the opposite approach, noting that the treaty
is extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons, along
with their components.
   ``If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' said
Glitman. Later, he added that ``we're best protected by stating
what we cannot do.''
   Glitman said the voluminous negotiating record is the best
defense against future disputes about what is, and is not, covered
by the treaty.
   He opposed suggestions by Quayle and other senators that some
type of amendment is needed to clarify Article 14.
   The section is a standard clause which has been added to other
treaties and it simply restates the intention of both nations to
abide by the pact, Glitman said.
   Glitman cited one method in which he said U.S. aid to NATO would
not be affected. The treaty bans cruise missiles, he said, but it
doesn't block the transfer of U.S. technology to NATO nations such
as Great Britain to develop cruise missiles.
   Glitman said the U.S. negotiating team resisted Soviet efforts
to block U.S. help for NATO. ``We knew their goal was to find a way
to put a brake on NATO activities,'' he said.
   Reagan promised Tuesday that the United States will do its part
to ensure that the NATO alliance remains strong, saying in an
address broadcast to Europe that ``our destiny is coupled with
yours.''
   In the address, which came a week before a NATO summit meeting,
Reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any
member nation is an attack against all of them. ``Simply put, an
attack on Munich is the same as an attack on Chicago,'' he said.

   A top FBI official admitted today that some
agents came ``very close'' to conducting a political investigation
of anti-Reagan activists, but denied they intended to do so or
received any instructions from the Reagan administration.
   Oliver B. Revell, executive assistant director, told a Senate
panel there were legitimate reasons to investigate the Committee In
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, including possible links
with Salvadoran-based terrorists, and discussions by CISPES members
of committing violent acts.
   The investigation was closed down without any charges being
filed, and the bureau has now begun an investigation of its agents'
conduct. CISPES has said it was investigated because it opposes
President Reagan's Central America policies.
   Several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee told Revell
they remained skeptical of the FBI information that triggered the
investigation in March 1983 and fueled it until it closed in June
1985.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the former district attorney of
Philadelphia, said he has ``grave questions'' about Revell's
justifications, adding ``You have to proceed on the basis of
tangible hard facts and evidence'' _ which he indicated were
lacking in this case.
   Revell, noting this was a terrorism investigation, testily
replied that if the FBI always waited ``until there was tangible
evidence, you would have been picking up the pieces of the bombs.''
   Documents previously released in the probe show that FBI agents
and informants sent to spy on CISPES collected so much information
on peaceful protest activities that bureau headquarters was worried
that the investigation had gone too far.
   The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act,
have shown that while the investigation was targeted at CISPES, the
files eventually included information on hundreds of other
individuals and groups, ranging from Roman Catholic nuns to union
leaders who opposed Reagan policies.
   Revell said that more than a year after the investigation began,
top FBI officials warned field offices about investigating
legitimate political activity, beause they ``sensed'' the conduct
of some agents was ``very close to the line.''
   ``We may have seen some wavering over that line,'' he said, but
maintained that the investigation was legitimate under the FBI's
foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence guidelines.
   He flatly denied that the administration ever tried to influence
the investigation, commenting, ``There's been absolutely no contact
by anyone in the administration concerning tasking, opening or
closing of the investigation.''
   In defending the probe, Revell testified that in addition to
possible violence, CISPES was involved in circulating forged U.S.
documents and had strong ties to the U.S. communist party.
   ``Some have insinuated that this investigation was politically
motivated as many individuals associated with CISPES were opposed
to Reagan administration policies in Central America,'' Revell
said. ``Nothing could be further from the truth.
   ``We did find indications that some CISPES members were at least
discussing and planning violence. Our investigtions uncovered one
CISPES member who was tasked to determine response times of
emergency services in a major American city; another CISPES member
stated he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in a
major midwestern city; as well as plans to violently disrupt the
1984 Republican convention.''
   The bureau initiated the investigation under foreign
intelligence and counter-intelligence guidelines, designed to
protect the United States against crimes such as espionage and
terrorism, in which foreign powers or groups are involved.
   These guidelines allow the FBI to focus more on politically
oriented groups and their missions than on specific crimes that are
planned or carried out. Because of this wider latitude, some
lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that it is
easy to cross the line and investigate free speech and peaceful
assembly.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said the investigation in this
case ``was predicated on information received from several sources
that certain leaders and key members of CISPES were involved in
covertly furnishing funds and materials to a foreign terrorist
organization.'' The group was identified as the FMLN, the group
fighting a war against the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador.
   Jerry Berman, chief legislative counsel for the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the investigation should have started under
the most strict guidelines, those for general criminal
investigations.
   These investigations can only begin ``when facts or
circumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been, is
being, or will be committed.'' If the crime has already been
committed, the probe focuses on who committed the act and on
securing evidence.
   The FBI is given greater leeway for a domestic ``intelligence''
investigation, which can focus on groups in the United States
trying ``to further political or social goals through activities
that involve criminal violence.''
   The bureau did not place the CISPES investigation under either
the intelligence or general guidelines, but under the foreign
intelligence and counter-intelligence rules that involve
participation by foreign entities.
   These rules remain largely classified, but officials familiar
with them say they provide the widest latitude among the different
sets of guidelines.
   On July 26, 1984 _ some 16 months after the investigation began
_ FBI headquarters sent 32 field offices a message that suggested
some of them were going beyond the guidelines.
   ``Some offices have reported information recently regarding
political statements and political lobbying by CISPES or CISPES
affiliates,'' it said. ``Supervisors in recipient offices must
carefully monitor this and related investigations and asset
operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate
direction, targeting and reporting.''
   But messages from the field showed that bureaus were still
confused.
   In August 1984 the Denver office told headquarters, ``the field
is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political
activity can be monitored.''

<HEAD>Marijuana, Cocaine Traces Said Found In Amtrak Switchman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marijuana and small traces of cocaine and
methamphetamine were detected in the system of an Amtrak switchman
who fled his post after a Washington-to-Boston train derailment,
officials said Tuesday.
   Thomas Connor, 30, of Aldan, Pa., tested positive for marijuana
in his blood and urine, the Federal Railroad Administration said
after receiving results from the Center for Human Toxicology at the
University of Utah.
   In addition, there was evidence of cocaine and methamphetamine
in Connor's urine, but the levels were so low that the FRA declined
to even say they represented a ``positive'' finding under normal
circumstances.
   Connor, who has since resigned, was on duty in a control tower
when the train struck a work vehicle in Chester, Pa., near
Philadelphia, injuring 25 people on the train. Officials said he
left his post after realizing he had failed to take the train off a
stretch of track undergoing maintenance.
   Connor did not submit to blood or urine tests until more than 72
hours after the accident. For that reason, the FRA said it
instructed the laboratory to test the specimens to seek the
``smallest detectable amount,'' even if it fell below the normal
reporting range.
   FRA Administrator John Riley said the case illustrated the
importance of urine and blood tests being conducted on members of
train crews involved in major accidents. That program was struck
down two weeks ago by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and
the Reagan administration is appealing.
   `` Under the provisions of the recent 9th Circuit decision, it
is unlikely that we could have performed these tests. Neither we
nor the National Transportation Safety Board would have the benefit
of the information the tests were able to provide,'' Riley said.
   Arthur Donato, Connor's attorney, was said to be in a meeting
and unavailable for comment Tuesday.
   Marijuana can remain in the system and be detected for as long
as 30 days after use. Cocaine and amphetamines have much shorter
detection ranges _ roughly two to five days and two to seven days,
respectively.
   The tests found Connor had 89 nanograms per mililiter of
marijuana in his urine. A nanogram is one billionth of a gram. It
normally takes a finding of at least 20 nanograms per mililiter to
confirm the presence of the drug.
   FRA spokesman Bill Loftus declined to interpret the findings,
but said they will be considered in investigations of the accident
by his agency and the NTSB.
   ``This does not determine what level may have been in his system
at the time of the accident. It does not determine impairment. It
does not determine cause,'' Loftus said.
   An assistant conductor on the Amtrak train also tested positive
for marijuana, but he was not believed to have had played any role
in the accident, the FRA said.

   The National Governors' Association voted
after a spirited debate today to support the U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement despite fears that some state industries could suffer.
   The vote was 30 to 5, with the governors of Kentucky, Michigan,
North Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming in the minority.
   The governors also adopted policies urging the federal
government to take action on child care, including a ``modest''
commitment of funds to help poor working families.
   The fight against the resolution supporting the free trade
agreement was led by Wyoming Gov. Michael Sullivan, who charged
that American energy producers, fisheries, precious metal miners
and others ``are left at a disadvantage.''
   ``We can express our support for free trade without endorsing
the agreement,'' Sullivan said. He said it was premature and
governors should wait until their next meeting in August to take a
stand.
   But Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson replied, ``I don't like the
beer, you don't like the energy, Governor Sullivan, but how are we
going to have some input'' in the Senate ratification debate.
   An aide to the Wisconsin governor explained that some American
brewers have licensees in Canada, but Wisconsin's Heilemann's does
not and could be left at a disadvantage.
   But Thompson said it would be ``a terrible mistake'' to spurn
the agreement.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson said that if the governors did
not put aside ``partisanship and parochial fears for the greater
good of the country'' on this issue, ``then I have to say my voice
would be a little softer'' when he asked Congress to lay aside
politics in dealing with the deficit or welfare reform.
   The governors, who were concluding their three-day winter
meeting, did add an amendment to their resolution offered by Gov.
Garrey E. Carruthers of New Mexico which said: ``The governors have
significant concerns about issues created or not fully resolved by
the agreement and ask to be consulted as the implementing
legislation or other measures are developed to ameliorate these
problems. The administration should enter into additional
negotiations to address inequities regarding subsidies.''
   The governors adopted a policy two years ago supporting the
U.S.-Canada free trade negotiations. The new policy says the
governors' support ``is contingent upon Canada and the U.S. doing
nothing'' before the final treaty ratification to jeopardize or
undermine ``the spirit and benefits of the free trade agreement.''
   The governor of Guam, Joseph Ada, expressed concern that U.S.
territories were left out of the initial agreement.
   The governors of Hawaii and Maine abstained from the vote, which
did not include all the state leaders, because of their concerns
about the agreement, which was signed by President Reagan and
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Jan. 2. The agreement,
which must be ratified by Congress and the Canadian Parliament,
would eliminate all tariffs between the two countries by 1999. It
also would set up a new tribunal to settle future trade disputes.
   Forty-four governors signed a letter urging the Senate to pass a
welfare reform bill this year and the governors also asked Congress
to extend through 1992 their right to issue mortgage revenue bonds.
A provision in the 1986 tax reform law forbids their issuing new
mortgage revenue bonds after 1988.
   On Monday the governors went to the White House to hear
President Reagan make a pitch for a no-frills, $1.1 billion
Republican alternative to the $4.3 billion House-passed version of
welfare reform. He also cautioned them to ``tread carefully'' on
the issue of child care.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a Democratic presidential
hopeful, called Reagan's speech a disappointment. He said the
president should have joined the governors' call for passage of New
York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's welfare reform bill in the
Senate.
   Reagan instead said he still strongly supports the less costly
Republican alternative that the House rejected two months ago,
which would give states more flexibility in running their welfare
programs. Unlike the Democratic bill passed by the House, it would
not provide any big increase in Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.
   The governors' policy on child care calls for the public and
private sectors to work in concert on the problem, and says that
despite the deficit, ``the governors believe that the federal
government should begin to take action to improve child care.''

   Disabled Americans express greater interest in
politics than other citizens, but they register and vote at a rate
considerably lower than the general public, says a survey released
Tuesday.
   ``Our findings suggest that barriers, either external or
internal or both, prevent many disabled Americans from converting
their exceptionally high political interest into actual electoral
activity,'' said Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris and
Associates, which conducted the poll.
   The telephone poll of 536 disabled people nationwide found that
53 percent said they follow government and public affairs most of
the time.
   In comparison, only 26 percent of all U.S. adults pay attention
to politics much of the time, according to a 1984 National Election
Study by the University of Michigan.
   During the 1984 presidential campaign, 46 percent of the
disabled Americans were ``very much interested'' in the contest
compared with 35 percent of all adults, according to the new
survey, conducted in June and July 1987 by Louis Harris and
Associates.
   However, the interest did not translate into equal levels of
registration and voting,
   Disabled people registered at a rate that is six points lower
than the general population and voted at a rate that 12 points
lower, the poll said.
   The most common barrier cited for disabled people was lack of
transportation and difficulty in getting to the polls, problems
noted by 29 percent of the respondents. Twenty-one percent said it
was difficult to stand or walk.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.
   Taylor said he expects the number of disabled voters to increase
as states comply with federal law to make areas accessible to the
nation's approximately 35 million disabled.
   The survey defined disabled as people with a health problem that
prevented them from working, attending school or participating in
other activities; people with a physical disability such as
blindness, or people who considered themselves disabled.
   The announcement of the survey results coincided with the start
of the National Organization on Disability's public service
campaign to encourage the disabled to register to vote.
   The campaign included magazine ads featuring photos of former
Texas Rep. Barbara Jordan and presidential press secretary James
Brady, and the words, ``We're Here Promoting Voter Registration for
the 1988 Elections.''
   The ad also carries a toll-free number for registration
information: 1-800-248-ABLE.
   One-minute television spots also promote the hotline number.

<HEAD>Anniversary To Mark Annexation By Nazis Surrounded By Controversy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Austria's three main political
parties called Tuesday for a reconsideration of plans to have
President Kurt Waldheim address a ceremony on the 50th anniversary
of Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany.
   The debate over the solemn ceremony March 11 is the latest round
in the international controversy surrounding Waldheim and his role
in the German army under Adolf Hitler.
   Several high-ranking politicians have suggested the event should
be called off, saying a Waldheim speech is not the way for the
country to reflect on the atrocities of the Nazi era.
   None of the officials Tuesday called for a cancellation and none
said that Waldheim should be barred from speaking. Still, it was
clear that the politicians were not satisfied with the structure of
the ceremony as it stands.
   Waldheim has consistently denied that he committed wrongdoing as
a first lieutenant serving in the German army in the Balkans in
World War II.
   An international historians' commission report released earlier
this month left open the question of whether Waldheim committed
Nazi wartime atrocities.
   However, the report said Waldheim was ``in close proximity'' to
Nazi atrocities in the Balkans, knew they were going on and made no
attempt ot stop them. It also said Waldheim concealed his wartime
past.
   The commission, which started work in 1987, was formed after the
U.S. government placed Waldheim on a ``watch list'' of undesirable
aliens, effectively barring him from the United States.
   At a joint news conference Tuesday, the parliamentary leaders of
the conservative People's Party, the Socialists and the
rightist-oriented Freedom Party said organizers should rethink
plans for the cermony which include a Waldheim speech.
   Parliament President Leopold Gratz, a Socialist, said it is not
a question of canceling the ceremony. But he emphasized a meeting
of the organizers is needed ``because high officials have gone
public with their questioning of the sense of the planned official
ceremony.''
   Several thousand protesters are expected to gather outside the
Hofburg Palace, where the ceremony is set to take place, to
demonstrate against Waldheim and demand his resignation.
   Protesters, many of them opposed to Waldheim, also have promised
to flood Heroes' Square next to the Hofburg on March 12, the day
after the scheduled Waldheim speech.
   Gerulf Stix, parliamentary leader of the Freedom Party, also
called Tuesday for a rethinking of the commemoration plans, while
the tiny Greens party has called for its scrapping altogether.
   Several other political leaders also have expressed their
reservations.
   ``I have misgivings about this event,'' Socialist Party chief
Fred Sinowatz told reporters at a news conference Monday.
   The former chancellor called, instead, for reflection of ``what
happened on March 11, 1938 and what must be done so that such a
thing never happens again.''
   German troops marched into Austria nearly 50 years ago,
officially linking this Alpine nation with Hitler's Third Reich.
   Austrians are marking the annexation, called the Anschluss in
German, as a time of reflection on the troubled past.
   Austrian television and radio, along with many of the country's
newspapers, have started programs leading up to the March 11
commemoration date. There also are films and exhibitions.

   U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Margaret
Heckler prayed at the churchyard where her grandparents are buried
and visited the cottage where her father lived before he emigrated
to the United States.
   The visit by Mrs. Heckler was supposed to be a secret, but
people in Ballysteen, a village of 200 people near the River
Shannon 14 miles west of Limerick, found out in time to spruce up
the ancestral cottage.
   In the tiny two-bedroom house, Mrs. Heckler, who has been
ambassador to Ireland for two years, found a loaf of home-baked
bread, scones and tea laid out on the table by the villagers.
   Limerick County Council chairman Paddy Sheehy, who happens to be
Mrs. Heckler's cousin, greeted her when she arrived, and the local
folk music band regaled her with songs of welcome.
   ``It's a moment I've long waited to cherish,'' said Mrs.
Heckler, 56. ``It's fascinating to see the country roads where my
family once walked and to see the hills where they probably once
roamed.''
   Mrs. Heckler, a former congresswoman from Massachusetts, served
as the federal secretary for health and human services before being
posted to Dublin in January 1986.

   American rock star Tina Turner
arrived here Tuesday for two performances this week, accompanied by
an eight-piece band and 10 tons of equipment.
   Turner, with four Grammy and two American Music awards to her
credit, said that she plans to concentrate on acting, which means
she can't keep traveling at the same time.
   However, the 48-year-old singer said, she will try to satisfy
her rock fans by continuing to do recordings and television

   Speaking of her role, played opposite Mickey Rourke, she says,
``I found myself at a place in my life, and there was Wanda at the

   ``That's what I want _ to connect in my work with who I actually
am. God knows I've had a lot of artifice,'' she says. ``I don't

want to play any more queens.''

   Doctors, dentists and other health-care workers
can face penalties under the city's civil rights laws if they
refuse to treat people with AIDS, an administrative law judge has
ruled.
   Judge William Kirchgaessner, in a 17-page decision handed down
Monday, said that the city Human Rights Commission's ban against
discrimination in public accommodations included health-care
services.
   The ruling in the case of John Campanella, who was diagnosed as
having AIDS two years ago, clears the way for him to file a
complaint with the commission against his dentist, Dr. David
Hurwitz. Hurwitz had sent Campanella a letter a year ago saying he
would no longer treat Campanella because of the disease.
   ``This ruling puts all health-care workers in the city,
including dentists, doctors and nurses, on notice that they cannot
refuse to treat people with AIDS,'' said Lisa Bloom, an attorney
who represented Campanella.
   Arnold Weiss, Hurwitz's attorney, had filed a motion to dismiss
the complaint, arguing that the commission did not have ``the
authority to call a professional office a place of public
accommodation.''
   Weiss declined to comment Monday on the ruling, saying he had
not yet read it, or to say whether it would be appealed.
   No date has been set for a hearing on Campanella's complaint,
Ms. Bloom said.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring.

<HEAD>Soviet President Begins Five-day Visit To Hungary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Andrei Gromyko was
welcomed Tuesday by his Hungarian counterpart Karoly Nemeth at the
beginning of a five-day visit to this reform-minded but
economically stagnant Soviet ally.
   The only official business on the calendar of the former
longtime Soviet foreign minister, who became Soviet president three
years ago, was the signing of an agreement establishing a Hungarian
cultural center in Moscow.
   But a Hungarian official said privately that Gromyko and
Hungarian leaders could be expected to discuss ``everything'' about
relations between the two countries.
   The visit officially was to mark the 40th anniversary of the
Feb. 18, 1948, mutual assistance pact between the two countries.
And on Thursday, Gromyko is to give a major address to the
Hungarian Parliament.
   Gromyko, 78, was accompanied by a large Soviet delegation,
including Deputy Foreign Minister Vadim Loginov and Victor Karpov,
head of the Soviet Writers Union. The Soviets are staying until
Saturday morning.
   In a brief but ornate welcoming ceremony in the square in front
of the Parliament building situated along the Danube, Gromyko
inspected an honor guard of troops and listened to a military band
play the anthems of the two nations.
   He and Nemeth then departed, presumably for private talks.
Representatives of the Soviet delegation were to meet with
reporters in the evening.
   The government newspaper in a banner headline across its front
page Tuesday said, ``We greet with sincere respect and friendship
Comrade Andrei Gromyko.''
   The newspaper, Magyar Hirlap, noted that it was Gromyko's first
state trip abroad since assuming the presidency of the Supreme
Soviet in 1985 after his long career as Soviet foreign minister.
   The reason he chose Hungary, the newspaper said, may be ``that
our own efforts and initiatives are being recognized'' and that
``Soviet bodies are showing a well-meaning interest in our
country.''
   Hungary under party chief Janos Kadar has been a leader of
economic and political reform among Soviet bloc nations, and its
policies in many ways parallel the changes advocated in the Soviet
Union by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But the economic success of Hungary in the 1960s and '70s has
given way to stagnation in the 1980s.
   Hungarians are facing double-digit inflation and a foreign debt
burden of $16 billion for a country of only 10.6 million people,
the highest per capita debt in the East Bloc.
   The economic problems and the question mark hanging over the
nation as it waits the eventual retirement of Kadar, who will be 76
in May, are seen as two possible topics that would come up during
the Gromyko visit.
   Kadar has been general secretary of the Hungarian Socialist
Workers (Communist) Party since 1956.

   Officials of the Christian

church-supervised probation.
   ``CBN will air, this coming Sunday, a piece we did on Reverend
Swaggart's service last Sunday,'' said Benton Miller, a CBN
spokesman. ``After that point, we will not be airing any Swaggart
programming during the probation.''
   Swaggart, a Baton Rouge, La., televangelist, told his
congregation Sunday that he had sinned but gave no specifics
following allegations of sexual misconduct.
   The Louisiana presbytery of the Assemblies of God voted Monday
to bar him from preaching for three months and have him undergo two
years of rehabilitation. The national presbytery will make the
final decision.
   Miller said CBN would decide after the three-month probation
whether to resume carrying the program.
   Pat Robertson, founder of CBN and a Republican presidential
aspirant, said Monday that the weekend revelations about Swaggart
were planned by parties unknown to embarrass his campaign.
Robertson offered no proof to back up his allegations.

   ``The Red Sorghum Field'' _ an epic film about
seduction and war in China _ won the best-picture award Tuesday at
the 38th Berlin Film Festival.
   The best-director prize went to Canadian Norman Jewison for his
romantic comedy ``Moonstruck,'' and Holly Hunter was named best
actress for her portrayal of an ambitious TV producer in
``Broadcast News.''
   Joerg Pose and Manfred Moeck shared the best-actor honors for
their work in the East German entry ``Bear Ye One Another's
Burden.''
   Twenty films from 15 countries competed for top prize at the
festival, considered Europe's second-most prestigious movie
competition next to the Cannes film festival.
   ``The Red Sorghum Field,'' the first feature for director Zhang
Yimou, is set in a remote province of China during the late 1920s
and early 1930s. It tells the story of a young married girl who is
seduced by a distillery worker and bears his child. Her life is
then engulfed by the Japanese invasion of China.
   ``This is the first time that a Chinese film has received such a
great honor in Europe,'' Zhang said. ``I am especially happy for my
friends and co-workers.''
   Zhang, who studied at the Beijing Film Institute, won the best
acting award at the 1987 Tokyo Film Festival for his role in the
film ``The Old Well.'' He belongs to a new generation of Chinese
movie-makers whose films examine sexuality and human emotion more
realistically than past Chinese films.
   ``This generation of movie-makers was very young when the
Cultural Revolution broke out in China,'' Zhang told The AP.
   ``They are the young people who experienced the Cultural
Revolution for 10 years,'' he said. ``Because of this special
experience, they have an unusual point of view. They are
more-future-minded, they have different expectations. They want to
break with China of the past and represent the modern Chinese
society.''
   Moviegoers packed West Berlin theaters during the 12-day
festival, and many films were sold out several hours before their
showing. Long lines of people waited to buy tickets for ``Broadcast
News'' and ``Wall Street.''
   The festival was to end Tuesday night with a showing of Steven
Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun,'' which was not an entry in the
competition.

<HEAD>Justices Reaffirm States' Power to Control Tidal Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a defeat for private
landowners, on Tuesday buttressed the power of states to control
inland and coastal property affected by shifting tides.
   In a 5-3 ruling involving Mississippi's claim to 42 acres of
underwater land, the justices hotly disputed the effect of the
decision.
   The dissenters said it threatens private property in every
coastal state in the nation.
   But Justice Byron R. White, writing for the majority, said, ``We
are doubtful that this ruling will do more than confirm the
prevailing understanding. Our ruling today will not upset titles in
all coastal states.''
   The ruling, involving oil- and gas-rich land near Mississippi's
Gulf Coast, said states own land beneath waters subject to the
tide's influence _ and not only land under navigable waters.
   The ebb and flow of the tide, not navigability, determines the
state's ownership as long as it previously has not relinquished a
public trust claim to the tidelands, White said.
   ``States have interests in lands beneath tidal waters which have
nothing to do with navigation,'' he said. Those purposes range from
protecting fishing to setting aside submerged land for reclamation
for urban expansion, he said.
   ``It would be odd to acknowledge such diverse uses of public
trust tidelands and then suggest that the sole measure of the
expanse of such lands is the navigability of the waters over
them,'' White said.
   He said Tuesday's ruling is in line with longstanding tradition
giving states control over tidelands.
   The court rejected an appeal by private landowners and companies
that included Phillips Petroleum and a partnership called Cinque
Bambini.
   The private interests challenged Mississippi's claim to some
2,400 acres of undeveloped property in Hancock County. Lower courts
granted most of the land to the private companies.
   But the courts said the state owns 42 acres underlying the north
branch of Bayou LaCroix and 11 small drainage systems, about five
miles from the gulf. The state leased the land to Saga Petroleum
U.S. Inc. in 1977 for oil and gas exploration.
   The Mississippi Supreme Court in 1986 upheld the state's
ownership of the land based on a grant from the federal government
when Mississippi became a state in 1817.
   The state court said the state's title extends to all land
subject to tidal influence, inland to the mean high water mark.
   The Mississippi land is influenced by the tide since it is
affected by the ebb and flow of an adjacent navigable river that
flows into the gulf.
   The private landowners and companies traced their claims to the
underwater land back to Spanish land grants of 1813.
   In a dissenting opinion Tuesday, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
said the ruling could have sweeping impact.
   ``The court holds today that the public trust includes not only
tidewaters along the ocean shore, but also discrete bodies of water
that are influenced by the tide but far removed from the ocean or
any navigable tidal water,'' she said.
   ``Breaking a chain of title that reaches back more than 150
years, the court today announces a rule that will disrupt the
settled expectations of landowners not only in Mississippi but in
every coastal state.''
   O'Connor was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin
Scalia.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Limited the job protection for government workers fired for
lacking security clearances. In a 5-3 ruling involving a fired
laborer at a Navy installation in Washington state, the court
agreed with the Reagan administration that the Merit Systems
Protection Board lacks authority to decide whether denials of
security clearance are justified.
   _Said, 6-2 in a California case, that a criminal suspect's
rights are not violated when a witness who is unable to identify
the suspect in court testifies about an earlier identification of
the accused.
   _In a victory for the states of Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska,
unanimously limited the authority of the interior secretary to
allocate water stored in Missouri River Basin reservoirs.
   _Unanimously ruled in a case from California that businesses may
not be sued in federal court for refusing to contribute to
multi-employer union benefit funds after a collective bargaining
agreement expires.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Thursday,
did not take part in any of the decisions.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences White Man To NAACP Work After Attack on Blacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 21-year-old white man ``taught to hate black
people'' was sentenced Tuesday to perform 200 hours of community
service for the NAACP after he admitted chasing two blacks with a
baseball bat.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Stuart Nudelman said he hoped that by
working with blacks, James Kalafut would overcome his prejudice.
   ``He has been taught to hate black people for some reason,''
Nudelman said after the sentencing. ``I'm trying to put him in an
environment where he can perhaps do some good and learn something
about the people he thinks he hates and perhaps learn that his
feelings are misguided.''
   Kalafut was charged Aug. 16 after he and other whites
brandishing baseball bats, throwing bottles and shouting racial
slurs chased two blacks from a transit stop in Gage Park, a
predominantly white neighborhood on Chicago's Southwest Side.
   The plumbing company laborer could have been sentenced to a year
in prison on his plea of guilty to aggravated assault and ethnic
intimidation, the judge said.
   Kalafut's brother, Larry, is serving a six-year prison term
after pleading guilty to firebombing the home of a black family who
had moved into Gage Park, said Barry Silver, James' attorney.
   Silver said the order for his client to work for National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People is ``a good
sentence given the fxhat he's basically pleaded guilty to
hating a minority group.''
   ``By being with black people, he will have a chance to learn
they are no different than he is except that the color of their
skin is different. I think that is an important lesson for anyone
to learn, especially someone who has been involved in this kind of
activity,'' Silver said.
   The attorney said James Kalafut, who declined to be interviewed,
was willing to give the sentence a try but was ``concerned about
his own personal safety when he is in the neighborhood of the
NAACP,'' located on Chicago's South Side.
   He also said Kalafut was concerned about being rejected by NAACP
officials and being ``made the scapegoat in a sort of reverse
discrimination.''
   The NAACP plans to work hard to make sure that doesn't happen,
said Edward McClellan, president of the group's South Side branch.
   ``Certainly we don't presume there are only white racists or
what have you,'' McClellan said. ``Racism can be engendered by
anyone inclined to that sort of prejudice.''
   He said it wasn't the civil-rights group's job to punish
Kalafut. He also said he wasn't sure what type of work the group
would ask him to perform.
   ``I can only hope his attitude is such that he's willing to come
here and pay his debt to society,'' McClellan said. ``I would hope
that he would have some positive reflections from this experience
that maybe he's been hating the wrong thing.''
   Nudelman said that trying to help Kalafut overcome his prejudice
made more sense than sentencing him to jail, ``where he won't learn
anything except more hatred.''
   But the judge warned, ``If he screws up and doesn't do what he's
supposed to, he'll come back before me and I'll sentence him to
jail.''

<TEXT>
   ABC took the gold for its coverage of the
Winter Olympics, winning the week, moving into the lead in the
February sweeps and taking over second place for the season, ahead
of CBS.
   Olympics events took six places among the top 20 shows, forcing
NBC into second place for the week ending Feb. 21 and for the
sweeps, which help determine the rates local stations charge
advertisers.
   The opening chapter of NBC's much-ballyhooed miniseries ``Noble
House'' ended up 16th. However, it did beat out ABC's Olympics
coverage for Sunday night as well as the CBS movie ``Bring Me the
Head of Dobie Gillis.''
   Coverage of the Olympics in Calgary, Canada, gave ABC its first
weekly victory since Super Bowl Week, ending Jan. 31. Its only
other first place for the season was during the World Series, the
week ending Oct. 25.
   ABC's coverage of the Tuesday night events were first in the
ratings. NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was second and ABC's Saturday
coverage was third. Wednesday's coverage was seventh and Thursday's
was ninth.
   ABC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week with an
average of 19.4. NBC was second with 15.0 and CBS was third with
12.8. The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with television.
   The new season-to-date ratings: NBC 16.3, ABC 13.8, CBS 13.6.
   The Top 10 shows were: ABC's Tuesday Olympics, NBC's ``The Cosby
Show,'' ABC's Saturday Olympics, NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS'
``60 Minutes,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' ABC's Wednesday Olympics, CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote,'' ABC's Thursday Olympics, and NBC's ``Family
Ties'' and ``ALF,'' tied for 10th.
   ABC's evening news show, benefiting from the Olympics
viewership, remained ahead of its rivals with a rating of 12.0. CBS
was second with 11.1 and NBC third with 10.0.
   The lowest-rated network show was CBS' ``48 Hours: Campaign
Trail.'' Here are the five bottom shows in descending order: CBS'
``Houston Knights,'' CBS' ``Ringling Brothers Circus: 20th
Anniversary of the Clown College,'' CBS' ``West 57th Street,''
NBC's ``Decision: 88, New Hampshire,'' and CBS' ``48 Hours:
Campaign Trail.''
   Meanwhile, the Fox Broadcasting Co. was also enjoying good
ratings for its Sunday night shows. ``21 Jump Street'' had its
highest rating to date with 6.6, which would place it ahead of
three network shows. ``Married With Children'' got a 5.7 rating,
its highest ever. That would place it higher than the two bottom
network shows. ``Werewolf'' got its highest rating ever in its 8
o'clock time period, 5.1, which would give it a tie with the
network's' lowest-rated show.

   Adel Ali Massoud said
Tuesday that when soldiers took him to the Mediterranean beach near
his home here, beat him and buried him in the sand, they told him:
``Don't think you are going to return alive.''
   The 18-year-old youth and a Gaza lawyer want to take the army to
court over the brutality Massoud says was inflicted on him. It is
the second time this month Palestinians have reported being buried
alive by soldiers.
   The Israeli army says it is investigating both incidents.
   ``They took me to the beach'' about a mile and a half away,
Massoud said. ``They attached me to a jeep and dragged me behind it
through the sand and the water.''
   Massoud said he saw another youth on the beach, whom he
identified as Saleh Hamad, receiving the same treatement.
   ``They put sand in my mouth and covered me with sand, then they
covered me up, using their hands,'' he said.
   The youth said he did not know how deeply he was buried, but the
weight on his chest was very heavy and he lost consciousness.
   ``The next thing I remember, I was in the hospital,'' he said.
   Lying under a blanket on a mattress spread on the floor of his
spare home in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, the young Palestinian
recounted how Israeli soldiers burst into his home at 4 a.m. Feb.
14.
   ``They used ladders to climb over the wall'' into the tiny
courtyard in front of the house, Massoud said.
   As family members and neighbors began to gather in the small
room, he said: ``I was sleeping, here, like this. I suddenly saw
soldiers. They shined a strong light in my face. They started to
beat me with sticks.''
   The youth said the soldiers put a chain around his neck to raise
him to his feet, beat him to the ground and used the chain to raise
him again.
   Aisha Ali Massoud, 40, mother of Adel and nine other children,
said the soldiers also entered her room. She said about 15 entered
the one-story house.
   Ms. Massoud said soldiers also grabbed her 10-year-old son Sami,
and one of them stuck a gun in Sami's mouth.
   ``I grabbed for him, and they hit me here,'' she said, pointing
to a fading mark on her forehead.
   She said neighbors told her later the soldiers had raided many
houses in the neighborhood, a maze of winding, narrow alleys. They
were looking for teen-aged boys, she said, but her son Adel was the
only one in the area.
   After the soldiers took Adel to the beach, buried him in the
sand and left, families living near the beach rescued him.
   ``Of course I'm angry,'' he said. ``This is no way to treat
people. They told me on the road, on the way to the beach, `Don't
think you are going to return alive.'''
   On Feb. 5, soldiers grabbed four Palestinian youths and covered
them up with a bulldozer in the village of Kfar Salem, near Nablus,
40 miles north of Jerusalem. The army detained two soldiers in the
case, but the investigation is continuing.
   Gaza attorney Mohammed Abu Shaaban wants to press the case in
the Supreme Court in Jerusalem.
   ``I think we will have some problems because he and his family
will be afraid,'' Shaaban said. ``The military police have
threatened people in other cases.''
   The medical report at Khan Yunis' Nasser hospital indicate the
youth was treated in the emergency room but suffered only bruises.
X-rays showed no broken bones. A doctor, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Massoud's family refused to allow him to be
admitted for fear the army would come for him.
   ``We aren't going to court for justice,'' Shaaban said. ``We are
going to court because we know all the newspapers will talk about
it. That's useful. But we know we'll never get justice.''
   The boy's father, Ali Mohammed Massoud, said he too wants to
push the case in the courts, but is afraid.
   ``If we go to court, the next day they will come and beat him,''
the father said. ``Maybe, after it is in the press, I'll discuss it
with the lawyer. ``If it makes trouble for us, we won't do it.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
said Tuesday the Soviet Union has made a ``very clear'' commitment
to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, even though no firm
timetable has been announced.
   U.S. sources said the Red Army had begun preparations to leave.
Soviet soldiers were sent to Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 are in the country helping the Communist
government fight Moslem insurgents.
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials who attended a
closed meeting with Shultz described him as hopeful of a Soviet
withdrawal, but said he did not mention specific evidence that
preparations were under way.
   Shultz told reporters, when asked why he was optimistic about
Soviet intentions: ``Their statements are very clear and very
public and unequivocal, unadorned.''
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said Soviet troops are taking up defensive positions and
dependents are being sent home. He said this was ``solid evidence''
that the Soviet military intervention would end soon.
   The official also said Soviet soldiers are not being replaced
when they finish tours of duty. He spoke on Shultz's flight to
Brussels from two days of talks in Moscow.
   While Shultz was in Brussels, the Kremlin's Warsaw Pact
colleagues were briefed on the Moscow talks by Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister.
   After a 2{-hour meeting with the NATO allies, Shultz flew to
Washington to prepare for a trip Wednesday to the Middle East,
where he will meet with Arab and Israeli leaders about efforts to
revive peace negotiations.
   In his remarks to reporters, Shultz said he had encountered
``intense skepticism'' about the chances of a breakthrough on
Middle East negotiations, but the United States has ``a few ideas''
that could help end the deadlock. He was not more specific.
   ``I believe that if there are chances, even if the chances are
small, it's worthwhile trying,'' he said. ``You can't be too afraid
of failing.''
   Europeans who attended the NATO meeting said the allies praised
Shultz and the Reagan administration for making an effort on Middle
East peace.
   ``There was the feeling expressed that of course the situation
appears deadlocked, but that nonetheless it would be worth trying
now,'' one said, on condition that his name not be given.
   Shultz said a complete Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan would
boost prospects for resolving other regional issues.
   ``I certainly have the sense ... that they do regard their
presence in Afghanistan as counterproductive at this point and they
would like to leave,'' he said.
   On Feb. 8, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered to begin
the withdrawal May 15 if Pakistan and Afghanistan reach agreement
by March 15 in U.N.-sponsored negotiations that resume in Geneva
next week. He said the pullout could be accomplished in 10 months.
   Kremlin officials have accused Pakistan of obstructing a
settlement by insisting an interim government be created in Kabul
to prevent protracted civil strife. About 3.5 million Afghan
refugees have fled to neighboring Pakistan, which is eager for a
solution.
   Shultz told the NATO allies the Soviets decided to withdraw
because they realized they could not defeat the guerrillas, who get
much of their support from the United States.
   The secretary also reported progress on arms control in his
Moscow talks with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze.
   On Monday, U.S. and Soviet negotiators were directed to prepare
within a month three draft agreements for a treaty to reduce
long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50
percent.
   Draft accords on verification, disposing of weapons and exchange
of information are to be ready for the next Shultz-Shevardnadze
meeting, March 22-23 in Washington. The goal is for Gorbachev and
President Reagan to sign the final treaty at a summit in Moscow
late this spring.

   Cities may not promote equal opportunity by
imposing blanket restrictions that force private clubs to admit
women and racial minorities as members, the Supreme Court was told
Tuesday.
   Alan Mansfield, a lawyer for the New York State Clubs
Association, said such a New York City law violates ``the
fundamental right of our citizens ... to choose who their friends
will be.''
   But Peter L. Zimroth, the city's chief lawyer, said the clubs
affected by the law are not intimate associations but bastions of
the ``old-boy'' network where business deals are consummated.
   Citing the example of the 10,003-member New York Athletic Club,
Zimroth asked the justices, ``Can you imagine someone saying `Here
are 10,002 of my most intimate friends.'''
   The court seemed to be confused by the widely varying views
expressed by Mansfield and Zimroth about the law and a ruling by
New York's highest state court upholding it.
   The justices' decision, expected by July, could carry an impact
well beyond New York's borders. At least five other major cities _
Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and San Francisco _ have
enacted similar ordinances recently.
   The New York City law banning discrimination by public
accommodations exempts ``distinctly private organizations.''
   But it deprives non-religious groups of that designation if they
have more than 400 members, provide regular meal service and
regularly get their members' dues paid by non-members such as the
members' employers.
   Mansfield said the city law wrongly treats any organization that
meets the three criteria as non-private. ``Three prongs and you're
out,'' he said. ``This law incorporates a fundamentally incorrect
analysis of the freedom to associate.''
   Mansfield said each club affected by the law should have a
chance to prove that, even if it meets each of the three criteria,
it is a truly private entity.
   Zimroth said no such club has come forward. ``I don't think this
is a real case,'' he said. ``The city council wasn't talking about
hypothetical clubs. It was talking about real clubs.''
   Both lawyers were interrupted repeatedly by questions from the
bench during the 60-minute argument session.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Thursday
and only recently resigned from a men-only, whites-only club in San
Francisco, appeared troubled by the fact that the law also exempts
certain ``benevolent orders'' such as the Masons, Loyal Order of
Moose, Protective Order of Elks and the Knights of Columbus.
   Mansfield argued that treating various private organizations
differently violates equal-protection guarantees.
   Zimroth said New York City officials were not concerned about
such organizations being used as extensions of the business office.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who recently resigned from a men-only
club in the nation's capital, did not ask a question.
   One of the more animated exchanges occurred when Justice
Thurgood Marshall suggested that the challenged law was a valid
civil rights measure and then said to Mansfield, ``You want to
torpedo it.''

   The U.N. Command rejected North Korean
charges Tuesday it is building up forces for a nuclear attack and
it demanded the communist nation admit it ordered the bombing of a
civilian airliner.
   The United Nations Command dismissed a North Korean demand that
the United States and South Korea call off joint military
exercises, called ``Team Spirit.'' It accused North Korea of
fomenting tension on the divided Korean peninsula and trying to
sabotage the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.
   The United States maintains 40,000 troops in South Korea and
heads the command, which represents the 16 nations that fought
under U.N. auspices against North Korea and China during the Korean
War.
   ``Don't miscalculate ... the will of the world to react, with
appropriate action, to continued barbaric acts of terrorism which
result in the deaths of innocent people,'' said U.S. Rear Adm.
William T. Pendley, the chief U.N. Command delegate.
   Pendley demanded North Korea punish those involved in the
bombing last November of a South Korean airliner and apologize to
the world. All 115 people aboard the Korean Air jet were killed
when it blew up Nov. 29 over the Andaman Sea near Burma.
   Chief North Korean delegate Maj. Gen. Li Tae Ho said Pyongyang
had nothing to do with the attack and charged South Korea with
destroying the plane in a scheme to retain power and discredit the
north.
   The charges were made at the first meeting of the Military
Armistice Commission since the loss of the plane. The commission
polices the ceasefire that ended the Korean War between north and
south in 1953.
   North Korea called the meeting to demand the United States and
South Korea abandon the annual ``Team Spirit'' exercises that start
next month, charging the exercises were preparations for an
American nuclear attack.
   ``You have nuclear war plans worked out,'' Li charged.
   Pendley dismissed the North Korean accusations and said the
exercises were lawful military activities intended to guarantee the
safety of South Korea.
   The U.N. Command's delegation presented a videotape of a
televised confession last month in Seoul by Kim Hyon Hui, a woman
who claimed she was a North Korean agent and destroyed the plane to
disrupt the Olympic Games that start in Seoul in September.
   Ms. Kim, who rode an early leg of the KAL flight, took poison
along with a male companion when they were detained in Bahrain. The
man died but she recovered.
   Pendley said the confession was damning evidence that the north
could not refute. ``You thought you had committed the perfect
crime, but, like all criminals, you made a mistake,'' he said.
   North Korea has been demanding to be a co-host of the Olympic
Games. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have
rejected the demand.

   While hundreds of University of
Massachusetts students discussed racism in class, a small group at
neighboring Hampshire College on Tuesday occupied a dormitory
office to protest racial attitudes at that elite school.
   The takeover came nearly a week after the end of a six-day
occupation of a University of Massachusetts building by more than
100 people protesting racial violence on campus.
   That occupation ended when protesters reached an agreement with
the chancellor, Joseph Duffey, which included increased hiring of
minority faculty and staff.
   Penny Premdas, a spokeswoman for the Hampshire group, Students
of Underrepresented Cultures, said up to 40 students occupied the
office of the Dakin House dormitory, a traditional meeting place
for minority students, at 8 a.m. to work on a list of demands,
including that an office in the dormitory be converted into a Third
World cultural center.
   ``We have been to the administration several times over the past
three years with our demands and concerns and nothing has been
done,'' said Ms. Premdas, who is black. ``It's been all lip
service. It seemed this was the only way to get something done.''
   Unlike the University of Massachusetts, which has been the scene
of attacks on blacks, ``We have never had any blatant physical
harassment here,'' Ms. Premdas said. ``It has all been emotional
and mental and institutional.''
   A Dakin House resident, Marston Chickering, said the occupation
was ``particularly hard at this school, which has an image of being
politically correct and aware.''
   ``No one's ever satisfied at this school,'' said Karen Bagninm,
a freshman from New York City who lives across the yard from Dakin.
``Everyone's always feeling belittled or discriminated against. If
it's not minorities, it's females ... this is what they (the
protesters) feel they have to do to get attention.''
   About 100 of the 1,100 undergraduate students at the private
college are minorities, said Petez Gluckler, a spokesman for the
administration.
   A consultant hired by the school last year to investigate racial
attitudes on campus is preparing his final report, Gluckler said.
   The school planned to provide the protesters with food and
sleeping bags, said Hampshire spokeswoman Lee Wicks.
   Hundreds of students at the 25,000-student University of
Massachusetts campus across town from Hampshire attended class
discussions on racism on Tuesday.
   At least 35 classes were devoted to the topic in response to a
call by the Graduate Student Association to boycott all classes
Tuesday and Wednesday in lieu of forums on racism, said school
spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins.
   Duffey had warned in a statement against students boycotting
classes and had suggested that racism discussions be held in
classes.

   William L. Ball III, President Reagan's new
choice to pilot the Navy through the shoals of Pentagon budget
cutbacks, was described Tuesday as savvy coalition builder with
years of experience at the White House and Capitol Hill.
   ``All of us who know him here at the White House know that the
Navy is getting a strong advocate and a strong fighter,'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in announcing Reagan's
decision to nominate Ball.
   Ball, a stocky, 39-year-old who has served as the president's
chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill since 1986, was tapped Tuesday to
succeed James H. Webb as secretary of the Navy.
   Webb abruptly handed in his resignation Monday after accusing
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci of scuttling administration
dreams for a 600-ship Navy.
   Fitzwater, a long-time friend of Ball's, described him as ``the
kind of guy who knows how to build coalitions and work with people.
... He has a great love and respect for the Navy and he knows how
to get things done.''
   The spokesman said Webb's resignation had caught the
administration by surprise, but that Ball was easily recognized as
a top candidate for the job due to naval, congressional and White
House experience.
   ``He's a known quantity. Everyone instantly recognized him as
the perfect choice,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Ball earned Carlucci's respect in the wake of
the Iran-Contra affair, when the legislative liaison helped the
former national security adviser forge a new relationship with
Congress and its intelligence oversight committees. Ball also
worked with Carlucci on the formulation of the latest budget
policies, Fitzwater said.
   ``He earned Frank's respect. ... He knows intimately the
problems Frank is facing,'' the spokesman observed.
   Fitzwater said the South Carolina native has a ``wry sense of
humor'' and ``is personable and savvy'' when it comes to working
with Congress and the military.
   ``He should have no problems,'' the spokesman predicted.
   Prior to working in the White House, Ball was assistant
secretary of state for legislative and intergovernmental affairs.
   In 1981, he served as the chief clerk of the Senate Armed
Services Committee. Earlier, he had worked as the administrative
assistant for former Sens. Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., and John Tower,
R-Texas.
   Ball was commissioned as a regular officer in the Navy in 1969
and served three years aboard the guided missile destroyer USS
Sellers, followed by three years of service in the Department of
the Navy.
   He graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a
degree in industrial management.
   Ball is married to the former Patricia Adkins of Memphis, Tenn.,
and has two daughters.

<TEXT>
   ``People's Court'' Judge Joseph Wapner's word
is the law on television, but not necessarily off camera, where the
popular show's lawyers have agreed to pay a $2,500 settlement to a
man the judge ruled against.
   The show's producers said the $2,500, awarded to 72-year-old
former Mr. America Rex Ravelle, marked the first time the judge has
settled out of court with someone who has sued over a TV decision.
   ``The judge's decision was so bad it was unbelievable,'' said
Ravelle, who had sought $2,000 in back rent and return of a bedroom
set he said was taken by a woman he evicted from his house.
   Ravelle said in a recent interview that he was set up to look
like a bully and a buffoon and then Wapner ruled against him for
dramatic effect when the show was taped Dec. 4, 1985.
   ``I was instructed to project my voice and assert myself, while
the defendant was submissive and scarcely audible,'' Ravelle said.
``This obvious ploy clearly established me as the big, macho
villain.''
   Wapner said he couldn't recall Ravelle's case and was unaware of
the settlement, but added he tries to be fair to all people on the
show.
   ``I try to be fair, and our track record is there,'' said
Wapner, former presiding judge of Los Angeles Superior Court. ``I
try to make sure that each side gets a fair shot.''
   Ravelle, who had sued the show for $1 million, agreed to drop
the suit in exchange for the settlement last week.
   Of approximately 2,000 small claims cases Wapner has heard
during the show's seven years, Ravelle is one of only three
disgruntled litigants to sue, said James B. Pollock, vice president
for Ralph Edwards Productions, the show's producer. He is the only
one to win a settlement, Pollock added.
   Participants on ``People's Court'' are selected from among those
who file for damages in small claims courts in 36 Southern
California localities. Since files are open to the public,
researchers can read cases and get in touch with those filing
claims. Those selected after phone interviews appear for personal
interviews and are selected by producers for the program.
   All participants volunteer to take part and sign papers making
it legally binding under California's law on arbitration. Wapner
has a private arbitration practice.

<TEXT>
   The executive staff of the U.S. Bureau
of Prisons has decided federal inmates should not have the
privilege of begetting children through artificial insemination.
   If such a police were allowed, the government believes ``that
numerous other inmates from regular prison institutions of all
security levels would desire to beget children,'' according to the
government's response filed Monday in the case of a federal
prisoner.
   The response was filed Monday in the case of Steven James
Goodwin, 31, a prisoner in the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners
in Springfield.
   Goodwin had filed a lawsuit against the government and received
a favorable ruling from U.S. Magistrate James England. The judge
recommended in November that U.S. District Judge William R.
Collison rule that the bureau's lack of a policy on artificial
insemination isn't a constitutionally sufficient reason to prohibit
the procedure.
   Goodwin had asked in his lawsuit that doctors be allowed to
collect his sperm at the prison so it could be frozen and sent to
his wife's doctor in St. Louis.
   The executive staff of the bureau met earlier this month to
consider a policy on the issue, Assistant U.S. Attorney David C.
Jones said in the government's response.
   If the procedure were allowed in one case, all 48 federal
prisons would be affected. The prisons either would have to develop
collecting, handling and storage procedures for semen, or private
medical personnel would have to be allowed into the institutions,
Jones said.
   As result, the response said, the bureau believes the situation
could be extremely costly or create substantial security risks.
   The government disagreed with England's ruling that begetting or
bearing children is a fundamental right that survives
incarceration. Actually, begetting or bearing children is one of
the many rights that is restricted by imprisonment, Jones said.
   Goodwin is serving a 14-year sentence on a charge of conspiracy
to distribute cocaine.

<TEXT>
   Eighty-seven firefighters who had been
on duty for more than three days were sent home Tuesday as
colleagues ended a sickout and returned to work under threats of
contempt of court citations.
   More than 100 firefighters called in sick Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, despite a judge's order Saturday that they report for duty.
   Thirty-three firefighters who defied the order were held in
contempt Tuesday by another judge, Americo Campanella of Superior
Court, for failure to show up in court to explain why they were
absent.
   The firefighters had been served notice by the city to appear in
court on Monday.
   Campanella's ruling stunned attorneys for Local 799 of the
International Association of Firefighters. They told Campanella it
was their impression he only wanted union president Leo J. Miller
and secretary-treasurer Richard Kless in court.
   Attorney Harry J. Hoopis said he thought his representation of
the union membership as a whole, as well as Miller's, was good
enough to constitute the presence of the absent members.
   Campanella, who continued the hearing on the status of the rest
of the firefighters who called in sick, said he would decide later
what penalty to assess against the 33.
   Mayor Joseph R. Paolino urged that no jail time be imposed.
However, the city continued to press for contempt citations, even
though the sickout ended with the start of Tuesday's day shift, to
prevent something similar from happening in the future, according
to city labor attorney Vincent Ragosta Jr.
   The sickout, which the city is trying to prove is an illegal job
action by municipal employees, cost the city about $84,000 in
overtime and related expenses, estimated Fire Chief Michael F.
Moise.
   It also meant a long haul for firefighters who went to work at 6
p.m. Friday. Moise kept them on duty through the sickout, but they
went home Tuesday.
   The sickout apparently stemmed from a dispute over language in a
contract ratified by firefighters in December but yet to be
approved by the City Council.
   Miller contends the city is trying to renege on a provision that
calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit.
Union members also say the city is not replacing worn-out or
damaged equipment as promised.

   Then-FBI Director William Webster was kept
unaware of problems with a probe of anti-Reagan activists, even
when it became clear that some agents were investigating legitimate
protest activities, a top agency official said Tuesday.
   Oliver B. Revell, executive assistant FBI director, also told
the Senate Intelligence Committee that no one in the administration
told the bureau to conduct the investigation.
   Revell's testimony offered the first in-depth look at the FBI's
investigations of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador, or CISPES, which began in 1981 and ended in 1985. Leaders
of CISPES maintain that the inquiries were politically motivated,
but Revell denied that charge.
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. ``We have
investigated a number of groups on the other side of the political
spectrum. ...
   ``The focus of the FBI investigations has been and is
criminality, or the collection of intelligence which will keep our
nation and citizens safe from terrorism,'' he said.
   At another point, Revell said, ``I have no knowledge of any
political taskings by anyone in the Reagan administration of the
FBI's CISPES investigation.''
   No criminal charges ever have been filed against CISPES or any
of its members.
   Several members of the committee told Revell they remained
skeptical of the FBI information that triggered the investigation
of CISPES.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he had ``grave questions'' about
Revell's justifications, adding, ``You have to proceed on the basis
of tangible hard facts and evidence'' _ which he indicated were
lacking in this case.
   But Revell noted that it was a terrorism investigation, and
added that if the FBI always waited ``until there was tangible
evidence, you would have been picking up the pieces of the bombs.''
   Earlier, Specter asked Revell the extent of Webster's
involvement in the CISPES probe.
   ``He was aware of several cables sent to him for informational
purposes,'' Revell said. ``He did not authorize any of the
activities. The supervision was at the sectional level.''
   Revell added that it is impossible for the FBI director to keep
up with all the investigations the bureau conducts. However, he did
say that in the wake of revelations about the conduct of the CISPES
case, ``we have taken interim steps to increase the level of
review'' of sensitive probes.
   Webster, who now directs the CIA, has had no public comment on
the investigation.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of the intelligence
panel, joined Specter in criticizing the FBI probe.
   ``It is apparent that whatever the rationale for its initiation,
it resulted in the FBI subjecting many Americans and U.S.
organizations to various types of scrutiny without any basis other
than the exercise of their First Amendment rights,'' Cohen said.
   He later asked Revell why the FBI headquarters had to send a
memo on July 26, 1984, cautioning the field offices against
reporting legitimate political activities by CISPES.
   Revell replied that the memo was sent because top FBI officials
``sensed'' the conduct of some agents was ``very close to the
line.''
   ``We may have seen some wavering over that line,'' he said, but
he maintained that the investigation was legitimate under the FBI's
foreign intelligence and counterintelligence guidelines.
   Revell said the FBI opened its investigation into CISPES on
Sept. 3, 1981, after the Justice Department requested the bureau
examine whether the group was supplying money and material to
leftist rebels in El Salvador and therefore was required to
register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
   Revell described that probe as ``just a records check,'' and it
was closed in February 1982.
   A little more than a year later, on March 30, 1983, the
counterterrorism section at the FBI authorized a new investigation
of CISPES. This probe, Revell said, was into whether members of
CISPES were ``engaged in international terrorism, activities in
preparation therefor, or knowingly aiding and abetting the
terrorists in El Salvador and other countries in the conduct of
international terrorist activities.''
   That investigation continued for more than two years, during
which time, Revell said, ``we did find indications that some CISPES
members were at least discussing and planning violence.''
   He cited an instance of a CISPES member given the job of
determining response times of emergency services in a major
American city, another of a CISPES member saying he had developed a
system to shut down a public utility in a major Midwestern city and
a third of discussion of plans to disrupt the 1984 Republican
Convention in Dallas.
   Angela Sanbrano, executive director of CISPES, who attended the
Intelligence Committee hearing, denied afterward that any of the
charges were true. She suggested that the comments about possible
violent activities might have been made by someone ``planted'' at
CISPES meetings.
   Revell said the FBI closed the investigation in June 1985 ``when
we found there was insufficient evidence to continue the
investigation.''
   He said ``part of the reason for that was the disinformation and
misinformation supplied to us'' by Frank Varelli, who told a House
subcommittee last year hat he was paid by the FBI to infiltrate the
Dallas chapter of CISPES and told the bureau what it wanted to hear.
   Revell said earlier that the Dallas FBI agent who directed
Varelli was investigated for ``mishandling documents, funds and
direction.''
   Varelli has sued the FBI in an attempt to get pay he claims he
is owed for his work.

<HEAD>Orders To Factories Fell 2.8 Percent In January</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods fell 2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a
year, reflecting sharp drops in demand for aircraft and primary
metals, the government reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods fell
to a seasonally adjusted $112.23 billion last month, a drop of
$3.28 billion from December.
   The steep decline, only the third setback in the past 13 months,
followed a big December advance of 4.1 percent, the strongest rise
since March.
   Analysts said the January setback reflected a return to more
normal levels of demand in both aircraft and primary metals, two
categories which had seen unusually big advances in December.
   Both the Reagan administration and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan noted that the overall decline also masked pockets of
strength, particularly in non-defense capital goods.
   ``The numbers that were released on durable goods, if one
subtracts some of the temporary fluctuations, were really quite
strong,'' Greenspan said during an appearance before a House
Banking subcommittee.
   Many economists are predicting that growth will slow in the
first half of 1988 because of an unusually high buildup of unsold
inventories which occurred at the end of 1987. But Greenspan said
he did not think this slowdown would deteriorate into a recession,
in part because of the strength being shown in manufacturing.
   ``While we envisage sluggish growth for the period immediately
ahead, there just are very few signs that we're about to tilt
over'' into a recession, Greenspan said.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that the administration continues to believe that the trend in
manufacturing ``is still healthy.''
   The administration is forecasting that half of overall growth
this year will come from rising factory production.
   Private economists said they were not alarmed by the January
setback, which was the biggest drop since an 8 percent fall in
January 1987. They pointed to a 1.6 percent increase in orders for
non-defense capital goods, the category which reflects business
plans to expand production facilities.
   ``That is an encouraging sign that businessmen are not backing
off from their investment plans,'' said David Wyss, an economist
with Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass.
   Even with the setback last month, new orders were still 15.5
percent ahead of a year ago, reflecting the strong export demand
caused by the decline in the value of the dollar.
   Demand in transportation industries fell by 12.4 percent to
$27.21 billion last month following an 8.6 percent advance in
December, a surge which was attributed primarily to new aircraft
orders placed with the Boeing Co. of Seattle.
   Orders for primary metals fell 15.5 percent to $10.19 billion
after having shot up 10.5 percent in December. Analysts said that
the big December jump in orders came because of fears of pending
price increases.
   Demand for military hardware fell 12.1 percent in January to
$7.86 billion.
   Orders for electrical machinery rose 5.5 percent in January
while demand for non-electrical machinery rose 5.8 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 3.3 percent to $109.26 billion
following a 4.3 percent increase in December.

<TEXT>
   Israel's parliament on Tuesday elected
Irish-born Chaim Herzog to a second five-year term as the country's
president.
   Eighty-two members of the 120-member Knesset, or parliament,
voted to re-elect Herzog, who was unopposed. Two voted against him
and 18 did not vote, Israel radio reported. Other members were not
present.
   The office of president is a largely ceremonial one in Israel
and the president has no formal party affiliation.
   ``I heartily thank the members of Israeli Knesset for their
trust and their vote and (I) accept the Knesset's decision with
appreciation and gratitude,'' he said on Israel radio. ``I am proud
to serve the people.''
   Herzog, 69, was first elected to the post in March 1983.
   His first term in office was marked by a controversial decision
to pardon Shin Bet security agents, including the former head of
the service, Avraham Shalom, who were found guilty of lying in
court about the beating deaths of two captured Palestinian
hijackers.
   Herzog was criticized for the decision, but won praise when he
took a strong moral stand against a ring of Jewish terrorists
jailed for crimes against Arabs. He rejected a call from right-wing
Israelis to pardon all of them, although he did lessen the
sentences of some.
   Herzog was also praised for his behind-the-scenes efforts to end
an election stalemate in September 1984 between Shimon Peres'
centrist Labor Party and Yitzhak Shamir's conservative Likud bloc.
His efforts contributed to the forming of Israel's unusual
coalition government.
   Herzog headed Israel's military intelligence from 1959 to 1962.
In 1967, he became the first military governor of the occupied West
Bank, captured by Israel from Jordan in that year's Middle East
war. He also served as Israel's ambassador at the United Nations
from 1975 to 1978.

   A British soldier sentenced to
life in prison for slaying a Belfast Catholic has been released
from jail and returned to his regiment after only three years in
prison, the army said Tuesday.
   Pvt. Ian Richard Thain was not, however, returned to active
service in Northern Ireland.
   An army statement Tuesday said Thain killed the man when he was
18.
   ``While the army in no way condones his action, we consider the
incident to have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young
man in very difficult circumstances,'' the statement said.
   The Rev. Denis Faul, a Roman Catholic priest and human rights
campaigner in Northern Ireland, said he had no objection to the
release, but asked why similar clemency could not be shown to
civilians serving life sentences for actions committed in their
youth.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, claimed Thain's release showed there was no
justice in Northern Ireland.
   ``I'm very, very shocked and distressed. I can't believe this
has happened,'' said the victim's father, Jim Reilly.
   The announcement of Thain's release came amid new tension
between Britain and Ireland.
   On Sunday, a Catholic was killed by a British soldier in
Northern Ireland. The Irish government announced it would undertake
its own investigation of the slaying, even though the incident
occurred in Northern Ireland outside Dublin's jurisdiction.
   The Irish move was seen as a calculated slight to Britain, since
its police force has already announced its own inquiry and the
soldier has been placed in military custody.
   Sunday's shooting of 23-year-old Aidan McAnespie occurred near
Aughnacloy, half a mile from the frontier in County Tyrone.
   McAnespie was killed by a bullet from an army observation tower
at a checkpoint as he walked to a football match.
   McAnespie was a Sinn Fein supporter, and his former parish
priest said he was harassed whenever he passed through the
checkpoint. Press Association, the British news agency, said the
soldier who fired at McAnespie told his interrogators it was an
accident.
   Thain was convicted of killing Thomas Reilly, road manager of
the pop group Bananarama, on Aug. 9, 1983. He claimed in court that
he fired because he believed Reilly was about to pull a gun on him.
   The judge found Thain ``deliberately untruthful.'' The private
was the first soldier sentenced to life imprisonment for actions in
Northern Ireland.
   Thain was released on a life license, a form of parole whereby
he can be reimprisoned ``should his behavior give rise to
concern,'' the Home Office said.
   It said he was freed after a review by the state parole board.
   Anglo-Irish relations are already under strain on a series of
issues including disputes over the extradition of IRA suspects and
British anti-terrorism laws which Dublin sees as discriminatory
toward Ulster Catholics.
   The worst tension, however, is being generated by Britain's
announcement last month that it will not prosecute Northern Ireland
police officers involved in the shooting of six unarmed Catholics
in three incidents in 1982, despite evidence of a police conspiracy
to pervert the course of justice.

<TEXT>
   A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III
from his friend E. Robert Wallach broached a proposal to bolster
Israel's moderate Labor Party against the rival Likud bloc.
   In his September 1985 memo, made public Monday, Wallach stressed
the need to encourage Soviet leaders to allow greater Jewish
emigration to Israel because Russian Jews, once they are voters in
Israel, tend to support the Labor Party.
   Israel contends that 400,000 Jews want to emigrate from the
Soviet Union _ enough to make a difference in an Israeli election,
if all were allowed to resettle in Israel.
   Wallach's idea was based on the assumption that Israel would
call early elections no later than March 1986, but it is unclear
whether an influx of Russian Jews could have brought about a Labor
victory. No election was held, and in October 1986, then-Prime
Minister Shimon Peres switched jobs with Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir in a power-sharing arrangement.
   ``There is a need to provide Israel with a increasing flow of
Ashkenazi Jews to help balance the influx of Sephardic-Oriental
Jews who have a natural affinity and affiliation with Likud,''
Wallach wrote.
   ``From the standpoint of American interests, the advantage is
evident,'' he added without elaboration.
   Ashkenazi Jews are those whose origins are in Europe, while
Sephardic Jews came from Asia and Africa. Voter breakdown shows
that Sephardim, who constitute some 60 percent of Israel's 3.5
million Jewish population, tend to support Likud more than they do
Labor.
   U.S. leaders in the past have said privately they feel more
comfortable with Labor, which exhibits greater willingness to cede
lands to Israel's Arab neighbors in return for a peace settlement.
Likud is more hardline, refusing any territorial concessions.
   But publicly, the United States has consistently veered away
from taking any stand that could be viewed as interference in
internal Israeli politics.
   The Wallach-Meese memo is the focal point of a criminal
investigation of the attorney general. At issue is whether Meese
knew, from reading the memo, of a plan to pay a bribe to the Labor
Party, and, if so, why he did nothing about it.
   Wallach wrote that his business associate, Israeli-born oilman
Bruce Rappaport, had commissioned several public opinion polls that
indicated a ``high probability'' of early elections and growing
support for Labor.
   Rappaport, who resides in Switzerland and is a generous
contributor to the Labor Party, confirmed an arrangement with Peres
that Israel would receive some $700 million over 10 years from the
pipeline that would pass near the Israeli border on its way from
Iraq to the Red Sea port of Aqaba.
   ``What was also indicated to me ... is that a portion of those
fund will go directly to Labor,'' Wallach wrote.
   The emigration issue, as outlined by Wallach, revolves around
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's promise to Peres to consider
increasing emigration levels if the Jews went directly to Israel
rather than to the United States, Wallach said.
   The United States has refused to take any stand in support of
direct Soviet emigration to Israel, saying it was up to the Jews to
decide where they want to live.

   Mayor Raymond Flynn sought the approval of the
City Council on Tuesday for an experiment to provide sterile
needles to drug addicts in an effort to curb the spread of AIDS.
   Drug-users would make periodic visits to facilities yet to be
established for the program and would get up to seven marked
needles each time, depending on how many they returned from the
previous visit.
   When entering the program, addicts would be offered a place, if
available, at a drug treatment center. Rejected offers would be
renewed periodically.
   ``No one initiative to contain the virus can be the answer,
other than finding a vaccine or a cure for the disease itself,''
said Flynn, in a prepared statement at a closed morning meeting
attended by city councilors.
   Conventional anti-drug measures ``do not go far enough in the
short term'' to curb the spread of AIDS, he said.
   Addicts, their sex partners and their babies ``are the fastest
growing group of AIDS victims,'' Flynn said.
   Among the 1,230 Massachusetts AIDS cases reported so far, about
20 percent have involved intravenous drug users. More than 25
percent of Boston's estimated 14,000 intravenous drug addicts are
thought to be infected with the virus already, state officials said.
   Council President Christopher Iannella is expected to assign the
measure to a council committee for review at the council meeting
Wednesday, according to Flynn spokesman Arthur Jones.
   Flynn also is seeking City Council's approval of a petition to
the state Legislature to by-pass state laws against possession of
hypodermic syringes by drug addicts or against dispensing such
equipment to drug addicts.
   Reaction was mixed among city councilors. Some like Councilor
David Scondras, said after the meeting Tuesday that he backed the
plan because ``my instincts tell me this is a medical crisis and
(politicians) should not stand in the way of what a doctor
prescribes for a patient.''
   Councilor James Kelly said he has ``strong objections.''
   ``First, I don't think the city should be giving the appearance
that we're condoning drug use, which we clearly are,'' said Kelly.
``Second, I don't think it'll work.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has opposed any needle exchange program
and so does state Public Health Commissioner Deborah Prothrow-Stith.
   ``I don't think we ought to be encouraging people to shoot up
with heroin. I am against it,'' Dukakis told a news conference
Tuesday. ``If we can get people into methadone maintenance
programs, needles cease to be a factor. And that is a much, much
better to deal with this, in addition to treatment.''
   Last month, the state of New York announced a plan to distribute
free needles to drug addicts in New York City.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which has no known cure,
has been found to be spread through sharing of infected intravenous
needles as well as through sexual contact. It damages the body's
immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   As of Jan. 4, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta had
received reports of 50,265 Americans with AIDS, 28,149 of whom had
died.

   A Delta Air Lines jetliner bound from Boston to
Salt Lake City made an emergency landing Tuesday at O'Hare
International Airport after the flight crew shut down one engine, a
federal aviation official said.
   Delta Flight 235, a Boeing 757 flying from Boston to Salt Lake
City with 127 people on board, made an unscheduled landing at
O'Hare at 9:22 a.m. CST, said Marjorie Kriz, a spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   No injuries were reported, she said. The jetliner landed safely
and taxied on its own to a terminal, she said.
   ``They're designed to fly on one engine,'' Ms. Kriz said.
   The plane's 120 passengers and seven crew members remained on
board while repairs were made, and the craft left for Salt Lake
about 11:20 a.m., said Delta spokeswoman Christa Anderson.
   The crew shut down the engine as a precaution because an
indicator gauge showed low oil pressure, said a Delta official
reached at the company's marketing office in suburban Schaumburg.
   The official, who declined to be identified, said that the
incident would not be termed an emergency landing and that the
passengers were never in danger.

   The active-duty strength of the nation's
military services in January was virtually unchanged from the
previous month but more than 12,000 below the same period last
year, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   As of Jan. 31, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force had
2,167,378 men and women on active duty, up 767 from Dec. 31 figure.
   That combined total represents a decrease of 12,023, however,
compared with the Jan. 31, 1987, tally. The armed services reported
active-duty strength of 2,179,401 a year ago.
   It is not unusual for military strength to swing up and down on
a monthly basis during the year, primarily because of differences
in the flow of new recruits. The strength totals are expected to
vary even more widely than normal this year, though, because the
Pentagon is reducing its active-duty strength in a budget-cutting
move.
   According to the latest ``Military Strength'' assessment, two of
the four armed services reported declines in personnel in January
from December.
   The Marine Corps reported 198,243 men and women on active duty,
down 194 from December. The Air Force reported 604,574, down 755.
   The Army had an active-duty strength of 778,835 as of Jan. 31,
up 1,155 from December. And the Navy reported 585,726 on active
duty last month, up 561 from December.

<TEXT>
   Western nations are luring away tens of
thousands of Poland's most skilled professionals, causing a costly
``brain drain'' of its best and brightest young people, the
government charged Tuesday.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the West is cashing in on
Poland's costly investment in education and threatening to prolong
his country's economic crisis.
   He said more than 500,000 Poles emigrated to the West between
1983 and 1987, including nearly 60,000 university graduates. The
losses include 19,000 engineers, 5,500 physicians, 4,800 economists
and 4,000 scientists.
   ``There is a brain drain in the Western emigration policy'' that
makes it difficult for unskilled workers to remain abroad but which
``eagerly retains experts in demanded specialties,'' Urban said.
   ``The rich West, which is criticizing socialism, is sucking from
Poland a part of socialism's achievement,'' he said. ``We are
suffering these losses in favor of countries which in general ...
are very reluctant to undertake economic cooperation with Poland
which would back our reforms.''.
   The educations of the doctors and engineers who have fled the
country between 1983 and 1987 is about $100 million, Urban said.
   Urban's comments, read from a text at the beginning of his
weekly news conference, mirrored charges made in November by Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   In an interview with NBC News, Gorbachev replied to a question
on the Soviet policy toward Jewish emigration by saying U.S.
officials are trying to solve their problems by ``organizing a
brain drain from the Soviet Union.''
   Urban did not specify what steps the government might take to
stem the wave of emigration, saying he was only appealing to all
Poles to express their views on a problem ``for which there is no
simple remedy.''
   Urban did say that Western countries should take the
consequences of the brain drain into consideration ``in balancing
mutal economic relations and commitments,'' an apparent reference
to Poland's efforts to obtain new economic credits and a favorable
debt payment rescheduling from its Western creditors.
   Urban's remarks reflect growing concern in the country to the
large numbers of young professionals fleeing the country's economic
crisis for greener pastures in the United States, West Germany,
Italy and France, among other countries.
   Last month, a joint government and Roman Catholic Church
commission expressed concern about what it called an ``alarming
phenomenon'' and called for measures to convince young Poles that
they can satisfy their aspirations in their native country.
   Official newspapers have printed articles about emigration,
including letters from young professionals explaining why they want
to leave. Government polls have shown that more than half Poland's
youth would like to stay in the West to work for two years or more.
   Emigration has grown since the lifting of martial law in 1983,
when the government liberalized regulations for obtaining a
passport to travel abroad. Urban said Poles made 4.2 million trips
to Western countries from 1983-87.
   He said those staying abroad were motivated by economic rather
than political reasons, describing their attitude as
``mean-spirited ... turning the back on the homeland instead of
working in favor of improving living conditions.''
   But he added the government did not intend to withdraw from its
liberalized passport policy.
   Some Soviet bloc countries, such as Romania, have demanded that
would-be emigres repay the cost of their education before departing.
   From 1983 to 1987, Urban said, 58,500 people emigrated legally
from Poland, including 5,000 university graduates.
   Another 117,000 people, including 16,500 university graduates,
traveled to the West on business or tourist trips and then stayed
permanently abroad without consent of Polish authorities.
   He said 328,000 people, including 38,000 with university
degrees, extended their stay abroad, although many were expected to
return to Poland, he said.

   Bruce Smart, the Commerce Department's top
trade official since mid-1985, is resigning to return to the
private sector, officials announced Monday.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said the departure resulted
from a ``difference of management styles'' between the two men.
   Smart had been one of the leading candidates to become commerce
secretary when Malcolm Baldrige was killed in a horse riding
accident last summer. However, President Reagan chose Verity for
the job. Verity took office on Oct. 19.
   Smart had served as undersecretary for international affairs
since July 1985. He reportedly had been in line to take over the
No. 2 job at the Commerce Department as the deputy secretary, which
became vacant with the departure earlier this month of Clarence
Brown.
   However, in his statement, Verity said, ``A difference of
management styles developed between Bruce Smart and myself and I
asked him to agree to have his name withdrawn for the position of
deputy secretary.''
   Verity said he asked Smart to continue in the trade job but that
Smart had declined.
   Smart's office said he was not commenting on the announcement.
   A Commerce Department spokesman said no decision had been made
on the exact date of Smart's departure. The spokesman said Smart
did not have a specific job yet in the private sector.

   State prosecutors said Monday they
won't seek criminal charges against contractors of an apartment
building that collapsed during construction in Bridgeport last
year, killing 28 workers.
   Chief State's Attorney John Kelly and Bridgeport State's
Attorney Donald Browne said investigators determined that the cause
of the collapse ``did not involve intentional criminal conduct on
the part of any contractor involved in the construction.''
   ``While investigators have disclosed the most probable cause of
the building collapse, we do not believe that they have
demonstrated either a gross deviation from a reasonable person's
standard of conduct or that the prosecution could demonstrate
responsibility for criminally negligent homicide beyond a
reasonable doubt,'' the prosecutors said in a statement.
   Richard Bieder, an attorney representing families of some
collapse victims, said authorities probably don't know all there is
to know about the accident because some people with information may
not have come forward.
   ``My experience is that more of them with information will begin
singing like canaries as the pressures (of lawsuits) mount,'' he
said.
   ``I think there's more behind this story,'' echoed Anthony
Petta, general manager of the Waterbury Foundation Co. Inc., which
was a concrete subcontractor for the L'Ambiance project and lost 11
workers in the accident. ``Who knows what will happen after all of
the court proceedings?''
   L'Ambiance Plaza, a multi-story apartment complex in
Bridgeport's downtown, was being built in the lift-slab method. In
that method, huge concrete floor slabs are poured and allowed to
harden in a stack on the ground before they are jacked into place
on steel columns.
   Federal authorities concluded the April 23, 1987, collapse was
triggered when a small bracket that was part of the lifting system
bent under pressure.
   The National Bureau of Standards concluded that builders failed
to conduct stress-analysis tests to find out if the lifting
brackets, steel pieces measuring about 4 by 12 inches, could hold
up the concrete slabs.
   The Labor Department assessed a record $5.1 million in fines
against five companies for violations at the apartment complex. The
heaviest fines went to TPMI-Maycomber, a joint venture of TPM
International of Darien and B.H. Maycomber of Boston, which was the
primary contractor and project manager, and Texstar Contruction Co.
of San Antonio, Texas.
   The decision announced Monday by Kelly and Browne affects only
state prosecution.
   A regional administrator for the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, John Miles, said recently he has recommended
federal criminal charges be filed as a result of the collapse. The
federal review process could take months.
   Joe Egan, business agent for Ironworkers Local 424, which lost
seven men in the collapse, said he couldn't understand the state
prosecutors' decision.
   ``If there has to be criminal intent, than most manslaughter
cases would have to be thrown out of court,'' Egan said.
   Bridgeport Mayor Thomas W. Bucci declined to comment on Monday's
announcement except to say, ``They (Kelly and Browne) are both
excellent prosecutors and I'm not going to second guess their
decision in this matter.''
   In a lawsuit filed Oct. 28 by the victims' families, the city
was accused of negligence in issuing a building permit for
L'Ambiance Plaza and in inspecting construction of the building.
   David Turlington, a lawyer for Texstar Construction Co. of San
Antonio, Texas, said Connecticut's decision verifies ``that ... the
cause of the disaster has not been determined and Texstar continues
to dispute the findings by the National Bureau of Standards and
OSHA.''

   They had the goods on Bucky. Even if
he'd had an alibi, he wasn't in a position to tell anyone about it.
   But when Hamilton County Sessions Court Judge H.L. Smith handed
down his sentence Monday, maybe he took into account this was
Bucky's first offense. And that he was only 3 years old. And also
that he was a deer.
   Bucky is a white-tailed buck judged too tame to survive in the
wild after being illegally raised on a farm since he was a fawn.
Smith ordered him to spend the rest of his life in Chattanooga's
Warner Park Zoo.
   The sentence satisfied Hershel Bradshaw, a 70-year-old
Birchwood, Tenn., man who had taken care of the deer since its
mother and another fawn were accidentally killed by a combine he
was operating.
   Bradshaw was concerned that Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency
officials wanted to destroy the seven-point buck.
   ``For a while, they were talking about taking it out in the
woods and shooting it,'' he said. ``I just don't think that would
have been right.''
   Bradshaw's attorney, Bob Moon, said his client was charged with
illegally taking and possessing a Class IV animal. Wildlife
officials were told about the deer by a group of hunters who became
angry when Bradshaw would not let them shoot the animal, which was
caged, Moon said.
   Tennessee law prohibits anyone except ``zoos and transient
circus acts'' from possessing or displaying a class of wildlife
that includes such as white-tailed deer, black bears, bobcats and
wild turkeys.
   The judge said he had no intention of fining Bradshaw.

   Now that Michigan's 150th birthday is
over, the state office in charge of the bash has to figure out what
to do with nearly 10,000 birthday cards and letters.
   Many were placed by staff of the Sesquicentennial Office in a
large laundry hamper, but some can't be filed away so easily.
   For example, there is the 150-pound, 4-foot by 4-foot ceramic
tile state map, a joint venture of Detroit's Vernor Primary School
and Pewabic Pottery.
   There also are 28 6- by 4-foot birthday cards sent in by
Michigan shopping malls, some of them bearing more than 9,000
signatures.
   Some communities sent in birthday scrolls up to 20 feet long and
signed by hundreds of residents. Most of the cards are hand made.
Many are from kindergartens and elementary schools, but there's
even one from ``all of us at the Eaton County Jail.''
   The state's 18-month-long celebration of its 150th birthday
ended Jan. 26.

   Things are popping out on the farm, thanks
to a jump in consumption of the fluffy white snack Americans devour
by the ton each year.
   Production of popcorn statewide has doubled since the early
1980s when the last official estimate was made, said John Unger,
statistician for the Illinois Agricultural Statistic Service in
Springfield.
   ``Consumption of popcorn has increased with the popularity of
microwave ovens,'' Unger said. ``The price of popcorn is up, and I
think some farmers see it as an alternative crop that will make
them a little more money.''
   Scott Talbott of Manito is hoping to take advantage of the
popcorn craze. He and his father, Gnile, grow up to 800 acres of
popcorn each year near this town of 1,900 located 20 miles south of
Peoria.
   Unger estimated Illinois farmers grow upwards of 35,000 acres of
popcorn each year, more than double the 15,000 acres reported in
1981 in the last census.
   Indiana leads the nation, with about 53,000 acres of popcorn,
and Nebraska and Ohio rank about even with Illinois.
   Deirdre Flynn, spokeswoman for the Popcorn Institute in Chicago,
said industry sales started climbing in 1984, and a reported 700
million pounds were sold in 1986.

   U.S. and Soviet diplomats will have a tough
time meeting a one-month deadline for drafting portions of a treaty
to slash superpower nuclear arsenals, government and private
experts said Tuesday.
   ``The aspects of the agreements that they have agreed to draft
within 30 days are important, but they are appendages to the main
treaty,'' said Albert Carnesdale, a former arms control negotiator
now at Harvard University.
   And another former negotiator, James Hackett of the conservative
Heritage Foundation in Washington, cautioned that ``the best way to
get a bad agreement is to give your negotiators a deadline. Thirty
days is an incredibly short time for an agreement that should take
years to negotiate.''
   Both the Soviets and Americans would have to make major changes
in their bargaining positions to produce an agreement before a
summit planned for Moscow in late May or early June, said
Carnesdale, Hackett and administration sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and his Soviet counterpart
Eduard A. Shevardnadze set the 30-day deadline at their meeting in
Moscow on Monday, directing their staffs to reach draft agreements
dealing with verifying compliance with the cutbacks, disposing the
weapons, and exchange of information.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze meet again in Washington on March 22-23.
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and Soviet Defense Minister
Dmitri Yazov are also scheduled to discuss the issues at a meeting
in Bern, Switzerland, on March 16-17.
   The foreign ministers announced no major breakthroughs in the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), which President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev have agreed should cut superpower
nuclear arsenals to 6,000 warheads, a reduction of 30 percent to 50
percent, depending on how the weapons are counted.
   Among the major points of disagreement are a U.S. proposal to
limit the number of Soviet land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBM's) to 3,300, no more than 1,630 of which can be on
rockets carrying seven or more warheads. And the Soviets are
demanding limits on the number of cruise missiles aboard submarines
and aircraft.
   One administration source said, ``It's going to be tough to get
a deal unless the two sides agree to mix and match,'' the formula
adopted in the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, signed in
1979. That pact set overall limits on warhead levels but did not
achieve the limits on land-based Soviet ICBM's that the
administration has been seeking under START.
   Some analysts believe that no START deal is possible unless the
superpowers reach agreement on the degree to which the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limits the testing of weapons
developed under Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   However, Congress has barred the administration from spending
any money through next September on tests that would break the ABM
pact, and U.S. experts believe that enthusiasm for Star Wars will
wane after Reagan leaves office.
   ``Star Wars is probably a moot point,'' said an administration
source.
   A spokesman at the Soviet embassy, Boris Malkhov, said Tuesday
that ``we are confident that technical obstacles can be overcome.
We have the political will, and we think that President Reagan
does, also,'' to produce a START accord before the summit.

<HEAD>Tremors After Surgery Caused By Anesthetic Not Body Temperature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY McGRATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Post-operative trembling endured by half
the 25 million people who undergo surgery each year results from
the use of anesthetics, not from decreased body temperature as had
been assumed, according to a new study.
   The finding could lead to improved treatments to prevent the
unpleasant and uncontrollable tremors that in some cases resemble a
seizure and can be dangerous to patients, researchers said Tuesday.
   ``We now know that a very dramatic side effect of surgery has
been misinterpreted for more than 35 years,'' said Daniel I.
Sessler, assistant professor of anesthesia at the University of
California-San Francisco and head of the study.
   Sessler, along with researchers at UCLA and the University of
Minnesota, compared electrical signals produced in the muscles
during normal shivering to those in nine women recovering from
anesthetic after surgery. They found the post-surgical tremors were
not related to body temperature, but matched tremors produced in
people with severed spinal cords.
   Anesthetic, they found, wears off in the spine while the brain
remains asleep, essentially disconnecting the spine from the
brain's chemical messages.
   If the patient's skin gets cold, triggering shaking, the brain
cannot signal the muscle reflex to stop, Sessler said. After about
15 minutes, when the brain wakes up, the tremor stops, he said.
   ``People have been trying to do something for years about
post-surgical tremors, but generally without success because they
have been treating it as a thermo-regulatory problem,'' said
Sessler, who reported the finding at last year's meeting of the
International Anesthesia Research Society. The study will be
published in the journal Anesthesiology this year.
   Dr. Richard Stein, vice president of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists, said the finding will not drastically alter
current practice at hospitals, which already use lamps or blankets
once tremors begin.
   But according to Sessler, warming the skin with infrared heating
lamps or even something as simple as a hair dryer while the patient
is still asleep should prevent the tremors altogether.
   ``Infrared heating lamps are used empirically in some hospitals
and have already been shown to work ...,'' said Sessler. ``But most
don't treat this except with blankets. Routinely keeping the
patient warm would prevent this, even a modest increase in the
warming system.''
   The shaking, which can occur with almost all general anesthetics
in use today, can raise the patient's heart rate and blood
pressure, in addition to pulling apart incisions and damaging
teeth, Sessler said.
   Stein differed with Sessler's estimate that half of all surgical
patients experience some tremors, from mild to severe. He said such
cases are rare and are usually not serious.
   The condition is most common among patients treated in cold
operating rooms, such as those receiving hip or knee replacement,
he said. Orthopedic surgeons keep the temperature at around 62
degrees because of the heavy gowns they must wear and the air
conditioning system, both designed to prevent infection, he said.
   In a separate study, Sessler's research team disproved another
assumption _ that surgery patients lose all ability to control body
temperature. Anesthetics do not eliminate control but instead lower
the threshold for cold. The regulatory reaction occurs, but at a
much lower body temperature than normal, they found.

<HEAD>DOE Says No Decision on Super Collider Site Before November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Selection of a site for the $4.4 billion
``super collider'' atom smasher will be delayed by up to four
months to prepare a draft environmental impact statement before,
instead of after, the choice, the Energy Department said Tuesday.
   Word of the delay, from July to November or December, came in
budget questioning of Secretary John Herrington before the interior
subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee.
   He was asked whether he would pick the site before or after the
committee acts on his request for $363 million in construction
funds for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   ``I don't see us making the decision'' before the committee must
act, Herrington said. ``I would guess a preferred site would be
selected in November or December.''
   The department has planned for more than a year to chose the
final site in July and confirm it in January, subject to
preparation of an environmental impact statement.
   Department spokesman Jeff Sherwood said later that DOE now
believes it is better to do more work on the environmental impact
statement and complete a draft covering all possible sites before
chosing the final site.
   ``That will be on the street and people will be able to comment
on it, and we'll have the benefit of the comments in choosing the
fon to delay announcement
of a final site recommendation.
   ``The longer you go in with this project without getting the
funding committed, the more risk there is it won't get funded,''
Blanchard said at the National Governors' Association winter
meeting in Washington. ``The more you narrow down the site
selection, the less likely Congress is to fund it.''
   If Congress builds it, the superconducting super collider will
investigate exotic scientific theories of the origin of matter by
whirling beams of protons into each other at an energy 20 times
greater than what is now possible.
   Believed to be the largest scientific instrument ever built,
state governments are anxious to win the contest for the
53-miles-around tunnel because it will create 3,000 jobs and have
an annual operating budget of $270 million.
   Besides Michigan, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Tennessee
and North Carolina remain in the competition to build the collider.

   A two-pack-a-day woman who said she smokes
just to annoy her husband was ordered not to light up in front of
him or their three children and to confine her smoking to one room
of their house, according to court papers made public Tuesday.
   The court order, from state Supreme Court Justice Ralph Diamond,
says Elizabeth Roofeh, 41, of Kings Point on Long Island, can be
held in contempt if she breaks the rules.
   Mrs. Roofeh's husband, Jahanshah, a non-smoking orthopedic
surgeon, went to court in an attempt to get his wife to stop
smoking around the family.
   He claimed she had made a promise to that effect when they
married in 1976. She said she broke the promise in 1984 only
because of stress after suffering a stroke.
   She filed for divorce last May from her Iranian-born husband,
whom she called ``an ayatollah.''
   ``I smoke just to annoy him,'' Mrs. Roofeh said last year.
``I'll quit when I get him out of the house.''
   In the suit, Roofeh claimed his wife's habit was ``offensive and
detrimental to the health of the children,'' aged 6, 7, and 9.
   The husband had argued that smoking was as bad as punching or
spitting and asked for an order of protection, but Diamond said
such orders are designed to protect family members from domestic
violence and would be too severe a remedy.
   Instead, he ordered that she never smoke in front of her husband
or children and never smoke at home except in the family's small TV
room.
   Mrs. Roofeh said Tuesday that the ruling, dated Monday, was
``nothing new.''
   She said she had already been refraining from smoking in front
of the children and confining her smoking to the TV room.
   In an affidavit, she had agreed that smoking is ``detrimental to
the health of the smoker and those who passively inhale the
smoker's smoke.''
   Constance Navesky, a spokeswoman for the judge, said extensive
research into state law had not found any similar ruling.

   The sisters of kidnapped Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins said he appeared well on a tape released Monday by
his Lebanese extremist kidnappers.
   ``He looks good, considering what he's been through in the last
few weeks, but he is under a lot of stress,'' said his sister, Mary
Fisher, of the Jefferson County suburb of Okolona.
   ``It's strange to be seeing this. It's something you think can
never happen to you,'' said another sister, Linda Lee Miller of
Memphis, Tenn., who is visiting Mrs. Fisher.
   On the scratchy tape, Higgins, who was born in Danville, Ky.,
and grew up in nearby Garrard County, read a list of demands that
had to be met in order to obtain his release, including withdrawal
by Israel from its border ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Higgins, 43, head of a United Nations observer force in Lebanon,
was kidnapped last Wednesday as he drove alone in a jeep on the
higihway south of Tyre, about 50 miles from Beirut.
   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth, which claimed responsibility for the abduction, released the
70-second tape.
   ``I don't believe he thought it could happen to him. I believe
he thought he was safe,'' Mrs. Fisher said of her brother.
   Both Mrs. Fisher and Mrs. Miller said their brother would not
want the United States to give in to the kidnappers' demands.
   ``He would want them to take a hard line, not give in to them,
to stand up for the rights that the U.S. believes in,'' Mrs. Miller
said.
   While both sisters said they were glad to see that their brother
was alive, they realized it could be a long wait. Currently, there
are eight other Americans being held hostage in Lebanon, for as
long as nearly three years.
   ``He wouldn't want us to just stop our lives because he's in
this situation,'' Mrs. Fisher said.
   Mrs. Fisher said she would like to be able to get word to her
brother of the death of their father, William Higgins Sr. The elder
Higgins died Thursday, the day after his son's abduction, without
knowing what had happened to the Marine.
   Mrs. Fisher said she also had a message for her brother's
kidnappers.
   ``Please let him come home. Please release him.''

   The FBI illegally obtained a suspected Shiite
Lebanese terrorist's confession to leading a 1985 airplane
hijacking during ``relentless interrogation'' that violated his
rights, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker suppressed oral and
written confessions that Fawaz Younis gave to agents after he was
lured aboard an FBI-chartered yacht in the Mediterranean last Sept.
13.
   Parker ruled the statements were inadmissable as evidence
because Younis was denied his constitutional protection against
self-incrimination and his right to legal counsel during four days
of questioning aboard a Navy ship in the Mediterranean.
   ``Somehere along the way, in its zeal and determination to
indict and prosecute an alleged hostage-taker and hijacker under
recent congressional enactments, and in securing Fawaz Younis'
written confession, the FBI failed to comply fully with
constitutional restraints and predecential Supreme Court
decisions,'' Parker said in a 47-page opinion.
   ``Law enforcement agencies must follow the letter and the spirit
of the law, even though the accused is not a citizen of the United
States,'' Parker said. The FBI ``failed to do so in September 1987
when it interrogated the defendant.''
   Younis was arrested when a friend who had become a government
informant lured him onto an FBI-chartered yacht with the prospect
of making a drug deal. Prosecutors say they have a videotape and
other statements from witnesses that place Younis at the scene of
the June 11, 1985, hijacking of a Royal Jordanian jetliner from
Beirut International Airport.
   He is scheduled to go to trial March 22 before Parker on charges
that he led hijacking, during which the plane was blown up after
passengers and crew were taken off the aircraft.
   Although Parker declined to rule that the arrest was illegal, he
concluded that the FBI deliberately kept Younis aboard the USS
Butte for four days to obtain a confession in ``a clear abuse of
the obligation to bring the defendant before a judicial officer
immediately following his arrest.''
   ``The slow voyage across the Mediterranean appeared to serve
only the government's purposes _ ample time to educe a
confession,'' Parker said. ``That deliberate action coupled with
the lengthy and relentless interrogation was all to the defendant's
prejudice and detriment.''
   The FBI launched its plan to abduct Younis early last year under
the direction of Oliver Revell, the bureau's executive assistant
director, who witnessed the arrest and was aboard the Butte for
part of its four-day voyage, according to testimony.
   Younis' ``capacity for self-determination was critically
impaired'' by seasickness and throbbing pain from wrists that were
fractured when agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht, Skunk
Kilo, following his arrest, Parker said.
   The judge noted that the FBI kept Younis in windowless,
overheated room aboard the ammunition ship as it steamed slowly
from waters off Cyprus to a rendezvous with the USS Saratoga four
days later. Younis was then flown from the carrier to Andrews Air
Force Base, Md.
   The defendant had been advised of his rights to remain silent
once during his interrogation, but ``In an uncertain physical
condition, in an oppressive environment, and subject to relentless
interrogation, Younis lacked the will necessary to voluntarily
waive his rights,'' Parker said.
   ``We are reviewing the decision carefully within our office and
with our colleagues in the Department of Justice,'' Timothy J.
Reardon III, principal assistant U.S. attorney, said in a
statement. FBI spokeswoman Susan Schnitzer said the bureau would
not comment on the decision.
   Parker also criticized the ship's doctors for providing
inadequate medical treatment and ``negligent diagnosis'' despite
Younis' ``constant complaints'' about the pain.
   Younis was given ice packs but his wrists were not X-rayed and
put into casts until after he was flown to Washington.
   Parker said he was ``extremely troubled'' by the FBI's failure
to provide Younis with a defense lawyer ``despite the meticulous
detail of Operation Goldenrod'' _ the FBI's code-name for the
effort.
   ``If the FBI could arrange to have a medical surgical team of
five doctors and several tons of medical equipment aboard the
Butte, would it have been too difficult to arrange for a competent
and detached attorney?''
   Besides the confession, prosecutors also have the testimony of
two Americans who identified Younis as one of five men who boarded
the plane with AK-47 assault rifles. They also have the testimony
of Jamal Hamdan, Younis' one-time friend who had several
conversations with him about the hijacking.
   In addition, prosecutors have a videotape of Younis reading a
statement to reporters before the plane was blown up in the
background.

   The state Supreme Court on Tuesday
declared West Virginia's $1.49 billion budget unconstitutional
because it contains a deficit, and the state auditor's office said
all state spending would cease immediately.
   ``We've got to quit everything right now,'' said Don Adams,
chief clerk for Auditor Glen Gainer.
   Adams said no further expenditures of state money can be made
until the $26 million deficit in the current budget is corrected.
   There was a unanimous reaction of shock at the decision, which
had been pending for months.
   ``The governor has been saying it's unconstitutional since June.
I'm sure he'll be interested to hear that,'' said Gov. Arch Moore's
press aide, John Price.
   Moore was in Washington at a governor's conference Tuesday and
could not immediately be reached for comment.
   The court ruled in a 3-2 decision, in an opinion written by
Justice Darrell McGraw, did not tell Gov. Arch Moore and the
Legislature what to do about the unconstitutional budget.
   `` ... We presume the governor and Legislature will do their
duties,'' McGraw wrote.
   The decision resulted from a lawsuit brought by the West
Virginia Education Association last year that challenged cuts in
funding for education. The association did not seek to have the
budget declared unconstitutional but asked that Moore be forced to
call a special session to address the problem.
   In his response, Moore did not contest the allegations and said
the Legislature budgeted $26 million more than he had said would be
available in revenues. He said the document was unconstitutionally
out of balance.
   The state Constitution's requires ``that the estimate of revenue
and the budgeted appropriation be in balance so as not to create a
deficit.''
   But the high court said it refused to tell the Legislature and
the governor what they should do to correct the problem and
rejected the education association's request that a special
legislative session be ordered.
   It said the branches of government are equal and the court
presumes that the executive and legislative branches will do what
they are supposed to do.

   The National Park Service affirmed the dream
of a former Boy Scout Tuesday by dedicating a national trail he
conceived to show tourists landmarks that illustrate the rich
history of blacks in the nation's capital.
   The Black History National Recreation Trail winds from a
179-year-old cemetery in the exclusive Georgetown neighborhood to
the home of 19th century black leader Frederick Douglass in the
city's poor Anacostia section.
   ``The trail is a continued and living legacy to the achievements
of black Americans,'' said Willard Andre Hutt, 27, who started the
drive for the trail as his Eagle Scout project in 1979.
   Dedicated to the memory of late black historian Carter G.
Woodson, the tour through Washington is part of a series of
National Park Service trails, such as the Appalachian Trail, that
represent periods in American history.
   The trail includes such landmarks as Lincoln Park on Capitol
Hill; the downtown home of educator and presidential advisor Mary
McLeod Bethune; the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal
Church, the first AME in Washington, created in 1822 when a group
of dissatisfied blacks broke away from a predominantly white
church; Howard University, founded after the Civil War to provide
higher education to blacks; and the preserved home of abolitionist
Douglass.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, urging tourists to visit the
sites, wrote in a letter that the trail ``will surely contribute to
an increasing awareness of the vitality and rich history of the
black community in Washington D.C.''
   ``Our young people need to see these sites,'' Mayor Marion Barry
Jr. said at a dedication ceremony. ``They need to understand we
didn't get to where we are because of who we are, but because of
the struggle of these people.''

   Two Republicans said Tuesday their $375
million child care improvement bill is far more likely to become
law than a multibillion-dollar alternative sponsored by Democrats.
   ``It's closer to what the president is going to sign than
anything else on the table or under discussion,'' said Rep. Nancy
Johnson, R-Conn., House sponsor of the GOP bill. ``It is practical.
It is realistic. It is doable.''
   The plan sponsored by Johnson and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
relies on state regulation and private initiatives. The $2.5
billion Democratic proposal requires federal regulation and, among
other things, provides more direct aid to low-income families.
   ``There's no way they can get that past a Democrat president,
let alone this president,'' Hatch said.
   Hatch said he would have to ``sit down and negotiate'' with Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., sponsor of the Democratic bill in the
Senate. He predicted no child care bill would pass unless it comes
close to what he has proposed.
   But Dodd said he and Hatch already have had ``numerous
conversations'' about the two child care proposals, with little to
show for them.
   ``I frankly feel that under any of the presidential candidates,
I would fare better with my child care proposal than under this
administration,'' Dodd said. ``So unless I sense that Sen. Hatch
and others are willing to move more in our direction to really
target low- and moderate-income families, I am going to be
unwilling to necessarily reach a compromise this year.''
   Hatch initially introduced his bill last year, saying
conservatives had to take a leadership role in resolving the child
care problems faced by many working families. He reintroduced it
Tuesday with some refinements and Johnson's companion measure in
the House.
   The bill provides $250 million for state grants to projects
designed to improve or expand child care or make it more
affordable, $100 million for liability pools that any licensed
provider could join and $25 million for capital improvements to
regulated day care homes.
   In addition it would limit provider liability, give tax credits
to employers with on-site child care and offer a double tax
exemption to families in which a parent stayed home for six months
to care for a newborn. The break would be worth about $500 to $600
to the average family.
   Though some experts have said state regulation of day care is
inconsistent and in some cases very poor, Johnson said that would
change because the bill requires state regulation and will
stimulate debate.
   ``When that debate becomes public ... it results in good
standards,'' she said.
   Johnson also said the bill would decrease the incidence of
``underground'' providers because it addresses the liability
problem and simplifies taxes for family day care providers.
   ``If you don't deal with those disincentives, you're not going
to bring people into the regulated system,'' she said.
   The National Governors' Association, meanwhile, urged the
federal government Tuesday to take action on child care, including
a ``modest'' commitment of funds to help poor working families.
   The governors, ending their three-day winter meeting in
Washington, called for the public and private sectors to work in
concert on the problem, and said that despite the deficit, ``the
federal government should begin to take action to improve child
care.''
   But President Reagan on Monday cautioned the governors to
``tread carefully'' on the issue of child care.
   ``Maybe it's my conservative bent, but I can't help but feel
uneasy sometimes'' about proposals to seek government solutions to
such problems, Reagan said.
   Hatch and Johnson described their bill as bipartisan, although
most Democrats are supporting the Dodd bill, introduced in the
House by Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich.
   Proponents of the Democratic measure say a strong federal role
is needed to unify and strengthen the current piecemeal system and
to give the private sector a framework in which to invest.
   Only 5 percent of employers currently offer day care services or
direct financial aid to pay for them.

   Thousands of people marched in Soviet Armenia on
Tuesday to demand control of territory assigned to another
republic, dramatically illustrating tensions among the nation's 100
nationalities.
   Demonstrations in Yerevan, capital of the southern Soviet
republic, followed protests in the disputed area, a small
mountainous region just north of Turkey.
   A former political prisoner said from Yerevan that the
protesters want the small area _ part of the neighboring republic
of Azerbaidzhan _ to be made part of the republic of Armenia
because many Armenians live there.
   Other problems between different nationalities have led to
demonstrations in the republics of Kazakhstan, Estonia, Lithuania
and Latvia.
   Nationalist demonstrations have increased since Mikhail S.
Gorbachev gained power in March 1985 and adopted a policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness on selected social issues. On Feb. 10, he
said developing a nationalities policy is ``the most vital,
fundamental issue of our society.''
   Dissidents in Moscow said Tuesday at least 100,000 demonstrators
took to the streets in Yerevan, but a participant claimed later the
number was 200,000. In either case, it appeared to be one of the
largest unofficial gatherings ever reported in the Soviet Union.
   The government acknowledged ``breaching of public order'' took
place in the the disputed area, Nagorno-Karabakhskaya, and said the
territorial demands were against the public interest.
   Tamara Grigoryants, a Moscow dissident whose husband is
Armenian, said the disputed area in the Caucasus was given to
neighboring Azerbaidzhan in the early 1920s although most of its
inhabitants are Armenian.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan, a 38-year-old former political prisoner, said
in a telephone interview from Yerevan that protests began late
Monday and continued Tuesday. Yerevan is 1,100 miles south of
Moscow.
   ``No one slept all night,'' he said. ``We gathered at the opera
house at about 11 p.m. and stayed out demonstrating until 5 a.m.
About 200,000 people massed outside the Council of Ministers, the
Central Committee headquarters and the Supreme Soviet.''
   About one-third of Armenia's 3.3 million people live in Yerevan.
   Ayrikyan led an underground Armenian nationalist group called
the National Unification Party and was jailed for 17 years
beginning in 1969. He said he now is chairman of a nationalist
group called Alliance for National Determination.
   Earlier this month, he said, the Nagorno-Karabakhskaya
government council asked that the region be made part of Armenia,
citing the constitutional guarantee of the right of
self-determination. The Communist Party Central Committee rejected
the request, and demonstrations followed in Nagorno-Karabakhskaya
and Yerevan, Ayrikyan said.
   Soldiers brought in tanks to quell protests in
Nagorno-Karabakhskaya and rumors circulated that some demonstrators
were killed, he said.
   The government made its comment through the official news agency
Tass, and the dispatch was read later on the national evening news
program.
   ``Breaching of public order was provoked as a result of
irresponsible calls by extremist individuals,'' Tass said of events
in Nagorno-Karabakhsaya.
   It said the Central Committee ``holds that the actions and
demands directed at revising the existing national and territorial
structure contradict the interests of the working people in Soviet
Azerbaidzhan and Armenia and damages inter-ethnic relations.''
   The Central Committee urged residents ``not to yield to
provocations by nationalist elements'' and said all measures would
be taken to ``safeguard public order,'' Tass reported. It did not
give the number of demonstrators or say what actions were taken to
stop the protest.
   Alexander Ogorodnikov, a former political prisoner who lives in
Moscow, said demonstrators in Yerevan chanted the slogan, ``One
nation, one republic!''
   Karen S. Demirchyan, the Armenian Communist Party chief, went on
television Monday night asking people to be calm, but thousands
gathered outside the opera whistled and jeered, Ogorodnikov and
Ayrikyan said.
   Police followed the demonstrators as they marched through
Yerevan but did not detain or harrass the protesters, Ayrikyan said.
   He added that rumors were circulating of authorities sending
martial arts experts to the city to cause disorder and provide
police with a pretext for intervention.
   Problems of nationalities gained prominence last summer in the
Baltic republics, and there were street demonstrations in Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia to mark the anniversary of a secret
German-Soviet agreement that led to the Soviet takeover of the
three countries in 1940.
   On Feb. 16 in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, there was a
heavy presence of police patrolling the streets and squares in an
apparent move to prevent any demonstrations on the 70th anniversary
of Lithuanian independence.
   Estonian dissidents plan more protests Wednesday.
   In the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, at least 3,000
people rioted Dec. 17-18, 1986, in the capital Alma Ata to protest
appointment of an ethnic Russian to replace a Kazakh as the
republic's party leader.

<HEAD>Analyst Says Bush's TV News Image Rose As His Campaign Faltered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Network news stories on Vice President George
Bush were generally negative before the Iowa Republican caucuses
but became much more favorable after his poor showing there, a
media analyst said Tuesday.
   There were 157 on-air evaluations of Bush as a candidate on
evening newscasts from Jan. 1 to Feb. 16, said Robert Lichter, who
has been logging and analyzing television coverage of all the
contenders since early last year.
   From Jan. 1 to Feb. 8, before Bush's third-place Iowa finish, 61
percent of the evaluations were negative. From Feb. 9 through Feb.
16, between the Iowa and New Hamphire contests, only 34 percent of
the evaluations were negative.
   Lichter called the trend ``a dramatic upturn'' that illustrates
the media tendency to treat front-runners more critically than the
rest of the pack.
   ``As Bush's prospects dim ... suddenly for the first time in
this campaign he starts to get good press,'' Lichter said.
   Part of the shift involved the virtual disappearance of stories
about Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair, Lichter said. Before
the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8, there were twice as many stories about
Iran-Contra as there were about any other policy issue. Then
Iran-Contra ``dropped from sight,'' he said.
   Lichter showed snippets of pre-Iowa campaign coverage that
included several pointed comments from Bush's chief rival, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   In one nightly news clip, Dole said Bush never said anything at
leadership meetings. ``I don't know, maybe he was just holding
back,'' he said. In another, Dole said he had ``a record of
leadership. ... I can't help it if he (Bush) can't provide any.''
   After the Iowa caucuses, sample clips showed Barbara Bush
calling her husband ``wiser and smarter'' than the other
candidates. NBC Correspondent Tom Pettit said Bush was ``not a
quitter. He's a very determined man.'' And a New Hampshire truck
driver told an interviewer that Bush ``seems a lot taller and
sterner than I thought he would be.''
   Lichter said most positive comments come from candidates and
their families while negative ones come from others in the race.
The trend worked to the disadvantage of Democrats because they kept
picking on each other _ particularly during debates, he said.
   Sample clips of the Democrats included some acerbic comments on
the so-called Massachusetts miracle touted by Gov. Michael Dukakis
as evidence of his successful economic policies.
   ``I went to divinity school and they have a tougher definition
of the word miracle,'' Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., said during one
debate.
   Rep. Dick Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon provided many instances
of Democratic sniping picked up by network news. Among the clips:
   ``It is legitimate for me to say where are you going? Who is the
real Dick Gephardt?'' said Simon, defending an anti-Gephardt
television ad.
   ``I asked Sen. Simon to take those ads off television,''
Gephardt said. ``And if he doesn't, he should take off his bow tie
because he's just another politician.''
   Lichter said ABC and NBC coverage of Bush stayed just about the
same after Bush's confrontation with Dan Rather on CBS. But Bush's
positive evaluations on CBS dropped sharply from about 50 percent
to 27 percent after the set-to, Lichter said.
   Lichter said the negative CBS coverage may have been ``one
blip'' attributable to ``a lot of anger'' over the incident. He
said Bush stories on CBS since Iowa are in the same ballpark as
other networks _ about 60 percent positive.
   ``Horse-race'' comments about a candidate's chances were not
included in the tallies of positive and negative evaluations.
Comments that were counted came from candidates, their families and
aides, network correspondents, independent experts and others.
   Lichter is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and
co-director of the Center for Media and Policy Studies. Besides
tracking network news coverage of the candidates, he is also
monitoring election-year political humor on the Johnny Carson and
David Letterman shows.

<HEAD>Monitors Should Hit Big Overpayments in State Assistance Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal monitors of state-run family
assistance programs should penalize only those states with
excessive rates of overpayments, a congressional study said Tuesday.
   Moreover, the report by the Nationa Research Council said the
current federal monitoring system should be replaced with one that
measures state efforts to accomplish the social purposes of the
programs rather than just financial accountability.
   Recommendations of the panel, an operating arm of the National
Academy of Sciences, are based on an 18-month study ordered by
Congress.
   The new report focuses on Aid to Families with Dependent
Children and Medicaid. A similar report issued last May
concentrated on the Food Stamp program.
   The underlying call for different ways of measuring
effectiveness applied to all three programs, which account for
about 40 percent of total federal spending on the poor.
   Nevada is the only state that has escaped sanctions that are
expected to total $3 billion by 1989. Nearly all of the 49 states
facing sanctions are appealing and some are challenging them in
court.
   Intended to deter overpayment errors in the three programs,
penalties are imposed if a state's error rate exceeds 5 percent of
its Food Stamp payments and 3 percent of its AFDC and Medicaid
payments.
   The panel endorsed the concept of imposing sanctions for
improperly run programs, but said the overpayment error rate should
not be the sole criteria of a state's performance.
   It said the present monitoring system does not provide the
``detailed data that are needed for identifying and correctioning
problems at the service-delivery level.''
   Because of uncertainties in the available information, sanctions
should be limited to ``extremely bad performers'' until a more
comprehensive method of measuring performance is developed, the
panel said.
   It said federal officials should measure the states against each
other, rather than the present absolute gauge, and penalize only
those with ``excessively large'' error rates.
   However, the report did not specify a cutoff point as being
``exessively large'' and said, ``There is no absolutely reliable
way of determining, say, the 10 states with the highest error
rates.''

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts and Wisconsin receieved top
scores Tuesday in a ranking of state environmental protection
programs by an advocacy group, the Fund for Renewable Energy and
the Environment.
   The two states received 45 points out of a possible 60 in the
group's subjective assessments of programs in six areas: surface
water protection, pesticide control, highway safety, land use
planning, indoor pollution and pollution from energy production and
use.
   Not far behind in the rankings were California and New Jersey
with 44 points each and Connecticut with 43. At the bottom of the
list were Nevada, Oklahoma and Texas with 19 points, Arkansas and
Mississippi with 17 and Wyoming with 15.
   In the separate areas, the group put these states first: North
Carolina in surface water protection; California in pesticide
protection; Oregon in land use planning; New Jersey in combating
indoor pollution; Maryland in highway safety; and Massachusetts in
energy pollution control.
   In an introduction to the report, Denis Hayes, chairman of the
fund, said, ``Slowly, the environmental community has come to
recognize that our responsibility is not discharged simply by
passing sweeping legislation. ... The real success must be won in
the trenches.
   ``The purpose of this study is to share information on how the
battle is going in the trenches.''
   This is the second report from the fund. Last year's examined
outdoor air pollution, soil conservation, solid waste and
recycling, hazardous waste management, groundwater protection and
renewable energy and conservation. The fund said it plans to look
at each area every three years.
   The rankings tried to account for the existence of state
legislation, the scope of programs, financing, monitoring and
enforcement and indications of progress.
   The report singled out Massachusetts, which imposed $697,000 in
penalties for water pollution under a new state program.
   Among other points, the report said:
   _Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio
and Washington ``have more than one-fifth of the major municipal
public treatment works in significant non-compliance'' with their
water pollution discharge permits.
   _Most states rely on local government zoning ordinances for
controls on land use, and statewide programs were found only in
Oregon, Florida, Vermont, Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey.
   _Forty-two states have passed laws limiting smoking in public
places, and 22 states and more than 200 local governments restrict
smoking to some degree on the job.
   _Though not one of the traditional environmental issues,
``Highways are one of our most dangerous daily environments,'' and
``The automobile is also the machine with the single greatest
impact on our environment,'' accounting for half of air pollution.

   The Army announced Tuesday it intends to build
incinerators at eight ammunition depots around the country to
destroy old chemical weapons because it doesn't want to risk moving
the munitions.
   ``I think we could do it either way,'' said James R. Ambrose,
the under secretary of the Army and the official who made the final
decision.
   ``But it is my judgment in rendering this decision that it is
much more sensible in every respect, and far less complex and I
think on the whole ... less risky, to do it where it is.
   ``We think we can exercise much better control on a combined
federal reservation than we can transporting this stuff over many
states and through cities and the like,'' he said.
   Ambrose's decision was hardly a surprise. The Army has favored
on-site destruction of its old chemical stocks ever since it began
studying the matter more than two years ago, and just last December
released an environmental impact study supporting that approach.
   Some members of Congress, however, including Rep. Larry J.
Hopkins, R-Ky., have contested the Army's plans, saying the service
hasn't demonstrated the safety of incinerating chemical weapons at
storage depots located near population centers.
   Hopkins said Tuesday he was not surprised by Ambrose's decision,
but thought the Army had reneged on an earlier agreement to conduct
a more ``site-specific'' study of each depot.
   ``In my view, on-site incineration is unsafe and unthinkable in
Madison County, Ky.,'' Hopkins said. ``We have the most amount of
population and the least amount of chemicals.''
   The service is now constructing a prototype incineration plant
on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean _ where another chemical
weapons depot is maintained _ to demonstrate the safety of the
destruction process, Ambrose noted.
   ``We think these plants are extremely safe,'' he said at a
Pentagon briefing. ``We think the safety is greatly in excess of
that required by any of the known rules and laws.''
   The Army's No. 2 civilian leader said the service now hopes to
begin building the eight incineration plants by 1989 or 1990, but
conceded that timetable could be slowed by litigation or by
Congress.
   While Ambrose said he was comfortable with his decision, he said
he fully expects to see lawsuits challenging the move.
   ``I've had even some people I won't identify assure me that
they'll sue me either way,'' he said to laughter.
   The Army's stockpile of so-called unitary chemical weapons, in
which shells and bombs are filled with a variety of nerve gases and
poisons such as mustard gas, is now on average more than 25 years
old. Although the Army won't say how large the stockpile is _
citing secrecy classifications _ published estimates have ranged
from 25,000 tons to 40,000 tons.
   The weapons are stored at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.;
Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.;
Newport Army Ammunition Plant, Ind.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.;
Pueblo Army Depot, Colo.; Tooele Army Depot, Utah, and Umatilla
Army Depot, Ore.
   The Army is under orders from Congress to begin destroying the
old stock as it begins producing a new type of chemical weapon
considered to be more safe. Those new ``binary'' weapons are made
with two harmless chemicals that are kept separate until after the
artillery round or rocket is fired, mixing then to form a lethal
gas.
   Ambrose said Tuesday he had closely studied the Army
environmental impact study before accepting its rejection of four
alternatives to on-site incineration.
   Those alternatives included transporting the weapons by rail for
destruction at plants to be built at Tooele and Anniston;
transporting by rail to a single national disposal center at
Tooele; airlifting the Lexington and Aberdeen weapons to Tooele for
destruction, with on-site destruction at the other locations, and
continued storage at the current sites.
   ``These devices are there,'' Ambrose said. ``They've been there
for some time. They will not go away. They should be gotten rid of.
They will not turn into something completely harmless by themselves.
   ``I have simply concluded that the ability to control
(transportation) actions and to take the necessary precautions in
large-scale movements ... is just much more of a formidable,
complex and uncertain task than to keep these materials under close
control at these locations and to perform the incineration there.''
   The Army could probably save about $200 million if it built a
single large incineration plant instead of eight small ones, but
the risk of large-scale movement of the weapons is not worth it,
Ambrose added.
   If all goes well, Ambrose said it would cost between $2 billion
and $2.5 billion to dispose of the old weapons and that the job
could be completed by 1996 or 1997. It would then take another year
or so to dismantle the eight incineration plants, he said.

   Connecticut Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman announced
Monday he will challenge maverick Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker
Jr.'s bid for re-election, while Democratic Rep. Frank McCloskey of
Indiana _ who won re-election in 1984 in a disputed recount _ said
he would seek a fourth term.
   And in Augusta, Maine, longtime congressional aide Edward S.
``Ted'' O'Meara said he would run for the GOP nomination in the 1st
Congressional District, challenging L.L. Bean heiress Linda
Bean-Jones in a primary. The seat is held by Democrat Joseph E.
Brennan, the former governor.
   Lieberman, 45, a Democratic former state senator who ran
unsuccessfully for Congress in 1980, attacked Weicker for using the
Senate as ``a debating society'' for his own agenda.
   Weicker, 56, who announced his candidacy for a fourth term
earlier this month, has made a name for himself as a liberal
Republican, frequently at odds with his party and president. He has
championed constitutional issues and civil rights and worked
against school prayer and balanced budget amendments.
   The candidates will be determined at state party conventions
this summer. So far, Weicker is unopposed and Lieberman has only
token opposition from Gary Johnson, who describes himself as a
veterans' rights advocate.
   McCloskey said he expected another tough campaign in the 8th
Congressional District, which is situated in southwestern Indiana.
In 1984, McCloskey won by just four votes in a hotly disputed
recount after a race with Republican candidate Rick McIntyre of
Bedford in which more than 230,000 votes were cast.
   So far, two Republicans have filed to challenge McCloskey _ John
Smith, a Bloomington businessman, and John Myers, an Odon newspaper
publisher.

   Flight attendants at Northwest Airlines have
voted overwhelmingly to strike the airline this weekend unless a
contract dispute over wages and benefits is resolved, a union
official said Monday.
   Jeff Musto, a spokesman for Teamsters Local 2747 representing
6,500 Northwest attendants, said 94.4 percent of the more than
5,000 attendants participating voted to strike Saturday. Strike
authorization required a two-thirds majority.
   ``The strike authorization of 94.4 percent reflects the
deplorable state of labor relations at Northwest Airlines,'' Musto
said at a news conference, reading a statement prepared by the
local.
   ``Northwest Airlines labor relations does not comprehend the
severity of the labor situation at this carrier,'' the statement
read.
   Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said he was not surprised by
the strike vote and said the airline expected to continue operating
most of its flights if a strike occurred.
   Meanwhile Monday, the Teamsters union at Pan Am Corp. threatened
to disrupt the airline over a contract impasse but stopped short of
calling a strike.
   The strike deadline for the union, which represents 4,500 Pan Am
baggage handlers, reservations clerks and other ground personnel,
passed at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. No negotiations were scheduled for
Monday.
   Teamsters officials said they would use tactics such as sending
baggage to the wrong airports and canceling reservations.
   Tyler said Northwest officials and the union would hold a
negotiating session Tuesday ``with the cooperation of the National
Mediation Board and we continue to remain optimistic that our
contract will be resolved.''
   The two sides have not negotiated since the National Mediation
Board released them from mandatory negotiations last month, when
they deadlocked over wages, fringe benefits and work rules. A
30-day cooling-off period ends at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, at which
time the attendants may strike and Northwest may impose a new
contract.
   About 2,000 Northwest managers are qualified to be flight
attendants and would be used during a strike, according to the
airline, which also advertised earlier this month for flight
attendants.
   But Northwest last week told 5,300 mechanics and baggage
handlers they could be laid off if the flight attendants went on
strike.
   The International Association of Machinists, which represents
20,000 ground workers at Northwest, and the pilots' union have not
said if they would honor a strike by the flight attendants.
   In the last strike against Northwest, the machinists union
walked out for 27 days in May 1982.
   Northwest merged with the Minneapolis-based Republic Airlines in
1986 and the company and its major unions have been involved in
talks on new contracts ever since.
   Many former Republic employees are paid less than their
Northwest counterparts, a cause of friction between labor and
management.
   Northwest's latest proposal to the Teamsters offers immediate
elimination of pay gaps between former Northwest and former
Republic flight attendants and deals with the other areas of
disagreement.
   The proposed five-year agreement calls for pay increases for
former Republic flight attendants ranging from 17 percent to 26
percent, according to Terry Erskine, Northwest's vice president of
labor relations. Senior flight attendants earn about $35,000
annually; starting pay is about $15,000 a year, he said.
   But Musto said Monday that ``even though it does show a pay
raise for the Republic people, the end result would be a pay cut if
you put a dollars and cents figure on things being taken away form
the Republic people.''
   Musto said the proposal would mean less vacation pay and, ``in
the long run, you would get less retirement benefits.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Tuesday that
Occidental Chemical Corp. is liable for the cost _ estimated at
more than $250 million _ of cleaning up the Love Canal landfill
that became synonymous with environmental disaster.
   After nine years of deliberations, U.S. District Judge John
Curtin said Occidental produced the wastes and stored them in a way
that would eventually result in toxic leakage.
   ``It is beyond dispute that OCC's disposal practices were at
least partially responsible for the release, or threatened release,
of the chemicals from the Love Canal landfill,'' Curtin said.
   Curtin said Occidental's liability would be determined in
further court proceedings involving claims against Occidental by
other parties, including the state of New York and some residents.
Previous estimates have ranged above $250 million.
   Frank Ashley, a spokesman for Occidental Petroleum Corp., the
parent of Occidental Chemical, said the company would appeal.
   ``Although we believe we are protected by insurance, we intend
further to protect our rights by appeal from this extraordinary
decision,'' Ashley said.
   ``At last someobo~ has been assigned some responsibility,''
said Sister Marjeen Hoffmann, director of the Ecumenical Task Force
which has been an advocate for people in the Love Canal
neighborhood.
   ``This is what we've been waiting for,'' she said.
   Lois Gibbs, a former Love Canal resident who now runs the
Citizen's Clearing House for Hazardous Wastes in Alexandria, Va.,
said she hopes the company will be found liable for the full $250
million. ``That will at least make them blink,'' Gibbs said.
   Roger J. Marzulla, acting assistant attorney general in charge
of the Justice Department's Land and Natural Resources Division,
said the ruling shows Occidental ``cannot insulate itself from
liability by blaming others.''
   Curtin's ruling upholds the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which the judge
said was designed to compel the waste disposal industry ``to
correct its past mistakes and to provide a solution for the dangers
posed by inactive abandoned waste sites.''
   The law was passed 27 years after Occidental yielded ownership
of the landfill, transferring it to the Niagara Falls School Board.
   Occidental, formerly Hooker Chemical and Plastic Co., contended
that it was not responsible for the site after 1953 when it sold
the property to the school board, which built a school on the
grounds. Occidental Petroleum had acquired Hooker in 1968 and
changed the name to Occidental Chemical.
   Occidental said the construction broke a clay seal on the dump
and allowed the chemicals to leach into the environment. The
company acknowledged dumping 20,000 tons of chemical wastes into
the canal during the late 1940s and early 1950s.
   Martin Littlefield, assistant U.S. attorney for the Buffalo
district, said the decision was ``a great victory for the state
because it means companies are indeed responsible for what they've
done in years past.''.
   Littlefield said Occidental would be liable for the ``bottom
line'' on the cleanup costs. He said, however, the ruling allows
Occidental to sue other parties the chemical giant contends should
share the responsibility.
   Nunzio Loverdi, president of the Love Canal Environmental Action
Committee, said, ``I think Occidental should accept the decision
and not take action against the city and School Board because if it
does we will all suffer. We want to get on with our lives and put
this behind us.''
   Ten years ago, Love Canal became synonymous with environmental
disaster when state officials ordered an evacuation of children and
pregnant women from the area because of leaking chemicals.
President Carter designated the 10-block site as a federal
emergency area in 1978.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency began the suit
against the company in 1979.
   During the next two years, 728 families were evacuated. Many of
those were among the 1,300 former residents who accepted a $20
million damage settlement from Occidental in 1984.
   Today, there are some 175 families awaiting the results of a
state habitability study to decide whether they can return to their
homes.
   Occidental has since proposed construction of a
multimillion-dollar incinerator complex and offered to destroy
dioxin-contaminated wastes. The offer marks the first time since
the federal and state governments took over the cleanup in 1979
that the company has proposed any direct action or involvement in
cleanup measures.
   Occidental officials are scheuled to make a formal proposal at a
meeting March 2 in Washington at the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.

   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
grudgingly supported Senate ratification of the new U.S. Soviet
medium-range arms reduction agreement on Tuesday, saying it never
should have been agreed to in its present form.
   But Kissinger said the treaty should be approved without
crippling amendments because failure to do so would ``magnify all
difficulties'' within the NATO alliance.
   ``The removal of American intermediate range missiles (from
Europe) is now irreversible,'' because of the pressures of European
public opinion and other factors, Kissinger told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   Because of that, he said, defeat of the treaty in the Senate
``would generate a crisis in the Atlantic Alliance which in the end
would almost certainly lead to the unilateral withdrawal of U.S.
missiles from Europe and undermine the cohesion of the alliance.''
   ``My concerns cannot be removed by the refusal of the Senate to
ratify the agreement,'' Kissinger said. ``Failure to ratify ...
cannot cure its defects.
   Meanwhile, because they had ``manuevered themselves into a
position where they think they now have no choice but to stand by
proposals they never thought would be agreed to in the first
place.''
   The treaty is the result of NATO's 1979 ``dual-track'' decision
to deploy U.S. weapons to counter Soviet SS-20 medium-range
missiles while at the same time negotiating their removal.
   ``They felt the obligation to imply that these weapons were
there for arms control purposes and were therefore open to
negotiation,'' Kissinger said of the European political leaders.
   Kissinger said he believes the treaty is flawed because it will
not reduce in any significant way the ability of the Soviet Union
to devastate Europe with other nuclear weapons and because it
substantially reduces the ability of the United States to retaliate
with nuclear weapons based in Europe.
   Nuclear deterrence in Europe will now rely primarily on weapons
based in the United States and Kissinger said that creates ``a
psychological and political imbalance,'' especially when weighed
against Soviet superiority in conventional forces.
   But he said rejection of the treaty would severely undermine
confidence in American leadership, demoralize the alliance, and
ignite neutralism.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, said his committee has ``high confidence'' in the
ability of the United States to verify Soviet compliance with the
treaty.
   But ``there's a very big question mark about our ability to
verify'' a separate treaty providing deep cuts in long-range
nuclear weapons, Boren said in an interview.
   ``The problem there is one of money, not technical ability,'' he
explained. ``We have the capability, but the administration has to
come forward and propose a budget plan to pay for it.''
   The Intelligence Committee has been holding closed-door hearings
for three weeks about verification capabilities.
   In his testimony, Glitman provided a detailed analysis as part
of the Senate's thorough examination of the pact signed 10 weeks
ago by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The
treaty will eliminate all nuclear-tipped missiles with ranges of
about 300 to 3,000 miles.
   Armed Services committee members say the detailed scrutiny is
needed because of disputes about the meaning of past treaties,
particularly the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   The current treaty is being considered by the Senate amid a
fight between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the Reagan
administration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact and
whether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developed
under the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Article 14 of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty
says neither side shall do anything, now or in the future, to
undercut the pact.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told Glitman that ``I'm concerned about
article 14'' because it might limit future U.S. help to other NATO
nations.
   ``If we don't spell out what the future obligations are,'' said
Quayle, ``down the road I can foresee some problems ... now is the
time to give us as much running room as possible in the future for
our technology.''
   But Glitman took the opposite approach, noting that the treaty
is extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons, along
with their components.
   ``If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' said
Glitman. Later, he added that ``we're best protected by stating
what we cannot do.''
   Glitman cited one method in which he said U.S. aid to NATO would
not be affected. The treaty bans cruise missiles, he said, but it
doesn't block the transfer of U.S. technology to NATO nations such
as Great Britain to develop cruise missiles.
   Glitman said the U.S. negotiating team resisted Soviet efforts
to block U.S. help for NATO. ``We knew their goal was to find a way
to put a brake on NATO activities,'' he said.
   Reagan promised Tuesday that the United States will do its part
to ensure that the NATO alliance remains strong, saying in an
address broadcast to Europe that ``our destiny is coupled with
yours.''
   In the address, which came a week before a NATO summit meeting,
Reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any
member nation is an attack against all of them. ``Simply put, an
attack on Munich is the same as an attack on Chicago,'' he said.

   President Reagan on Tuesday picked a veteran
Capitol Hill infighter, William L. Ball III, to step into a
simmering dispute over Pentagon budget cuts as his new secretary of
the Navy.
   The White House said the president will nominate Ball, a former
Capitol Hill aide who has been chief lobbyist for both the State
Department and the White House, to succeed James Webb, who resigned
as Navy secretary on Monday with a blast at Secretary of Defense
Frank C. Carlucci.
   ``We look to Will Ball to continue working aggressively for a
strong U.S. Navy,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
noting Webb's charge that Carlucci had needlessly sacrificed the
administration's goal of a 600-ship fleet.
   Fitzwater said the administration still seeks a 600-vessel Navy,
but now expects that the goal will be reached in fiscal year 1992,
more than two years after Reagan leaves office, rather than in
fiscal 1989 as originally planned.
   ``The budget restructuring under way at the Pentagon now is a
difficult and painful process,'' Fitzwater said. ``Secretary
Carlucci is doing an admirable job. He's quite capable and suitable
to the task, and he's carrying out thepresident's policies in that
regard.''
   Of Ball, he said, ``All of us who kFw him here at t Z/e
House know that the Navy is getting a strong advocate and a strong
fighter both on the Hill as well as in any of the other courts of
public opinion around the country.''
   Ball, 39, a soft-spoken Southerner who came to Washington as an
aide to former Sen. Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., has a reputation for
skill at the behind-the-scenes compromises and maneuvers needed to
steer legislation through Congress.
   Webb, on the other hand, was more noted for outspoken advocacy
of such controversial positions as his criticism of the service
academies' admission of women and his ruling that the Navy would no
longer accommodate officers who want to play professional sports.
   Ball has been assistant to the president for legislative affairs
since February 1986. Before that he had been assistant secretary of
state for legislative and intergovernmental affairs. From 1981 to
1985 he was administrative assistant to`hen Sen. John Tower,
R-Texas, serving also as chief clerk of the Senate Armed Services
Committee in 1981. He was Talmadge's administrative assistant in
1978.
   A native of South Carolina, he is a graduate of the Georgia
Institute of Technology and was a regular officer in the Navy from
1969 to 1975.
   As secretary of the Navy, Ball will oversee approximately
584,000 Navy personnel and 199,000 Marines.
   He will be succeeded at the White house by a deputy, Alan
Kranowicz, who has been primarily responsible for White House
lobbying efforts in the House. Kranowicz served as chief of staff
to former Rep. Tom Loeffler, R-Texas, while Loeffler was in
Congress.
   Fitzwater said Webb ``did the honorable thing'' in resigning
when he could no longer support the president's policies. He said
Webb's service was ``distinguished and the president appreciates it
very much.''
   Later the White House released a letter from Reagan to Webb
accepting the resignation ``with regret'' and saying, ``As your
service to this administration comes to a close, I want to thank
you for the selflessness and loyalty that you have always
personified.''
   Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said, ``The Pentagon is
very pleased that someone with such positive credentials has been
named so quickly.''
   ``It is a painful restructuring they are having to go through to
absorb some of those reductions in spending levels,'' the
presidential spokesman said. ``The president has been a strong
advocate of the military and has worked hard to build it up over
many years and feels that pain no less than anyone else.''
   The budget cuts being carried out by Carlucci, the former White
House national security adviser who succeeded Caspar W. Weinberger
at the Pentagon late last year, result from a compromise reached by
Reagan with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   In his budget message delivered last Thursday to Congress,
Reagan said he had kept his part of the bargain and expected them
to keep their part by appropriating the full amount agreed upon for
Pentagon spending.
   Ball's nomination requires confirmation by the Senate. He is
expected to have little difficulty since the nomination will be
reviewed by the Senate Armed Services Committee, many of whose
members know him as a former aide to the panel and to Tower, who is
a former member and chairman.
   In announcing his resignation Monday, Webb charged that Carlucci
had instructed him to deny news stories reporting that it was the
Defense Department, not the Navy, that wanted to mothball ships.
   He also said Carlucci needed to ``spend a lot more time with the
top leaders in this building (the Pentagon),'' but instead had been
``spending a lot of time with the State Department and a lot of
time on the Hill.''
   Carlucci declined to respond, saying only that he had learned of
Webb's resignation with ``regret.''

   Pat Robertson suggested on Tuesday that
political motivations lay behind the timing of sexual-misconduct
allegations against TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, and he also
accused George Bush's campaign of planning religiously bigoted
television commercials.
   He provided no evidence to support his accusation on the timing
of the Swaggart story, and he declined to say who might be behind
any such effort. However, he said the vice president's campaign was
the only one in the GOP presidential race that has been engaging in
``dirty tricks.''
   Robertson's comments brought heated denials from Bush~ others
in the vice president's campaign.
   Asked about Robertson's charge during a campaign stop in St.
Louis, Bush challenged him to ``prove it.''
   Later, in London, Ky., Bush was asked if he could say his
campaign had no connection with the timing of the Swaggart story.
   ``That's a hundred percent accurate,'' he replied.
   Bush said he saw no reason anyway to connect the Swaggart story
with Robertson, himself a former television evangelist.
   ``I don't think it's fair to burden Pat Robertson with something
with Jimmy Swaggert. I don't think that's fair play,'' Bush said.
``On the other hand, if he accuses me of something, I'm perfectly
prepared to defend us.''
   In Washington, South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, Bush's
state campaign chairman, said, ``If somebody makes a specific
charge then they certainly ought to have to come forward with some
proof. I think it's a rather ridiculous charge myself.''
   Robertson said evidence indicating Swaggart had been involved
with prostitutes had lain ``dormant since last October.''
   It ``stretches the imagination and stretches credulity'' that
revelations of such allegations came two weeks ``before the most
important primary in the nation,'' the Republican candidate said
during a news conference. He was referring to the primaries and
caucuses that 20 states will hold on March 8, known as Super
Tuesday.
   ``I think somebody had something to do with it,'' said
Robertson. ``Somebody else planned all these things, I am afraid.''
   He also said Bush's campaign was guilty of dirty tricks against
him and was planning more in the form of advertisements before the
Super Tuesday primaries.
   ``They will attack my religious beliefs and practices and I'm
going to call them before it happens,'' Robertson said.
   Bush officials said that accusation wasn't true.
   Robertson declined to say what led him to make the charge.
   Concerning his statement that the Swaggart controversy was
politically orchestrated, he said a prominent journalist, whom he
declined to name, ``told me something like that might have gone
on.'' He said it was the news media's duty to determine whether or
not it was true.

Firm</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A space agency engineer who pressed for
a delay in the launch of the ill-fated space shuttle Challenger
started work Monday at the private aerospace company that built the
shuttle booster rocket.
   Judson A. Lovingood, 51, joined several other top-ranking
officials in leaving the Marshall Space Flight Center since the
seven crew members died in the Challenger explosion two years ago.
   Lovingood retired Saturday from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, where he had worked for 25 years, instead of
taking an assignment at NASA headquarters in Washington as deputy
director of systems engineering and analysis for the shuttle
program.
   ``He elected to retire in lieu of accepting the assignment for
economic and other reasons,'' said a Marshall spokesman, Dave
Drachlis. ``Dr. Lovingood has said that he has worked on the
shuttle since 1969. The Challenger accident has exacted a great
personal toll and he felt it was time for a change.''
   Lovingood's new job is technical director of Morton Thiokol.
   He said through a Thiokol spokeswoman that he will be
responsible for ``overseeing some technical activities'' at the
Huntsville division of Morton Thiokol, whose main shuttle plant is
in Utah. His activities were not specified, but he said the
company's Huntsville operation has little connection with the
shuttle program.
   Lovingood was deputy manager of the shuttle projects office at
Marshall when Morton Thiokol engineers recommended against
launching the shuttle in cold weather at Cape Canaveral on Jan. 28,
1986.
   ``I was contacted about 4:30 that afternoon (Jan. 27) by a guy
from the cape,'' Lovingood said.
   ``A point was being made and the point being that I heard that
Thiokol people were recommending that we not launch,'' he said. ``I
felt like with a recommendation like that that we shouldn't launch,
period.''
   A presidential commission that investigated the disaster
concluded that the decision-making process prior to the launch was
flawed, with the views of Morton Thiokol engineers overruled and
critical concerns not relayed to top NASA levels, where officials
were pushing for a launch.
   The commission said flawed O-rings in the booster rocket allowed
hot gases to leak through to the external fuel tank.

   Pat Robertson's campaign lawyer contended
Tuesday that the campaign has not used the $6.5 million it received
in federal matching funds even though its financial report shows it
has less than that on hand.
   The matching funds were used to secure a $5.5 million loan
during January, said campaign attorney Marion Harrison, but he
added that the campaign does not consider that was using the money.
   ``The matching funds are 100 percent in an escrow account,'' and
none has been spent, Harrison said in a telephone interview.
   When asked why the campaign's financial statement filed with the
Federal Election Commission showed $5.5 million in cash on hand, $1
million less than the matching funds he said were in the bank,
Harrison said he did not prepare the report and could not explain
it.
   Campaign aides did not return calls Monday and Tuesday to answer
questions about the report.
   Whether or not the Robertson campaign has accepted the matching
funds is significant because presidential candidates who are
declared eligible for such funds must abide by spending limits
under federal regulations.
   The Robertson campaign contends that it does not have to abide
by the limits unless it actually uses the money, and considers that
although it put the funds into its bank, it still has the option of
sending the money back and bypassing the spending limts, said
Harrison.
   ``That will be our contention if we decide not to accept them,''
Harrison said. ``It's a decision that hasn't been made yet.''
   FEC spokesman Fred Eiland said, ``That's sort of a dubious
argument, but the commission would have to answer that.''
   He noted that candidates must sign an agreement to abide by the
spending limits even before they actually get the matching funds.
   The spending cap issue is more important for Robertson than for
any other presidential candidate because he is by far the closest
to the limit.
   The cap is $23 million for the primary season plus another 20
percent, or $4.6 million, allowed for fund-raising expenses.
   As of the end of January, Robertson reported spending $17.6
million against the $23 million cap, plus $4.3 million against the
fund-raising cap.
   Those figures did not include February's spending toward the
Iowa and New Hampshire contests, Tuesday's South Dakota and
Minnesota contests or the Super Tuesday primaries in 20 states on
March 8.
   Harrison said the $5.5 million loan from Sovran Bank in Virginia
was secured, but neither he nor the bank's regional executive
officer, Earl Slattum, would disclose what collateral was required.
   The loan was bigger by far than any taken out by the other
candidates.
   Election law requires that banks treat presidential campaign
loans in the normal course of business, with no special
considerations applied.
   Slattum cited customer privacy considerations and refused to
divulge any information about Robertson's loan, the bank's general
lending practices, or even the cities included in the region
Slattum heads.
   Slattum and Harrison also declined to give the date the loan was
taken out although FEC spokesman Eiland said that is required on
the disclosure reports. The report listed the date only as January
1988.
   Robertson also used his matching funds to secure a $1.5 million
loan in December from Sovran Bank. That loan was paid back on Jan.
10.
   Robertson reported spending during January of $7.9 million, more
than any other presidential campaign, and ended the month with $5.5
million in cash on hand and $6 million in outstanding debts.

<HEAD>One Dead In Election Denounced By Church Leader, Politicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new election system in which people vote
for candidates by lining up behind them led to one death and
widespread charges of fraud, Kenya newspapers reported Tuesday.
   The purpose of Monday night's voting was to choose parliamentary
candidates for Kenya African National Union of President Daniel
arap Moi, Kenya's only legal political party.
   John Matere Keriri, who was assistant transport minister but
failed in his nomination bid, called the vote ``an absolute sham, a
fraud not an election.''
   Keriri and a few other losing candidates claimed they or their
agents were arrested and harassed by partisan officials the night
before the Monday vote and that several agents were barred from
polling stations.
   One man identified as a Keriri supporter died and two other
people were hospitalized in the northern Kirinyaga district, where
violence was used to keep some people from voting, newspapers
reported.
   The elections marked the party's first test of the new system
and a much-criticized regulation that allows nominees with more
than 70 percent of the vote to enter Parliament unopposed.
   At least 30 candidates received more than 70 percent.
   Church leaders, lawyers and a few politicians have called the
line-forming system as intimidating and said the 70-percent rule
disenfranchizes non-party members.
   Under the new system, voters lined up behind candidates and
officials took a head count.
   Government officials contend the new system will prevent
corruption and give the party rank and file a greater voice.
Candidates previously were chosen by the party chairman,
secretary-general and treasurer.
   Preliminary results indicated poor turnouts in many
constituencies. The Standard, an independent Nairobi newspaper,
reported hundreds of eligible voters milled outside some voting
locations and only a few lined up to vote.
   ``It appeared more people came as spectators than as voters,''
it said.
   Anglican Bishop David Gitari accused election officials of
trying to rig the ballots. He said the election official at one
polling station refused to count heads when more people lined up
behind Keriri than behind his opponent.
   Official tallies were expected later this week in the week.
   Presidential nominations are due Saturday but no-one is expected
to challenge Moi. He has held the office since the death of the
first president, Jomo Kenyatta, a decade ago.

   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said Tuesday that
most U.S. intelligence agences now believe the Soviet Union is
hiding hundreds of potent medium-range missiles in Europe. The
Reagan administration said his assertion is incorrect.
   Helms, commenting as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
continued its examination of the new treaty banning all
medium-range missiles in Europe, has repeatedly said estimates from
the Defense Intelligence Agency indicate the existence of at least
300 more SS-20 missiles than those declared by the Soviets.
   The senator, who opposes the treaty, said on Tuesday he now has
been told a majority of U.S. intelligence agencies support that
view.
   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-RI., the committee chairman, read an
administration statement denying that.
   The statement called the Helms assertion incorrect, and added:
``The majority of the national intelligence community does not
support the view the Soviets have withheld a number of SS-20s.''
   The statement said that all data on the number of such weapons
will be reviewed when the Soviets submit an updated report on their
medium-range missile force after the new treaty is ratified by the
Senate.
   That report will be verified by on-site inspection, the
statement said.
   It said that CIA Director William Webster, ``speaking for the
entire intelligence community, has said the (submitted) Soviet data
... `falls within (U.S.) intelligence estimates.'''
   The SS-20 is a mobile, highly accurate, medium-range missile,
each of which carries three nuclear warheads.

<TEXT>
   A former county assistant judge who was the
focus of misconduct charges against three state Supreme Court
justices has been convicted of lying under oath.
   A Vermont District Court jury found former Chittenden County
Assistant Judge Jane Wheel guilty late Monday after more than six
hours of deliberations, said court spokeswoman Harriett Eitapence.
   An attorney for Wheel, found guilty of three counts of lying
under oath, said he would try to have the verdict set aside.
   Wheel, 55, was charged in October 1986 for her actions during an
inquest earlier that year into allegations that she had padded her
paycheck.
   The prosecution maintained she lied when asked if she had
altered court files to indicate that she was sitting in court on
days she actually was elsewhere. Judges are paid for time spent
hearing cases.
   Assistant judges in Vermont are elected lay people, while
regular judges are lawyers appointed by the governor. Wheel was a
high school English teacher until her election in 1974 and had long
been active in Democratic politics.
   Lay judges, who make up the state's superior court system, hear
mostly civil cases, although before court reorganization several
years ago they also often heard criminal cases.
   The charges against Wheel, who was defeated in a September 1986
election, rocked the state's judiciary because of her association
with three Vermont Supreme Court justices.
   Misconduct charges were filed in January 1987 by the Judicial
Conduct Board against Wheel, former Supreme Court Justices William
Hill and Thomas Hayes, and Justice Ernest Gibson III, accusing them
of using their influence to help Wheel while she was under
investgation by the attorney general's office in the
paycheck-padding case.
   Hayes died last year, and charges against Gibson were dropped.
Wheel and Hill await proceedings before the conduct board.
   The board is slated to take up 12 counts against Hill on March 7.
   One of the misconduct counts alleges that Hill berated an
employee of the Chittenden County Superior Court when she walked
into a room and saw Wheel's arms around Hill.
   Another alleges that Wheel's friendship with Hill was so open
that an employee of the court called Hill at home and warned him
that unless he altered his behavior in front of Wheel it could do
serious damage to his reputation.
   Another charge alleges that Hill talked improperly outside the
courtroom with Wheel about a case that had been tried in her court
and was being appealed before him at the Supreme Court level.
   During the trial, Assistant Attorney General David Suntag
portrayed Wheel as someone who had been caught in a web of lies and
deceit as she signed her name to the court folders to cover up the
fact she had hardly sat in court on cases for a year.
   ``She lied under oath, and no amount of talking about lots of
other things and no amount of changing stories ... can change
that,'' Suntag told the jury.
   Wheel's attorney, Richard Davis, said he would move to have
Monday's verdict set aside on grounds that the evidence did not
support a guilty finding.
   During the trial, which began Jan. 25, Davis had argued that
Wheel was the victim of a vendetta by court personnel.
   Wheel faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in jail and a $10,000
fine for each of the three counts. No sentencing date had been set.

   Snow fell Tuesday from Michigan to New York, while rain dampened
areas from the Gulf Coast to New England.
   Clear to partly cloudy skies prevailed west of the Mississippi
River.
   Snow fell in southeastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and western
sections of Pennsylvania and New York, mixed with rain across parts
of northern New England and central New York.
   Heavier snowfall Tuesday morning included 6 inches at Coopers
Rock State Park in West Virginia; 5 inches in Laurel Village, Pa.;
and 3 inches at Somerset, Pa., and Chalke Hill, Pa.
   Snow showers dusted the Michigan shore of Lake Superior between
Marquette and Sault Ste. Marie.
   Rain was scattered from southern New England across southeastern
New York and eastern Pennsylvania, and the Tennessee Valley, and
fell in portions of the central Gulf Coast and central Florida.
   Gale warnings were posted along the New England coast, where
winds were clocked at 20 to 35 mph. Winds of 20 to 35 mph also were
common from the northern Plains to the upper Great Lakes, resulting
in sub-zero wind chill readings.
   Ice jams prompted flood warnings along streams near Buffalo, N.Y.
   Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 84 degrees at Homestead, Fla. The morning low was 14
below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for sunny skies over most of the
nation, with snow showers in parts of the Great Lakes region and a
few rain showers in the Florida peninsula.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the 20s and 30s from
Wyoming and Colorado across the northern half of the Plains, the
middle-Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley to
New England; the 60s in much of California, southern New Mexico,
southern Texas, northern Florida and southern Georgia; the 70s and
low 80s in the desert Southwest and southern and central Florida;
and the 40s or 50s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Yugoslavia Denies That Nasser's Son Has Political Asylum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia denied Tuesday that it
had granted political asylum to the son of former Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who is wanted for terrorism in Egypt.
   In a statement read to The Associated Press over the telephone,
a Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman also denied that Khaled Abdel
Nasser is a permanent resident of Belgrade.
   ``It is true that he periodically visits Yugoslavia like any
visitor who has a tourist visa,'' said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Nasser and 19 others were indicted in Egypt last week in
connection with four shooting attacks on Israeli and U.S. diplomats
and embassy workers in Cairo between 1984 and 1987. Two Israelis
died and six Israelis and two Americans were wounded in the
shootings.
   Nasser, 38, and 10 other defendants face possible death
sentences. The other nine could receive life sentences.
   Arab reports said Nasser had been living in Belgrade with his
family for four months and that Yugoslavia granted him political
asylum.
   ``We want to emphasize that he has never asked for nor was
granted political asylm'' in Yugoslavia, said the statement. ``He
(Nasser) is not engaged in any political activity in Yugoslavia.''
   The spokesman said that Nasser possesses a multiple-entry
tourist visa given to all those who have diplomatic passports.
   ``He has an Egyptian diplomatic passport,'' he added.
   Cairo newspapers reported that authorities in Yugoslavia had
been notified that Nasser is a fugitive sought by Interpol, the
international criminal police organization.
   The daily Al-Akhbar also said Ahmad El-Khawaga, a defense
attorney and head of the Egyptian bar association, went to Belgrade
to bring Nasser back from exile.
   Yugoslavia's late leader Josip Broz Tito was a co-founder of the
Non-Aligned Movement with Gamal Abdel Nasser. Egypt and Yugoslavia
have no extradition treaty.

   An Israeli tank was attacked while on patrol in
south Lebanon, and two Israeli soldiers were killed and two
wounded, the military command announced Tuesday.
   Lebanese security sources said earlier Tuesday that guerrillas
using rocket-propelled grenades ambushed an Israeli armored patrol
consisting of one tank and one armored personnel carrier near the
south Lebanese village of Braachit, killing two soldiers and
wounding others.
   The Israeli army announcement said the tank was hit by an
explosive device at 6 p.m. Monday near Braachit, six miles north of
the Israeli border in Israel's self-designed security zone in south
Lebanon.
   ``The explosive device was activated and as a result of that,
two soldiers were killed and two others suffered light wounds and
were rescued,'' the brief announcement said. It said Israeli
soldiers launched a search in the area.
   The announcement gave no details. The military command did not
explain why the announcement was delayed for over 24 hours.
   The Israeli fatalities in south Lebanon were the first this year.
   ``Both vehicles were raked with rocket-propelled grenades that
set off a chain of ammunition explosions in the tank. No one could
have escaped alive from the burning tank,'' said one of the
Lebanese sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the guerrillas were either Shiite Moslem fundamentalists
or pro-Syrian leftists. Both groups operate in that area.
   Israel created its six- to 10-mile-wide security zone when it
withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in June 1985, ending a
three-year occupation.
   The zone is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli soldiers assisted
by about 1,000 militiamen from the mostly Christian South Lebanon
Army, which is trained and backed by Israel.

<HEAD>Former Canadian Cabinet Member Acquitted</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ST-JEAN, Quebec (AP) _ Andre Bissonnette, who was dismissed from
the federal Cabinet after news reports linked him to a questionable
land deal, was acquitted Tuesday of four charges of fraud, breach
of trust and conspiracy.
   Normand Ouellette, Bissonnette's close friend and political
associate, was convicted of one count of fraud but acquitted of one
charge of breach of trust, one count of conspiracy to commit fraud
and one count of conspiracy to commit breach of trust.
   Charges were filed after a series of sales that tripled the
price of a piece of land in St-Jean from $800,000 to $2.98 million
in 11 days of January 1986. The Canadian dollar is worth about 79
U.S.
   Oerlikon Aerospace Inc. contracted to buy the land 13 weeks
before the federal government awarded it a $600 million contract to
build Canada's low-level air defense system.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney fired Bissonnette, 42, of St-Jean
a day after reports of the land sales were made public last year.
He had been junior transport minister.
   In Ottawa, Mulroney's office released a statement saying ``the
prime minister is very pleased that Mr. Bissonnette has been fully
exonerated by a jury of his peers.'' The statement said nothing
about Bissonnette's chances of getting back into the Cabinet.
   The jury was told to decide whether steps taken by Ouellette
that drove up the price were ``objectively dishonest,'' and whether
Bissonnette helped him.
   Judge Jean-Guy Boilard of Quebec Superior Court also instructed
the jury to determine whether Bissonnette knew of methods used by
Ouellette, who managed his blind trust.
   Prosecutors alleged that Bissonnette and Ouellette used
privileged information to profit illegally from the sale.
Bissonnette denied in court that half the profit from the final
transaction, in which Ouellette was involved, wound up in the bank
accounts of himself and his wife.
   Bissonnette smiled slightly as the verdict was read. He later
crossed the room, patted Ouellette on the back and wished him luck.
   Bissonnette, a self-made millionaire, was known as the ``Chicken
King'' of Quebec because one of his companies supplied much of the
barbecued chicken sold in restaurants in the province.
   Outside the courthouse, he shook hands with several jurors. He
thanked Mulroney for supporting him over the past 13 months and
said he would leave any decision about his political future up to
the prime minister.

<TEXT>
   The government is reviewing plans for
comprehensive screening of blood supplies for AIDS, since some
blood banks were testing only 8 percent of their supplies, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported Tuesday.
   Dr. Etim Essien, chairman of the National Adivsory Committee on
AIDS, said testing in Nigeria's nine blood banks ranged from 8 to
85 percent of supplies.
   Essien said the incidence of AIDS in Nigeria was small, but
plans for a comprehensive screening program were under review to
guard against the spread of the disease through blood transfusions.
   Essien said there were 20 known cases of AIDS in Nigeria,
Africa's most populous nation with more than 105 million people,
and the chances of getting the disease through blood transfusion
were small. He gave no details about the screening program or say
when it would be implemented.
   Essien's comments followed the launching of a $1 million
national AIDS education program.
   Meanwhile, a Lagos newspaper confirmed the death Friday of the
country's 12th AIDS victim, a Gambian national living in Nigeria.
   Professor Idris Mohammed, also speaking at the launching of the
new AIDS program, said Nigeria's AIDS victims were mostly
low-income farmers who patronized prostitutes.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a
virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible
to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

   A 28-year-old transient was being held
Tuesday in lieu of $1 million bond, accused of shooting two
plainclothes policemen and then barricading himself with hostages
in an office building.
   David Johnson was charged with two counts of attempted capital
murder in the Monday night shooting.
   Authorities alleged that Johnson, a familiar figure to officers
patrolling downtown, scuffled with police who confronted him, got
an officer's gun and opened fire.
   One of the captives, Jerry Renaud, said the gunman seemed
disoriented and contended he was being framed by police.
   ``My understanding is he had some mental problems and it's your
typical downtown problem that we've been faced with,'' City Manager
Lou Fox said Monday night.
   Meanwhile, Officer Edwin Gorrell, 33, a two-year veteran, was in
critical condition at Brooke Army Medical Center after more than 13
hours of surgery on a head wound, said hospital spokesman Robert
Clark.
   Officer Onofre Serna, 26, was in good condition at Medical
Center Hospital with a wound to his left shoulder, said hospital
spokeswoman Inez Eisazadeh.
   According to police spokesman Sgt. Paul Buske, the two officers
had stopped the man and a female companion who appeared to be
intoxicated.
   ``A struggle ensued,'' Buske said. ``One of the officers lost
his weapon. (The suspect) picked up the weapon and several shots
were fired.''
   The man took a gun, a badge and a police radio and fled into a
Travis Park Plaza building, where he took two hostages. He released
them and went to a third-floor office, where he took three hostages.
   Renaud, an accountant who was working late with others at
Deloitte, Haskins and Sells, said he at first thought the gunman
was joking, then decided to listen to the man to calm him down.
   ``He seemed disoriented at first, despondent, that he had gotten
framed,'' Renaud said Tuesday. ``He said he wasn't there to hurt
us. He said he just needed a place to hide out for the night.''
   After a few minutes, he said, he and the man got a soft drink to
cool off.
   ``Right after he got his Coke, I decided I needed a drink
desperately and poured a little Seagram's Seven in my Coke so I
could think,'' Renaud said. ``I got interrupted quite a few times
by the telephone, but I never really tried to say anything that
would upset him.''
   Renaud and his two co-workers escaped when the gunman walked
into another area to take a sixth hostage, Buske said. He
surrendered an hour later.
   The San Antonio Express-News talked to the man by telephone
Monday night. He told the newspaper he was just walking when he was
grabbed by a man with a gun and a badge.
   ``The gun just went off ... I didn't mess with nobody,'' he said.
   Gorrell and Serna were part of a downtown foot patrol aimed at
deterring street crime.
   Last month, a mentally ill homeless man shot and killed a Dallas
police officer in a downtown parking lot.

   Sen. Bob Dole fought his GOP presidential rivals in the South
Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses Tuesday as Vice President
George Bush all but conceded defeat in advance. Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis dueled Richard Gephardt and the rest of the pack
for fresh momentum in the Democratic race.
   The two states were billed as the gateway to Super Tuesday _ a
Midwestern opportunity to demonstrate electoral strength before the
March 8 festival of delegate-rich primaries and caucuses, mostly in
Southern and border states.
   Dole was rated the heavy favorite in the South Dakota Republican
primary as he bid to rebound from last week's drubbing in New
Hampshire.
   As the polls were closing, CBS News and ABC News projected that
Dole would win the Republican primary in South Dakota. CBS said
Bush and former television evangelist Pat Robertson in a tight race
for second place in the GOP race.
   ABC also projected Gephardt as the winner in South Dakota. .
   The Kansas senator also campaigned hard in Minnesota, but
Robertson dreamed of an upset and Rep. Jack Kemp made an all-out
effort as well.
   Bush, who finished third in the Iowa caucuses earlier this
month, made little effort in the two neighboring Midwestern states.
He spent little money in Minnesota and withdrew television
advertisements from South Dakota stations.
   Democrat Dukakis, fresh from a triumph in the New Hampshire
primary, aimed for a convincing win in Minnesota as he bid to
demonstrate that his candidacy has appeal outside New England. Iowa
caucus winner Gephardt, Sen. Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson also vied
for support as they sought standing in the race before the primary
and caucus calendar turned South.
   Dukakis and Gephardt each hoped for a win in a heated South
Dakota race. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. invested heavily in television
advertising, as well, hoping for a strong showing outside his
native South in advance of Super Tuesday.
   Simon, who once said he would quit the race if he failed to
score a victory in either state, stepped back from that standard
late last week and vowed to stay in the race no matter where he
finished.
   Gary Hart, his comeback candidacy in tatters after poor finishes
in Iowa and New Hampshire, campaigned hard in South Dakota.
   For Hart, Gore, Jackson and Robertson, South Dakota posed a
financial test, as well. Each man finished with less than 10
percent of the vote in New Hampshire, and a similar result in South
Dakota would deprive them of federal matching funds beginning in 30
days. A candidate can requalify by gaining 20 percent of the vote
in a future primary.
   The states offered a bewildering array of delegate selection
provisions.
   South Dakota's Democratic vote was a preferential poll designed
to serve as an advisory opinion to a statewide caucus on March 12
that will allocate 15 of the state's 19 delegates.
   But Minnesota's Democrats began the selection of 78 of the
state's 87 delegates to the party's nominating convention in
Atlanta in July.
   South Dakota's Republican primary voters picked all 18 of the
state's delegates to the GOP nominating convention in New Orleans
in August.
   Minnesota's Republicans expressed their presidential preferences
through a straw vote and selected delegates to begin the process of
picking 31 national convention delegates.

<HEAD>General Motors To Reopen Framingham Plant In May</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with GM confirming plans to reopen,
comment from Dukakis, Kennedy. Also moving on the financial wire.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. plans to reopen
its assembly plant here in May and rehire about 1,800 of the 3,700
workers who lost their jobs when it closed in November, a GM
official said Tuesday.
   Company officials were aiming for May 9 as a startup date, but
the reopening could be delayed an additional week, said GM Regional
Manager Joseph Nedrow. One shift would return to work, he said.
   ``We're hopeful ... we're going to have a second shift'' later
in the year, depending on whether car sales pick up further, Nedrow
said in a telephone interview. A formal announcement on the startup
will be made Wednesday, he said.
   Nedrow spoke shortly after Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
he had been told that GM would reopen the plant May 9. A spokesman
for Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said state officials also
had been informed the plant would reopen.
   GM closed the plant Nov. 31, blaming sluggish sales of the
midsized Chevrolet Celebrity and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera assembled
at Framingham.
   At the time, the company said it hoped to reopen the plant in
the spring. Industry analysts had predicted such a move was
unlikely because the plant is nearly 40 years old and projections
call for a continued decline in sales of the models made there.
   Attempts to reach officials of United Auto Workers Local 422 for
comment were not immediately successful. Telephone calls to the
union office were not answered.
   Dukakis, a presidential candidate, praised GM in a statement
issued by his office for keeping its pledge to reopen in the spring.
   ``But since this is only a partial reopening, I am still very
concerned about the workers who are not returning to the jobs at
the plant.''
   ``I commend GM for this decision,'' Kennedy said. ``I will
continue to work with GM and the UAW to resume full production as
soon as possible.''

<HEAD>Senate Filibuster Over Campaign Spending Limits Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Tops with 3 grafs to UPDATE with filibuster continuing,
picking up 2nd pvs, bgng: We've decided</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

   The Senate launched a ``full-fledged
filibuster'' Tuesday as Majority Leader Robert Byrd ordered 24-hour
sessions to subdue Republican opposition to a Democratic campaign
financing bill.
   The talking, broken by occasional roll calls, began about 2 p.m.
and continued into the night. Appointments were canceled, schedules
revised, senators began catching up on paperwork and cots were set
up in rooms near the chamber.
   Byrd, lacking the votes to prevent Republicans from stalling
action on the legislation, threatened to keep the Senate in session
indefinitely.
   ``We've decided we'll just go around-the-clock,'' the West
Virginia Democrat said at midafternoon after Republican and
Democratic negotiators reported making no progress on the central
question of spending limits.
   ``We're going to talk or we're going to vote,'' said Byrd,
warning that foes of the campaign finance legislation would have to
keep control of the floor to prevent a vote.
   Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a
year over a Democratic bill with 52 co-sponsors that would set up a
system of voluntary spending limits for Senate general election
campaigns.
   The limit would be from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a
state's population. The bill's supporters say limits are needed to
put a brake on the increasing cost of getting elected, up from an
average of $600,000 in 1976 to $3 million in 1986.
   In larger states, growing numbers of candidates are spending
more than $10 million to win a Senate seat, with increasing amounts
of campaign funds being supplied by special-interest political
action committees.
   A candidate observing the voluntary limit would get campaign
funds from the Treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or an
independent group spent large amounts of money against the
candidate.
   Republicans, who have made opposition to limits a party issue,
succeeded last year in preventing the Senate from voting on the
legislation, winning a record seven cloture votes during 22 days of
floor time.
   Byrd, even with the support of three of the Senate's 46
Republicans, is believed to be five votes short of the 60 needed to
cut off debate and force a vote on the bill.
   ``The Senate is in a full-fledged filibuster,'' said Byrd,
adding that he would no longer confine debate to daylight hours.
   ``There's no point in continuing the casual, gentlemanly,
good-guy filibuster because it will just turn out like it did last
year,'' he said. ... Let's have it on the floor where the American
people can see it.''
   Four Democrats and four Republicans have been negotiating since
last week. They reported progress on some facets of the bill but
not on spending limits, which Republicans say will discriminate
against them in states with a heavy Democratic edge in registered
votes.
   The chief negotiators said their positions on the key issue were
solid.
   A limit on spending ``is something this side is not going to
agree to,'' said Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ``That is not one of the
negotiable items.''
   His counterpart, David Boren, D-Okla., was just as adamant:
``Any bill that does not limit campaign spending would not be real
reform.''
   Boren said, however, that Democrats are willing to discuss
higher spending limits in states where their party enjoys a big
advantage in registration or historically has dominated
congressional elections.
   There was no public response from McConnell, who said
Republicans were willing to discuss compromise on another
Democratic demand: putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate
can get from political action committees.
   Boren and McConnell said negotiators had neared informal
agreement on other issues, including controling how much personal
money a millionare can put into his or her campaign; requiring
broadcasters to charge rock-bottom rates for political ads; better
disclosure of money going to political parties; and getting
controls on so-called ``soft money,'' which includes groups like
labor unions supplying people to help candidates with canvassing
and phone banks.

   Democrats who chose a candidate in the final
days of the South Dakota primary race went strongly Tuesday for
Rep. Richard Gephardt, who employed aggressive television
advertising in his winning campaign.
   Among the Republicans, network exit polls said, conservative
voters helped Pat Robertson challenge Vice President George Bush
for second place, while Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas won with broad
support.
   A third of the Democratic voters told CBS News they made up
their minds in the last three days of the race, and 45 percent of
them backed Gephardt, compared to 23 percent for Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis. Gephardt had trumpeted a key endorsement and
attacked Dukakis in television advertising.
   Gephardt and Dukakis, who finished second, split the liberal
vote. But Gephardt won the moderate and conservative Democrats, won
the male vote while splitting the female vote with Dukakis, and won
among the less wealthy and the less educated, again splitting the
others with Dukakis, the polls suggested.
   Surprisingly, the NBC News poll found that a plurality of South
Dakota Democrats, 46 percent, said they believed Dukakis eventualy
will win the presidential nomination, even though not all voted for
him.
   On the Republican side, Bush's identification with President
Reagan failed to help his cause, the same problem Bush suffered in
the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8, the polls indicated. Bush finished third
in Iowa to Dole and Robertson.
   Dole won the Republican primary, Bush and Robertson were locked
in a race that was too close to call and Rep. Jack Kemp was a
distant fourth.
   Gephardt won the Democratic race, Dukakis was running second and
the remaining candidates were tightly bunched well back.
   Dole campaigned determinedly in South Dakota, while Bush steered
clear of the state. The exit polls indicated that Dole won strongly
in nearly all categories; ABC News, for example, found that Dole
won more than seven in 10 liberals and moderates and four in 10
conservatives.
   Robertson was second among conservatives, with 27 percent in
ABC's poll, according to network poll analyst Doug Muzzio. Kemp was
well back, with 8 percent of conservatives.
   CBS said Robertson, a former television evangelist, won support
from 51 percent of evangelical Christians, who made up about a
fifth of the Republican electorate.
   Republicans who support President Reagan helped Bush win the New
Hampshire primary. But in South Dakota nearly half of the
Republicans who favor Reagan _ 56 percent of the total _ went for
Dole, ABC found. About a quarter each backed Bush and Robertson.
   Among the losing Democrats, NBC found that former Sen. Gary Hart
of Colorado, who won the state in his 1984 bid for the nomination,
was viewed unfavorably this year by twice as many South Dakotans as
viewed him favorably. Roughly 60 percent said they were not pleased
that Hart re-entered the race after withdrawing last summer amid
questions about his marital fidelity.
   The CBS survey had a margin of sample error of 4 percent; ABC's
was 5 percent and NBC's was 3 percent. The networks did not poll in
Minnesota, which held precinct caucuses Tuesday rather than
primaries.

   Navy Secretary James Webb's abrupt resignation
blew the lid off his split with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
and revealed bitter infighting at the Pentagon as it grapples with
budget cuts after years of Reagan-era increases.
   Webb resigned Monday and decided to air some dirty linen on the
way out, accusing Carlucci of needlessly sinking the
administration's dream of building a 600-ship fleet.
   He further accused Carlucci of ordering him to lie about
internal budget fighting, saying the defense chief had written him
a note saying he should deny news stories reporting it was the
Defense Department _ and not the Navy _ proposing to mothball ships.

   Repentant television evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart must stop preaching for three months and undergo a
two-year rehabilitation and counseling, church leaders decided
after questioning him about his sexual misconduct.
   ``We accept his confession of specific incidents of a moral
failure,'' Cecil Janway, Louisiana District superintendent of the
Assemblies of God said late Monday night. ``Based on his detailed
confession and the evidence we observed of true humility and
repentance, we have offered him rehabilitation.''
   Janway made the announcement after Swaggart met here for more
than 9 hours with the state council of the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination.
   Photographs allegedly showing Swaggart with a prostitute
reportedly were given to church officials by New Orleans evangelist
Marvin Gorman, who had once filed a $90 million suit charging
Swaggart with unjustly accusing him of numerous affairs.
   Swaggart has not publicly described his misconduct, and the
state council urged him not to.

   Republican presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson, who objects to being called a former television
evangelist, claims ``somebody planned'' the Jimmy Swaggart scandal
to embarrass him before the Super Tuesday elections.
   Swaggart, a television evangelist accused of sexual misconduct,
was ordered Monday by the hierarchy of his church in Baton Rouge,
La., to limit his preaching and enter counseling.
   Robertson said Monday that the eruption of the Swaggart
controversy two weeks before the March 8 round of primaries and
caucuses is no coincidence.

   FBI agents and informants sent to spy on
anti-Reagan activists collected so much information on peaceful
protest activities that bureau headquarters was worried they went
too far, once-secret documents show.
   FBI officials were called before the Senate Intelligence
Committee today to account for the more than two-year
investigation, which produced no criminal charges but gave the
government reams of information about opponents of President
Reagan's Central America policies.
   Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act have
shown that the investigation initially was targeted at one group,
the Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador. But FBI
files eventually included information on hundreds of other
individuals and groups, ranging from Roman Catholic nuns to union
leaders who opposed Reagan policies.

   Caspar Weinberger is going to Buckingham Palace to
receive an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II, the highest
royal honor Britain bestows on foreigners.
   Today's ceremony doesn't mean the former U.S. defense secretary
will become Sir Caspar _ that accolade is reserved for the queen's
own subjects _ but it's Britain's way of saying thanks for being an
exceptionally good friend.
   The 70-year-old Weinberger, who counts Winston Churchill among
his heroes, also has to forgo the ceremony of kneeling before the
queen as a commoner, being tapped on both shoulders with a sword,
and arising as a knight. That, too, is only for British subjects.

   Its partners included three former U.S. senators, a one-time New

lavish headquarters on Park Avenue, it had major branches in
Beverly Hills, Miami and Washington, D.C., and smaller offices
throughout the United States and abroad. Its clients included
Citibank, Shearson Lehman Brothers and real estate developer Donald
Trump.
   By the end of the year, Finley, Kumble was gone _ ``vaporized,''
says founder Steven Kumble _ and its lawyers were hiring lawyers
for the battle over what remained: an $83 million debt.
   ``The fabric of a law firm is a very delicate thing,'' Kumble
says now. ``If you tear it, it can unravel very quickly. And that
is what happened in this case.''
   Ambition, jealousy and greed were the instruments of destruction
at Finley, Kumble, where top partners waged internal warfare and
borrowed money to pay their own salaries, which were among the
highest in the profession.
   As the yarn unraveled publicly in the legal press last fall, the
profession looked on with morbid fascination tinged with glee and a
bit of introspection.
   Finley, Kumble was never popular among other lawyers and judges.
It was too big, too brash, too noisy and didn't play by the old
rules. It lacked gentility. But for all its excesses, the firm
embodied many of the changes that have been sweeping the legal
profession for the last two decades.
   Law firms once operated like exclusive, private clubs.
   Now, large firms are absorbing smaller ones. Partners, who once
considered a change in firms to be tantamount to divorce, are doing
what many married couples have done in recent years _ finding new
partners. Firms that 20 years ago were unlikely to have even one
branch office outside their home city are now spreading around the
globe.
   Finley, Kumble was among the biggest of the national superfirms.
It didn't grow ``organically,'' like the old establishment firms;
when it wanted new partners, it went out and bought them. In many
respects, Finley, Kumble operated more like the multinational
corporations it served than the law firms it challenged.
   ``I do think it's a harbinger of sorts,'' said Richard Abel, a
professor of law at the University of California at Los Angeles who
is studying the development of the legal profession. ``Certainly
many lawyers are viewing it as a cautionary tale, and a worrisome
one.''
   Finley, Kumble was founded in 1968 by eight New York lawyers led
by Kumble, a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School who
was 35 years old at the time. Kumble says he had no grand plan _ he
just wanted to practice law.
   The firm grew gradually in its first decade. By 1978, it had 70
lawyers, all still in New York. They were doing very well.
   ``Basically, the firm grew because we ... expanded to meet the
needs of our clients,'' says Kumble. ``We didn't set out to grow;
we set out to build a law practice.''
   Things began to change in 1978. Recognizing the growing
importance of Los Angeles as a financial and corporate center,
Finley, Kumble took on Marshall Manley as its first California
partner and allowed him to begin building the firm's first branch
office in Beverly Hills.
   As it grew, the California office began to challenge the
dominance of New York. In 1983, in a bitter power struggle, Manley
persuaded management to let him become co-managing partner along
with Kumble.
   By then, Finley, Kumble had 283 lawyers, only 100 of them in New
York. There were 86 lawyers in Beverly Hills, 63 in a new
Washington office, 26 in Miami and eight in San Diego. The firm was
on the move.
   In the next four years, Finley, Kumble would more than double in
size and open new offices in Chicago, Dallas, Baltimore, downtown
Los Angeles, Baton Rouge, La., Tallahassee, Palm Beach and Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., Newport Beach and Sacramento, Calif., and London.
   It would recruit former Sens. Paul Laxalt, Russell Long and
Joseph Tydings to join former New York Gov. Hugh Carey and former
New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Sr.
   It would become one of the most high-profile firms in the
country, with lawyers and legal publications constantly discussing
its aggressive tactics and its philosophy of ``meritocracy,'' in
which lawyers were said to be rewarded according to the business
they generated, not the years they served.
   But the battle for control of the firm continued. First it was
Manley; after he left in 1986, it was a new partner, Harvey
Myerson, who struggled with Kumble.
   The showdown came in February 1987. At a management committee
meeting in Miami, the firm's officers voted to strip Kumble of
power, which fell to Myerson and Robert Washington Jr., head of the
Washington office.
   The expansion continued, but through that spring and summer,
unsettling reports made the rounds among lower-level partners.
According to these partners, the rumors said the firm was in debt _
deeply in debt.
   New York partner Peter Fass says the bottom line for him was the
discovery, just a few months after he joined the firm in January
1987, that more than half the firm's profits were borrowed.
   ``The ship was already underwater when I got there, but I didn't
know about it,'' Fass said. ``A lot of people who had been there
for a number of years had no inkling what was going on.''
   What was going on, many partners later charged, was that the
managing partners had hidden the borrowing by creating a separate
corporation that took out bank loans to buy up the firm's accounts
receivable _ the unpaid bills of clients.
   This money was then used to pay the generous salaries of the
firm's superstar lawyers, many of them lured in the firm's final
year of furious expansion. Laxalt and Long were said to have been
offered $800,000 a year.

   In September, the borrowing scheme was divulged publicly in an
extraordinary front-page article in The American Lawyer magazine by
editor Steven Brill. It was titled, ``Bye, Bye, Finley, Kumble,''
and it was prophetic.
   ``It was devastating,'' said one Los Angeles partner, who, like
many people interviewed for this article would speak only on
condition of anonymity. ``That article, I think, was really the
beginning of the end.''
   In it, Brill not only laid bare Finley, Kumble's financial
morass in excruciating detail, he also castigated the firm for what
he viewed as a misplaced sense of priorities.
   ``It has become a place,'' wrote Brill, ``where the only
corporate culture is money, where things like pro bono (charitable
legal work) or collegiality are sissy stuff _ which means that when
the money dries up, even temporarily, there's no other glue there,
no shared values, to hold the place together.''
   Toward the end of the summer, lawyers were leaving Finley,
Kumble in growing numbers. After Brill's article, the stream turned
to a torrent. By the beginning of December, branches were closing
and it became apparent that the firm could not survive. On Dec. 21,
at a sparsely attended meeting in New York, the remaining partners
voted to disband as of Jan. 4.
   A four-member liquidation committee is now sorting the firm's
accounts, trying to determine how its assets stack up against the
$83 million debt. One Washington partner estimates that as much as
$60 million can be squeezed out of the firm's real estate, accounts
receivable and other assets. But he said the process could take
years.
   ``I'm sure that five years from now there will still be some
quivering in the corpse,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, two lawsuits have been filed by California partners
Richard Osborn and David Ellsworth, and others are expected. Osborn
and Ellsworth allege that they were misled about the financial
health of the firm and should not be responsible for repaying the
debt.
   Four banks have sued, charging that all partners are responsible
and that some assets have been hidden. Some partners who have
signed individual settlements with the banks were not named in the
suit, and more such settlements are likely.
   What went wrong at Finley, Kumble? The consensus is that the
firm grew too far, too fast, exercising questionable business
judgment along the way.
   Its level of borrowing was ``almost unheard of'' among law
firms, according to Jack Kaufman, chairman of an American Bar
Association committee on law office management and president of
Hildebrandt Inc., the nation's largest legal management consulting
firm.
   ``In fact, until recently, law firms didn't borrow, period,''
Kaufman said.
   Kumble counters that the firm's loans were no different from
those employed by many corporations. ``It was a big business, and
it borrowed like big businesses do,'' he said.
   The problem, he said, was that when adversity began driving
partners away from the firm, those remaining couldn't support the
debt. And as they realized that, they left too.
   And what of Brill's contention that Finley, Kumble lacked the
loyalty, friendship and shared goals that hold law firms together,
that it was a place to do business, nothing more?
   ``I've had more conversations with other people in two weeks
than I had in 11 months at Finley, Kumble,'' said Fass, now at
another Manhattan firm. ``There, nobody cared what you did so long
as you brought in money.''
   Still, Finley, Kumble's basic business strategy _ national
growth, corporate-style aggressiveness _ was far from unique.
   Ten years ago, only two law firms in the United States had more
than seven branches, according to UCLA's Abel. In 1987, there were
13 such firms. Ten years ago, no firm had more than 300 lawyers. In
1987, there were 38.
   Abel said the growth has been disproportionate among the
lowest-paid attorneys, the associates, whose fees help pad the
profits of increasingly wealthy partners.
   Others say simply that the growth has been triggered by a new
intensity in competition that has forced firms to reach out for new
business.
   ``It's gotten to be a very tough, competitive marketplace,''
Kaufman said.
   Kumble, who is now chairman of Lincolnshire Management, a firm
that arranges and finances leveraged buyouts, prided himself as a
seer of the legal profession, often to the irritation of his
competitors. He is giving no ground now.
   ``I think a lot of firms are emulating what Finley, Kumble did,
in terms of being a national law firm, in terms of lateral
recruitment (of partners), in terms of expansion, and I think that
will continue,'' he said.
   ``The problem we had is that our management committee became
very politicized. ... I don't think the concept was flawed. I think
the combination of people we had didn't work cohesively. It wasn't
the concept _ it was the people.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Empress of African Song</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANNIA CLEATON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite her opposition to apartheid, despite her
work as a U.N. delegate, despite her award-winning efforts for
human rights, Miriam Makeba insists she is an artist _ not a
politician.
   It was as an artist that the empress of African song first spoke
out against the system of discrimination in South Africa,
testifying before the United Nations Special Committee on Apartheid
in 1963. In retaliation, South Africa banned her records.
   ``Afterward, I tell the press, `I am not a politician or a
diplomat,''' Makeba writes in her recently published autobiography
``Makeba: My Story,'' written with James Hall (New American
Library, $18.95).
   ``I am just a singer, I say. But in South Africa, when the
authorities learn of my testimony, I become something else: a
criminal.''
   ``Makeba: My Story,'' recounts some of the joy and sadness in
the life of one of South Africa's most acclaimed singers, who has
been in exile from her native country since 1959.
   She decided to write her autobiography five years ago. ``I never
really wanted to write a book. Besides, I don't know how to write.''
   However, Makeba said, friends convinced her of the book's
importance; she was ``the first artist to leave the country and
make some type of impact on the world'' while not forgetting the
problems that exist in South Africa.
   ``They said that if anything should happen to me, others could
write whatever they wanted without my being able to say whether
it's true or false,'' she said.
   ``It was so hard. Every time I read it, I just cry. This morning
I was looking at the book. ... I looked at it for maybe for 10
minutes and I was crying.''
   The book coincides with the release of ``Sangoma,'' the singer's
first American album since the late 1960s. It is a collection of 19
African songs, sung in three languages. The songs were taught to
Makeba by her mother, who was a Sangoma, the South African term for
a healer in close communication with ancestral spirits.
   ```Sangoma' is the most personal record I've made,'' Makeba
said. ``I like the songs because every time I sing them I think
about my mother because she sung them.''
   Born in Johannesburg on March 4, 1932, with the Xhosa tribal
name Zensile, Makeba has survived bitter personal and career
setbacks.
   When she was just 18 days old, she went to jail for six months
with her mother, who had illegally brewed homemade beer to support
the family. Later, after her mother was released, the family moved
to Pretoria, where they endured the hardship of apartheid.
   At a young age, she found joy in singing. Some of the songs
protested her country's white minority regime: The songs were a way
she and others could demonstrate their defiance in school and
church choruses.
   Makeba started her professional career in 1952. She was chosen
as the female vocalist for one of the country's top bands, the
Manhattan Brothers.
   In 1955 she accepted a small role in the documentary, ``Come
Back Africa,'' based on the life of a murdered black boxer. Harry
Belafonte spotted her in the film, helped her to obtain a visa and
then boosted her career when she arrived in the United States in
1959.
   She writes in her book that Belafonte _ or ``Big Brother,'' as
she calls him _ gave her this advice: ``You must always be careful
how you conduct yourself on stage and off, because some day you
will have a chance to speak on behalf of your people.''
   With her ``click'' singing and deep but lilting voice, Makeba
created a sensation in her first American TV appearances and New
York club dates, and she was received by the late Ethiopian Emperor
Haile Selassie, Cuban President Fidel Castro, the late President
John F. Kennedy and other world leaders.
   In 1960, her mother died and she wished to return home to visit
her grave and see relatives. She went to the South African
consulate in New York.
   ``The man at the desk takes my passport. He does not speak to
me, but to himself when he says, `Miriam Makeba,' as if he was
expecting this moment,'' she writes. ``He takes a rubber stamp and
slams it down on my passport. Then he walks away. I pick up my
passport. It is stamped `INVALID.'''
   She has not been allowed to return to South Africa since.
   Her troubles were not limited to her native land. She has been
married five times, including once to South African trumpet player
Hugh Maskela, but her career in the United States was most affected
by her marriage to black activist Stokely Carmichael.
   ``I never had any problems with the officials in this country,
it's just that when I married Stokely ... many concerts that were
booked for me were canceled _ I guess because some people took my
marriage so personally,'' she said.
   ``And when that happened I had a tour planned in Europe, so I
just packed up and went to some of my friends in Guinea.''
   Her friendship with Guinea's president, Sequo Toure, led to her
work as a Guinean delegate to the United Nations.
   More recently, Makeba completed six months as a special guest on
Paul Simon's Graceland World Tour, which included her long-awaited
return to the United States.
   ``When we went to Zimbabwe, it was another experience,'' she
said. ``Just looking out from the stage and seeing all those people
tight in the stadium. Black people, white people _ from all walks
of life _ just swaying together to the music. It was so beautiful.
   ``It made me almost cry, because I said why can't it be like
that just next door. Because we were right next door from home.''
   Makeba hopes that one day she will return to South Africa.
   ``I guess if I stop believing that I will go home, there would
really be no purpose for anything,''she said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Are Humans Fundamentally Aggressive?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1972, Shirley Strum found herself alone with
a troop of baboons among the spare, scattered acacia trees on the
plains of East Africa, a jacket knotted around her waist and a
clipboard in her hand.
   A graduate student in anthropology at the University of
California, Berkeley, Strum had been dispatched to Kenya to observe
the baboons. She knew little about them. And she knew less about
survival in the African wilderness.
   ``It was only total ignorance of what I was getting into that
gave me the courage to go,'' she said recently in an interview.
   Strum was supposed to stay in Kenya for 18 months, just long
enough to collect the data she would need to write a Ph.D. thesis.
Instead, she made Kenya her home.
   By 1976, her studies had grown into the Gilgil Baboon Project.
She now employs six full-time researchers.
   Strum has written a lively, personal account of the project in
``Almost Human'' (Random House, $22.50). She was in New York to
promote the book, which synthesizes the ideas she has developed
during 15,000 hours of watching baboons in Kenya during the past 15
years.
   In ``Almost Human,'' she compares the behavior of the olive
baboon, Papio anubis, to the behavior of Homo sapiens. Her studies,
vividly recounted in the book, challenge the accepted wisdom that
baboons are brute, aggressive beasts. In so doing, the studies have
changed her thinking about human nature.
   ``If baboons were aggressive, then the killer ape was where we
started from,'' she said. Early baboon studies formed part of the
underpinning for the idea widely popularized in the 1960s by the
writer Robert Ardrey that a ``killer ape'' lurks inside each of us.
Humans are fundamentally aggressive, Ardrey wrote in ``African
Genesis,'' and nothing we do can change that; we can only control
it.
   That is not what Strum found, however. She draws an engaging
picture of baboons as sophisticated creatures who prefer
negotiation and persuasion to aggression.
   The old picture was of a society in which males held all power
and used force to attain dominance. Strum found that males were
transients and that they did not arrange themselves in a hierarchy
with dominant males on top. She found that females were the stable
core of baboon troops, and were ranked in a dominance hierarchy.
Females _ not males _ were the linchpins of baboon society.
   They did not, however, exert their dominance over the males.
``It turns out to be a society where there is a complementarity of
roles,'' Strum said. ``Even if you have dominance and aggression in
the traditional sense, it doesn't explain everything.''
   No one suggests that the hominids, or human-like creatures, that
gave rise to humans resembled baboons. But, said Strum, if baboons
had developed to the point where they no longer relied on naked
aggression, then humanity's early ancestors probably did too.
   ``It's impossible for me to believe that the early hominids were
less sophisticated than baboons,'' she said. Thus our early
ancestors may have abandoned aggressive social practices long ago.
   Strum grew up in San Diego, and she had no plans to become an
anthropologist when she left home in 1965 for the University of
California. But the turmoil of those years in Berkeley made a mark
on her.
   ``As I lived through the Free Speech movement and the Vietnam
War protests, I found myself confronting, over and over, questions
about human nature, about what was innate and impossible to modify
and what was flexible and worth changing,'' she writes.
   She drifted in and out of the psychology and sociology
departments before fixing on anthropology. She fell under the spell
of Sherwood Washburn, a leading American anthropologist who had
done some of the first observations of baboons in the 1950s and
'60s. It was Washburn who said: ``Go out and watch baboons.''
   That's what she did for six years, keeping careful records of
her observations. In June 1978, at a conference on baboon behavior
organized by Strum, she presented her findings to her colleagues.
``The 10 worst days of my life followed,'' she writes.
   Other baboon watchers at the conference couldn't accept her
conclusions, or her methods. When she arrived in Kenya, she decided
to follow baboons on foot, rather than watching from a van, as her
predecessors had done. That was partly what enabled her to learn so
much about baboon society. ``Rival baboon watchers criticized me,''
she writes. ``I was `interfering,' ruining the baboons!''
   It took time, but Strum overcame her disillusionment with her
colleagues and won many of them over. As that crisis resolved,
however, she faced a crisis of a different sort in Africa: The
baboons she had come to know so intimately were in danger; the
undeveloped ranch on which they had been allowed to roam had been
sold, and it was being divided into 5-acre and 10-acre parcels. The
baboons' wilderness would soon be farmland.
   Strum and her colleagues made preparations to do the unthinkable
_ to relocate the baboons to another wilderness area. No one had
ever attempted to move a group of non-human primates from one
wilderness area to another.
   The search for a new location proved difficult, but at the last
minute a site was found. The animals were difficult to capture.
They were being moved to an area where they would have to learn to
eat new foods. Would they survive?
   They would. ``It's been a great success,'' Strum said. The
animals adapted well, and with Strum's help, survived a dry period
shortly after arriving at their new home. The success of the move
has made translocation an option for conservationists, she said.
   ``Unwittingly, the baboons had given me much over the years,
personally and scientifically,'' she writes. ``Now I had been able
to reciprocate by giving them a chance for a better future.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Tom Wopat Battling ``Good Ole Boy'' Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former ``Dukes of Hazzard'' star Tom
Wopat is battling his spirited ``good ole boy'' image with love
songs and a new TV show about modern family issues.
   Wopat is starring in the new CBS-TV drama, ``Blue Skies,'' and
is maintaining a singing career with country music-oriented songs
that have a more romantic feel than driving souped-up cars as the
adventurous Luke Duke.
   ``Blue Skies'' is scheduled to begin this spring and the action
involves coping with contemporary issues such as aging and
alcoholism rather than rural escapades with his blond buddy John
Schneider.
   ``It was a golden opportunity to be involved with fine persons
and escape the `good ole boy' stereotype,'' the 36-year-old Wopat
said. ``I'm a totally different character. In `Dukes,' everything
was fantasy. In `Blue Skies,' it's straightforward and as near to
life as possible.
   ``I feel it's the type of show the public is looking for as
shown by the success of `Our House,''' he said. ``It's about three
generations of family and the problems of the parents and their
families.''
   Wopat and Schneider, and their high powered car, the General
Lee, co-starred in ``Dukes of Hazzard'' for seven seasons beginning
in 1978. Since then, both have gone on to country music careers and
remained in acting.
   He and Schneider just reunited in a holiday special, ``Christmas
Comes to Willow Creek,'' which did well in the ratings. He sees
Schneider six to 10 times a year.
   ``I love him dearly,'' he said. ``He's like a brother. We shared
so much and we were in so many scenes together. We genuinely liked
each other and had the same interests.
   ``We decided from the beginning it was going to be fun and we'd
enjoy it and I think this came across on the screen. It's not
common to have two leading men who got along as we did.''
   Looking back on the highly rated ``Dukes,'' Wopat said it was
popular because it was different.
   ``Until then, urban half-hour comedies were on. We were a new
rural show that was action oriented with some violence and exciting
stunts. It was a calculated approach: a dark-haired boy, a
light-haired boy, a mean old man, a nice old man, a comical old
man, a pretty girl.
   ``It was pure entertainment. Kids could watch it with older
people. There was no cussing and no sex except for (Catherine
Bach's) legs. There was a little moral message once in a while and
it was oriented to family, not like `Dallas' or `Dynasty.'
   ``There were imitators, but we outlasted them all. No show will
ever be seen again like it. The cost is too high.''
   Wopat, who directed some episodes of ``Dukes,'' is selecting
songs now for his second album. The first was ``Tom Wopat: A Little
Bit Closer.'' A cut from the album, ``A Little Bit Closer,'' is the
current release and has zipped up the country music charts.
   Two previous songs have reached the Top 20 on the charts: ``The
Rock and Roll of Love'' and ``Susannah.'' He and his band,
Southwind, do four to eight shows a month.
   Since ``Dukes,'' he has performed in two stage musicals,
``Carousel'' in Washington, and off-Broadway in ``Olympus on My
Mind.''
   He's not done quite as well musically as Schneider, who's had
No. 1 country music songs such as ``I've Been Around Enough to
Know,'' ``What's a Memory Like You (Doing in a Love Like This)''
and ``Country Girls.''
   ``It's been a long and frustrating process except when you have
a passion for it,'' Wopat said about his music career. ``We're
looking for a song to make a big difference _ that big hit that
changes everything.
   ``I'm still in the process of making believers out there in my
commitment to country music. I think I can broaden the base of
country music because of my visibility on TV. I'm optimistic about
my future in country music. I think I'll be here for a long time.''
   Wopat, who was raised on a small dairy farm in Lodi, Wis., says
he watches very little television these days, mostly ``Cheers'' and
reruns of ``The Andy Griffith Show.'' He hasn't seen reruns of
``Dukes of Hazzard'' for a long time.
   ``I have them all on tape. I got one out a while ago and looked
at how I directed it.'

somewhere before. You have if you listen to Side 1.
   The most noteworthy thing about this album is that it marks only
the second time these two longtime studio musicians have recorded
together. The first time was in 1954.
   However, the title is ``Serious Swingers,'' and this album
doesn't pretend to be any more than a good time _ incidental music
for a Saturday night.
   In the jungle of over-produced pop jazz and fusion albums, there
is a place for people who want to swing, to plow straight ahead in
familar fields. Yet, this record somehow leaves an empty feeling.
All the chops are just right, the solos just free enough that you
know they weren't charted, the mix of ballad and swing ever so
correct.
   A solid rythym section drives Bill Perkins' tenor sax and Bud
Shank's alto.
   But the bottom line is this material has been done before and
better by many. If you want the real thing instead of an homage,
check out early Miles Davis or Thelonious Monk or Charlie Mingus.

   Jimmy Rowles-Red Mitchell (Contemporary) _ ``I'm Glad There Is
You''
   
   This is a collection of simply played standards, spare in
phrase, but beautifully executed.
   Jimmy Rowles' lilting piano combines with the delicate brush
work of Colin Bailey on Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``It Might as
Well Be Spring'' to create music mindful of the first scents of
early April.
   On the title track, Rowles brings out the passion those simple
words have exchanged by trusting lovers. Stacy Rowles' charming
trumpet solo to close the piece seconds the emotion.
   Red Mitchell shows his style without imposing on any of the
arrangements with that need that bass players sometimes exhibit to
prove they can do more than keep the beat.
   There is no flash in this record, only clean playing that sets a
pleasant, content mood.

<HEAD>Strike Threats, Labor Bitterness at Pan Am, Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's biggest and best-known airlines are facing
strike threats over wages, benefits and concessions that reflect
growing hostility between labor and management in the intensely
competitive deregulated industry.
   Pan Am Corp. and the union representing 4,500 ground employees
in 14 cities remained deadlocked Monday following the breakup of
their talks. Union leaders in New York threatened to call a strike
at any time and vowed ``guerrilla war'' tactics that included
losing passenger bags and canceling reservations.
   At the same time in Minneapolis, flight attendants at Northwest
Airlines voted by a 94.4 percent majority to strike this weekend if
a contract dispute over wages and benefits is not resolved.
   ``The strike authorization of 94.4 percent refects the
deplorable state of labor relations at Northwest Airlines,'' said
Jeff Musto, spokesman for the Teamsters Local 2747 representing
6,500 Northwest attendants.
   Officials at both airlines said managers would replace strikers
in the event of walkouts and predicted minimal disruption. But the
threat of a labor rebellion at Pan Am already appeared to be
discouraging potential passengers.
   ``It's a very bad situation for everybody,'' said David Perlman,
president of DMS Travel in midtown Manhattan. ``Some people are
shying away (from Pan Am flights).''
   Perlman said his agency has been using double bookings as an
insurance technique for customers booked on Pan Am flights. For
passengers taking Pan Am from Kennedy airport to Europe on Monday
night, for example, he also booked them on flights offered by other
airlines to the same destinations.
   The union threats against Pan Am came against a background of
staggering losses for the eighth-largest U.S. airline, which once
dominated overseas travel but has been struggling over the past
several years because of high costs and growing competition from
other carriers, a partial result of airline deregulation a decade
ago.
   Pan Am management has demanded $35 million in concessions from
the Teamsters, who control ground workers at Boston, Detroit,
Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Honolulu,
Houston, Washington, New York and the Florida cities of Tampa,
Orlando and Miami.
   Prospects of a strike disruption at Northwest were considered
less severe, partly because flight attendants are the most easily
replaced of all airline workers. But the carrier's machinists and
pilots unions have not said whether they would honor a strike by
flight attendants.
   Northwest and its major unions have been engrossed in talks on
new contracts since the 1986 merger with Republic Airlines, another
result of deregulation, which made Northwest the fifth-biggest U.S.
airline.
   Many former Republic employees are paid less than their
Northwest counterparts, a cause of friction between the airline and
its unions.
   Northwest's latest proposal to the Teamsters offers immediate
elimination of pay gaps between former Northwest and former
Republic flight attendants. The union claims the company is
compensating by reducing vacation pay and retirement benefits.

<HEAD>Judge Thwarts Ohio Takeover Law, Part of Federated's Anti-Campeau
Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio's new anti-takeover law, a key element of
Federated Department Stores Inc.'s strategy to thwart a hostile
acquisition by Canadian developer Campeau Corp., has been
invalidated by a federal judge.
   The ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin was regarded
as at least a temporary victory for Campeau, which has been
pursuing the Cincinnati-based retailing giant with a takeover offer
valued at $5.4 billion.
   Rubin granted Campeau's request for a preliminary injunction
against the new statute, which was passed as an addition to the
state's existing takeover law. He said the new measure
unconstitutionally discriminated against certain businesses and was
an improper regulation of interstate commerce.
   Mike Webb, a spokesman for the Ohio attorney general's office,
said state officials had not decided whether to appeal the ruling.
A Federated spokesman declined comment.
   Federated stock rose 50 cents a share Monday to $60.75 in active
New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The ruling removed one legal obstacle to Campeau's efforts to
acquire Federated, which has been spurning the Canadian concern's
offers.
   Campeau has a pending $61 a share hostile tender offer, totaling
about $5.4 billion. It also has made an alternative offer to
acquire the retailer for $66 a share, about $5.8 billion, in a
definitive merger agreement.
   The Toronto-based company had indicated the anti-takeover law
could prove to be an impediment in arranging financing for the
acquisition.
   Campeau also has challenged another recently passed
anti-takeover law in Delaware, where Federated is incorporated.
   Rubin said Ohio's law violated federal measures aimed at
avoiding inconsistent regulation of commerce among states.
   The judge said the Ohio law is ``discriminatory on its face''
because it regulates only takeovers by certain businesses organized
in foreign countries. He said federal law prohibits such
discriminatory legislation by states.
   The judge agreed with Campeau attorneys that the Canadian
corporation could suffer irreparable injury because of the law.
   Federated's board of directors on Friday rejected Campeau's $66
a share proposal, saying they were not convinced that Campeau had
solid financing for the deal.
   Federated operates department and mass-merchandising stores in
36 states and had sales of more than $11 billion last year. Its
divisions include Abraham & Straus and Bloomingdale's of New York,
Bullock's and I. Magnin in California, Rich's in Atlanta, Filene's
of Boston and Burdines of Florida.

<HEAD>Henley Proposes Santa Fe Scrap Part of Restructuring, Sell It More
Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. is
pondering a proposal from Henley Group Inc. to scrap part of the
railroad-energy giant's restructuring and sell $780 million in new
stock to the dissident investor.
   The move, which would boost Henley's stake in Chicago-based
Santa Fe to 34.3 percent from 15.7 percent, was announced Monday
and faced an uncertain reaction from Santa Fe, which has been
fending off Henley's unwanted overtures since mid-1987.
   Santa Fe spokesman Robert Gehrt said the proposal would be taken
up at Santa Fe's regularly scheduled board meeting later today but
would not comment further.
   Henley's proposal called for Santa Fe to stop the planned
payment of $5 per share in high-yield ``junk bonds'' for each of
its 157.3 million shares on March 1. Santa Fe already has made a
$25-per-share cash payout.
   Henley has claimed persistently that the pay-in-kind debentures
would leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the
way they are structured.
   Instead, Henley proposed that Santa Fe sell Henley $780 million
worth of new stock at $17.50 per share. Proceeds from that deal
would be used to make a onetime $5-per-share cash payout to all
current shareholders.
   The proposed deal would mean 44.6 million new shares for Henley
and would boost Santa Fe's total shares outstanding to 201.9
million. But Henley said the proposal was dependent on Santa Fe's
annulment of a ``poison pill'' takeover defense that would make a
hostile acquisition prohibitely expensive.
   Under the measure, if any hostile suitor exceeds 20 percent
ownership in Santa Fe's stock, other Santa Fe shareholders would be
permitted to buy new stock at half price.
   Henley now owns 24.6 million shares, or 15.7 percent, of Santa
Fe, a railroad, land and natural resources concern that has been
attempting to restructure because of federal regulatory rulings
forcing it to sell one of its two railroads, either the Santa Fe
line or Southern Pacific line.
   Together, those lines constitute the nation's third-larges rail
system extending over of 26,000 miles of main track.
   Henley repeatedly has criticized Santa Fe's adoption of the
``poison pill,'' saying the measure restricted the ability of major
holders to maneuver.
   In another development Monday concerning Santa Fe, Denver-based
Rio Grande Industries Inc. filed an application with the Interstate
Commerce Commission to acquire the Southern Pacific line for $1
billion.
   The ICC already has approved an expedited schedule for the
application, with a final decision expected in six months, Rio
Grande said.
   Rio Grande's action threw into question Kansas City Southern
Industries Inc.'s rival bid of more than $1.25 billion for the
Southern Pacific.

<TEXT>
   L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., a venerable
investment firm that once served wealthy clients, later became
dangerously diversified and was devastated by the October stock
market crash, is selling itself to a Kansas company despite earlier
vows to remain independent.
   The announcement on Monday signaled the latest casualty from the
stock collapse and the first major Wall Street firm to be acquired
by a savings and loan company. It also marked the end of an era for
the 89-year-old brokerage, which had been hemorrhaging even before
Black Monday, Oct. 19.
   Since then, several small firms have been forced out of
business, and E.F. Hutton Group Inc., one of the nation's largest
investment firms, agreed in December to be acquired by Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Rothschild, which also announced a $128.8 million loss for the
final quarter of 1987, previously had sold virtually all its retail
stock brokerage operations, cut staff by more than 40 percent and
undertaken several other austerity moves.
   The firm said it would merge with Stern Brothers & Co., an
investment bank in Kansas City, Mo. wholly owned by Franklin
Financial Services Inc., which in turn is owned by Franklin Savings
of Ottawa, Kan.
   The purchase price still was subject to adjustment, but
estimated at about $4.40 in cash and securities for each of
Rothschild's 15.1 million shares, or about $66.4 million.
   Franklin's major subsidiary is Franklin Savings Institution,
which had $9 billion in assets at the end of 1987. It also has
brokerage, insurance, mortgage banking and financial consulting
operations.
   ``The merger ... will form a unique investment banking
combination,'' said Ernest Fleischer, chairman of Franklin Savings,
who along with his wife owns just over half of the company's stock.
``It brings together the advantages of a New York trading desk and
regional distribution.''
   ``Our Stern Brothers clients will receive expanded underwriting
and distribution capabilities. For L.F. Rothschild's clients, we
will provide risk management and solid financial backing,'' he said.
   Franklin Financial will provide a 2{-year, $30 million loan to
L.F. Rothschild & Co., the broker-dealer subsidiary of L.F.
Rothschild Holdings, the announcement said
   In a separate announcement, Rothschild Holdings reported severe
losses for both the fourth quarter and all of 1987, reflecting both
the impact of the stock market crash and other troubles.
   Rothschild lost $128.8 million on revenues of $32.5 million in
the quarter, compared with a net loss of $15.4 million on revenues
of $92.4 million in the same period of 1986.
   For the full year, it lost $129.1 million on $461.4 million in
revenues, compared with an after-tax profit of $498,000, or 3 cents
per share, on $401.1 million in revenues in 1986.
   It said approximately $56 million of the losses resulted from
arbitrage and over-the-counter trading positions held during the
stock market's collapse. An additional $15 million in losses
stemmed from the post-crash bankruptcy of Haas Securities, a
correspondent firm of Rothchild's broker-dealer subsidiary.
   In addition, Rothchild said quarterly and annual losses
reflected at least $28 million in charges related to cutbacks in
staff and offices and the sale of its retail brokerage business.
   Once considered a specialty investment banking house that
serviced extremely wealthy clients, Rothschild later evolved into a
publicly held firm that expanded into government bonds, mutual
funds, arbitrage and other areas.
   The company encountered trouble in late 1987, when a management
dispute surfaced over whether the company was becoming excessively
diversified. Two Rothschild principals who opposed diversification
abruptly quit and the firm foundered thereafter.
   Andrew L. Berger, Rothschild's president, had said in a
statement to the press on Dec. 7 that the firm intended to remain
independent, ``get our house in order and as quickly as possible
return this business to profitability.''
   The company has scrapped its public finance and municipal bond
activities and agreed to sell its securities brokerage operations
in New York, Boston, and Tampa, Fla.
   It is in the process of closing offices in San Francisco,
Switzerland and Liechtenstein and is trimming its activities in
London.

   Oil prices started the week by moving lower in
aimless trading.
   ``We're really trading on no new news,'' said John H. O'Connell,
an analyst at Refco Inc. Commodities, on Monday. ``Its just a
roller-coaster. Up and down. But I don't think we're falling apart
here.''
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for March
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.crude,
closed at $16.62 per 42-gallon barrel, down 8 cents from Friday.
   Among March contracts for refined products, wholesale heating
oil settled at 45.79 cents a gallon, down 0.01 cent, while unleaded
gasoline closed down 0.11 cent at 46.32 cents per gallon.
   O'Connell said the market had been rife with stories about
overproduction and other problems within the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. But he said none of the stories have
been considered reliable.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. has extended until midnight
Friday its $66-a-share offer for a friendly merger with Federated
Department Stores Inc.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge Monday threw out an Ohio
anti-takeover law enacted to protect Federated from the
Toronto-based developer.
   Campeau said in a statement Monday that without a friendly
merger it would continue its hostile tender offer at $61 a share,
or $5.4 billion. The friendly offer, which previously expired
Sunday, totals $5.8 billion.
   A Federated representative had no comment on the renewed offer.
The Cincinnati-based retailer twice last week rejected the
$66-a-share bid, saying Campeau had not shown it had adequate
financing.
   Federated's board has delayed implementing a company
shareholder-rights plan until midnight Thursday. The rights plan, a
so-called ``poison pill'' defense, is designed to make a hostile
takeover too expensive.
   A Campeau representative said the retail and real estate company
was renewing its offer ``to remind (Federated's) board we're very
interested in signing a transaction.''
   At the same time, Chief U.S. District Court Judge Carl B. Rubin
ruled unconstitutional the state's anti-takeover law enacted Feb.
12. Federated had no comment when asked if an appeal was planned.
   Rubin said that while states have a role in the regulation of
commerce, the new law ``is discriminatory on its face.''
   The act required that certain foreign businesses attempting to
acquire companies with major operations in Ohio inform the state of
the acquisition's impact on employment, tax revenues and details of
its financing.

<HEAD>Money Spent By Japanese Firms On Advertising Increases in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese companies spent 3.945 trillion yen, or
about $30.34 billion, on advertising in 1987, up 8.1 percent from
the previous year and the highest increase in six years, a report
released Tuesday said.
   Dentsu Inc., the country's largest advertising agency, said the
increase reflected the recovery of the Japanese economy led by
rising domestic demand, and Japanese firms' efforts to expand their
doemstic business activities.
   The previous highest annual increase was 8.2 percent in 1981,
although the standard for the survey was modifieid in 1985 by
eliminating advertising for promoting exports, Dentsu said.
   Corporate spending on advertisements in newspapers and magazines
and on radio and television was 259 trillion yen, or about $19.95
billion, up 7.7 percent from 1986, Dentsu said. That accounted for
65.7 percent of total advertising expenses.
   Dentsu said advertising through direct mail, outdoor ad
services, inserts and exhibitions was 1.344 trillion yen, or $10.3
billion.

<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. completed its effort to
buy Sterling Drug Co. today by acquiring more than 96 percent of
Sterling's stock during the 20-day tender offer, a Kodak spokesman
said.
   Kodak acquired about 54.5 million shares of Sterling stock by
the midnight Monday deadline and will now complete the merger ``in
the matter of a few days,'' said Kodak spokesman Ron Roberts.
   The acquisition, the largest in Kodak history, has attracted a
great deal of criticism from stock analysts who said Kodak was
paying too much for the drug and household products company.
   Kodak had agreed to pay $89.50 a share for the 57 million
outstanding shares of Sterling stock, which is more than $34 higher
than the stock was selling for at the end of 1987. The total value
of the deal is expected to be $5.1 billion.
   Sterling, based in New York, has 22,000 employees and has annual
sales of about $2 billion.
   Kodak, based in Rochester, has 124,000 employees and annual
sales of about $13 billion a year.
   The acquisition will help Kodak move into the $110 billion
pharmaceutical industry and give the company an established
pipeline to get drugs to market, said Kodak spokesman Charles Smith.
   But analysts have cast a wary eye on the deal with several no
longer recommending the purchase of Kodak stock.
   On Monday, Kodak's bond rating was downgraded by Moody's
Investor's Service from A2 to Aa2 largely because of the impending
$5.1 billion loan the company is going to have to take on to pay
for Sterling.
   Sterling's bond rating was also downgraded from A2 to Aa1.
   With the acquisition, Kodak gets a business featuring such
familiar brand names as Bayer aspirin, Panadol non-aspirin pain
reliever, Lysol disinfectant, d-Con rat killer, and Phillips Milk
of Magnesia.
   Kodak officials have said they do not plan to sell any parts of
Sterling and will keep the company's organization intact.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp., one of the
world's largest consumer electronics manufacturers, has announced
plans to set up a new firm in the United States in April for sales
and maintainance of factory automation machines, a Japanese news
report said.
   The new firm, Panasonic Factory Automation Co., a division of
Matsushita Electric Corp. of America, will pave the way for
Matsushita's further expansion of factory automation business in
North America and localization of the development of computer
software used for factory automation, Kyodo News Service said
Tuesday.
   Matsushita officials did not answer repeated telephone calls to
their offices Tuesday night.
   Sales of factory automation equipment have been handled by
Panasonic Industrial Co., but the rapid growth of the factory
automation market in North America led the parent company to set up
a new firm dedicated solely to that purpose, Kyodo said.
   Panansonic Factory Automation Co., which will sell industrial
robots and installation devices for electronics parts, aims to
boost its sales of 6.5 billion yen, or $58 million, in the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1988 _ and by five times within five years,
Kyodo said.

   Stock prices were narrowly mixed this morning
after pushing to their highest levels in six weeks in the previous
session.
   Trading was more active than in Monday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70
points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, backed off 1.33
to 2,038.96 after 90 minutes of trading.
   But advancing issues took a slight lead over losers in the
overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 639
up, 584 down and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 81.94 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street compared with 52.26 million shares at the same
point on Monday.
   The stock market has benefited recently from indications that
the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some
analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate
profits.
   But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects.
   In a new report today, the government said orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the
biggest decline in a year.
   But that statistic has been volatile, and many analysts expected
a decline in January because it had risen by an unusually large 4.1
percent in December.
   Stock traders were also looking to today's congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Greenspan said the country faces ``formidable challenges'' in
keeping the economic recovery alive, urged further progress on
reducing the federal deficit and cautioned Congress against passing
protectionist trade legislation.
   Among active issues on the NYSE, Philadelphia Electric was
unchanged at 19~, Eastman Kodak was down \ at 40{, Polaroid was up
1] at 31] and International Business Machines was unchanged at 115\.
   Texaco was up \ at 42}. It said it had agreed to pay the
government $1.25 billion to settle disputes related to its pricing
of crude and refined products during the 1973-1981 period of price
controls.
   IU International rose 1] to 21\. The company said it received a
buyout offer of $21.50 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.18 to 148.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 0.11 to 282.90.

   Two stock specialist firms have agreed to give
up their roles as market-makers in three stocks, the New York Stock
Exchange said.
   The moves are part of a review of the performance of specialists
during the October stock market crash, the exchange said in a press
release Monday.
   The Big Board said that Lawrence, O'Donnell & Co. would
surrender its market-making role in Neiman-Marcus Group Inc. common
stock next week. La Branche & Co. will give up its rights to market
E.F. Hutton Group Inc. and A.G. Edwards Inc. on March 3.
   The franchises in the affected issues will be reallocated by the
exchange, NYSE officials said. In the case of E.F. Hutton, a large
securities firm due to be merged with Shearson Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., the stock is expected to be delisted by the exchange
around March 24.
   The exchange's 53 specialist firms each control lucrative
franchises to market certain stocks and are required to maintain
orderly trading in those issues by setting opening prices and
covering trades when there are too few buyers or sellers.
   Following the crash, the exchange launched investigations into
the volatile behavior of some issues and the specialists assigned
to them. The activity of market specialists also was criticized by
a presidential task force and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in their separate probes of the October collapse.
   The NYSE said the agreements with Lawrence, O'Donnell and
LaBranche were reached voluntarily after discussions with the firms.
   In the case of LaBranche, the exchange's review centered on the
firm's handling of Hutton stock, but because of the imminent
delisting of that issue, the firm also agreed to accept the
withdrawal of its Edwards franchise as a penalty, the exchange
indicated.
   The exchange did not disclose the results of its investigations
into the trading of Hutton and Neiman-Marcus stock, but extreme
volatility appeared to have prompted the inquiries.
   The NYSE has taken action in four situations since the crash.
Previously, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg surrendered its franchise in
J.P. Morgan & Co. stock and J.J. Meehan & Co. withdrew its rights
to Gould Inc.
   Exchange officials would not say whether its inquiries into the
activity of specialists were continuing, but NYSE Chairman John
Phelan has told congressional investigators that reallocations of
stock franchises was one means of repairing the damage caused by
the crash.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean futures succumbed to follow-through selling from
Monday's weak close and to reports of improved growing conditions
for the South American crop, analysts said.
   Wheat prices fell in reaction to the Agriculture Department's
announcement that it plans more auctions of surplus wheat in
addition to the weekly auctions that have been a fixture since
November, analysts said.
   The auctions increase the supply of wheat on the open market,
which tends to depress prices.
   Corn futures prices retreated on a lack of bullish fundamentals
and on lower-than-expected exports last week, said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst for G.H. Miller & Co.
   Last week's wheat exports also were lower than expected, while
soybean shipments were above expectations, Gidel said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.21 a bushel; corn was } cent

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today the country faces ``formidable challenges'' in keeping the
economic recovery alive, urged further progress on reducing the
federal deficit and cautioned Congress against passing
protectionist trade legislation.
   Greenspan confirmed that the central bank, in an effort to keep
the recovery alive, had taken a ``small easing step a few weeks
ago.''
   The Fed chairman said the central bank agreed with the Reagan
administration that recovery from the 1981-82 recession should last
through this presidential election year, but said prospects for
growth would be enhanced through further efforts to reduce the huge
federal budget deficit, which raises U.S. dependence on foreign
investment.
   ``We face formidable challenges over 1988 and beyond in meeting
national economic goals of sustaining growth and progress toward
price stability,'' Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee.
   Greenspan's comments came as part of the Fed's semi-annual
report to Congress on the conduct of monetary policy. It was the
first time Greenspan has delivered the monetary report since he
took over as chairman from Paul Volcker in August.
   Volcker repeatedly lectured Congress during his eight years as
Fed chief over the need to reduce the soaring federal budget
deficits and warned that the central bank could not be expected to
carry the full burden of keeping the economic recovery going.
   Greenspan, sounding very much like Volcker, echoed those same
themes, contending in his testimony that the challenge of managing
the economy ``cannot be negotiated by the Federal reserve alone.''
   ``For the United States, the most direct and beneficial approach
would be to address the problem at its major source _ the federal
budget deficit,'' he said. ``Reducing the deficit further would
give us the opportunity to add to domestic saving and reduce
dependence on foreign capital, while still encouraging much-needed
investment spending.''
   Since January a variety of interest rates, including home
mortgage rates, have declined, leading many economists to speculate
that the Federal Reserve had eased credit conditions.
   Greenspan confirmed the move toward easier money, saying the Fed
had made the change amid indications of an economy that was slowing
as the year began. He said the Fed had the leeway to loosen credit
conditions because the U.S. dollar had stabilized on foreign
exchange markets.
   For part of last year, the central bank had been forced to push
interest rates higher in an effort to support the dollar, which was
declining rapidly in value. Higher interest rates in this country
tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive to
foreignes.
   The Fed released an economic forecast that was very close to the
predictions made by the Reagan administration when it released its
budget last week.
   The Fed said it believed the overall economy, as measured by the
gross national product, would grow at rate of 2.0 percent to 2.5
percent this year, down from last year's growth of 3.8 percent. The
administration is forecasting 2.4 percent GNP growth this year
while many private economists believe growth will not reach 2
percent.
   In response to a question, Greenspan said that while the Fed was
expecting sluggish economic growth this year, it saw no evidence
that a recession would occur because the economy was not exhibiting
the kinds of imbalances that normally start appearing at the end of
an expansion.
   Greenspan was asked by Rep. Charles E. Schumer, R-N.Y., whether
over the next 12 months he saw ``a greater danger of increased
inflation or recession?''
   Greenspan paused a moment and then responded, ``At the moment I
would say the dangers are probably equal. It's very difficult to
judge.''
   At another point, Greenspan disagreed openly with a contention
by Beryl Sprinkel, President Reagan's chief economist, that the Fed
had pursued a tight monetary policy during 1987.
   ``We did not perceive ourselves as being tight,'' Greenspan
said. He claimed that Sprinkel placed too much emphasis on the
importance of monetary growth in foretelling future economic
activity. To have controlled the growth in the money supply to the
extent that Sprinkel advocates would have triggered ``an unduly
inflationary environment'' last year, Greenspan testified.
   ``There is a difference of opinion between Mr. Sprinkel and
myself on this issue. It is an economist's disagreement,''
Greenspan said.
   The Fed chief refused under questioning to make a prediction on
the course of short and long-term interest rates during the coming
year, saying that for him to do so would be ``sheer
mischievousness'' in light of the fact that the Fed has direct
influence over interest rates.
   The Fed predicted that the unemployment rate, because of the
more sluggishgrowth, would not show any improvement, holding at
around 5.8 percent to 6 percent. The unemployment rate currently is
5.8 percent.
   On inflation, the Fed predicted that consumer prices, as
measured by an inflation index tied to the GNP, would rise 3.25
percent to 3.75 percent this year, a slightly better forecast than
the administratin, which is looking for a 3.9 percent rise in the
GNP price deflator, as the index is called.
   Greenspan also revealed the money growth targets the Fed has set
for 1988. These targets, while covering a broad range, serve as a
policy guide for the central bank as it tries to supply enough
money to keep the economy growing at a healthy rate while guarding
against pumping out so much money that inflation is rekindled.
   In one measure of the money supply, M-2, which includes checking
deposits plus cash held by the pubic along with savings accounts
and money market accounts, the Fed said it was aiming for growth of
4 percent to 8 percent. This was the same target set for a somewhat
broader measure of money known as M-3.
   The central bank, as it did last year, decided to set no growth
target for M-1, the narrowest guage of money, because of its
erratic behavior in recent years.
   The ranges for M-2 and M-3 were slightly lower than the 1987
targets of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
   M-2 actually grew much more slowly last year than the target,
increasing only 4 percent, a fact that raised criticism inside the
Reagan administration from some officials who contended that the
central bank was pursuig a tight-money policy which was driving up
interest rates and threatening a recession.
   The president's Council of Economic Advisers issued a report on
Friday which said tight Fed money policies were partly responsible
for triggering the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   Greenspan, less than a month after succeeding Volcker, led the
central bank to increase its discount rate from 5.5 percent to 6
percent on Sept. 4. The action raising the rate the Fed charges to
make bank loans occurred as the value of the dollar was falling
sharply and causing fears of higher domestic inflation.

   Stock prices pulled back this morning, as the
market ran into resistance in active trading after pushing to its
highest levels in six weeks in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70
points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, was off 12.60
at 2,027.69 at noon on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 3 to 2
in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
558 up, 802 down and 480 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 112.65 million shares as of
noontime compared with 52.26 million shares at the same point on
Monday.
   The stock market has benefited recently from indications that
the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some
analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate
profits.
   But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects.
   In a new report today, the government said orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the
biggest decline in a year.
   Many analysts had expected a decline in January, however,
because orders had risen by an unusually large 4.1 percent in
December.
   Stock traders were also looking to today's congressional
testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told a
House subcommittee that the country faces ``formidable challenges''
in keeping the economic recovery alive.
   Charles Jensen, a technical market analyst for MKI Securities
Corp., said the market's decline was ``a reflex reaction after
pretty good runup'' over the past two weeks.
   ``The market is in a mature rallying phase subject to these
short bouts of profit-taking,'' Jensen said, adding that he felt
the market ``could regroup and work its way higher'' later.
   Among the most active issues on the NYSE, Philadelphia Electric
was unchanged at 19~, Eastman Kodak was down \ at 40{, Polaroid was
up 1\ at 31\ and International Business Machines was off \ at 115.
   Texaco was unchanged at 42{ after saying it had agreed to pay
the government $1.25 billion to settle an oil pricing dispute.
Other opil stocks were lower, with Amoco off 1\ at 76, Atlantic
Richfield down ] at 78| and Mobil was down } at 44\.
   Moore McCormick climbed 10~ to 34} after Southdown disclosed it
was offering $31 a share for the company.
   IU International rose 1] to 21\. The company said it received a
buyout offer of $21.50 a share, topping an earlier $20 a share
offer that the company had called inadequate.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.98 at 147.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index fell 0.89 to 282.12.

   Harlan B. Strong has seen his share
of losers in his work for Young America Corp., one of the nation's
largest handlers of sweepstakes, rebates and product promotions.
   But Strong says it's the winners who stand out, especially when
they're as excited as a Detroit-area woman he called to inform that
she and her family had won a trip to Disney World.
   ``There was this long pause; then all I could hear was this
blood-curdling scream,'' said Strong, the company's vice president
of sales.
   The woman put down the receiver and Strong said he could hear
her running through the house yelling the good news to her family
for several minutes before returning to continue their conversation.
   ``I enjoyed that. It was a real honest expression of joy at
receiving this,'' he said.
   Nationally, there are about 40 companies in the fulfillment
industry, which takes its name from its work fulfilling rebate
requests and product promotions and conducting sweepstakes.
   Young America Corp. is one of five fulfillment companies in
Minnesota, and its closest national competitor, the Maple Plain
Co., is less than 20 miles away in Maple Plain.
   ``This is kind of the mecca of the fulfillment business,'' said
Strong.
   The 17-year-old Young America Corp. has grown from 15 employees
to more than 1,000. That's nearly the population of this tiny town,
from which the company took its patriotic-sounding name, 40 miles
west of Minneapolis.
   Business became so brisk that the company had to acquire its own
post office a few years ago to handle its up to 2 million pieces of
mail a week, ranging from consumers' requests for Duracell battery
rebates to Campbell soup bowls to sweepstakes entries.
   The 180,000-square-foot plant, which is completing its fourth
expansion in 10 years, is highly automated, and that often
surprises visitors, Strong said.
   In one room, employees do nothing but feed envelopes into
automatic slitting machines to open them.
   ``I think people think there are folks sitting around the table
opening envelopes,'' Strong said.
   That impression was closer to the reality of the company's
earlier days when Strong recalls executives taking off their coats
and joining workers in packaging watches to keep product promotions
on schedule.
   Selecting winners from thousands of contest entries has grown
more sophisticated, too.
   ``In the old days, we used to dump them on the floor,'' Strong
said.
   Now, workers randomly select 2 percent to 10 percent of the
entries received each day until the contest deadline and place them
in numbered boxes. After the contest deadline, workers draw
numbered pingpong balls from a lottery drum and then pick the
winners from the corresponding numbered boxes of envelopes.
   But the prizes _ TVs, VCRs, furs and jewelry and other goodies
small enough to be stored at the plant _ are still kept locked in a
carefully guarded storage area.
   The privately held company, which does not disclose its
financial figures, promotes its security when selling its services
to its clients, mostly Fortune 500 companies, by touting its
computerized tracking of mail and products as they move through the
company.
   The company installed a paper shredder more than two years ago
to destroy mailed-in rebate forms after people began digging
through landfills to retrieve other companies' discarded ones,
Strong said.
   He is proud of the company's record of employee honesty. Young
America Corp. has never had to discipline a worker for trying to
influence contest drawings or stealing rebate forms, Strong said.
   Young America Corp. is the largest single employer in Carver
County, a dairy farming area that's beginning to give way to the
suburban sprawl of the Twin Cities. Many employees have been with
the company for years, and up to 20 people a day apply for jobs
there.
   ``If I left here to get a job with this kind of status and
variety, I would have to go to Minneapolis,'' said Jan Feltmann, a
senior client service representative who began working for the
company 14 years ago a few hours a day at home.
   ``I was a young mother and had a college loan to pay and I
didn't want to have my husband pay for that,'' said Mrs. Feltmann,
35.
   Company officials were so impressed with her work that they
brought her to the plant, where she now supervises others.
   About 600 employees are home checkers and home data entry
personnel, verifying customers' entries, rebates and order forms
and typing the information for entry into the company's computer
system, which is capable of canceling multiple requests from the
same household.
   Customer service, where 30 people respond to incomplete rebate
forms and handle requests for exchanges on product promotions, also
is a fast-growing segment. The employees answer toll-free numbers
set up to handle customer inquiries. A wholly owned telemarketing
subsidiary, Young America Direct in Edina, was formed last year and
already employs about 100 people.

<HEAD>Real Estate Tours Lure Japanese Investors Who Want More Than

   A group of Japanese gets off a bus chartered by
Hokubei Tours Inc. to gaze at the Statue of Liberty. But these Far
Easterners are not mere picture-taking tourists _ they're
entrepreneurs who want to own a piece of America, rather than just
eyeball it.
   Hokubei, whose most popular tour shuttles visitors to as many as
five cities in pursuit of anything from a ski chalet to a factory
to a wide-open prairie, is just one company catering to the
swelling ranks of small Japanese investors interested in U.S.
property.
   Big cash-rich corporations, like Mitsui Fudosan Inc., which
bought New York's Exxon building in 1986, have been the biggest
players in the U.S. market up to now, and experts say they'll
likely dominate the $4 billion to $10 billion in purchases expected
this year.
   But smaller investors also are making a mark, quietly traveling
the nation, visiting with local business people and getting a feel
for the landscape.
   A recent study by Cushman & Wakefield, a major real estate
company, found that Japanese institutional investors rate real
estate as their most important investment in the United States,
well ahead of government bonds and corporate stock.
   The new wave of Japanese buyers is being drawn to this country
by high returns and comparatively cheap property. The average price
per square foot for high-quality office space in Tokyo is $4,000,
while office space of similar quality in New York commands $400 per
square foot or less, according to David Shulman, director of real
estate research at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Lower interest rates and the dollar's drop against the Japanese
yen make such bargains too good to pass up for many Japanese
investors, who stand to reap yields three times higher than in
their own country.
   With their penchant for savings, Japanese who have amassed as
little as $500,000 are realizing they can own a luxury condominium
in the United States and pay someone else to manage it. More
ambitious investors might join forces to buy a piece of commercial
property.
   What may be equally noteworthy is that they also are ``spreading
out from main-tier cities,'' Shulman said. Their interest no longer
is exclusively focused on a handful of major urban areas.
   At Los Angeles-based Hokubei, which specializes in promoting
Japanese-American business relationships, research manager Charles
Laub said the company arranged 30 real estate tours last year and
expects to do as many this year, if not more.
   During the planning stages of a trip, investors are asked what
type of property they would like to see and in what geographic
regions. Then Laub makes the appropriate real estate contacts,
while others arrange for accommodations, transportation and
interpreters.
   ``They won't just go to one city,'' he said. ``Most want to see
four or five cities.'' Typically, he said, investors spend ``five
to seven days in New York, then maybe they'll fly to Chicago, then
down to Dallas, up to San Francisco or Los Angeles. The whole thing
could be two or three weeks.''
   Most often investors ask to see office buildings, although there
is increasing interest in upscale residences like single-family
homes or condominiums valued at a minimum $500,000, Laub said.
   When on tour, ``it's all business'' from Monday to Friday, said
Laub, who added that arrangements can be made if travelers ``want
to go play golf, or if they're in New York and want to go to the
Empire State Building. Some want to go to Epcot Center in Florida.''
   Many of the tours Laub arranges are sponsored by big Japanese
institutions like Mitsui Bank and Nomura Securities, which
ultimately hope to serve as lenders if deals are consummated.
Independent investors, who usually travel in small groups, must
foot the $3,000-to-$6,000 bill for a two-week trip on their own.
   ``On the first trip, they like to get a feel for the area,'' he
said. Actual deals are negotiated on subsequent visits.
   Despite all the tours Laub has arranged, he has no idea how many
have actually resulted in definite sales agreements. ``They come in
secretly to close on deals ... I don't know what is sold,'' he said.
   Others also have discovered that real estate can be a common
language when talking to the Japanese.
   Earl Bunker, president of Hori & Bunker Inc. of Lincoln, Mass.,
puts out newsletters in Japanese that list U.S. properties for
sale. While several property owners complain of a lack of response
to the ads, Bunker insists that if he keeps on publishing, he'll
penetrate the market.
   ``Translation is very important,'' said Bunker, adding that the
Japanese ``expect the same preferential treatment they've been
giving us.''
   Cecil Ivey, president of Piping Engineering Co. of Sand Springs,
Okla., said he has had some nibbles from Japanese interested in the
shuttered welding plant he is trying to sell in Alamo, Texas.
Although he advertised with Bunker, he said his contacts came from
elsewhere.
   Much foreign interest has centered on southern Texas, where
investors can cash in on the maquiladora concept, in which
companies set up manufacturing facilities in Mexico to take
advantage of cheap labor while maintaining office operations just
miles away in the United States.
   Last year, a full busload of Japanese descended upon the
southern part of the Lone Star state, hitting ``every town on the
border from Laredo to Brownsville,'' said Peter Pranis, who, as
vice president of economic development for the Council for South
Texas Economic Progress, played host when the group reached
McAllen, Texas.
   ``They're like information vacuum cleaners,'' he said. ``They're
very courteous and well-mannered, but they've got a very good idea
what they're looking for .... They asked very pointed questions.''
   Elsewhere, a developer who asked not to be named said Japanese
are among those interested in a package of two buildings that
comprise an entire block in Baltimore's prime business district.
   Even Dean Williams, a retired salesman in Las Vegas, Nev., spent
a couple of hundred dollars on an ad to sell the 35 acres of land
he owns in central Nevada to the Japanese. At $69,000 for the
parcel, he thinks it's a bargain.

<HEAD>NBC Not Likely To Sell Programming To TBS' Proposed Cable Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the NBC television network
indicated NBC is unlikely to sell programming to Turner
Broadcasting System Inc.'s proposed new cable network, unless NBC
owned a portion of the parent company.
   Last year, NBC and TBS discussed the possibility of NBC taking
part ownership of Atlanta-based TBS. But the companies announced in
mid-January that the talks had been halted.
   NBC President Robert Wright said Monday the network would be
interested in helping program the proposed Turner Network
Television only if it owned a piece of TBS.
   ``We could be very interested in selling programming to it, but
I just don't see that happening,'' Wright said after speaking to a
civic group in Atlanta. ``The problem with TNT is that it is very
much involved in the organizational, ownership issues'' that
blocked NBC's attempt to buy an interest in TBS last year, he added.
   NBC reportedly had attempted for the second time in three years
to purchase up to 25 percent of TBS for $400 million.
   TBS is hoping to launch the new cable network in July. TNT is
proposed as a super cable channel that would compete with the
networks by offering first-run mini-series, award shows and major
sporting events.

   Arthur Emil never envisioned traveling all the
way to Japan to sell some of the 54 luxury condominiums he
developed in lower Manhattan.
   And he was more than a little skeptical when Japan's Fujisankei
Communications Group approached him about featuring one of the
units on a home-shopping broadcast that would air in Tokyo, Osaka
and nine other cities in late January.
   A Fujisankei representative explained that the communications
giant's satellite shopping network ``markets high-ticket items,''
Emil said. ``They said they sold a chateau in France.''
   And what could be more high-class than his condos, which range
in price from $500,000 to $1.7 million and feature such amenities
as sub-zero refrigerators in the gourmet kitchens, 17-foot ceilings
and a 24-hour concierge in addition to the doorman.
   Emil had a hard time with the notion that someone would buy an
apartment without ``physically visiting the property,'' although he
said it does happen from time to time.
   But Fujisankei promised, after a single broadcast, to present
him with 20 to 25 qualified buyers. ``I'm assuming these are real
buyers,'' he said shortly before leaving for Japan in early
February.
   But 16,000 miles later and one week later, Emil was a believer.
``You can sell apartments in the United States by television in
Japan,'' he exclaimed.
   While Emil said Fujisankei introduced him to fewer qualified
buyers than promised, he was still pleased.
   None of the investors signed on the dotted line, but Emil said
several are coming to New York to see the landmark building in the
near future, and he's confident he'll close on more than one deal.
   Emil described the buyers as wealthy executives who do business
in and around New York and were attracted by the building's luxury
qualities.
   ``I expected a number of offshore buyers, but that I would
schlep myself over to Japan ...,'' he joked.
   Fujisankei's January broadcast proved to be successful not only
for Emil. A limousine used by Pope John XXIII also sold _ to an
unnamed bidder for $423,000.

   Japanese who invest in U.S. real estate evoke
mixed emotions on this continent, angering Americans competing to
buy the same properties but pleasing sellers.
   ``They have come into the market with a tremendous new source of
capital, and prices have gone up on the very small, upper-tier of
properties they're interested in,'' said Jon Minikes, a managing
director at Jones, Lang, Wootton USA, an international real estate
firm headquartered in New York.
   Among those ``upper-tier'' properties are New York's Exxon
building, which was sold to Mitsui Fudosan for $610 million; the
Arco Towers in Los Angeles, which sold for $620 million to Shuwa
Investments Corp.; and the Equitable building in Dallas, for which
Nissei Realty paid $250 million.
   ``Whenever more money is chasing a good product, prices have to
go up. It's very simple economics,'' he said.
   But Americans who expected to pay less for quality commercial
property in major cities ``are upset with the Japanese,'' said
David Shulman, director of real estate research at Salomon Brothers
Inc., while ``building sellers are very happy.''
   Shulman estimated that prices for quality office buildings could
drop by as much as 10 percent to 15 percent if the Japanese ceased
buying property or became less aggressive in their purchases.
   Japanese can afford to pay more because they are guaranteed to
reap far greater yields in the United States than at home.
   For example, a $100 million investment in Japan would probably
yield 1 or 2 percent a year, said Jim Montinari, senior vice
president of Cushman & Wakefield, a national commercial real estate
firm. Yield is what investors earn after they subtract expenses
from rent collected.
   But the yield on the same $100 million investment in U.S. real
estate ``is certain to be 6 to 9 percent. Comparing oppportunity to
Japan versus the United States is anywhere from triple to more,''
he said.
   In Japan, high-quality commercial real estate appreciated
between 50 percent and 60 percent in price from 1985 to 1986,
shutting out potential investors from their domestic market and
turning their attention to the United States, where prices for
comparable properties rose about 15 percent, Shulman said.
   The fall in the value of the dollar against the yen also has
lured Japanese investors, but a cheaper dollar can be ``a
double-edged sword,'' Minikes said.
   ``Most Japanese investors are looking at the rise in value of
the yen as a way to make the purchase cheaper, but you realize that
if the yen keeps rising, their investment _ which is generating
U.S. dollars _ will show a lower yield, he explained.
   While some Americans are miffed at the cash-rich Japanese
companies that are snapping up top properties at top dollar, real
estate companies have adapted to serve a new market.
   ``We constantly have groups coming through who want us to tell
them about U.S. real estate,'' Minikes said. ``We regard them as a
continuing source of profitable business.''

<HEAD>National Westminster Bank's 1987 Profit Plummets 30.1 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's largest
bank, said Tuesday its profit sank 30.1 percent last year, mainly
as a result of higher provisions against loans to Latin American
countries and heavy losses at its investment bank.
   The bank said its 1987 earnings totaled 429 million pounds, or
$759 million, down from 614 million pounds, or $1.09 billion in
1986. On a per-share basis, that worked out to 57 pence, or $1 per
share in 1987, compared with 94 pence, or $1.66 in 1986.
   The bank said its provisions against loans to lesser developed
countries, including Brazil, Mexico and other Latin American
countries, now total 810 million pounds, or $1.43 billion _ 33
percent of its total exposure of 2.47 billion pounds, or $4.37
billion.
   Natwest raised its provisions against loans to lesser developed
countries to 30 percent last summer, and later by another 3
percent, to keep it within guidelines set up by the Bank of England.
   Natwest's international banking unit swung to a loss of 339
million pounds, or $600 million, from a profit of 223 million
pounds, or $395 million, because of the increased provisions and
the lower dollar.
   The group's investment banking division widened its loss to 116
million pounds, or $205 million last year, from 38 million pounds,
or $67 million in 1986. Natwest blamed continuing development costs
and the effects of the October stock market's crash.
   National Westminster Bank USA had a loss of 95 million pounds,
or $168 million, after increasing its provision for loans to lesser
developed countries to 35 percent. That loss compared with a profit
of 68 million pounds, or $120 million, in 1986.
   Natwest said its results were encouraging in the light of the
experience of banks worldwide in 1987.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. shoved aside two
competitors last year to reclaim the title of the nation's largest
defense contractor, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Releasing its annual rating of the top 100 military contractors,
the Pentagon said McDonnell Douglas had jumped past General
Dynamics Corp. and General Electric Co. to win the top ranking for
fiscal 1987.
   The St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas increased its Pentagon
work by $1.1 billion during the year to a new total of $7.7
billion, easily surpassing General Dynamics.
   General Dynamics, ranked No. 1 in fiscal 1986 with $8 billion
worth of contracts, fell to No. 2 in 1987 with work valued at $7
billion. General Electric also suffered a decline in contract
awards, falling from the $6.8 billion it won in 1986 to $5.8
billion in fiscal 1987, the Pentagon said.
   The Defense Department report covers the fiscal year ending last
Sept. 30, and is considered the most definitive gauge of how major
military contractors are faring each year.
   The report discloses that the Pentagon's contractors were
fighting over a smaller pie in fiscal 1987, with prime contracts
totaling $142.5 billion being parceled out. That is $3.2 billion
less than the total awarded in fiscal 1986.
   Moreover, the top 100 companies, as a group, saw their share of
those contracts decline slightly last year. The 100 firms received
$95.4 billion of the contracts, or 66.9 percent of the total,
compared to $98.6 billion and 67.7 percent in fiscal 1986.
   According to the rankings, there was only one company in the
fiscal 1986 top 10 that failed to stay in that number last year.
Rockwell International Corp., which is winding down its work on the
new B-1B bomber, fell from fourth place on the 1986 list to 12th
place in fiscal 1987 with contracts worth $2.2 billion.
   Rockwell's spot in the top 10 was claimed by Martin Marietta
Corp., which moved from 11th to seventh place in the rankings with
work totaling $3.7 billion.
   The other top 10 rankings involved the same companies as in
1986, but in a different order.
   The fourth largest defense contractor in 1987 was Lockheed
Corp., which won contracts totaling $5.6 billion. It improved from
sixth place the year before, when its military business totaled
$4.9 billion.
   Fifth in the rankings was General Motors Corp. with $4.1
billion. That was a decline from the $5.1 billion in work won by GM
in 1986, but still enough to keep it at the same spot in the
rankings.
   Rounding out the top 10 were Raytheon Co., with $3.8 billion in
contracts; Martin Marietta, with $3.7 billion; United Technologies
Corp., with $3.6 billion; Boeing Co., with $3.5 billion, and
Grumman Corp., with $3.4 billion.
   McDonnell Douglas' rise to the No. 1 spot is nothing new for the
giant aircraft maker. While General Dynamics was No. 1 in 1986,
McDonnell Douglas was the top-ranked contractor in fiscal 1984 and
fiscal 1985.
   Some of the company's larger contracts include the F-A-18 Hornet
fighter for the Navy; the F-15 Eagle for the Air Force; the AH-64
Apache helicopter gunship for the Army, and the AV-8B Harrier jump
jet for the Marine Corps.

   The stock market was drifting at modestly lower
levels this afternoon as its recent rally ran into some resistance.
   Trading was moderate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70
points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, was off 3.82 at
2,036.47 with two hours to go in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 4 to 3
in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
677 up, 816 down and 441 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 147.77 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street with 109.87 million shares at the same point on
Monday.
   Traders said the market seemed to pause after a sharp runup over
the past two weeks.
   They said traders were also looking for clues in Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to a congressional panel about
the central bank's view of the economy.
   The stock market has benefited recently from indications that
the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some
analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate
profits.
   But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects.
   In a new report today, the government said orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the
biggest decline in a year.
   Many analysts had expected a decline in January, however,
because orders had risen by an unusually large 4.1 percent in
December.
   Among the most active issues on the NYSE were several utility
stocks that will soon be paying dividends. Philadelphia Electric
was the most active, slipping [ to 19}.
   Among the blue chips, Eastman Kodak was down \ at 40{, American
Telephone & Telegraph was down [ at 29} and International Business
Machines was up \ at 115{.

<HEAD>Government Erects Barrier to Pearson Takeover of Les Echos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Edouard Balladur indicated Monday
he was opposed to the planned sale of the French financial
newspaper Les Echos to Pearson PLC of Britain, saying he won't
allow the transfer of ownership to proceed automatically.
   In a statement, Balladur said the 886 million franc, or $158
million, deal that was signed Jan. 11 between Pearson and Les Echo
owner Jacqueline Beytout ``is subject to the explicit authorization
of the French authorities.''
   Mrs. Beytout called the government's position ``exclusively
political,'' and the management of Les Echos said the newspaper
wouldn't publish on Tuesday in protest.
   Under regulations, takeovers involving French companies and
other European entities must be submitted for approval by the
French treasury. If no objection is raised after a two-month
period, the transaction goes ahead automatically.
   The ministry noted, however, that a 1986 press law stipulates
that individuals or corporate entities that don't reside in the
European Community can't acquire a stake of more than 20 percent in
the capital of a French publishing company without prior government
approval.
   The ministry said ``the European character of the Pearson group
doesn't appear to be durably established at this time.''
   Ministry officials said the main stumbling block to the sale is
the 20.5 percent stake in Pearson held by media magnate Rupert
Murdoch.
   News Corp, Murdoch's Australian press group, disclosed Jan. 13
that it had increased its stake in Pearson by purchasing a 4.9
percent block of shares from Cerus SA, the French investment arm of
Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti.
   Aides to Balladur said the government is concerned that Murdoch
might be tempted to seek a controlling interest in Pearson,
although Murdoch has denied any such plans.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Backs Company In Dispute Over Pensions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday
that businesses may not be sued in federal court in certain cases
involving their contributions to union benefit funds.
   The court said the federal courts have no authority over cases
in which companies refuse to contribute to multi-employer union
benefit funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires.
   In an 8-0 ruling in a case from California, the court rejected
Reagan administration arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases
could undermine the solvency of the multi-employer pension plans.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in his opinion for the court, noted
that in 1980 Congress amended the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) to provide a federal court remedy for trustees
of the multi-employer benefit plans to collect delinquent
contributions.
   But Stevens said the remedy does not extend to ``the employer's
statutory duty to make post-contract contributions while
negotiations for a new contract are being conducted.''
   The federal courts have no authority to determine whether an
employer's refusal to contribute to the funds in such circumstances
is a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, Stevens said.
   The case stems from a decision by Advanced Lightweight Concrete
Company Inc. in California to withdraw from the union funds on June
15, 1983, when its collective bargaining agreement with its workers
expired.
   The fund managers filed a federal court suit in December that
year, seeking to force the company to pay into the pension plans
for the period when the old contract expired until bargaining talks
over a new contract reached an impasse.
   The unions said ERISA conferred such jurisdiction on the courts.
   The suit was dismissed on grounds that the National Labor
Relations Board has final say. The NLRB had ruled against the
unions in November 1983, rejecting claims that Advance Lightweight
failed to bargain in good faith.
   Today's decision upheld a 1985 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the high court on
Thursday, did not take part in the decision.
   The case is Welfare Trust Fund vs. Advanced Lightweight
Concrete, 85-2079.
   In other cases Tuesday involving business:
   _The court limited the job protection for government workers
fired for lacking security clearances.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices agreed with the Reagan
administration that the Merit Systems Protection Board lacks
authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is
justified.
   The court ruled against Thomas E. Egan, who was hired in 1981 as
a laborer at the Trident Naval Refit Facility in Bremerton, Wash.,
on the condition he subsequently receive a security clearance.
   The facility is used to test and repair Trident submarines. All
jobs at the facility require security clearance.
   _The court, in a victory for three Midwestern states, limited
the secretary of the interior's authority to allocate water stored
in Missouri River Basin reservoirs.
   The justices ruled unanimously that the interior secretary
exceeded his authority when in 1982 he approved a contract
authorizing Energy Transportation Systems Inc. (ETSI) to take water
from Lake Oahe in South Dakota for a coal slurry pipeline project.
   The decision is a victory for officials in Missouri, Iowa and
Nebraska, which had blocked the now-scrapped pipeline project.
North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming took the other side.
   _The court rejected claims by private landowners and ruled that
the state of Mississippi owns thousands of acres of oil- and
gas-rich land near the state's Gulf Coast.
   By a 5-3 vote, the justices said states may claim title to land
beneath waters subject to the tie's influence _ and not only land
under navigable waters.
   The ebb and flow of the tide, not navigability, determines the
state's ownership, Justice Byron R. White said for the court.

   Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti
and Belgium's economics minister on Tuesday called for a truce in
the battle for control of Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., the
country's biggest holding company.
   ``Representative shareholders have to sit down at the table to
discuss clear-cut principles: an industrial plan, the modalities of
efficient management and a revitalization of the company,'' De
Benedetti said in a statement.
   De Benedetti, the largest independent stockholder, claims to own
43 percent of Societe Generale's 28.2 million shares outstanding.
He has launched a bid for another 15 percent, but the stock price
has since exceeded his offer of about 4,000 Belgian francs.
   Societe Generale hit a new record Tuesday, closing at 5,350
francs, or $152.80, up about $7.15 from Monday.
   De Benedetti held meetings Tuesday with several top government
officials, including Minister of Economy Philippe Maystadt,
caretaker Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and Vice-Premiers Guy
Verhofstadt and Philippe Maystadt.
   De Benedetti wants to create a pan-European holding company, but
the Belgian government has maintained it wants Societe Generale to
remain firmly anchored in Belgium. The 166-year-old company
controls about half of Belgium's top 50 companies and has interests
in more that 1,200 companies worldwide.
   As speculation mounts as to whether a brittle alliance of
Belgian and French financial groups could fend off De Benedetti,
the Italian financier called for a truce.
   ``As the most important shareholder by a wide margin, I want to
make an appeal to reason,'' De Benedetti said. ``There have been
enough maneuvers in the corridors, enough artificial coalitions,
enough unrealistic share counts, enough projects inspired only on
the basis of personal interest.''
   Maystadt also said that it would be ``desirable that all
concerned parties without exception at last sit down around the
same table.''
   The French Cie Financiere de Suez and about 18 Belgian companies
claim to hold more than 50 percent of Societe Generale's shares,
but they have not officially agreed to form an alliance.
   Societe Generale management has supported a Franco-Belgian
alliance.

<HEAD>Government Clears BP's Offer For Britoil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government said Tuesday it would
relinquish its ``golden share'' in Britoil PLC, removing a major
roadblock to British Petroleum Co. PLC's $4.4 billion acquisition
of the North Sea oil company.
   Since December, BP has accumulated 79.8 percent of Britoil's 504
million outstanding shares in a takeover bid priced at 2.5 billion
pounds. The oil giant has been paying 500 pence, or $8.85, for each
Britoil share.
   The government retained its special share _ which gives it a
controlling vote over the company's affairs _ when it privatized
Britoil in two stages in 1985 and 1982.
   The Treasury said it would give up the share under certain
conditions agreed to by BP.
   Britoil said its board of directors would meet to decide whether
to abandon its resistance to BP's offer.
   Britoil's shares rose 1.77 cents to finish at $8.83 (499 pence)
on the London Stock Exchange Tuesday. BP's shares finished
unchanged at $4.39 (248 pence).
   The government doesn't intend to exercise its special share as
long as BP upholds promises to maintain headquarters for some of
Britoil's operations in Glasgow, Scotland, and meet other
conditions, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said in answer
to questions in the House of Commons.
   Scottish politicians had expressed concern that the takeover
would mean the loss of jobs in Scotland.
   Lawson said control of the golden share will eventually be
transferred from the Treasury to Britain's Energy Department, where
legal moves will be taken to terminate it.
   ``An acceptable arrangement has been reached with BP,'' Lawson
said. ``I am quite sure there will be no backsliding by BP.''
   BP Chairman Peter Walters said in a statement that the company
was ``pleased that our discussions with the government have
produced a successful resolution of the issues surrounding the
special share.''
   ``We believe the outcome will enable us to manage the assets of
Britoil on a proper commercial basis in the interests of both our
shareholders and the U.K. economy,'' Walters said.
   But a Britoil spokesman, who asked not to be named, said, ``If
you look at the statements (by the government and BP) you'll see
it's a two-party agreement between the chancellor and BP.''
   Although Britoil officials met with Treasury officials
concerning the government's use of the golden share, the company
wasn't a party to the agreement, he said.
   Labor lawmaker John Smith, his party's Treasury spokesman, said
in the House of Commons that BP had ``gobbled up'' Britoil and told
Lawson: ``You have exacted precious little from BP in exchange for
handing Britoil to them on a plate.''
   Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles also had pursued Britoil,
but abandoned its attempt and sold its 24 percent Britoil holding
to BP last month after BP sweetened its December offer of $7.97
(450 pence) a share.
   Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti government, through its London-based
investment vehicle, the Kuwait Investment Office, has acquired a
stake of more than 19 percent in BP over the last few months.
   Here are the conditions to which Lawson said BP has agreed:
   _BP will locate both Britoil's and BP's North Sea exploration
and production head offices in Glasgow, where Britoil currently has
its headquarters. The office will control BP's exploration and
productio operations in Norway and the Republic of Ireland, as well
as in Britain.
   _Britoil will be managed and operated as a separate independent
subsidiary and will have its own chief executive.
   _The Britoil board is to be headed by a non-executive chairman
with no previous BP connections. The appointment will be a joint
agreement between BP and the government.
   BP also agreed to try to achieve an increase of at least 5
percent in recoverable reserves from Britoil's North Sea oil fields.
   BP will spend between $531 million and $575 million a year on
exploration and development in areas controlled by BP and Britoil,
a large increase over previous expenditures in the area.

   Share prices closed higher in London Tuesday, but
were down sharply from their best levels in concert with weak early
trading on Wall Street.
   Trading volume picked up from its recent slack pace as some good
institutional buying interest emerged, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished at
1,757.9, 10.7 points or 0.6 percent higher, just 1.2 points above
its lowest level for the day. The index rose as much as 25 points
in early trading, bolstered by strong gains overnight in the New
York and Tokyo stock markets.
   The strong tone was reinforced by news that Britain's real gross
domestic product rose 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1987 from
the third quarter and was up 5.3 percent from a year earlier.
   Share prices showed little reaction to the GDP news, but dealers
said the figures should help sustain a cautious optimism among
market participants.
   Dealers said another factor boosting the market was expectations
that substantial tax cuts would be included in the budget to be
presented next month by the Thatcher government.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the government has
agreed to give up its golden share in Britoil PLC, clearing the way
for the independent company's takeover by British Petroleum Co.
PLC. Britoil shares rose 1 penny to 499 pence, while BP was
unchanged at 248 pence.

   Stocks traded at modestly lower prices this
afternoon as the market's recent rally ran into some resistance.
   Trading was moderate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25.70
points on Monday to its highest level since Jan. 7, was off 8.29 at
2,032.00 with one hour to go in the session.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of about 4 to 3 in
the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
669 up, 846 down and 436 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 165.28 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street with 131.66 million shares at the same point on
Monday.
   Traders said the market was pausing after a sharp runup over the
past two weeks.
   They said traders were hesitant to make big moves while Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was testifying before a
congressional panel about the central bank's view of the economy.
   The stock market has benefited recently from indications that
the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some
analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate
profits.
   But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects.
   In a new report today, the government said orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the
biggest decline in a year.
   Many analysts had expected a decline in January, however,
because orders had risen by an unusually large 4.1 percent in
December.
   Among the most active issues on the NYSE were several utility
stocks that will soon be paying dividends. Philadelphia Electric
was the most active, and was unchanged at 19~.
   Among the blue chips, Eastman Kodak was down \ at 40{, American
Telephone & Telegraph was down \ at 29| and International Business
Machines was off \ at 115.
   Moore McCormack climbed 10{ to 34] after Southdown disclosed it
was offering $31 a share for the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.86 at 148.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index fell 0.89 to 282.12.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed
moderately lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures declined in reaction to the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Monday that it would replace its
weekly auctions of surplus wheat with three weekly auctions
beginning March 2, analysts said.
   Sales from the Friday auctions have declined in recent weeks,
with last week's total of 11 million bushels falling far short of
the target of 25 million bushels.
   The USDA set initial targets of 10 million bushels for each of
the three new auctions, which will be held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Fridays.
   Traders fear that the new auctions could put as much as 30
million additional bushels of wheat onto the open market, which
would tend to depress prices, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst for G.H.
Miller & Co.
   Soybean prices retreated in response to improved growing
conditions for the South American soybean crop, Gidel said. Corn
futures drifted lower due to a lack of fresh supportive news, he
said.
   At the close, wheat was 4} cents to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.17 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 3{ cents lower with March at $1.96 a bushel; oats were 1 cent
lower to \ cent higher with March at $1.90\ a bushel; soybeans were
3{ cents to 8{ cents lower with March at $6.20 a bushel.

   A computer magazine has published a
story providing confidential details of a long-awaited Apple
computer still under development.
   The article appearing in this week's edition of Macintosh Today
was based on a 160-page confidential in-house document given to a
free-lance writer by an Apple employee, the San Francisco Examiner
said Tuesday.
   The article details the size, appearance and technical
specifications of Apple Computer Inc.'s Laguna laptop model, which
it said would be available in 1989.
   Apple has been hard hit by information leaks before, and even
hired a private detective two years ago to find out who was
releasing information. The investigator found leaks at firms
developing software and accessories for Apple products, according
to company spokeswoman Barbara Krause.
   Ms. Krause declined to comment on the magazine report.
   The article describes a 12-pound laptop capable of running
Macintosh software. It said the computer would have 1 megabyte of
internal memory, the same as the Macintosh SE. It said the computer
would have a flat-panel screen and be powered by a five-pound
lead-acid battery that will last up to 10 hours before recharging.

<HEAD>Ministers Formally Adopted Summit Budget Accords</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the European
Economic Community on Monday formally adopted decisions taken at
last week's EEC summit on limiting farm subsidies and overhauling
the group's finances.
   Britain and the Netherlands had made their acceptance of the
summit agreement conditional on settlement of a relatively minor
issue raised by France in the final stages of the Feb. 11-12
meeting.
   Officials said the French foreign minister, Jean-Bernard
Raimond, told Monday's meeting that his government remained unhappy
with proposals for placing new controls on EEC subsidies to growers
of such products as tobacco and wine.
   But Raimond said Paris would allow the proposals to go forward
without further debate. That cleared the way for the foreign
ministers to formally adopt the overall summit agreement.
   By satisfying British and Dutch demands for strict limits on
farm spending, the summit accords marked a breakthrough in the
EEC's budget crisis. The 12-nation group has been operating without
a formal budget since the start of the year and faced possible
bankruptcy by late summer.
   EEC budget ministers are scheduled to meet Tuesday to adopt a
draft 1988 budget. The spending plan then must be approved by the
European Parliament.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister and
chairman of Monday's meeting, told reporters that adoption of the
summit agreement was ``an important step forward in the history of
the European Community.''
   Genscher said he and Chancellor Helmut Kohl told U.S. officials
during a visit to Washington last week that the summit agreement
will ``strengthen the economic vitality of Europe'' by permitting
faster removal of trade barriers between EEC member countries and
by giving more financial aid to the relatively poorer members in
southern Europe.

Market Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission said Tuesday he did not expect Congress to give the
agency control of the stock index futures market and stressed the
SEC is working with futures regulators to prevent a recurrence of
the October stock market crash.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder also indicated his agency was
examining ways of reducing volatility of stock prices and trading
volume, which he attributed partly to the use of margin in the
stock index futures markets.
   In a speech to an economic outlook conference sponsored by the
Conference Board, Ruder repeated his agency's call to examine
proposals for increasing coordination between the stock and futures
markets and expanding the markets' capacity to deal with
unprecedented trading volumes.
   Trading strategies involving stock index futures _ representing
``baskets'' of actual stocks _ have been widely blamed for
worsening market volatility and contributing to the severity of the
Oct. 19 market crash.
   Ruder has contended the SEC should have final regulatory power
over all stock-related instruments, including the ability to
overrule the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which now
regulates such products.
   In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month,
Ruder asked for broad new powers over stock-related futures
trading, such as increasing margin requirements and ordering
temporary trading halts, to help prevent a recurrence of the crash.
   Kalo Hineman, acting chairman of the commodities commission, in
subsequent testimony resisted the idea of putting the SEC in charge
of stock index futures trading.
   During a news conference after Tuesday's speech, Ruder defended
his proposal but said he did not anticipate congressional support
for SEC authority over stock index futures markets.
   He said that although he was not supporting a broad
congressional revamping of the regulatory system, the SEC's
proposals would result in ``a more active and aggressive oversight
of those markets'' by his agency.
   That at times could entail pressuring the commodities commission
to make market changes, Ruder said. But he also said he expected
any future regulation to stem from ``cooperative'' proposals, and
emphasized his agency's commitment to work closely with other
regulators.
   Ruder said he and the SEC staff had met with Hineman and the
staff of the commodities commission to discuss ``a wide range of
market-related topics.''
   Similar joint discussions were held with representatives of the
stock and futures exchanges and would continue as the SEC attempted
to formulate concrete steps for preventing another crash, Ruder
said.
   In his speech, Ruder again called for higher margin requirements
_ the ``down payment'' a buyer must make _ for trading stock index
futures and for other measures to improve liquidity in the futures
markets. He said the SEC would continue considering the
effectiveness of delayed futures market openings.
   Ruder said the ``increased velocity and concentration'' of
trading within the stock and futures markets and between those
markets had increased the probability of wild price swings. He said
the increased intensity of trading was due partly to the lower
margin levels in the futures markets.
   ``Initial margin on stock inedex futures for non-market makers
should be raised, at least temporarily, to levels harmonious with
stock margin levels applicable to stock market professionals,'' he
said.

   The stock market marked time today, finishing
narrowly mixed as its recent rally ran into some resistance.
   Analysts said the market had paused after a two-week rally that
had driven some major indicators to their highest levels in six
weeks.
   They said traders also appeared hesitant to make a major move
while Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was outlining for a
congressional panel the central bank's monetary goals and his view
of the economy.
   The analysts found little in Greenspan's remarks to encourage
them to bid stocks in either direction.
   The stock market has benefited recently from indications that
the economy may be stronger than had been expected, leading some
analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate
profits.
   But there is plenty of uncertainty about the economy's prospects.
   In a new report today, the government said orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods plunged 2.8 percent in January, the

   But a decline had been expected in the wake of an unusually
sharp 4.1 percent rise in December.

<TEXT>
   Officials at the Nissan Motor Co. plant
in Smyrna are recommending expanded production at the plant that
could include a second passenger car line, the company stated
Monday.
   However, the plant is not among the sites under consideration
for a proposed joint venture with Ford Motor Co. to build a new
vehicle, company officials said.
   Nissan Motor Co. announced that it would undertake a second
phase of a study on the proposed joint venture and that a proposal
would be made for top management review in May.
   A study committee indicated a site had not been selected yet but
the Smyrna facility _ which makes light trucks and Sentra cars, was
not among those being considered.
   ``The joint venture project with Ford is looking at building a
type of vehicle that is very different from the cars and trucks we
build at Smyrna,'' said Jerry Benefield, president and chief
executive officer of the Smyrna plant.
   But officials said plant production may be expanded anyhow
because of a proposed addition of a second passenger car line, and
parts production may be increased.
   Benefield said he was recommending that the plant begin making
three components: Sentra engines, truck axles, and front and rear
bumpers for the Sentra. The new production would not require any
new employees, officials said.
   The company also is considering adding a second passenger car
line at the plant, which would require a larger work force.
   The company's board of directors will review the proposals at an
April meeting.

<HEAD>Greenspan Remarks Get Negative Reaction From Metals Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's prediction of modest
economic growth and continued low inflation received a sharp
negative reaction on the precious metals futures markets Tuesday.
   On other markets, which were not necessarily affected by
Greenspan's comments, prices for future delivery of livestock,
meat, orange juice, grains, soybeans and stock indexes all
retreated. Energy futures advanced.
   Analysts said Greenspan's 1988 economic forecast, delivered in
testimony before a House Banking subcommittee in Washington, was
viewed as a price depressant for precious metals, which tend to
perform well as investments during bad economic times.
   ``The most important thing he said for the precious metals was
that inflation is expected to be at a moderate rate of 3.25 percent
to 3.75 percent for 1988,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser for Josephthal & Co.
in New York, said precious metals futures also were pressured by
the day's lower prices for most other commodities, reflected by a
2.68-point decline in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21
commodities.
   Among the precious metals, platinum futures registered the
sharpest drop, falling $15 across the board at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for April delivery settled
at $448.80 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $3 to $4.30 lower
with April at $444.30 a troy ounce; silver was 11 cents to 11.8
cents lower with March at $6.30 a troy ounce.
   Some feeder cattle futures fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents a
pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and other livestock and
meat futures also posted steep losses.
   Cattle futures weakened in reaction to a variety of fundamental
factors, including relatively slack wholesale demand for beef
products, high retail prices for beef, and good availability of
slaughter-ready cattle, said Tom O'Hare, an analyst for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   A monthly Agriculture Department report showing the number of
pork bellies in cold storage to be higher than the market had
expected sent pork complex futures down sharply, O'Hare said.
   Live cattle settled .70 cent to 1.23 cents lower with April at
71.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .75 cent to 1.50 cents
lower with March at 81.02 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .77
cent lower with April at 43.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1 cent to 1.85 cents lower with March at 51.80 cents a pound.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures sank on the New York
Cotton Exchange in reaction to a price cut of $25 a ton for
Brazilian juice, analysts said.
   Cheaper Brazilian orange juice could result in less demand for
U.S. juice.
   Orange juice settled 2.80 cents to 3.90 cents lower with March
at $1.6335 a pound.
   Wheat futures prices declined on the Chicago Board of Trade in
reaction to the Agriculture Department's announcement late Monday
that it would replace its weekly Friday auctions of surplus wheat
with three weekly auctions beginning March 2, analysts said.
   Sales from the weekly auctions have declined in recent weeks,
with last week's 11 million bushels falling far short of the 25
million-bushel target.
   The USDA set initial targets of 10 million bushels for each of
the three new auctions, which will be held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Fridays.
   Traders fear that the new auctions could put as much as 30
million additional bushels of wheat onto the open market weekly,
which would tend to depress prices, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst
for G.H. Miller & Co.
   Soybean prices retreated in response to improved growing
conditions for the South American soybean crop, Gidel said. Corn
prices drifted lower in the absence of fresh supportive news, he
said.
   Wheat settled 5 cents to 5} cents lower with March at $3.16{ a
bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 3\ cents lower with March at $1.96{ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $1.90} a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 6{ cents lower with March at
$6.21 a bushel.
   Oil prices rose slightly in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, driven largely by technical factors, analysts
said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents higher across
the board with April at $16.60 a barrel; heating oil was .44 cent
to .67 cent higher with March at 46.46 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent to .59 cent higher with March at 46.90 cents
a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.35 points lower at 265.50. The
underylying spot index was off .62 cents at 265.02.

<NOTE>Eds: Precede LONDON BC</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly lower after a session of
choppy trading Tuesday.
   Gold prices also fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a late bid price for gold of $441.50 a troy ounce, down $2.75 from
Monday's late bid.
   Analysts said the dollar gained some strength from reports of
congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan early in the session, reversing overnight losses.
   John Lynam, an analyst at Security Pacific National Bank, said
traders were encouraged by Greenspan's statement that he saw no
signs of a recession.
   Other analysts in Europe and the United States cited his comment
that the U.S. money supply might grow at a faster pace this year.
   That spawned speculation that the Fed might have to encourage
higher interest rates to slow excessive money growth _ which would
stimulate inflation.
   In turn, higher rates would make dollar-denominated investments
more attractive, boosting demand for the U.S. currency.
   In the end, however, the dollar wound up mostly lower in trading
described as choppy.
   Lynam said the market continued to be dominated by ``charts and
technicals,'' making people ``less willing to hold on to their
positions.''
   ``The whole problem is that this has become a one-release
market: the trade numbers, everyone focuses on that,'' said Jim
Chorek, an analyst at the Chicago office of Market Services Inc.,
an investment firm.
   ``And after that, volume is just dead,'' he continued. ``So the
market becomes keyed off of technicals.''
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7655 from $1.7630 late
Monday. In New York, the pound stood at $1.7633, more expensive
than Monday's late price of $1.7593.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. reported a 27 percent
drop in first-quarter earnings Monday, but noted results for the
year-earlier period were inflated by a $20 million gain from
discontinued operations.
   Firestone reported earnings of $30 million or 94 cents a share,
on sales of $976 million for the three months ended Jan. 31,
compared with earnings of $41 million or $1.07 a share on sales of
$846 million during the same period a year ago.
   Excluding a one-time gain of $20 million from the December 1986
sale of its North American wheel and rim business, Firestone's
first-quarter earnings were up 40 percent from a year earlier.
   The results reflected improved automotive parts and service
sales, increased income from credit-card operations, and larger
profits from the company's diverisified-products operations due to
higher natural-rubber prices and improved building-products sales,
Firestone said in a news release.
   During the quarter, Firestone repurchased 3.6 million shares of
its outstanding stock for $116 million.
   Firestone, which moved its headquarters from Akron, Ohio, to
Chicago during the quarter, announced last week it would sell a 75
percent interest in its tire-manufacturing operations to
Bridgestone Corp. for $1.25 billion.

   A federal judge has issued a temporary
injunction blocking Eastman Kodak Co.'s deal to merge its
photofinishing operations with those of Fuqua Industries Inc., and
the company continues to face questions about its $5.1 billion
acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc.
   Kodak announced Tuesday that it had been tendered more than 96
percent of Sterling shares during the offering period that expired
Monday, and said it expected to complete the acquisition in a few
days.
   The company has scheduled a meeting with analysts Thursday in
New York in an effort to convince them of the merits of the
Sterling deal.
   Kodak's stock rose 50 cents a shre to $41.25 a share Tuesday in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. Fuqua's stock fell 50
cents a share to $28.50.
   In the Fuqua dispute, U.S. District Judge Eldon Mahon in Fort
Worth, Texas, issued his ruling Monday in response to a suit filed
in December by Phototron Corp., a San Bernardino, Calif., wholesale
photofinishing company.
   The suit contended that if the proposed merger went through,
Kodak and Fuqua would control 50 percent of the wholesale
photofinishing industry and 80 percent of the total market for
photo-related paper and chemicals, said Brenda Landry, an analyst
for Morgan Stanley and Co.
   The injunction will remain in effect pending a trial on the
merits of the case.
   Fuqua spokeswoman Donna Browning, in arguments supporting the
merger, said the merger would result in a new company controlling
only 25 percent of the total photofinishing market in the United
States.
   The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice
antitrust division approved the proposed merger in December and
said their investigation did not show any evidence that federal
antitrust laws would be violated.
   On Dec. 7, Kodak announced plans to merge its wholesale
photoprocessing laboratories with Fuqua's Raleigh, N.C.-based
subsidiary, Colorcraft Corp.
   Several financial analysts have lowered their opinions of Kodak
in recent weeks on grounds that the company overpaid for Sterling.
   ``Obviously there are pros and cons to this,'' said Michael
Ellmann, a stock analyst with Wertheim Schroeder & Co. ``But I want
to hear what management has to say.''
   Kodak will pay $89.50 for 54.5 million of the 57 million
outstanding shares of Sterling stock, more than $34 higher than the
stock was selling for at the end of 1987. The company will acquire
the 2.5 million shares that weren't offered for sale for the same
price after the deal is final, Roberts said.
   The total value of the deal is expected to be $5.1 billion.
   Sterling, based in New York, has 22,000 employees and has annual
sales of about $2 billion.
   Kodak, based in Rochester, has 124,000 employees and annual
sales of about $13 billion a year.
   The acquisition will help Kodak move into the $110 billion
pharmaceutical industry and give the company an established
pipeline to get drugs to market, said Kodak spokesman Charles Smith.
   On Monday, Kodak's bond ratings were downgraded by Moody's
Investors Service from A2 to Aa2 largely because of the heavy
borrowing needed to pay for Sterling.
   Sterling's bond rating was also downgraded from A2 to Aa1.
   With the acquisition, Kodak will immediately realize its
ambition of being a billion-dollar-a-year drug company through
Bayer aspirin, Panadol non-aspirin pain reliever, and Demerol.
   Kodak will also get a billion-dollar-a-year household products
business with such products as Lysol disinfectant, d-Con rat
killer, and Phillips Milk of Magnesia.
   Kodak officials have said they do not plan to sell any parts of
Sterling and will keep the company's organization intact.

   The United States announced Tuesday that it

while the South American country works out arrangements for a

   The Treasury Department announced the loan, which would be the
second such borrowing Argentina has done in the past five months.
   In November, Argentina received another $500 million bridge loan
from the United States and 14 other countries which it paid back in
January after it received further money from the IMF.
   The Treasury said in a statement, ``The willingness of the
United States to provide this financing indicates our support for
Argentina's economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a
viable balance-of-payments position.''
   The statement said the United States ``commends Argentina's
efforts to implement stabilization and reform policies with the
support of the international financial community.''

<HEAD>News Corp. Posts 45 Percent Profit Gain in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. Ltd., the worldwide media company
controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said Tuesday its profit climbed 45
percent in its second fiscal quarter as its revenue rose 33 percent.
   The company, based in Sydney, Australia, cited strong
performances by its newspaper division in Britain and its magazine
division in Australia and the Pacific Basin, including results from
acquisitions.
   It said profits declined in the United States, reflecting a soft
advertising market for its seven television stations, disappointing
results from the newspaper division including the New York Post and
lower results from Twentieth Century Fox Films.
   News Corp. said its profit rose to $127 million, or 79 cents per
American Depositary Receipt, in the three months ended Dec. 31
compared with $87.6 million, or 64 cents per ADR, a year earlier.
   The ADRs are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and each ADR
represents two of the company's common shares.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $1.11 billion from $837 million
a year earlier.
   For the first six months, profit nearly doubled to $231.2
million, or $1.42 per ADR, from $120 million, or 88 cents per ADR,
a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first six months rose 26 percent, to $2.09
billion from $1.66 billion in 1986.
   Six-month results were helped by foreign-exchange trading gains
and acquisitions in Australia and the Pacific Basin.
   Last weekend, Murdoch won concessions from the New York Post's
labor unions that cleared the way for the sale of the ailing
newspaper to real estate developer Peter Kalikow for $37 million.

   Kraft Inc. will pay Ambrit Inc. $8.5 million to
settle a trademark battle over similar ice cream bars made by the
two companies, Kraft announced Tuesday.
   The 6-year-old case stemmed from Kraft's Polar B'ar ice cream
bars, which Ambrit contended were packaged in a manner that
infringed on the trademark of its own Klondike bar.
   The Supreme Court last May let stand a lower court ruling
prohibiting Polar B'ar from using a wrapper resembling the Klondike
package and denying Polar B'ar exclusive trademark rights to that
name.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled in December
1986 that Polar B'ars may not have images of polar bears on their
wrappers in imitation of the Klondike design.
   The appeals court also said Polar B'ars may have the color royal
blue on their silver foil wrappers only if it did not make them
``confusingly similar'' to the Klondike wrapper.
   The appeals court also had ordered a federal judge to determine
what damages if any Kraft must pay Ambrit, which is based in
Clearwater, Fla., for imitating the Klondike wrapper.
   Kraft said from its Glenview, Ill., headquarters that the
settlement was ``significantly less'' than the amount sought by
Ambrit but declined to comment further, citing agreements by both
parties not to discuss specifics of the case.
   The appeals court had canceled Kraft's Polar B'ar trademark
because the company had abandoned the name from 1932, when it
stopped making a like-named ice cream novelty, until it began
marketing a new ice cream bar in 1979.

<HEAD>Southdown Offering $177 Million for Moore McCormack Resources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southdown Inc., a cement and energy company,
launched a $177 million cash tender offer Tuesday for Moore
McCormack Resources of Stamford, Conn.
   The offer is contingent on the valid tender of a majority of
Moore McCormack's common stock, the inapplicability of Delaware's
recently enacted anti-takeover law, the redemption or invalidation
of Moore McCormack's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense and
Southdown's ability to secure $635 million in financing, of which
$500 million has been committed by a major commercial bank.
   Tony Doumlele, director of corporate relations for Moore
McCormack, said the ``tender offer was totally unsolicited.''
   On Monday, Houston-based Southdown and its subsidiary, SDW Inc.,
filed a federal lawsuit which seeks to overturn Moore McCormack's
anti-takeover defenses, including a poison pill provision that
would make the acquisition prohibitively expensive.
   The lawsuit claims that Moore McCormack Chairman Paul R.
Tregurtha tried to illegally block the tender offer.
   Southdown said in the suit that it will offer $31 a share for
Moore McCormack, a building materials company. With 5.7 million
Moore McCormack shares outstanding, the transaction would be worth
about $177 million.
   Southdown said in its suit that unless the anti-takeover
defenses are removed, it will be deprived of the right to make a
bona fide offer and will be subjected to confusion, delay and
lawsuits.
   The suit said Tregurtha and Moore McCormack's board of directors
violated their fiduciary responsibilities by setting up illegal
obstacles that allegedly will prevent the company's shareholders
from considering the tender offer.
   The suit also said that merger talks between the two companies
were initiated by Moore McCormack a year ago and that Tregurtha
insisted that he hold the posts of chairman and chief executive
officer in the combined business. As a result, Southdown said, it
concluded that its only alternative was to take a proposal directly
to the shareholders of Moore McCormack.
   Southdown produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete and
is in oil and gas exploration and development. It announced Monday
that it has 137.6 billion cubic feet of proved natural gas
reserves, up from 111.7 billion cubic feet last year. It attributed
the increase to successful exploration in Louisiana and Texas.
   Moore McCormack produces building materials and is also involved
in oil and gas exploration and production, mainly in Texas and
Louisiana.
   No hearing has been set for the case, assigned to U.S. District
Judge Lynn N. Hughes.
